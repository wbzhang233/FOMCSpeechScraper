        "content": "As you know, the United States is now about a year and half into recovery from the longest and deepest recession of the post war period. Growth has resumed, and our financial system, pushed to the brink two years ago, has stabilized.\n\nWe are recovering, but we are far from recovered. The rebound to date has been much less vigorous than has been the norm for U.S. recoveries. The economy has been adding jobs—some 875,000 since the start of the year—but unemployment remains stubbornly high. Growth has slowed, averaging just under 2 percent over the last two quarters, as support from the fiscal stimulus and the turn in the inventory cycle is fading. Bank lending standards are no longer being tightened, but bank credit continues to contract. The backlog of inventory in housing appears likely to weigh on activity in that sector for some time to come. And the large amount of slack created by the recession continues to put downward pressure on prices and wages. All in all, a fragile picture.\n\nThis sluggishness is a reflection of the fact that what came before was not a garden variety recession. Put simply, our current circumstances are not just the result of the crisis. Our growth was too reliant on spending and borrowing, as opposed to saving and investing and competing in the increasingly globalized marketplace. Too much of what occurred in the run-up to the crisis was framed against a backdrop of monetary, supervisory and fiscal policy focused too much on the quantity of growth, and not enough on the quality.\n\nExperience with balance sheet recessions and debt overhangs is relatively limited in the advanced economies, at least in the post war period. But these types of problems are far less rare in the emerging world. And the record there suggests that recovery takes time and requires painful adjustments, as households and creditors work through the overhang of excessive borrowing and lending, and the associated decline in asset prices and employment opportunities; and as financial institutions work to strengthen their balance sheets to meet more robust standards for capital and liquidity. I see little to suggest that a similar dynamic isn't likely to hold true for us as well.\n\nAdding to the challenges confronting us at the moment is the large amount of uncertainty in the wind. In addition to the headwinds for the macro outlook, there are questions about the long-term sustainability of U.S. fiscal policy; six weeks from the start of a new year, households and businesses still don't know what the tax regime will be in the coming year, let alone for the medium term; they face questions regarding the new health regime and its costs; on the financial side, there are hundreds of new regulations to be written during the next year or so in the context of Dodd Frank and Basel III, and those carry with them concerns about the availability and cost of credit, as well as the durability of certain business models. And the state of our domestic political discourse hasn't exactly been confidence-inspiring—or investment-friendly.\n\nAll of this clearly affects confidence, the prospects for growth and employment, and the hand-off from a fading turn in the inventory cycle to a sustained upturn in business fixed investment and, over time, consumption. As we know, jobs depend on growth; growth depends on investment; and investment capital flows where it is welcome, where the rules of the game are perceived to fair and predictable, and where it can expect a reasonable return.\n\nIn this context, there are numerous questions about what role monetary policy can and should play. And as we've seen in the past few weeks, there is no shortage of views on answers. So let me share my bias:\n\nMonetary policy can create favorable conditions for growth, by helping to foster an environment in which job creation can take place. And monetary policy can provide a supportive environment for households and firms as they work through difficult balance sheet adjustments, by lifting asset prices and net worth, lowering debt and equity costs, and ensuring that disinflation or deflation do not derail the adjustment process. Finally, monetary policy can contribute to reduced uncertainty about the outlook for growth, and help guard against the risk that a new negative shock could threaten what is still a fragile recovery.\n\nBut monetary policy has limits. It cannot, by itself, create growth or jobs. Nor can monetary policy, by itself, provide the answers to all of the uncertainties that are weighing on consumption, investment and job creation, or eliminate the need for balance sheet adjustments.\n\nIt is understandable that the decision to undertake Large Scale Asset Purchases has been greeted with some degree of anxiety and skepticism. On the other hand, I am not persuaded by much of the reaction.\n\nMonetary policy works by influencing the level and shape of the domestic yield curve. In normal times, the Fed does this by buying and selling Treasury securities at the short end of the curve, thereby influencing short-term rates. The Fed's purchase of Treasury bonds (under quantitative easing \"QE\" or LSAP) simply extends classic open market operations to longer duration securities, to produce similar results: a shift in the yield curve consistent with desired financial conditions.\n\nWhile I have some sympathy for those who question the degree to which this will ultimately be successful in producing the desired real economy effects, I am not sure what to make of the fact that a change in operating procedure per se could have generated such an uproar about the Fed's fundamental commitment to price stability, to preserving the central role of the dollar as the world's reserve currency—and to executing on the responsibilities that brings with it. Based on our record on that score over the past thirty years or so, I find it particularly curious.\n\nRegarding the external implications of the policy, several points are worth keeping in mind. One is that the goal of policy is to stimulate demand in the United States by encouraging lower real yields. To be sure, the dollar has weakened of late, but as a side effect of policy, not as a goal, and not by more than might be expected in light of our recent slowing and recent changes in interest rates and inflation expectations. And as growth strengthens, the value of the dollar should adjust accordingly.\n\nPolicy-induced shifts in financial conditions—lower expected real yields, tighter spreads, higher asset prices—should provide some support for growth in the quarters ahead, notwithstanding that aspects of the credit channel remain impaired.\n\nWe recognize that success in easing financial conditions comes with risks: financial excesses may reemerge—this is something we will be especially watchful for. But this is not just a consideration for monetary policy, and is not unique to LSAPs. All of us—public and private sectors alike—need to be attentive to undue acceleration in financial activity, to slippages in risk management practices or underwriting standards, and to developments in an environment where many of the familiar reference points are changing rapidly.\n\nSo, to reiterate: monetary policy can potentially ease the headwinds we currently face and help reduce some of the downside risks, but it is not a cure-all for the challenges facing our country. These need to be addressed directly by the appropriate parties. Progress in areas beyond the purview of monetary policy is important if we are to achieve strong and sustainable growth, and durably shore up confidence in our economy, our currency and our credit.\n\nClearly, putting our public finances back on track represents one of our most important challenges. Fiscal support played a valuable stabilizing role in heading off economic and financial disaster, both in the United Sates and across the globe. But with the U.S. public debt rising at its fastest pace since the Second World War and set to soon reach its highest level in relation to national income in over 50 years, we would be kidding ourselves if we believed that today's very large and growing structural fiscal deficits are consistent with a continuing strong global leadership role.\n\nWe need a strategic approach, one that provides answers—growth friendly answers—about how spending and tax burdens are likely to evolve.\n\nThis does not mean we need to solve all of our problems at once. We have some scope for gradualism and even to provide further support for growth—but this needs to be embedded in a credible framework that gives greater predictability to the path back to a sustainable fiscal stance.\n\nFundamental financial reform also needs to be a priority, and important progress has been made both domestically and internationally in forums such as (Basel and the Financial Stability Board) on higher and better quality capital and liquidity buffers, more robust institutional arrangements, and resolution regimes for large interconnected financial institutions.\n\nBut these are complicated undertakings, with many details still to be worked out, (as evidenced by the more than 200 new rules scheduled to be written under Dodd-Frank in the months ahead). Details matter here—bank regulation rivals the tax code in its complexity but also in its impact on incentives—and a great number of moving parts will need to fit together efficiently and effectively. Once in place, regulations can also be difficult to change. So it is important that we get this right.\n\nThere is a tension between moving quickly to resolve regulatory uncertainties, however, and introducing greater scope for unintended consequences. Transparency, consultation, and international coordination should help on this score.\n\nWe also need to keep in mind that our ultimate success in enhancing financial stability will depend on aspects that cannot be addressed by legislation and static rules. As I noted earlier, all of us have role to play in guarding against potential side effects of the accommodative environment that prevails in much of the globe at present.\n\nLet me conclude with a brief word about the role of the emerging world in all of this.\n\nThe emerging markets, so often a source of instability in the past, have been an important source of resilience and stability in recent years. Indeed, after spending much of my career helping countries in the emerging world work through difficult patches, I now find myself on the other side, spending a fair bit of time discussing, with visitors from the emerging world, how we plan to get ourselves back on track.\n\nGrowth prospects and policy performance in much of the emerging world remain relatively strong, notwithstanding prospects for subdued growth in the advanced economies. These positive trends, even more than the push of low yields in the advanced economies, have been encouraging capital to flow once again to the emerging world. On balance this is a positive development, as it can facilitate more rapid increases in the standard of living in these countries, as well as a needed rebalancing of global demand. But it also poses its fair share of challenges.\n\nI think it is well understood that the emerging world will need to expand its role further, and become more of an engine of growth and global demand, if the global economy is to successfully navigate the difficult straits it faces. But experience has taught the emerging market economies to be cautious. They know better than anyone that they are not decoupled from the risks that the advanced economies are facing. And they also know the risks of market exuberance and complacency. In this context, it is no surprise that self insurance through reserve accumulation has again been on the rise.\n\nUnfortunately, with jobs scarce in the advanced economies, and authorities in the emerging world understandably concerned about being overwhelmed by excessive capital inflows, the scope for fractious and defensive policies is growing. I cannot recall a time in my career when protectionist sentiment was bubbling so close to the surface.\n\nWe need a framework for dealing with these issues, which go well beyond exchange rates and include a host of policies that influence savings, investment and growth trajectories. But there are no easy answers, because while there are important common interests, many others are not clearly aligned.\n\nAchieving the needed global adjustment will require cooperation, consultation and leadership—real leadership that identifies common principles, that frames policy against principles that can be mutually shared, that inspires confidence by delivering on commitments, and that makes possible concessions that facilitate broader interests.\n\nSuccess will hinge in part on the willingness of the emerging economies, particularly the larger ones, to meet this challenge.\n\nBut I have a hard time seeing how we can get to a better place without strong leadership from the Unites States as well. In this respect, we have our work cut out for us. It is not enough for us to have good ideas about what others can do, we need to show that we are holding up our end, and delivering on the reforms that we need.\n\nI think we all recognize that the crisis damaged our global leadership role. The size and vitality of our economy, respect and confidence in our policy framework, and the liquidity and robustness of our financial system—have all been important sources of soft power for the United States, and have allowed us to exert influence in support of an open global trade and financial system, not just to our benefit, but to the benefit of greater global prosperity.\n\nThese strengths are still there, but the rest of the world expected better of us in terms of management of our economy and our financial system—just as I think we expected much better of ourselves."

        "content": "Let me begin by thanking Manuel Monteagudo, a dear friend and colleague, and the Central Reserve Bank of Peru for inviting me to speak and for hosting this important conference.\n\nMy task is to discuss the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act (FSIA or Act), which provides specific immunity protections for central banks. I believe that central bank immunity generally, and the topic of this conference more specifically—legal aspects of central banks' reserve investments—is both timely and deserving of attention.\n\nOur present situation has brought new challenges. In the emerging markets, some countries have experienced sovereign default and the attention of litigious and sophisticated investors looking to realize on the debt of the defaulted sovereign. In more mature markets like the United States, which is recovering from the worst financial crisis since the 1930s, the importance of foreign investment has been reaffirmed and our fiscal deficit relies on foreign investment. Emerging and mature markets share a common interest in trying to ensure that central banks invest their international reserves in a manner that is appropriate and safe. Concern about reserve management arises from the public nature of the reserves, and from the unique position of the central bank as an instrumentality of a sovereign state.\n\nIn some ways, central bank reserves are like a nation's savings account. On a personal level, most of us want to protect the security of our savings, because that savings enables us to achieve future goals, such as the purchase of a home or the education of our children and provides a safety net for the unforeseen, such as unemployment, illness and even death. For the same reasons, central bankers worry about the safety and liquidity of their national reserves.\n\nIn my view, central bank attorneys play a key role in ensuring that central bank reserves are kept safe and secure. A legal advisor who is counseling a client contemplating a transaction, including an investment, should provide advice about how to structure the transaction to minimize, to the extent appropriate, the risk of loss. An accurate understanding of legal risk is one factor in evaluating the overall risk of any given investment. For a central bank, especially a central bank from a jurisdiction that might be the object of unwelcome attention from creditors or other litigants, this legal risk might be critical. All of the work involved in the painstaking selection of an appropriate investment comes to nothing if that investment can be tied up in litigation, or worse, if the investment is seized to satisfy a judgment.\n\nWith respect to legal risk, and I do not mean to sound like an advertising executive here, the legal climate in the United States is welcoming to central bank investment. The stability of the U.S. dollar and its role as the principal reserve currency is one key aspect of this. Other economic considerations center on the highly developed nature of U.S. financial markets, providing a range of investment products that can generate a safe and appropriate yield for central bank dollar reserves.\n\nU.S. Treasury securities, to use the classical example, are among the safest and most liquid investment vehicles in the world.1 I will not focus any further on the attributes of the United States as a place to invest reserves, or the diversity of available investment products, because these are subjects better left to economists and investment specialists. My topic is the U.S. legal infrastructure, and my message is that the legal environment in the United States is designed by Congress to incent central banks to place dollar reserves in the United States.\n\nThe Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act\nThe FSIA2 Congress thus granted foreign central banks and monetary authorities their own protection under Section 1611(b)(1) to address the concern.3\n\nThat said, the protections afforded by the statute should not give rise to complacency on the part of central bank attorneys. Notwithstanding the protections of the FSIA, central banks have occasionally been unpleasantly surprised when drawn into litigation in the United States. While the protections of the FSIA are considerable, they are not absolute and must be managed by informed legal advisors. For example, the FSIA does contemplate that many of its protections can be waived, either through explicit agreement or implicitly, through conduct.\n\nMaking one's way through the FSIA's provisions can be daunting. Judges in the United States have called the FSIA \"remarkably obtuse,\" a \"statutory labyrinth,\" with a \"bizarre structure,\" and \"deliberately vague provisions.\"4 In light of those remarks and the complexity of the Act, specific problems regarding application of the FSIA are best addressed in consultation with U.S. counsel. My first recommendation to you is to retain such counsel if it should happen that your central bank is served with a complaint in U.S. litigation, or alternatively, if you learn that your central bank's property in the United States has been restrained. But, you want to be an educated consumer of U.S. legal services. For that reason, I will now provide an overview of the Act, focusing on those aspects that have the greatest practical application for central banks.\n\nOne of the key features of the FSIA is that it defines two types of immunity: immunity from the jurisdiction of the U.S. courts, and immunity from the remedies of attachment or execution.5 \"Jurisdictional immunity\" means immunity from suit in U.S. courts. A foreign entity that enjoys jurisdictional immunity cannot be forced to defend itself in a lawsuit brought in a U.S. court (other than those minimal actions needed to establish its immunity). \"Immunity from execution\" means that assets cannot be used to satisfy a judgment. A foreign entity with immunity from execution can protect its U.S. assets from judgment creditors, even though it may have litigated and lost a suit in a U.S. court. The Act establishes different, but related rules governing each type of immunity.\n\nTo reinforce just how important this distinction is, consider two different conditions. In the first condition, your central bank has no property in the United States. Can your central bank nonetheless be subject to jurisdiction under the FSIA in litigation in a U.S. court? The answer is clearly \"maybe.\" In the second condition, your central bank has property in the United States, let us assume in an account at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. May your central bank's investment in the account be seized through legal process known as a writ of attachment or execution? The answer is probably \"no,\" but there are actions that may foster a more definitive answer, either affirmative or negative.\n\nJurisdictional Immunity under the FSIA\nSections 1604 though 1607 of the FSIA are a set of rules governing jurisdictional immunity under the Act. Section 1604 states the general rule—that a foreign state has immunity from the jurisdiction of U.S. courts unless an exception applies. Sections 1605 through 1607 then set forth various exceptions to the general rule of immunity.\n\nWhat Is a \"Foreign State\" under the FSIA?\nThe first step in deciding whether an entity is entitled to jurisdictional immunity under the FSIA is to determine whether it is a \"foreign state.\" Many central banks have a separate legal existence from the government, which logically raises the question whether they should be considered part of the state for purposes of the immunity determination. The Act addresses this question by including within its definition of foreign state an \"agency or instrumentality of a foreign state.\"7 The Act, in turn, defines an agency or instrumentality as an entity:\n\nWhile the courts do not always provide uniform interpretations of this definition, most central banks would be considered \"instrumentalities\" of their governments under the FSIA.8 Those central banks that have a separate legal identity from their governments are predominately or entirely government owned.9 Moreover, an entity which performs central banking functions would probably be considered an organ of the government, at least with respect to its performance of those functions.10\n\nIndeed, when Congress enacted the FSIA, it expressly included the central bank as an example of an entity which would qualify under the definition of \"instrumentality\" of the state.11\n\nNow, I have little hesitation in saying that a central bank will likely qualify as an instrumentality of a foreign state. However, a U.S. court will not presume such legal status and it is important for you to establish your status as an instrumentality if you are sued. Our courts have cautioned that, before immunity will attach, the defendant has the burden of showing that it is a foreign state, or an instrumentality of a foreign state.12 In one notable case, a default judgment was entered against a central bank that did nothing in response to legal process.13\n\nExceptions to Jurisdictional Immunity\nA central bank that meets the definition of agency or instrumentality under the FSIA would be entitled to a presumption of jurisdictional immunity. That presumption may be rebutted (and the central bank subjected to jurisdiction), only if a plaintiff establishes one of the immunity exceptions set forth in Section 1605 to 1607 of the Act.\n\nThe most significant exception to jurisdictional immunity for our purposes is the commercial activity exception contained in Section 1605(a)(2) of the Act. Under this exception, a foreign state is not entitled to jurisdictional immunity if the case arises from:\n\nThe FSIA provides that a court should look to the \"nature\" as opposed to the \"purpose\" of the conduct, in deciding whether the conduct is commercial.14 Thus, the fact that a particular transaction may eventually further a public goal is not relevant to deciding whether the transaction is a \"commercial activity\" under the Act.\n\nInstead, a court will look at whether the conduct is essentially commercial, whatever its underlying motivation. Congress intended for U.S. courts to have considerable discretion in applying the \"commercial activity\" standard.15\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court articulated its understanding of the commercial activity standard in a case called Republic of Argentina v. Weltover.16 The facts at issue in Weltover concerned bonds issued by the Republic of Argentina and payable in U. S. dollars, an offering done to cover a shortage of foreign exchange reserves.\n\nWhen the bonds began to mature, Argentina found that it did not have sufficient dollar reserves to pay them. Acting under a Presidential Decree, Argentina unilaterally extended the time for payment and offered bondholders substitute instruments in a form of debt rescheduling.17 Two bondholders were dissatisfied with this arrangement, and sued Argentina and its central bank in the U.S. courts. The Supreme Court held that Argentina's issuance of the bonds fell within the commercial activity exception, because the bonds were essentially \"garden variety debt instruments\" and were payable in New York.18 Consequently, the Republic of Argentina enjoyed no jurisdictional immunity in this situation.\n\nAccording to the Supreme Court in Weltover, \"commercial activity\" is any activity which could be performed by a private party engaged in \"trade and traffic or commerce.\"19 The Court's rationale is instructive:\n\n[W]hen a foreign government acts, not as a regulator of a market, but in the manner of a player within it, the foreign sovereign's actions are \"commercial\" within the meaning of the FSIA.20\n\nThis reasoning is consistent with the underlying purpose of the FSIA, which is intended to extend immunity to foreign states for sovereign actions, but not when state actions are commercial or private.21\n\nWeltover can have surprising applications. Central bankers, for example, think of measures taken to invest dollar reserves as classically sovereign activity, because these investments are done for public purposes. Yet, the nature of the investment will be commercial. The Supreme Court did not quarrel with the fact that Argentina was acting in furtherance of a public purpose in issuing the bonds, but that was not determinative of immunity. Instead, a State's entitlement to immunity will depend on the nature of the actions it takes to further its admittedly public purpose. For example, if Argentina had issued regulations imposing fees for the conversion of foreign reserves, that act would not have been commercial activity, because private actors do not regulate.22 Following Weltover, it seems clear that a foreign state issuing debt which is to be paid in the United States would be held to be engaging in commercial activity within the meaning of the FSIA.\n\nThe second important exception under the FSIA is waiver.23 The FSIA provides that jurisdictional immunity may be waived by an agency or instrumentality of a foreign state, either expressly or implicitly. Generally, situations where an entity is held to have implicitly waived its immunity from suit in U.S. courts include those where:\n\nCourts in the United States have construed the waiver exception narrowly, and have generally limited the exceptions to the situations described above.24 Let me caution you that, to avoid an unintentional waiver of central bank immunity, you obtain adequate legal review of any agreement that relates to the United States.\n\nAs central bank attorneys, you may be thinking that the exceptions within the FSIA, principally the commercial activity exception, swallow the general rule of immunity. Many functions of a central bank (excluding regulation and supervision) are commercial in nature. Further, you might be concerned, and understandably so, that central bank investment activities in the United States would be viewed as commercial by a U.S. court. But the FSIA has provisions that create special protections for central banks beyond the protections afforded to foreign states, and these are important to your mission in protecting your national savings.\n\nRemember, up until this point, we have been discussing only jurisdictional immunity, which refers to the ability of a foreign state to prevent a litigant from forcing it to defend a suit in U.S. courts.\n\nImmunity from Attachment and Execution under the FSIA\nIn the situation where your central bank has placed reserves in the United States, the FSIA has provisions dealing expressly with the property of a foreign state generally, and a central bank specifically. These provisions operate separately from the principles of jurisdictional immunity that I have just summarized. At the outset of my remarks, I emphasized that jurisdictional immunity is separate from immunity from attachment or execution. Attachment and execution are the only legal means for a litigant to actually take your national savings, as opposed to simply initiating or even winning a lawsuit.\n\nThe FSIA's provisions governing immunity from attachment and execution are parallel to those we have just discussed governing jurisdictional immunity. Section 1609 states a general rule of immunity, which is followed by exceptions set out in Section 1610. Section 1610 authorizes attachment or execution against the property of a foreign state that is used for commercial activity in the United States where the foreign state has waived immunity from attachment or execution.25 It is noteworthy that even where a foreign state has waived its immunity, its property will not automatically be subject to attachment or execution under Section 1610. Before permitting attachment or execution of a foreign state's property, U.S. courts require a showing that the property in question is located in the United States, and was used for commercial activity in the United States at the time the writ of attachment or execution was issued.26\n\nThe Act also has a provision specifically protecting the property of central banks. This is Section 1611(b)(1), which provides that, notwithstanding the exceptions to sovereign immunity from attachment and execution in Section 1610:\n\n[T]he property of a foreign state shall be immune from attachment or execution if . . .the property is that of a foreign central bank or monetary authority held for its own account, unless such bank or authority, or its parent foreign government, has explicitly waived its immunity from attachment in aid of execution, or from execution...\n\nIf you remember anything I say today, remember that Section 1611(b)(1) provides highly potent protections for central bank property in the United States.\n\nFirst, Section 1611(b)(1) contains no exception for commercial activity. If such an exception existed, and it does not, the exception would overwhelm the rule because a central bank's investment or asset account will always look commercial in character. It would be impossible to distinguish a central bank's conduct as investor from that of any private investor. The power of Section 1611(b)(1) is that it does not depend on the distinction between commercial, on the one hand, and governmental, on the other.\n\nThe second significant feature of Section 1611(b)(1) is that it does not enable a central bank to waive its immunity from prejudgment attachment of assets. To appreciate this nuance in the statutory language, Section 1611(b)(1) must be read in conjunction with Section 1610(d), which does permit foreign states to waive immunity from prejudgment attachment.27 U.S. courts that have considered the question of prejudgment attachment under the FSIA have concluded that the Act does not permit a waiver of immunity from prejudgment attachment for central bank assets.28\n\nCongress recognized the potentially disruptive effect of prejudgment attachment for central banks when it chose not to provide for a waiver of prejudgment attachment. Immunity from prejudgment attachment is a highly significant advantage for central banks that wish to invest funds in the United States. Prejudgment attachment allows a plaintiff to encumber funds before the legal theories and proof are tested in a courtroom. We can all imagine what an attractive target central bank reserves must present for a plaintiff seeking to realize on what he hopes will be a substantial judgment. Given this, without the beneficial protection conferred by Section 1611(b)(1), central banks could find their assets tied up in litigation. From a policy perspective, a license to hunt down central bank assets would be unacceptable due to the significant U.S. interest in encouraging U.S. investment by central banks, and to the foreign interest in protecting national savings.\n\nA third feature of Section 1611(b)(1) is its requirement that any waiver permitting execution against central bank property be explicit. The significance of this provision is that it allows central banks to maintain strict control over the situations in which they choose to waive immunity. My advice to central bank attorneys who are drafting or reviewing agreements for their banks is to have any waiver language reviewed by U. S. counsel familiar with recent decisional law on this issue.\n\nHow do central bank lawyers become comfortable that their bank's assets enjoy the protection of Section 1611(b)(1)? Section 1611(b)(1) provides immunity from attachment or execution to all property \"of a foreign central bank or monetary authority held for its own account.\" There are two parts to this requirement. First, the entity seeking protection for its assets must be a \"central bank\" or \"monetary authority.\" While we may think that the meaning of these terms is obvious, there is considerable diversity from country to country, and there are some unusual cases. The FSIA itself contains no definition of the two terms, and U. S. courts have rejected some entities claiming to be central banks.29\n\nThe second part of what is required to qualify for protection under Section 1611(b)(1) is that the funds for which protection is sought must be \"held for [the entity's] own account.\" The FSIA, however, does not define the phrase \"held for its own account.\" Some courts in the United States have applied what is known as the \"central banking functions test\" to analyze the phrase \"held for its own account.\"30 This test requires an inquiry into whether the property in such account was held or used in connection with \"central banking activities.\"\n\nThere is a case currently pending in New York with respect to the applicability of Section 1611(b)(1) that merits discussion. That case is E.M. Ltd. v. The Republic of Argentina. In this case, the holders of defaulted bonds issued by the Republic of Argentina obtained judgments against the Republic in a United States district court, but could not collect on those judgments because the Republic did not have attachable assets in the United States. In an attempt to collect on those judgments, the bondholders have twice brought legal proceedings seeking to attach the reserves of the Central Bank of Argentina on deposit at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.\n\nThe bondholders' initial effort to attach central bank reserves in New York was unsuccessful. The bondholders claimed that an Argentine Presidential Decree directing the use of central bank reserves to repay the Republic's debt to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) converted all central bank reserves into attachable assets of the Republic.31 The district court denied the bondholders' motion, and the court of appeals affirmed, finding that the reserves were immune from attachment under the FSIA. Because the bondholders did not challenge the separate juridical status of the central bank, the reserves were found to be property of the central bank \"held for its own account\" under Section 1611(b)(1) of the FSIA.32 In addition, the payment to the IMF was held to be a sovereign, rather than a commercial, activity under Section 1610 of the FSIA.33\n\nWhen their initial attempt to attach central bank reserves was denied, the bondholders filed another motion—this time alleging that the central bank is the alter ego of the Republic, and that its reserves on deposit at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York are property of the Republic that should be attached to satisfy judgments against the Republic.34 This motion is currently the subject of ongoing litigation in New York.\n\nThe district court granted the bondholders' second attachment motion. The court found that the central bank is the alter ego of the Republic, based in part on press articles suggesting that the central bank is under the control of the Republic, and in part on the finding that the Republic had used central bank resources to pay off certain debts like the debt owed to the IMF, but had not paid the bondholders' judgments and thus did not act \"honestly and in good faith.\"35 Based on its alter ego determination, the district court concluded that the protections for central bank assets set forth in Section 1611(b)(1) did not apply.36 The district court found that the reserves in question were property of the Republic used for \"commercial activity\" under Section 1610 because they were invested in interest bearing accounts, and that the Republic had expressly waived immunity.37 The court thus ruled that the reserves were subject to attachment and execution to satisfy judgments against the Republic.38\n\nThe Republic and the central bank have appealed this decision, and the appeal is currently pending. The Federal Reserve Bank of New York believes that the district court incorrectly applied the provisions of the FSIA, in particular Section 1611(b)(1), and has filed an amicus curiae, or \"friend of the court,\" brief to communicate our views to the court. We believe that with respect to Section 1611(b)(1), it is irrelevant how independent the central bank is from its sovereign. Section 1611(b)(1) protects the immunity of a foreign central bank's property \"notwithstanding\" the provisions of Section 1610 and without regard to the relative independence of the central bank. It is our view that the account is the property of the central bank held for its own account. The record in this case shows that the reserves were used for typical central banking functions such as managing reserves and making payments to the IMF. While central banking functions may at times appear commercial in nature, they are not \"commercial activity\" that loses immunity under the FSIA.39\n\nEarlier this month, the U.S. Department of Justice also filed an amicus curiae brief in this appeal on behalf of the United States of America. The United States, like the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, took the view that a central bank's relative degree of independence from its parent government is irrelevant for purposes of Section 1611(b)(1) analysis. Under the \"central banking functions\" test, the United States believes that the central bank reserves on deposit at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York were used for traditional central banking activities and should thus be immune from attachment or execution.\n\nIn closing, I hope that my discussion today has been helpful in broadening your understanding of sovereign immunity, and my view that the United States provides a safe legal environment for central bank investment.\n\n____________________________________________________\n\n2 28 U.S.C. § 1602 et seq.\n\n3 H.R.

        "content": "Good morning. I am pleased to have this opportunity to speak to you as I travel through Upstate New York to meet with various communities in the region. This afternoon I will focus on national and regional economic conditions and what the Fed is doing about them—with particular attention to the housing sector and to conditions in Upstate New York. As always, what I have to say reflects my own views and not necessarily those of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) or the Federal Reserve System.\n\nIntroduction to the New York Fed\nAs many of you know, this is my first chance to speak at the University at Buffalo since I became president of the New York Fed. So, by way of introduction, let me start with a synopsis of what the New York Fed is, what we do and what makes my job so interesting.\n\nThe New York Fed is part of the Federal Reserve System, America's central bank, and was created by Congress in 1913. With this act, Congress delegated to the Fed System its constitutional authority to manage the money supply—and designed it be decentralized, representative of all of America and independent of the political process. The Fed System is comprised of the Board of Governors in Washington, D.C.—a federal agency led by Chairman Ben Bernanke—plus 12 autonomous Reserve Banks that span the country. For example, the district overseen by the New York Fed includes all of New York, the 12 northern counties of New Jersey; Fairfield County, Connecticut; Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Each Reserve Bank is autonomous, with its own charter and a board of directors drawn from its district, but overseen by the Board of Governors. The law that created the Federal Reserve made us independent so we can make decisions in the national interest free from political pressure. However, the Fed is accountable to Congress.\n\nCongress has set an explicit objective for monetary policy: To pursue the highest level of employment consistent with price stability. This objective is often referred to as our \"dual mandate,\" because it combines two goals: high employment, and low and stable inflation. In order to promote these objectives, we also pay close attention to financial stability, because without financial stability, it is very hard to achieve our goals for jobs and inflation.\n\nThe FOMC meets in Washington, D.C., eight times per year to deliberate and vote on monetary policy. As New York Fed president, I am vice chairman at these meetings and have a permanent vote. At these meetings, the 16 other members (the Board of Governors and the other Reserve Bank Presidents) and I each present our current outlook for the economy. For these assessments, we augment input from our research departments with critical information about local economic conditions supplied by our boards of directors, regional advisory councils and conversations with local stakeholders. You may know that one of my councils, the Upstate New York Regional Advisory Board, is designed specifically to provide me with timely information from this area. In this way, decisions by the FOMC are continually informed by views gathered from all parts of the country, including Upstate New York.\n\nOne thing that makes my job even more interesting is that New York has some roles unique within the Fed. Let me tell you about some of them. We, alone, implement monetary policy. At the direction of the FOMC, we buy and sell Treasury securities. We are also the eyes and ears of the Fed on Wall Street, and we supervise many of the largest financial institutions in the country. We operate Fedwire®—the conduit for large money transfers between banks. And, we provide banking services to the U.S. Treasury, and central banks and governments from around the world. Finally, I must mention that the New York Fed's district could be the most diverse in the System: ranging from the urban density of Manhattan to the forested sparseness of the northern Adirondacks, to the Caribbean islands of Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands. All in all, there is a lot to keep my colleagues and me quite busy—even in normal times.\n\nThe Crisis and Response\nOf course these are anything but normal times. The financial crisis that broke in mid-2007 and intensified dramatically following the failure of Lehman Brothers has been among the most virulent ever. And it was followed by the longest and one of the deepest recessions since World War II, called by many the \"Great Recession.\"\n\nThe Fed responded aggressively and creatively in an effort to pursue our dual mandate. Our actions fell into two broad buckets.\n\nFirst, we took steps to supply liquidity to the financial system, so that financial markets could continue to function properly and to enable households and businesses to maintain access to credit. Carrying out an age-old central banking role, we loaned funds to financial firms, secured against their high-quality collateral.\n\nTraditionally, such loans were only made to depository institutions, such as banks. Of course, the modern U.S. financial system includes many lenders that are not banks. These companies and markets provide vital financing for credit card loans, short-term business needs and many other activities. Many years ago, Congress gave the Fed the emergency authority to lend to nonbanks in \"unusual and exigent circumstances.\" During the crisis—in order to limit damage to the wider economy—we exercised this authority to lend to a wide variety of financial firms and markets.\n\nA handful of times, we made the difficult decision to make emergency loans to prevent the disorderly failure of particular firms. We did so not because we wanted to help the firms, but because allowing them to collapse in a disorderly fashion in the midst of a global crisis would have harmed households and business throughout the United States. All the Fed's loans were collateralized and we are confident they will be repaid in full.\n\nSecond, we took aggressive steps to ease monetary policy in order to support economic activity and employment. By the end of 2008 we reduced short-term interest rates to virtually zero—the lowest level in the history of the Fed. In order to provide still further support for the economy, we bought more than $1.5 trillion of long-term assets—principally mortgage bonds guaranteed by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac with the support of U.S. Treasury—between December 2008 and March 2010.\n\nWhen the Fed buys long-term assets, it pushes down long-term interest rates. This supports economic activity in a number of ways, including by making housing more affordable and boosting consumption in households that can refinance their mortgages at lower rates. In addition, low long-term rates reduce the cost of capital for businesses, thereby fostering more hiring and investment spending (on equipment, construction and machinery, for example) for any given economic outlook.\n\nNational Economic Conditions\nSo where are we today? Let me start my discussion of economic conditions with a few comments about national economic conditions.\n\nAs I discussed in a recent speech, the Great Recession has been followed by a tepid recovery. Since June 2009, economic activity has grown—but not robustly.\n\nIn recent months, the momentum has slowed. After rising at a 3.25 percent annual rate during the second half of 2009, real gross domestic product growth has slowed. With demand growth barely keeping pace with firms' ability to increase productivity, job creation has been too weak to significantly reduce unemployment, which stands today at 9.6 percent. And, as is typical in such circumstances of considerable slack, the rate of inflation has declined.\n\nWhy are we experiencing this soft patch now? There are several reasons:\n\nThe slow recovery of consumer spending and housing in the face of very substantial monetary and fiscal stimulus reflects the painful unwinding of the dynamics at work during the expansion that preceded it. Beginning around 2003, underwriting standards for residential mortgages were significantly relaxed, leading to a sharp rise in household borrowing and in home prices. The rise in home prices helped support more borrowing as households used lines of credit and second mortgages to tap into their rising home equity. This also fueled a strong boom in home construction. But house price increases could not be sustained without limit. When home prices peaked and started to turn down, the dynamic linking house prices, credit and consumption went into reverse.\n\nLet's consider first what this means for consumption. Consumption of goods and services rose at a slow 2 percent annual rate over the first half of 2010 and with no sign of a rebound. Several factors are inhibiting families from spending, including: job or income losses, low confidence and declines in wealth as real estate and stock prices dipped. Households have been saving more and paying down their debts. Of course, lenders have also reinforced this tendency with tightened underwriting for credit relative to prerecession standards. Have households completed their deleveraging, so they will soon spend more? Although we believe that substantial progress has been made, it is hard to tell how much further this process has to run.\n\nNow, let's consider why housing market activity—both new construction and sales—remains depressed. One reason for this is that many existing homes stand vacant. We estimate that there are roughly 3 million vacant housing units more than usual. This stock of vacant homes will shrink when foreclosures fall and more empty homes are sold or rented out.\n\nOn the sales side, even though low mortgage interest rates and falling home prices have together boosted housing affordability to its highest level in 40 years, the current pace of sales is quite sluggish. Impediments to home sales include tight lending standards, a weak job market and continued uncertainty about home prices. Importantly, the large drop in home prices between 2006 and 2008 also reduced homeowner equity broadly, making it more difficult to \"trade-up\" and move into better homes.\n\nWith lower home prices, many families now owe more on their mortgages than their homes are worth. This means that they cannot refinance or sell their homes easily if they experience a crisis such as a job loss or a serious illness. Foreclosure completions are at an all-time high, although the initiation of new foreclosures may be finally slowing. Recently, attention has focused on cases where some of the documentation used in the foreclosure process may have been flawed. The Fed actively encourages efforts to find viable alternatives to foreclosure. Not many people know this, but a team of New York Fed officials work with mortgage counselors and community activists to support distressed homeowners, and our lawyers support legal aid programs for people facing foreclosure. At the same time, it is important that foreclosures that comply with the law can ultimately take place. This is a necessary part of returning the housing market to more normal conditions.\n\nAlong with two other agencies, the Fed is reviewing the foreclosure practices at the major bank mortgage servicers. We are also keeping an eye on banks' potential liabilities where they made representations about mortgages bought by investors that may not have been correct in all cases. We want to ensure that the housing finance business is supported by robust back-office operations—for processing of new mortgages as well as foreclosures—so that homebuyers and investors have full confidence in the process. We are monitoring developments closely in order to evaluate any potential impact on housing or financial markets and the overall economy.\n\nEconomic Conditions in Upstate New York\nNow let me turn to economic conditions in Upstate New York. It is no secret that this region has struggled with weak economic growth and population loss in recent decades. The region has experienced some very painful economic restructuring, particularly as it lost so many of its high- paying manufacturing jobs. Yet the process has yielded a productive and more diversified economy, with a larger service sector. For this and other reasons I will discuss, the Upstate New York economy has weathered the Great Recession relatively well.\n\nWhile the Upstate economy generally underperformed the nation during the 1980s and 1990s, its recent experience has been quite different. During the Great Recession, Upstate New York's job losses began later than they did for the United States as a whole, and those losses were generally less severe.\n\nThe relatively strong economic performance of the region of late is also clearly tied to its stable housing markets. Upstate New York's relatively slow economic performance and lack of population growth during the expansion in the 2000s supported only modest increases in home prices and sales during the housing boom. When home prices and sales began to decline quite rapidly in many parts of the nation, they held steady across the region. As a result, Upstate New York has largely been spared the boom-and-bust cycle in housing that occurred in other parts of the country. In fact, many of Upstate New York's metropolitan areas even experienced home price appreciation during the housing bust, making these places among the best performing in the country during this period. Many parts of the country experienced severe housing busts, with sharp drops in housing-related activity (such as construction and purchases of major appliances). For example, in fast-growing places such as California and Florida, construction jobs grew to be a large share of employment, but the number of these jobs then plummeted during the recession. This dynamic did not occur in places like Buffalo, where the housing sector was small and thus, had few jobs to lose.\n\nAnother part of the story is that homeowners in Upstate New York did not take on as much debt, and households have been less strained here than elsewhere. One reason is that home prices did not appreciate rapidly here, so homes remained affordable. Moreover, there was generally lower penetration of risky nonprime loans into the region's housing markets. So, Upstate New York's home loans have generally performed better than elsewhere in the country, with fewer delinquencies and foreclosures. Indeed, much of the region was spared the worst effects of the nonprime mortgage boom and bust.\n\nThus, compared with other parts of the nation, the Upstate economy has performed well over the past few years. As a large and growing sector, local colleges and universities have surely contributed to the region's economic stability over the past few years. Indeed, the University at Buffalo provides a clear example of how a university can play a key role in its local economy. The benefits of the higher education industry go beyond their direct economic contributions, such as employment and spending, for a very important reason: they can increase a region's stock of human capital—that is, the total supply of knowledge and skills in its workforce.\n\nA region's human capital contributes to its economic success and resiliency. The educational activities of a region's colleges and universities help build the skills of the local workforce. In addition, the knowledge created by colleges and universities through research activities can play a key role in starting and supporting local businesses. Businesses can use university expertise, infrastructure and research findings to help them develop cutting edge products and services. Furthermore, universities often employ local businesses to develop and commercialize products that arise from their research activities. This dynamic can expand local economic activity and consequently create new jobs for high-skilled workers in a region. Institutions such as the University at Buffalo play a vital role of this sort in the Upstate economy.\n\nThe diversification of Buffalo's economy has helped the region to weather the Great Recession. In particular, major investments in the Buffalo Niagara Medical Campus have allowed the health care and education sectors to expand and become an increasingly important part of the local economy. These sectors provide stability because they are less susceptible to contraction during economic downturns than other sectors of the economy. Moreover, Buffalo's robust banking industry provides an additional source of strength. And the strong Canadian dollar has attracted Canadian shoppers to the region, bolstering retail sales, contributing to local economic stability over the past few years.\n\nWhat Is the Fed Doing Now?\nSince the beginning of the downturn, the Fed has actively used monetary and regulatory policy to help support economic activity and improve economic outcomes—here in Buffalo and across the nation—relative to what would have happened in the absence of this support.\n\nWith regard to monetary policy, the Fed has in place a highly accommodative stance. The FOMC has said that it will keep short term interest rates at exceptionally low levels for an extended period of time. The Fed also retains large amounts of mortgage-backed bonds acquired in order to support the housing market and help bring down mortgage and other long-term interest rates to the historically low rates in place today.\n\nThe FOMC and the Chairman have stated their commitment to take further actions to bring interest rates down further should economic conditions warrant. In a recent speech, I said that both the current levels of unemployment and inflation and the timeframe over which they are likely to return to levels consistent with our mandate are unacceptable. I said that I thought further Fed action was likely to be warranted unless the economic outlook were to evolve in a way that made me more confident we would see better outcomes for both employment and inflation before too long.\n\nTurning to regulatory policy, the biggest lesson of the financial crisis is that severe financial disruptions can inflict very large and persistent costs on people's lives and jobs. Over the past year, with Fed leadership and support, important new regulatory initiatives have been advanced to create a global financial system where the players cannot slide back into the risky \"business as usual\" that created this crisis. These include the recent agreement with international bank regulators (sometimes called \"Basel III\") to impose stricter standards for globally active banks and the considerable regulatory changes embodied in the Dodd-Frank Act.\n\nThese measures recognize that to avert or contain future financial crises, we need a financial system that can withstand large negative shocks. First, market participants must not have incentives to take excessive risks. Instead, incentives should reward actions that support economic growth and financial stability. And financial firms must set aside enough capital and liquidity so that when things go wrong they can absorb losses with their own resources. Finally, if these buffers prove inadequate and a financial firm veers toward failure, the official sector needs the tools to wind them down in an orderly manner without having to make the terrible choice between a chaotic failure that harms the whole economy and a taxpayer-funded rescue.\n\nConclusion\nI appreciate the opportunity to talk to you about how my job at the New York Fed ties in with your lives and work here in Upstate New York. The links are many, including\n\nTo summarize conditions at the moment: after a recession that was milder in Upstate New York than in many parts of the country, the region is showing signs of a modest recovery. A more diversified, more knowledge-based economy and a relatively small housing sector helped to limit the recession's impact on many communities. Nevertheless, the Great Recession spread much pain throughout this region and unemployment remains much higher than we would like.\n\nThe Fed cannot wave a magic wand and make the problems remaining from the preceding period of excess vanish immediately. But we can provide essential support for the needed adjustments. Even with our best efforts, the road to full recovery here in Upstate New York and across the nation is likely to be long and bumpy. But I am confident that we will make it. And, the dynamism that is represented in this room—the private sector combined with academic learning and research—will provide a strong underpinning for future prosperity.\n\nThank you for your kind attention. I will now be happy to take some questions."

You may know that one of my councils, the Upstate New York Regional Advisory Board, is designed specifically to provide me with timely information from this area. In this way, decisions by the FOMC are continually informed by views gathered from all parts of the country, including Upstate New York.\n\nOne thing that makes my job even more interesting is that New York has some roles unique within the Fed. Let me tell you about some of them. We, alone, implement monetary policy. At the direction of the FOMC, we buy and sell Treasury securities. We are also the eyes and ears of the Fed on Wall Street, and we supervise many of the largest financial institutions in the country. We operate Fedwire®—the conduit for large money transfers between banks. And, we provide banking services to the U.S. Treasury, and central banks and governments from around the world.\n\nFinally, I must mention that the New York Fed's district could be the most diverse in the System: ranging from the urban density of Manhattan to the forested sparseness of the northern Adirondacks, to the Caribbean islands of Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands. All in all, there is a lot to keep my colleagues and me quite busy—even in normal times.\n\nThe Crisis and Response\nOf course these are anything but normal times. The financial crisis that broke in mid-2007 and intensified dramatically following the failure of Lehman Brothers has been among the most virulent ever. And it was followed by the longest and one of the deepest recessions since World War II, called by many the \"Great Recession.\"\n\nThe Fed responded aggressively and creatively in an effort to pursue our dual mandate. Our actions fell into two broad buckets.\n\nFirst, we took steps to supply liquidity to the financial system, so that financial markets could continue to function properly and to enable households and businesses to maintain access to credit. Carrying out an age-old central banking role, we loaned funds to financial firms, secured against their high-quality collateral.\n\nTraditionally, such loans were only made to depository institutions, such as banks. Of course, the modern U.S. financial system includes many lenders that are not banks. These companies and markets provide vital financing for credit card loans, short-term business needs and many other activities. Many years ago, Congress gave the Fed the emergency authority to lend to nonbanks in \"unusual and exigent circumstances.\" During the crisis—in order to limit damage to the wider economy—we exercised this authority to lend to a wide variety of financial firms and markets.\n\nA handful of times, we made the difficult decision to make emergency loans to prevent the disorderly failure of particular firms. We did so not because we wanted to help the firms, but because allowing them to collapse in a disorderly fashion in the midst of a global crisis would have harmed households and business throughout the United States. All the Fed's loans were collateralized and we are confident they will be repaid in full.\n\nSecond, we took aggressive steps to ease monetary policy in order to support economic activity and employment. By the end of 2008 we reduced short-term interest rates to virtually zero—the lowest level in the history of the Fed. In order to provide still further support for the economy, we bought more than $1.5 trillion of long-term assets—principally mortgage bonds guaranteed by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac with the support of U.S. Treasury—between December 2008 and March 2010.\n\nWhen the Fed buys long-term assets, it pushes down long-term interest rates. This supports economic activity in a number of ways, including by making housing more affordable and boosting consumption in households that can refinance their mortgages at lower rates. In addition, low long-term rates reduce the cost of capital for businesses, thereby fostering more hiring and investment spending (on equipment, construction and machinery, for example) for any given economic outlook.\n\nNational Economic Conditions\nSo where are we today? Let me start my discussion of economic conditions with a few comments about national economic conditions.\n\nAs I discussed in a recent speech, the Great Recession has been followed by a tepid recovery. Since June 2009, economic activity has grown—but not robustly.\n\nIn recent months, the momentum has slowed. After rising at a 3.25 percent annual rate during the second half of 2009, real gross domestic product growth has slowed. With demand growth barely keeping pace with firms' ability to increase productivity, job creation has been too weak to significantly reduce unemployment, which stands today at 9.6 percent. And, as is typical in such circumstances of considerable slack, the rate of inflation has declined.\n\nWhy are we experiencing this soft patch now? There are several reasons:\n\nThe slow recovery of consumer spending and housing in the face of very substantial monetary and fiscal stimulus reflects the painful unwinding of the dynamics at work during the expansion that preceded it. Beginning around 2003, underwriting standards for residential mortgages were significantly relaxed, leading to a sharp rise in household borrowing and in home prices. The rise in home prices helped support more borrowing as households used lines of credit and second mortgages to tap into their rising home equity. This also fueled a strong boom in home construction. But house price increases could not be sustained without limit. When home prices peaked and started to turn down, the dynamic linking house prices, credit and consumption went into reverse.\n\nLet's consider first what this means for consumption. Consumption of goods and services rose at a slow 2 percent annual rate over the first half of 2010 and with no sign of a rebound. Several factors are inhibiting families from spending, including: job or income losses, low confidence and declines in wealth as real estate and stock prices dipped. Households have been saving more and paying down their debts. Of course, lenders have also reinforced this tendency with tightened underwriting for credit relative to prerecession standards. Have households completed their deleveraging, so they will soon spend more? Although we believe that substantial progress has been made, it is hard to tell how much further this process has to run.\n\nNow, let's consider why housing market activity—both new construction and sales—remains depressed. One reason for this is that many existing homes stand vacant. We estimate that there are roughly 3 million vacant housing units more than usual. This stock of vacant homes will shrink when foreclosures fall and more empty homes are sold or rented out.\n\nOn the sales side, even though low mortgage interest rates and falling home prices have together boosted housing affordability to its highest level in 40 years, the current pace of sales is quite sluggish. Impediments to home sales include tight lending standards, a weak job market and continued uncertainty about home prices. Importantly, the large drop in home prices between 2006 and 2008 also reduced homeowner equity broadly, making it more difficult to \"trade-up\" and move into better homes.\n\nWith lower home prices, many families now owe more on their mortgages than their homes are worth. This means that they cannot refinance or sell their homes easily if they experience a crisis such as a job loss or a serious illness. Foreclosure completions are at an all-time high, although the initiation of new foreclosures may be finally slowing. Recently, attention has focused on cases where some of the documentation used in the foreclosure process may have been flawed. The Fed actively encourages efforts to find viable alternatives to foreclosure. Not many people know this, but a team of New York Fed officials work with mortgage counselors and community activists to support distressed homeowners, and our lawyers support legal aid programs for people facing foreclosure. At the same time, it is important that foreclosures that comply with the law can ultimately take place. This is a necessary part of returning the housing market to more normal conditions.\n\nAlong with two other agencies, the Fed is reviewing the foreclosure practices at the major bank mortgage servicers. We are also keeping an eye on banks' potential liabilities where they made representations about mortgages bought by investors that may not have been correct in all cases. We want to ensure that the housing finance business is supported by robust back-office operations—for processing of new mortgages as well as foreclosures—so that homebuyers and investors have full confidence in the process. We are monitoring developments closely in order to evaluate any potential impact on housing or financial markets and the overall economy.\n\nEconomic Conditions in Upstate New York\nNow let me turn to economic conditions in Upstate New York. It is no secret that this region has struggled with weak economic growth and population loss in recent decades. The region has experienced some very painful economic restructuring, particularly as it lost so many of its high-paying manufacturing jobs. Yet the process has yielded a productive and more diversified economy, with a larger service sector. For this and other reasons I will discuss, the Upstate New York economy has weathered the Great Recession relatively well.\n\nWhile the Upstate economy generally underperformed the nation during the 1980s and 1990s, its recent experience has been quite different. During the Great Recession, Upstate New York's job losses began later than they did for the United States as a whole, and those losses were generally less severe.\n\nThe relatively strong economic performance of the region of late is also clearly tied to its stable housing markets. Upstate New York's relatively slow economic performance and lack of population growth during the expansion in the 2000s supported only modest increases in home prices and sales during the housing boom. When home prices and sales began to decline quite rapidly in many parts of the nation, they held steady across the region. As a result, Upstate New York has largely been spared the boom-and-bust cycle in housing that occurred in other parts of the country. In fact, many of Upstate New York's metropolitan areas even experienced home price appreciation during the housing bust, making these places among the best performing in the country during this period. Many parts of the country experienced severe housing busts, with sharp drops in housing-related activity (such as construction and purchases of major appliances). For example, in fast-growing places such as California and Florida, construction jobs grew to be a large share of employment, but the number of these jobs then plummeted during the recession. This dynamic did not occur in places like Rochester, where the housing sector was small and thus, had few jobs to lose.\n\nAnother part of the story is that homeowners in Upstate New York did not take on as much debt, and households have been less strained here than elsewhere. One reason is that home prices did not appreciate rapidly here, so homes remained affordable. Moreover, there was generally lower penetration of risky nonprime loans into the region's housing markets. So, Upstate New York's home loans have generally performed better than elsewhere in the country, with fewer delinquencies and foreclosures. Indeed, much of the region was spared the worst effects of the nonprime mortgage boom and bust.\n\nThus, compared with other parts of the nation, the Upstate economy has performed well over the past few years. As a large and growing sector, local colleges and universities have surely contributed to the region's economic stability over the past few years. Indeed, the University of Rochester provides a clear example of how a university can play a key role in its local economy. The benefits of the higher education industry go beyond their direct economic contributions, such as employment and spending, for a very important reason: they can increase a region's stock of human capital—that is, the total supply of knowledge and skills in its workforce.\n\nA region's human capital contributes to its economic success and resiliency. The educational activities of a region's colleges and universities help build the skills of the local workforce. In addition, the knowledge created by colleges and universities through research activities can play a key role in starting and supporting local businesses. Businesses can use university expertise, infrastructure and research findings to help them develop cutting edge products and services. Furthermore, universities often employ local businesses to develop and commercialize products that arise from their research activities. This dynamic can expand local economic activity and consequently create new jobs for high-skilled workers in a region. Institutions such as the University of Rochester play a vital role of this sort in the Upstate economy.\n\nThe diversification of Rochester's economy has helped the region weather the Great Recession. In particular, major investments in the University of Rochester Medical Center have allowed the health care and education sectors to expand and become an increasingly important part of the local economy. These sectors tend to provide stability to their local economies because they are less susceptible to contraction during economic downturns than other sectors of the economy. Moreover, despite the decline in manufacturing, Rochester is well known for its world-class optics and imaging business cluster. Local businesses work closely with the University of Rochester and the Rochester Institute of Technology to leverage their joint expertise in fields such as imaging technologies and lenses to develop cutting edge products. As a result, Rochester has remained a highly productive and relatively stable region.\n\nWhat Is the Fed Doing Now?\nSince the beginning of the downturn, the Fed has actively used monetary and regulatory policy to help support economic activity and improve economic outcomes—here in Rochester and across the nation—relative to what would have happened in the absence of this support.\n\nWith regard to monetary policy, the Fed has in place a highly accommodative stance. The FOMC has said that it will keep short term interest rates at exceptionally low levels for an extended period of time. The Fed also retains large amounts of mortgage-backed bonds acquired in order to support the housing market and help bring down mortgage and other long-term interest rates to the historically low rates in place today.\n\nThe FOMC and the Chairman have stated their commitment to take further actions to bring interest rates down further should economic conditions warrant. In a recent speech, I said that both the current levels of unemployment and inflation and the timeframe over which they are likely to return to levels consistent with our mandate are unacceptable. I said that I thought further Fed action was likely to be warranted unless the economic outlook were to evolve in a way that made me more confident we would see better outcomes for both employment and inflation before too long.\n\nTurning to regulatory policy, the biggest lesson of the financial crisis is that severe financial disruptions can inflict very large and persistent costs on people's lives and jobs. Over the past year, with Fed leadership and support, important new regulatory initiatives have been advanced to create a global financial system where the players cannot slide back into the risky \"business as usual\" that created this crisis. These include the recent agreement with international bank regulators (sometimes called \"Basel III\") to impose stricter standards for globally active banks and the considerable regulatory changes embodied in the Dodd-Frank Act.\n\nThese measures recognize that to avert or contain future financial crises, we need a financial system that can withstand large negative shocks. First, market participants must not have incentives to take excessive risks. Instead, incentives should reward actions that support economic growth and financial stability. And financial firms must set aside enough capital and liquidity so that when things go wrong they can absorb losses with their own resources. Finally, if these buffers prove inadequate and a financial firm veers toward failure, the official sector needs the tools to wind them down in an orderly manner without having to make the terrible choice between a chaotic failure that harms the whole economy and a taxpayer-funded rescue.\n\nConclusion\nI appreciate the opportunity to talk to you about how my job at the New York Fed ties in with your lives and work here in Upstate New York. The links are many, including\n\nTo summarize conditions at the moment: after a recession that was milder in Upstate New York than in many parts of the country, the region is showing signs of a modest recovery. A more diversified, more knowledge-based economy and a relatively small housing sector helped to limit the recession's impact on many communities. Nevertheless, the Great Recession spread much pain throughout this region and unemployment remains much higher than we would like.\n\nThe Fed cannot wave a magic wand and make the problems remaining from the preceding period of excess vanish immediately. But we can provide essential support for the needed adjustments. Even with our best efforts, the road to full recovery here in Upstate New York and across the nation is likely to be long and bumpy. But I am confident that we will make it. And, the dynamism that is represented in this room—the private sector combined with academic learning and research—will provide a strong underpinning for future prosperity.\n\nThank you for your kind attention. I will now be happy to take some questions."

        "content": "Let me thank the organizers for the opportunity to speak today about the supervision and resolution of financial institutions in danger of failing. Let me begin by noting that the views I'll express in these remarks represent my own views and not those of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York or the Federal Reserve System.\n\nIn any industry, it is important that unsuccessful firms fail. Business strategies fall short, franchises depreciate, management loses focus. Large or small, unsuccessful firms need to be cleared from the scene through merger, restructuring or liquidation.\n\nThis is no less true for the financial industry than for any other. And for all firms, society has an interest in ensuring that the process of failure does not destroy more value than necessary. As an economist, I see much innovation in national insolvency practices over time as designed to reduce the cost of insolvency and increase the value preserved in the insolvency process.\n\nOne of the vexing problems during the recent financial crisis was concern about the adequacy of means to resolve large financial firms and uncertainty about the externalities of placing a large financial firm into insolvency. The Lehman bankruptcy no doubt validated those apprehensions for many.\n\nSome of the issues in resolving large, internationally active financial firms have been recognized for some time—the multiplicity of jurisdictions, differences in insolvency regimes across countries, complexities in unwinding certain books and the largely untested nature of national, much less international, resolution processes for such very large financial firms. Over the last 20 years, the international legal and supervisory communities have undertaken several efforts to address these issues.\n\nIn the wake of the financial crisis, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision formed a Cross-Border Bank Resolution Group to identify what improvements could be made to the international resolution process and recommend actions to be taken. It published its recommendations in March 2010. The CBRG's report is admirable in its clear description of the problems encountered in the fall of 2008 and the concrete nature of its recommendations. I will be referring to them throughout my remarks. As the CBRG was completing its draft report, the Financial Stability Board asked a working group, the Cross Border Crisis Management Group, to advance the development of recovery and resolution plans for cross-border institutions as recommended by the CBRG.\n\nI'd like to make three points today. The first is to highlight the importance of timely supervisory action in preserving the value in a financial firm. The second is to underscore the important innovation in supervisory practice represented by recovery planning. The third is to paint a picture, an admittedly optimistic picture, of the improvements in the international resolution process made possible by following the recommendations of the CBRG. I will conclude by returning to my starting point, to the importance and the scarcity of time in dealing with a troubled financial firm.\n\nThe Important Role Time Plays at a Failing Firm\nThe seeds of any financial failure are generally planted years earlier. The cycle is familiar to us all—in good times, most business strategies thrive. Financial institutions commence an activity that has high initial marginal returns; over time the activity attracts more competition, pricing goes down and risk appetite goes up. Overexpansion leads to an inevitable correction, with the losses incurred testifying to the long-term unsuccessful nature of the strategy.\n\nU.S. banking, securities and finance companies in the early 1990s experienced the late stage of just such a cycle in which commercial real estate and leveraged buyout lending overexpanded. The result was that many large financial institutions had to be merged into others or unwound.\n\nBanking supervisors responded to these problems by requiring banks with large, problematic exposures to implement a three-part program. First, the bank comprehensively identified its problem loans and assigned them to workout specialists. Second, the bank developed and executed a capital plan and strengthened its liquidity. Third and essential to raising new capital, the bank developed a new business plan demonstrating its ability to return to profitability.\n\nThis program worked, in large part because it was applied timely enough. Stylized facts about time's role on the value of a failing firm created urgency in implementing the program. Those stylized facts were:\n\nThis three-part program of identifying all problems, replenishing capital and liquidity and recasting the business plan was designed around loan exposures, but continues to be relevant today. The challenges are to adapt such a program to the many financial institutions strongly oriented toward capital markets activities with the resulting volatile balance sheets and income streams and to apply the program timely.\n\nTime also plays an important role when a financial firm is subject to an insolvency process. Another stylized fact is that the market value of the assets and business lines often suffer a substantial markdown when a financial institution enters insolvency and may decay further thereafter. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), the resolution authority for banks in the United States, routinely experienced losses in resolving banks in the 1980s, when it was required to wait until the bank's book value had reached zero. That led to the provision in FDICIA 1991 that a bank can be declared insolvent when its tangible equity falls below 2 percent of assets.\n\nA Supervisory Innovation: Recovery Planning\nThe potential for rapid decay of asset and business line values unless assets and liabilities are transferred to a permanent owner quickly is a large part of what sets financial institutions apart from other companies entering insolvency. This difference motivates efforts to avert insolvency through supervisory action, as I described earlier. It also motivated U.S. banking supervisors in the early 1990s to ask some troubled banking companies not only to apply the three-part program but also to develop a meaningful contingency plan for reducing risk and raising capital if the first round of actions did not succeed. The supervisors incorporated the requirement to develop contingency plans in its supervisory agreements with those institutions.\n\nThe CBRG has recommended that all systemically important financial institutions develop recovery plans. I believe the development of such plans by healthy institutions and their discussion by a college of the firm's principal regulators constitute important innovations in the supervision of financial institutions. The Cross Border Crisis Management Group has provided momentum and a forum for discussion of progress and challenges as supervisors initiate discussion of recovery plans with firms. The discussions we have held in the United States involve the financial institution, its major U.S. regulators and the regulators of the foreign legal entities containing its principal business operations. Those discussions have included both the development of a global liquidity contingency plan and a plan to reduce the risk profile of or \"derisk\" the financial firm by winding down or selling business operations or financial assets. The intention is to have recovery plans, as well as resolution plans, in place by the end of 2011.\n\nRecovery planning has several important benefits. The first is to bring about a discussion of the firm's response to very severe stress scenarios. In addition, the principal supervisors of the firm are present together with the firm to discuss the plan as it evolves, contributing to a common base of understanding of the firm among the supervisors.\n\nThe second benefit is the identification of impediments to the firm's recovery. In our discussions with U.S. institutions, four important impediments have surfaced and the same themes, all familiar concerns for supervisors and resolution authorities, have surfaced in other discussions led by members of the Cross Border Crisis Management Group. The difference this time is that the issues are being raised by the firms themselves.\n\nThe first is the availability of sufficient financial information by legal entity. It begins with simple housekeeping—records that accurately record the legal entities of both the firm and the customer involved in a financial transaction, an asset holding or a liability. Given the extensive consolidation of firms in the financial industry, the information systems of many firms are an accretion of systems, with issues of consistency, comprehensive aggregation of exposures and speed of information retrieval for analysis. For example, most firms in distress find it difficult to answer a crucial question: what market participants are most exposed to me and how will they react to my difficulties?\n\nA second impediment is the complexity of unwinding certain books of business, where the business is originated in one location, recorded in another and risk-managed in a third. Derivative transactions are a prime example. The level of complexity related to how and where trades are marketed, booked, funded and risk-managed leads to high levels of connectedness within the firm, particularly as institutions book \"back-to-back\" intragroup trades to transfer the economics of a transaction to a central portfolio for risk management purposes.\n\nThe third impediment is the use of intragroup guarantees. Institutions sometimes use parent guarantees to support and cover particular transactions or the entire operations of separately capitalized subsidiaries in foreign countries. Guarantees of this sort allow firms to operate subsidiaries with less capital, but can distort the pricing and economics of the subsidiary's business activities and make the subsidiary more valuable to the current owner than to a potential buyer. In addition, the default of a guarantor may allow counterparties to terminate contracts and seize collateral even though official sector efforts are attempting to preserve the local operations.\n\nThe fourth impediment is the need to preserve global payment operations. The cash management, cash payments, securities settlement and custodial services that some firms offer to wholesale and retail clients are essential to the functioning of clients, the economy and the financial system, but such services have high switching costs for customers. These services often represent core business lines with stable profitability and thus valuable assets for financial firms, but they are also often entwined with other businesses in the firm. The fundamental nature of these activities and their importance to the financial and real economies make them of special interest to the financial authorities reviewing recovery plans and developing resolution plans.\n\nThe four impediments are all related to institutional complexity. A financial firm organized as a single legal entity would certainly face many complexities, but far fewer than organizations today. This clearly raises the issue of whether the extraordinary organizational complexity of financial firms today imposes social costs that are too burdensome, especially in resolution, relative to its benefits. The economists Dick Herring and Jacopo Carmassi earlier this year documented the reasons for the vast number of subsidiaries at large financial firms, reasons such as regulatory requirements, regulatory arbitrage and tax avoidance.\n\nIf such organizational complexity imposes a high social cost by impeding recovery plans and resolution, providing incentives to reduce complexity may be warranted. For example, collateralization or capital requirements on intragroup exposures or parent guarantees could internalize for the firm some of those social costs. Alternatively, more direct supervisory requirements may be necessary for addressing the improvement of information systems or the separability and preservation of critical payment systems.\n\nBut such measures have costs and I would argue increase the relative benefit of efforts to identify the no doubt very difficult changes necessary in both the private and the public sectors to reduce organizational complexity in financial firms. I note that the CBRG report not only has recommendations largely addressing the four impediments to recovery I described, but also a recommendation to simplify financial firm organizational structures.\n\nA final benefit of recovery planning is that it is a prod to concrete action in the near term, when the institution is healthy and provides a ready-made menu of options when the firm is distressed. Moreover, the impediments to recovery are also impediments to resolution. If the recovery plan does not succeed in averting failure, but the firm has acted on the plan, it will enter resolution with better information systems, a reduced risk profile and perhaps fewer intragroup exposures than it otherwise would have.\n\nResolution Planning\nAs I mentioned at the outset, the financial crisis validated for many concerns about the adequacy of measures to resolve large financial firms without high costs and destructive externalities. The Lehman bankruptcy reminds us that every financial institution is resolvable, but at a cost. The major elements of cost are the considerable expense of insolvency, the substantial loss of value through any excess, \"fire sale\" markdown of the value of assets and business lines and the externalities of a large failure to other firms, their stakeholders and market participants in the form of knock-on and psychological effects. When the observation is made that a financial institution is not resolvable or is too big to fail, it represents a judgment that the financial costs and externalities of failure are unacceptable.\n\nThe desire to improve the resolution process for cross-border financial firms is widely shared, but how we should we judge progress? The success of private and public sector actions, such as those recommended by the CBRG, to improve the resolution of systemically important firms can perhaps be gauged by the extent to which resolution costs are reduced. We might further gauge progress against additional expectations, such as the absence of taxpayer support of the resolution process, the efficiency of the process (to the extent it is not captured in resolution costs) and the equitable and consistent treatment of stakeholders.\n\nTo improve the resolution process, the CBRG's first recommendation is that national authorities have appropriate tools to deal with all types of financial institutions in difficulties so that an orderly resolution can be achieved. The recommendation specifically mentions power to create bridge financial institutions, transfer assets, liabilities and business operations to others and to resolve claims.\n\nThe FDIC has these powers for banks and thrifts as well as a great deal of experience in managing bank failures and has demonstrated the utility and flexibility of its tools. A positive development is that many countries are considering or have adopted legislation giving the financial resolution authority similar powers.\n\nThe U.S. Dodd-Frank Act passed in the summer broadens the scope of the FDIC's resolution powers, although in a carefully circumscribed manner. The Dodd-Frank Act allows the FDIC to resolve not only a bank, but a financial holding company of a banking organization or a nonbank financial institution, if the requisite recommendations and conditions are present, among them, that the failure is a threat to financial stability. When the FDIC is appointed receiver, it has available its full set of resolution powers, including the ability to create a bridge company for a nonbank financial institution.\n\nThe Dodd-Frank Act also strengthens the supervisory regime for systemically important financial firms. It empowers the newly formed Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) to designate bank and nonbank firms as systemically important. The FSOC has just published an advanced notice of proposed rulemaking soliciting comments on the criteria for designating nonbank financial companies systemically important. Companies that are so designated will be subject to consolidated oversight from the Federal Reserve.\n\nThe U.S. supervisory and resolution authorities have also begun the process of resolution planning, as recommended by the CBRG. That discussion is intended to be on a firm-by-firm basis among the supervisors and resolution authorities in the principal locations of the firm's activities.\n\nThe CBRG recommendations provide useful building blocks toward a stronger cross-jurisdiction national process: resolution tools, national coordination across jurisdictions, recovery planning, setting aside of impediments to recovery and resolution and simplification of organizational complexity. The CBRG also recommends that national authorities seek international convergence of resolution tools and measures.\n\nHow might we envision an effective cross-border resolution process developing from these building blocks? The report is very careful in talking about how the building blocks might integrate at the international level, noting the many problems and conflicts faced by national authorities in dealing with a troubled or insolvent organization located partially outside national borders. So let me extrapolate from the report, expressing strictly my own views and sketch out how the process set in train by the CBRG recommendations might evolve.\n\nLet's focus on a single systemically important financial institution. The healthy dialogue among regulators and resolution authorities in the principal jurisdictions for a given firm and the firm-specific recovery and resolution plans developed could provide the basis for strong cooperation when the institution crosses from healthy to troubled. On the basis of that cooperation, the lead supervisor, with the participation of the resolution authority in the home country jurisdiction, could coordinate a program of early supervisory intervention encouraging a private restructuring utilizing the recovery plan. At the same time, the resolution authority in the home country, working with the home country lead supervisor, could begin taking the necessary steps to prepare for a possible resolution as a contingency. If the supervisory intervention does not produce a successful private restructuring and recovery, the home country resolution authority leads a coordinated resolution process.\n\nLet me elaborate on a couple points. First, I believe that economists can be invaluable in helping financial supervisory and resolution authorities understand more fully where coordinated actions and cooperative solutions improve outcomes and where they do not, something I don't believe we now really know. The potential gains from cooperation will reflect the distribution of asset and liabilities (or net worth) across legal entities, assumptions about the rate of decay in the values of assets and business lines pre-entry and post-entry into insolvency, the length of time spent in each state and any one-time markdown on entering insolvency. With analysis or simulation, various decision rules can be explored about how a lead resolution authority could foster a cooperative, coordinated resolution using tools such as bridge banks, transfers of assets and liabilities, sequencing of sales or liquidations and other techniques. An analysis can also explore how sensitive the decision rules are to timing, distribution of net worth across entities and decay or markdown factors.\n\nIn addition, one of the most important decisions for resolution authorities will be which legal entities within a systemically important firm to place into insolvency proceedings and which entities can and should be maintained for sale as going concerns. In his September 1 testimony before the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission, my colleague, Tom Baxter, general counsel of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, described how Lehman's broker-dealer was not placed into insolvency, remained a going concern temporarily funded by the central bank and was sold within days after Lehman's bankruptcy filing.\n\nThe work needed to understand how coordinated resolution might work and when it will work underscores for us that an immediate jump to a fully fledged international resolution process is not really feasible. This is in fact why doing the hard and painstaking work of resolution planning is so important. Resolution planning is a smaller version of the statistical simulation I described, more closely tied to the specifics of the individual institution's case, in which the financial authorities in the jurisdictions where the firm's major operations are located work through potential scenarios. Those scenarios will reflect the current structure of the firm and the normal range of the distribution of assets and liabilities across legal entities. Resolution planning is likely to contribute a great deal of insight into how a full-fledged international process could work, insight that we do not have today.\n\nI have talked about early, coordinated supervisory intervention to activate a recovery plan for a systemically important firm and of a coordinated resolution process. Is there an opportunity between those two stages to intervene more forcefully, but not incur the potential asset markdowns and administrative costs of resolution? Considerable interest has been expressed in developing a \"bail-in\" mechanism to provide that intermediate step.\n\nLet me comment by stressing that what I am expressing is strictly my own view. And let me start by saying that a bail-in mechanism cannot substitute for the national resolution tools and resolution planning called for by the CBRG. There must be a last stop where systemically firms can be resolved, because we will inevitably need it and we must work to make cross-border resolution possible at acceptable cost.\n\nWhere can bail-in fit? I've described a process in which supervisors deal first with a troubled financial firm by encouraging its board of directors and management to activate its recovery plan and develop a private restructuring. In my personal view, the possibility of a restructuring prior to insolvency with potentially more forceful outside supervisory or contractual intervention is interesting and deserves more study. Given the number and range of stakeholders in a large financial company, such a mechanism could help solve a coordination problem that can be costly in terms of time and sub-optimal in terms of ensuring the equitable treatment of stakeholders for a financial company on the threshold of, or in, distress.\n\nHowever, bail-in is not yet a well-defined concept in the international policy discussion; I'm not sure how my description of a mechanism resonates with the overall discussion. Right now, the common theme of a set of bail-in concepts is putting in place a statutory or contractual trigger that would convert a firm's debt into equity, thereby immediately strengthening the firm's capital base. Short-term debt and liabilities would likely be excluded.\n\nTo move the bail-in mechanism from concept to a meaningful proposal, the official community needs to develop one or more specific proposals that can be vetted, debated and improved. In that spirit, let me list some areas in which a bail-in proposal needs to be more specific. A proposal needs to make clear:\n\nI'll conclude with the timing of the trigger. A key question is when such a mechanism has the greatest chance of success. In my personal view, it seems unlikely that the proverbial \"one minute to midnight\" is the right moment for action—by then most firms would face a severe shortage of liquidity and serious constraints in the ability to undertake new business. Timing that is too early brings with it a host of repercussions and risks, of course.\n\nIf I interpret a bail-in mechanism against the three-part supervisory program for troubled firms that I described at the beginning, conversion of debt to equity stakes is a mechanism to replenish capital, a critical element, but just one of the three key elements. The comparison suggests that the conversion of debt to equity by itself may not be sufficient and a fully developed proposal for a bail-in mechanism will need to include thorough identification and workout of problem assets and positions, as well as a revamped business plan that demonstrates the ability of the financial firm to return to profitability.\n\nA Return to the Issue of Time\nLet me conclude by returning to the theme of time. Long-standing supervisory practice aims to intercept problems before they threaten the viability of a financial institution and to promote action by the firm's directors and management while the firm still has the opportunity to recover. But supervisors will not always execute timely, successfully and in all necessary cases and financial firms will not always be able to turn around a deteriorating situation and avert failure; certainly the experience of the financial crisis are sobering in that respect. That underscores the need to develop with alacrity and diligence meaningful recovery and resolution planning for systemically important firms and continue to build a strong international resolution process.\n\nRecovery planning by firms helps to increase the margin of time available for firms by shortening reaction time when distress occurs and reducing the impediments to recovery and resolution when firms are healthy. Similarly, resolution planning gives financial authorities a better starting position and more ability to move swiftly and decisively in a financial firm failure. Taken together, augmented resolution powers, recovery and resolution planning and better identification of systemic risks can move us substantially forward in dealing with failing systemically important institutions.\n\nThank you for the opportunity to share these views with you."

        "content": "Introduction to the New York Fed\nAs many of you know, this is my first chance to speak at Cornell University since I became president of the New York Fed. So, by way of introduction, let me start with a synopsis of what the New York Fed is, what we do and what makes my job so interesting.\n\nThe New York Fed is part of the Federal Reserve System, America's central bank, and was created by Congress in 1913. With this act, Congress delegated to the Fed System its constitutional authority to manage the money supply—and designed it be decentralized, representative of all of America and independent of the political process. The Fed System is comprised of the Board of Governors in Washington, D.C.—a federal agency led by Chairman Ben Bernanke—plus 12 autonomous Reserve Banks that span the country. For example, the district overseen by the New York Fed includes all of New York, the 12 northern counties of New Jersey; Fairfield County, Connecticut; Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Each Reserve Bank is autonomous, with its own charter and a board of directors drawn from its district, but overseen by the Board of Governors. The law that created the Federal Reserve made us independent so we can make decisions in the national interest free from political pressure. However, the Fed is accountable to Congress.\n\nCongress has set an explicit objective for monetary policy: To pursue the highest level of employment consistent with price stability. This objective is often referred to as our \"dual mandate,\" because it combines two goals: high employment, and low and stable inflation. In order to promote these objectives, we also pay close attention to financial stability, because without financial stability, it is very hard to achieve our goals for jobs and inflation.\n\nThe FOMC meets in Washington, D.C., eight times per year to deliberate and vote on monetary policy. As New York Fed president, I am vice chairman at these meetings and have a permanent vote. At these meetings, the 16 other members (the Board of Governors and the other Reserve Bank Presidents) and I each present our current outlook for the economy. For these assessments, we augment input from our research departments with critical information about local economic conditions supplied by our boards of directors, regional advisory councils and conversations with local stakeholders. You may know that one of my councils, the Upstate New York Regional Advisory Board, is designed specifically to provide me with timely information from this area. In this way, decisions by the FOMC are continually informed by views gathered from all parts of the country, including Upstate New York.\n\nOne thing that makes my job even more interesting is that New York has some roles unique within the Fed. Let me tell you about some of them. We, alone, implement monetary policy. At the direction of the FOMC, we buy and sell Treasury securities. We are also the eyes and ears of the Fed on Wall Street, and we supervise many of the largest financial institutions in the country. We operate Fedwire®—the conduit for large money transfers between banks. And, we provide banking services to the U.S. Treasury, and central banks and governments from around the world. Finally, I must mention that the New York Fed's district could be the most diverse in the System: ranging from the urban density of Manhattan to the forested sparseness of the northern Adirondacks, to the Caribbean islands of Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands. All in all, there is a lot to keep my colleagues and me quite busy—even in normal times.\n\nThe Crisis and Response\nOf course these are anything but normal times. The financial crisis that broke in mid-2007 and intensified dramatically following the failure of Lehman Brothers has been among the most virulent ever. And it was followed by the longest and one of the deepest recessions since World War II, called by many the \"Great Recession.\"\n\nThe Fed responded aggressively and creatively in an effort to pursue our dual mandate. Our actions fell into two broad buckets.\n\nFirst, we took steps to supply liquidity to the financial system, so that financial markets could continue to function properly and to enable households and businesses to maintain access to credit. Carrying out an age-old central banking role, we loaned funds to financial firms, secured against their high-quality collateral.\n\nTraditionally, such loans were only made to depository institutions, such as banks. Of course, the modern U.S. financial system includes many lenders that are not banks. These companies and markets provide vital financing for credit card loans, short-term business needs and many other activities. Many years ago, Congress gave the Fed the emergency authority to lend to nonbanks in \"unusual and exigent circumstances.\" During the crisis—in order to limit damage to the wider economy—we exercised this authority to lend to a wide variety of financial firms and markets.\n\nA handful of times, we made the difficult decision to make emergency loans to prevent the disorderly failure of particular firms. We did so not because we wanted to help the firms, but because allowing them to collapse in a disorderly fashion in the midst of a global crisis would have harmed households and business throughout the United States. All the Fed's loans were collateralized and we are confident they will be repaid in full.\n\nSecond, we took aggressive steps to ease monetary policy in order to support economic activity and employment. By the end of 2008 we reduced short-term interest rates to virtually zero—the lowest level in the history of the Fed. In order to provide still further support for the economy, we bought more than $1.5 trillion of long-term assets—principally mortgage bonds guaranteed by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac with the support of U.S. Treasury—between December 2008 and March 2010.\n\nWhen the Fed buys long-term assets, it pushes down long-term interest rates. This supports economic activity in a number of ways, including by making housing more affordable and boosting consumption in households that can refinance their mortgages at lower rates. In addition, low long-term rates reduce the cost of capital for businesses, thereby fostering more hiring and investment spending (on equipment, construction and machinery, for example) for any given economic outlook.\n\nNational Economic Conditions\nSo where are we today? Let me start my discussion of economic conditions with a few comments about national economic conditions.\nAs I discussed in a recent speech, the Great Recession has been followed by a tepid recovery. Since June 2009, economic activity has grown—but not robustly.\n\nIn recent months, the momentum has slowed. After rising at a 3.25 percent annual rate during the second half of 2009, real gross domestic product growth has slowed. With demand growth barely keeping pace with firms' ability to increase productivity, job creation has been too weak to significantly reduce unemployment, which stands today at 9.6 percent. And, as is typical in such circumstances of considerable slack, the rate of inflation has declined.\n\nWhy are we experiencing this soft patch now? There are several reasons:\n\nThe slow recovery of consumer spending and housing in the face of very substantial monetary and fiscal stimulus reflects the painful unwinding of the dynamics at work during the expansion that preceded it. Beginning around 2003, underwriting standards for residential mortgages were significantly relaxed, leading to a sharp rise in household borrowing and in home prices. The rise in home prices helped support more borrowing as households used lines of credit and second mortgages to tap into their rising home equity. This also fueled a strong boom in home construction. But house price increases could not be sustained without limit. When home prices peaked and started to turn down, the dynamic linking house prices, credit and consumption went into reverse.\n\nLet's consider first what this means for consumption. Consumption of goods and services rose at a slow 2 percent annual rate over the first half of 2010 and with no sign of a rebound. Several factors are inhibiting families from spending, including: job or income losses, low confidence and declines in wealth as real estate and stock prices dipped. Households have been saving more and paying down their debts. Of course, lenders have also reinforced this tendency with tightened underwriting for credit relative to prerecession standards. Have households completed their deleveraging, so they will soon spend more? Although we believe that substantial progress has been made, it is hard to tell how much further this process has to run.\n\nNow, let's consider why housing market activity—both new construction and sales—remains depressed. One reason for this is that many existing homes stand vacant. We estimate that there are roughly 3 million vacant housing units more than usual. This stock of vacant homes will shrink when foreclosures fall and more empty homes are sold or rented out.\n\nOn the sales side, even though low mortgage interest rates and falling home prices have together boosted housing affordability to its highest level in 40 years, the current pace of sales is quite sluggish. Impediments to home sales include tight lending standards, a weak job market and continued uncertainty about home prices. Importantly, the large drop in home prices between 2006 and 2008 also reduced homeowner equity broadly, making it more difficult to \"trade-up\" and move into better homes.\n\nWith lower home prices, many families now owe more on their mortgages than their homes are worth. This means that they cannot refinance or sell their homes easily if they experience a crisis such as a job loss or a serious illness. Foreclosure completions are at an all-time high, although the initiation of new foreclosures may be finally slowing. Recently, attention has focused on cases where some of the documentation used in the foreclosure process may have been flawed. The Fed actively encourages efforts to find viable alternatives to foreclosure. Not many people know this, but a team of New York Fed officials work with mortgage counselors and community activists to support distressed homeowners, and our lawyers support legal aid programs for people facing foreclosure. At the same time, it is important that foreclosures that comply with the law can ultimately take place. This is a necessary part of returning the housing market to more normal conditions.\n\nAlong with two other agencies, the Fed is reviewing the foreclosure practices at the major bank mortgage servicers. We are also keeping an eye on banks' potential liabilities where they made representations about mortgages bought by investors that may not have been correct in all cases. We want to ensure that the housing finance business is supported by robust back-office operations—for processing of new mortgages as well as foreclosures—so that homebuyers and investors have full confidence in the process. We are monitoring developments closely in order to evaluate any potential impact on housing or financial markets and the overall economy.\n\nEconomic Conditions in Upstate New York\nNow let me turn to economic conditions in Upstate New York. It is no secret that this region has struggled with weak economic growth and population loss in recent decades. The region has experienced some very painful economic restructuring, particularly as it lost so many of its high- paying manufacturing jobs. Yet the process has yielded a productive and more diversified economy, with a larger service sector. For this and other reasons I will discuss, the Upstate New York economy has weathered the Great Recession relatively well.\n\nWhile the Upstate economy generally underperformed the nation during the 1980s and 1990s, its recent experience has been quite different. During the Great Recession, Upstate New York's job losses began later than they did for the United States as a whole, and those losses were generally less severe.\n\nThe relatively strong economic performance of the region of late is clearly tied to its stable housing markets. Upstate New York's relatively slow economic performance and lack of population growth during the expansion in the 2000s supported only modest increases in home prices and sales during the housing boom. When home prices and sales began to decline quite rapidly in many parts of the nation, they held steady across the region. As a result, Upstate New York has largely been spared the boom-and-bust cycle in housing that occurred in other parts of the country. In fact, many of Upstate New York's metropolitan areas even experienced home price appreciation during the housing bust, making these places among the best performing in the country during this period. Many parts of the country experienced severe housing busts, with sharp drops in housing-related activity (such as construction and purchases of major appliances). For example, in fast-growing places such as California and Florida, construction jobs grew to be a large share of employment, but the number of these jobs then plummeted during the recession. This dynamic did not occur in places like Ithaca, where the housing sector was small and thus, had few jobs to lose.\n\nAnother part of the story is that homeowners in Upstate New York did not take on as much debt, and households have been less strained here than elsewhere. One reason is that home prices did not appreciate rapidly here, so homes remained affordable. Moreover, there was generally lower penetration of risky nonprime loans into the region's housing markets. So, Upstate New York's home loans have generally performed better than elsewhere in the country, with fewer delinquencies and foreclosures. Indeed, much of the region was spared the worst effects of the nonprime mortgage boom and bust.\n\nThus, compared with other parts of the nation, the Upstate economy has performed well over the past few years. As a large and growing sector, local colleges and universities have surely contributed to the region's economic stability over the past few years. Indeed, Cornell provides a clear example of how a university can play a key role in its local economy. The benefits of the higher education industry go beyond their direct economic contributions, such as employment and spending, for a very important reason: they can increase a region's stock of human capital—that is, the total supply of knowledge and skills in its workforce.\n\nA region's human capital contributes to its economic success and resiliency. The educational activities of a region's colleges and universities help build the skills of the local workforce. In addition, the knowledge created by colleges and universities through research activities can play a key role in starting and supporting local businesses. Businesses can use university expertise, infrastructure and research findings to help them develop cutting edge products and services. Furthermore, universities often employ local businesses to develop and commercialize products that arise from their research activities. This dynamic can expand local economic activity and consequently create new jobs for high-skilled workers in a region.\n\nThese dynamics are clearly visible in Ithaca, where a large number of local companies—in industries ranging from information technology to medical equipment to agriculture—are closely tied to Cornell. Many of these companies were started by Cornell's faculty and students and have remained in the local economy to stay connected to the university. Other companies have been attracted to the region because of the access afforded to specific knowledge or new products and processes invented at Cornell. Higher education institutions such as Cornell play a vital role in upstate New York's economy.\n\nThe relative stability of the higher education industry has, not surprisingly, contributed to a strong economic performance in recent years. Ithaca's housing market is among the healthiest in the state, and it has experienced relatively strong employment growth during and since Great Recession. Indeed, unlike most of its Upstate peers, Ithaca has gained population throughout the past decade.\n\nWhat Is the Fed Doing Now?\nSince the beginning of the downturn, the Fed has actively used monetary and regulatory policy to help support economic activity and improve economic outcomes—here in Ithaca and across the nation—relative to what would have happened in the absence of this support.\n\nWith regard to monetary policy, the Fed has in place a highly accommodative stance. The FOMC has said that it will keep short term interest rates at exceptionally low levels for an extended period of time. The Fed also retains large amounts of mortgage-backed bonds acquired in order to support the housing market and help bring down mortgage and other long-term interest rates to the historically low rates in place today.\n\nThe FOMC and the Chairman have stated their commitment to take further actions to bring interest rates down further should economic conditions warrant. In a recent speech, I said that both the current levels of unemployment and inflation and the timeframe over which they are likely to return to levels consistent with our mandate are unacceptable. I said that I thought further Fed action was likely to be warranted unless the economic outlook were to evolve in a way that made me more confident we would see better outcomes for both employment and inflation before too long.\n\nTurning to regulatory policy, the biggest lesson of the financial crisis is that severe financial disruptions can inflict very large and persistent costs on people's lives and jobs. Over the past year, with Fed leadership and support, important new regulatory initiatives have been advanced to create a global financial system where the players cannot slide back into the risky \"business as usual\" that created this crisis. These include the recent agreement with international bank regulators (sometimes called \"Basel III\") to impose stricter standards for globally active banks and the considerable regulatory changes embodied in the Dodd-Frank Act.\n\nThese measures recognize that to avert or contain future financial crises, we need a financial system that can withstand large negative shocks. First, market participants must not have incentives to take excessive risks. Instead, incentives should reward actions that support economic growth and financial stability. And financial firms must set aside enough capital and liquidity so that when things go wrong they can absorb losses with their own resources. Finally, if these buffers prove inadequate and a financial firm veers toward failure, the official sector needs the tools to wind them down in an orderly manner without having to make the terrible choice between a chaotic failure that harms the whole economy and a taxpayer-funded rescue.\n\nConclusion\nI appreciate the opportunity to talk to you about how my job at the New York Fed ties in with your lives and work here in Upstate New York. The links are many, including\n\nTo summarize conditions at the moment: after a recession that was milder in Upstate New York than in many parts of the country, the region is showing signs of a modest recovery. A more diversified, more knowledge-based economy and a relatively small housing sector helped to limit the recession's impact on many communities. Nevertheless, the Great Recession spread much pain throughout this region and unemployment remains much higher than we would like.\n\nThe Fed cannot wave a magic wand and make the problems remaining from the preceding period of excess vanish immediately. But we can provide essential support for the needed adjustments. Even with our best efforts, the road to full recovery here in Upstate New York and across the nation is likely to be long and bumpy. But I am confident that we will make it. And, the dynamism that is represented in this room—the private sector combined with academic learning and research—will provide a strong underpinning for future prosperity."

        "content": "National Economic Conditions\nTo provide context, let me start with a few comments about national economic conditions. As I discussed in a recent speech, the long and deep recession that ended in June 2009 has been followed by a very tepid recovery. Since June 2009, economic activity has grown—but only slowly from levels far below the productive capacity of the economy.\n\nIn recent months, the momentum of the recovery has slowed. For example, after rising at a 3.25 percent annual rate during the second half of 2009, there has been a progressive slowing—to a 2.75 percent annual rate during the first half of 2010 and, most likely, to an even slower rate when the third-quarter real gross domestic product (GDP) figures are released at the end of this month.\n\nWith demand growth barely keeping pace with firms' ability to increase productivity, job creation has been too weak to significantly reduce unemployment, which stands today at 9.6 percent. And, as is typical in such circumstances of considerable slack, the rate of inflation has declined.\n\nViewed through the lens of the Federal Reserve's dual mandate—the pursuit of the highest level of employment consistent with price stability, the current situation is wholly unsatisfactory. Given the outlook that the upturn appears likely to strengthen only gradually, it will likely be several years before employment and inflation return to levels consistent with the Federal Reserve's dual mandate.\n\nWhy are we experiencing this soft patch now? There are several reasons:\n\nInstead, we have ongoing sluggishness in two key sectors that have led past recoveries: consumer spending and housing.\n\nThe slow recovery of consumer spending and housing in the face of very substantial monetary and fiscal stimulus reflects the painful unwinding of the dynamics at work during the expansion that preceded it. Beginning around 2003, underwriting standards for residential mortgages were significantly relaxed, leading to a sharp rise in household borrowing and in home prices. The rise in home prices helped to support additional demand for credit as households used the collateral represented by their homes to borrow large sums of money via home equity lines of credit and second mortgages. This also fueled a strong boom in home construction. But house price increases could not be sustained without limit. When home prices peaked and started to turn down, the dynamic linking house prices, credit and consumption went into reverse, forcing substantial adjustments on the part of the household sector and in the housing market itself.\n\nI've discussed in recent speeches the role monetary and regulatory policy can play in helping to support economic activity and in improving economic outcomes relative to what would otherwise be experienced in the absence of this support. These steps include critical reforms that make the financial system safer and accommodative monetary policy that make mortgages more affordable and make the investments that create jobs are more attractive. Today I will focus on the economic trends themselves.\n\nLet's consider first the consequences of this dynamic for consumer spending—that is, households' purchases of goods and services. Families' expenditures rose at a slow 2 percent annual rate over the first half of 2010 and (so far) this sluggishness appears to have continued in the third quarter of 2010. Families have not yet boosted their spending above the levels preceding the severe cuts they made during the recession. This frugality stands in stark contrast to the first year of recovery from previous deep recessions. Several factors are inhibiting families from spending. Many people have lost their jobs and are still unemployed, or have had their hours or pay reduced. Confidence in the economy remains quite low. And households' net worth, which fell substantially as real estate and stock prices dipped, remains well below its previous peak compared with disposable income. So, households have been saving more. The personal saving rate, which rose to 5.5 percent by the end of 2009 from a recent low of 1.2 percent in the third quarter of 2005, seems headed even higher in the third quarter. Households are \"deleveraging\"; they are paying down their debts. Of course, lenders have also reinforced this tendency as they have tightened underwriting standards for consumer credit, relative to their pre-recession standards.\n\nHave households completed their deleveraging, so they will soon spend more? Although we believe that substantial progress has been made, it is hard to tell how much further this process has to run. For example, the share of household after-tax income that families owe for servicing debts and paying for housing (including property taxes, homeowners insurance and rents) has declined sharply over the past two years and is now back to levels last seen in the late 1990s. Households have cut the total amount of debt they owe. They are also refinancing outstanding debt to take advantage of the lowest mortgage interest rates since the mid 1950s. We expect the increased rate of mortgage refinancing now in place to continue over the near term. This represents another means by which households can free up income for other uses.\n\nNow, let's consider the slow housing recovery. Housing market activity—both new construction and sales—remains depressed. On the construction side, total housing starts are running at just 600,000 units per year (seasonally-adjusted) in recent months. This is up from 530,000 units at the trough in the first quarter of 2009 but it is still extremely low by the standards of the last 50 years. In fact, the rate of new construction is so low that there is barely any net growth in the U.S. housing stock these days.\n\nOne reason why so little housing is being built is that many existing homes stand vacant. We estimate that there are roughly 3 million vacant housing units more than usual. And more vacancies are added daily as the foreclosure process moves homes from families to mortgage lenders. This stock of vacant homes will shrink when fewer are foreclosed upon and more of these homes are sold or rented out.\n\nOn the sales side, even though low mortgage interest rates and falling home prices have together boosted housing affordability to its highest level in 40 years, the current pace of sales is quite sluggish. Impediments to home sales include tight lending standards, a weak job market and continued uncertainty regarding the future path of home prices. The large decline in home prices that occurred between 2006 and 2008 is also important. This decline reduced the amount of equity that owners have in their homes, making it difficult for people to come up with the funds needed to \"trade-up\" and move into better homes.\n\nIn addition, the steep decline in home prices put many families at risk of mortgage delinquency and, ultimately, losing their homes to foreclosure. With lower home prices, many families now owe more on their mortgage than their home is worth. This means that they cannot refinance or sell their homes easily if they experience a financial crisis, such as a job loss or a serious illness. Recent developments on foreclosures have been mixed. While RealtyTrac reports that foreclosure completions in the United States exceeded 100,000 for the first time in September, it is important to remember that foreclosure is a lengthy process in most states. Our data indicate that, in recent quarters, borrowers are becoming less likely to fall behind on their mortgages, so fewer households are now entering the foreclosure process. At the same time, though, major lenders have acknowledged serious problems in the processes they have used to repossess homes and announced moratoria on new foreclosures. Taken together, these developments suggest that the situation in housing remains uncertain for the foreseeable future.\n\nThe Federal Reserve actively encourages efforts to find viable alternatives to foreclosure, like loan modifications, or deeds in lieu. We also support due process and access to legal counsel for homeowners facing foreclosure, for instance through legal aid programs. At the same time, it is important that foreclosures that properly comply with state and federal law can ultimately take place, as this is a necessary part of the adjustment that will eventually return us to more normal conditions in the housing market.\n\nAt present, the extent of the documentation problem and its wider ramifications are still uncertain. In conjunction with the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Federal Reserve is therefore seeking to establish the facts through a review of the foreclosure practices, governance and documentation at the major bank mortgage servicers. We want to ensure that the housing finance business is supported by robust back-office operations—for processing of new mortgages as well as foreclosures— so that buyers of homes and investors in mortgage securities have full confidence in the process. We are monitoring developments closely in order to evaluate any potential impact on the housing market, financial institutions and the overall economy.\n\nThe key role that housing has played during this recession and recovery makes it a timely topic for our regional economic briefing.\n\nRegional Economic Conditions (update since the July regional press briefing)\nNow, let me turn to regional economic conditions. Overall, the recession seems to have been less severe in much of our region than in many other parts of the country, though unemployment remains unacceptably high.\n\nAs attendees at previous Regional Press Briefings may recall, the New York Fed produces Coincident Economic Indicators to help track the performance of the regional economy. Since July, these indicators point to recovery in New York State, and particularly in New York City.\n\nAlthough New York City and New York State are recovering, elsewhere in the region, the story is different. In New Jersey, although activity is no longer declining, there has yet to be a sustained recovery. New Jersey's economy remains essentially flat. An index produced in Puerto Rico by the Government Development Bank shows that the pickup in economic activity there in late spring and early summer has retreated and activity in the past few months has again turned down.\n\nNow, let's look at jobs, which are the key for people to truly feel the recovery in their lives. I am pleased to note that private-sector jobs have continued to grow moderately across much of the region in the past few months, just as they have in the nation. Growth in private-sector jobs—which is not affected directly by hires and layoffs from the decennial census—signals that, on balance, firms are expanding their workforces to meet their business needs. While state and local government job cuts have also reduced total employment, the fact that the private sector is creating jobs is a good sign and necessary for a sustainable recovery.\n\nThe number of private-sector jobs has increased in and around New York City, in northern New Jersey and in some parts of Upstate New York. The latest job market report for New York shows a continuation of the generally rising trend of employment in the state at a pace that roughly matches the nationwide growth rate. In New York City, employment has expanded at rates substantially above the nation. Since we last met, employment in New Jersey has expanded, and while that growth has been quite modest, it is an encouraging sign. In Puerto Rico, employment reports continue to give mixed signals, showing a see-saw pattern that has yet to add up to a strong rebound.\n\nDespite these employment gains, unemployment in the region remains painfully high. In August, New York City's and New Jersey's rates were very close to the national jobless rate of 9.6 percent. The rate for New York State, which has been improving since the first quarter, is noticeably lower at 8.3 percent. Puerto Rico, which has had much higher unemployment than the mainland for the past several decades, saw a modest decline in its jobless rate, but at 15.6 percent is still showing little evidence of a recovery.\n\nRegional Housing Trends in New York and New Jersey\nWe focus on housing at today's briefing because it represents the most important asset that many households own, provides a substantial number of high-wage jobs and is often a key driver of regional as well as national business cycles.\n\nI'll start with a key observation: During this recession, the housing sector contributed less volatility to the regional economy than it did in much of the nation. We have, of course, seen painful losses of homes, construction jobs and housing equity in New York and northern New Jersey. This pattern can be seen quite directly in the construction sector, where many jobs were created during the housing boom, but then were lost as the housing market deteriorated. However, our housing markets tend to be less influential in our economy because we are a relatively mature region. That is, we are not adding population as rapidly as some other parts of the country, so housing construction—which tends to be very cyclical—and associated purchases account for a smaller share of aggregate activity here than it does in faster growing regions.\n\nIn addition, much of our region was spared the worst effects of the non-prime mortgage boom and bust. There was generally lower penetration of nonprime loans into our housing markets, and in general, our region shows better performance, with fewer delinquencies and foreclosures. This pattern was particularly true across Upstate New York. However, as can be seen on the New York Fed's U.S. Credit Conditions maps, there are significant pockets of housing distress around the greater New York City metro area, especially in communities in the Bronx, Dutchess County and Long Island. Indeed, we recently documented the severity of problems on Long Island in our Facts and Trends publication. Moreover, New Jersey had non-prime mortgage activity closer to the national average and now has more delinquencies and foreclosures than is the case for much of the region.\n\nAs the uneven pattern of nonprime lending suggests, the region is hardly uniform. The housing section fared better in Upstate New York than it did in much of the region during the recession. In fact, the housing boom and bust largely bypassed Upstate New York, where construction activity is a relatively small part of the overall economy.\n\nRelative to Upstate New York, most areas in downstate New York and northern New Jersey more closely tracked the national cycle. Sales activity and home prices ramped up during the housing boom, but then dropped sharply.\n\nMore recently—over the past year—home sales and prices in the region have followed different paths. Home prices have generally stabilized across upstate New York, with some parts, such as Buffalo, Rochester and Syracuse, even experiencing price increases over this period. However, home prices have continued to decline in the greater New York and New Jersey area. By contrast, the number of home sales have generally increased throughout the region over the past year. But the pattern has been erratic because of various policy changes. In particular, the introduction, initial expiration and subsequent extension of the home buyer tax credit introduced volatility as it boosted, slowed and then boosted sales again. With the final expiration of this tax credit, the recent rise in home sales across New York and northern New Jersey may well be short-lived.\n\nRegional Housing Trends: Focus on New York City\n\nI'll end with a few remarks about New York City's housing market—a very large market that stands out as unique in many respects.\n\nLet me remind you of some of these key differences:\n\nSo, how did the economic expansion and contraction affect New York City's housing market? For a mature city, the city saw an unusually strong boom in housing sales, construction and prices. This expansion actually began in 1996 and continued even in the aftermath of the 9/11 attack. Since 2007, however, New York City's market has turned down. This decline started later than the nation's and prices have fallen less sharply. Now, prices appear to have stabilized.\n\nThis pattern can also be seen in Manhattan's rental market. After a long period of rising rents, the market weakened substantially from 2007 to 2009, and rents have rebounded moderately in 2010.\n\nNew York City has not been spared from the high rates of mortgage delinquencies characteristic of this recession. Manhattan's delinquency rates are elevated although they remain markedly below the national average. By contrast, pockets of distress are much more prevalent in the outer boroughs, all of which have delinquency rates, per owner-occupied unit, above the national average.\n\nThe relatively mild recession and the recovery in the City are lending support to both home prices and sales. Also positive, compared with the rest of the country, are the City's low mortgage leverage rates and a low share of homes with underwater mortgages.\n\nNevertheless, several risks to home prices in the City remain. These risks include the ongoing completion of a considerable number of new apartment buildings—ones that were started at the end of the boom. Another risk comes from the slow pace of job growth in high-pay sectors (including the securities industry) in New York City. Finally, during the boom, prices rose substantially faster than rents. Going forward, this disparity could exert downward pressure on home prices as renting has become a more affordable alternative.\n\nConclusion\nIn sum, after a recession that was milder than in many parts of the country, the region is showing signs of a modest recovery in New York, but little growth elsewhere. The housing sector played a pivotal role in the recent national downturn. In the region, the fact that housing activity has a smaller weight in the regional economy helped to limit the recession's impact on many communities. Going forward, given housing's significance to the well-being of people in our region and beyond, the New York Fed will continue to focus on the sector as we monitor regional and national economic conditions.\n\nThank you for your kind attention. I will now ask James Orr to provide more details on current regional economic conditions."

        "content": "Today I want to discuss some of these initiatives, with a special focus on the recent agreement in Basel on capital and liquidity for large, internationally active banks. I will give my perspective on how these efforts have been informed by the lessons of the financial crisis and discuss what some of the likely consequences may be as these measures are put in place. Given the breadth of the changes, my remarks will be by no means complete. As always, my remarks reflect my own views and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System.\n\nThe biggest lesson of the financial crisis is that severe financial disruptions can inflict very large and persistent costs on real economic activity and employment. Thus, lawmakers and regulators must make widespread changes to create a more resilient and robust global financial system. But, at the same time, this must be done in way that ensures the financial system retains sufficient dynamism so that it can allocate capital efficiently to support innovation and economic growth.\n\nThe crisis revealed a number of significant weaknesses in the global financial system. First, many leading financial institutions at the core of the system did not have enough high-quality capital to be able to retain access to private funding markets in the face of the large credit and mark-to-market losses. In particular, they often held grossly inadequate capital against their trading book exposures and the counterparty credit risk generated by activities such as their over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives business.\n\nSecond, individual firms and the system as a whole had inadequate liquidity buffers to withstand marketwide disruptions. Indeed, there was widespread overreliance on short-term funding to finance long-term illiquid assets. This was especially evident among the major securities dealers, which depended on tri-party repo funding to finance much of their securities inventories, and in the so-called shadow banking system, in which entities such as structured investment vehicles and conduits were dependent on short-term funding to finance their long-term assets. Banks that had provided liquidity guarantees to these shadow banks were in turn exposed to runs on those entities.\n\nThird, a lack of transparency exacerbated uncertainty about the creditworthiness of many institutions. Some of this was due to the complexity of the assets—collateralized debt obligations (CDOs), in particular, were very hard to value even in normal times. But, some of this was also due to the lack of transparency about certain markets—the OTC derivatives market for credit default swaps is one notable example.\n\nFourth, an inappropriate structure of incentives encouraged excessive risk-taking. This was evident within firms in the form of “the trader’s option,” in which compensation was based mainly on fiscal year results with no clawback when mark-to-market profits on illiquid securities and other assets turned into losses. It was also evident in the ability of the largest firms to benefit in terms of their funding costs via a perception that they would be “too big to fail.”\n\nFifth, regulators and market participants did not appreciate how the financial system was interconnected so that shocks were transmitted broadly through the financial system, often intensifying rather than dampening as they spread.\n\nThe severe economic costs generated by the crisis indicate that the primary goal must be to reduce the likelihood and the severity of future financial crises. To accomplish this, we need a financial system that is better suited to withstand shocks of all kinds, regardless of their source. We need a financial system in which market participants face the appropriate set of economic incentives so that they do not take excessive risks, but instead behave in ways that generate outcomes that are supportive to economic growth and ongoing financial stability. This requires financial institutions to internalize the costs of their risk-taking activities up front and to hold capital and liquidity buffers sufficient to handle a plausible range of adverse outcomes. Finally, on occasions when these buffers prove inadequate and a financial firm does reach the brink of failure, the official sector needs the capacity to smoothly wind down such firms so that future taxpayer-funded rescues prove unnecessary.\n\nRegulatory and supervisory efforts to accomplish these goals are proceeding down several distinct but related paths:\n\nTurning first to the Basel III capital and liquidity standards agreed upon by the Governors and Heads of Supervision Committee (GHOS) in Basel last month, I believe these standards address some of the major shortcomings revealed by the crisis. In particular, the new standards will require banking organizations to significantly increase the amount of high-quality, loss-absorbing capital that they hold; significantly improve risk capture in trading, counterparty credit, securitization and other activities that the prior regulatory capital requirements did not adequately capture; make it more expensive for banks to provide liquidity guarantees to shadow banks; constrain the leverage that banking companies can take by introducing a credible, non-risk-based backstop; and increase the capacity of banks to absorb shocks that might temporarily impede their ability to access short-term funding markets. While these changes apply directly only to large internationally active banks, they will have wider ramifications for the financial system as a whole, including nonbanks and the capital markets.\n\nFurthermore, I believe that the agreement achieves an appropriate balance between significantly increasing the minimum capital and liquidity requirements for the major banks, while doing so in a way that recognizes the current state of the global economy and that seeks to minimize adjustment costs. The international regulatory community consciously has been willing to trade off a relatively slow phase-in period for the new standards in order to reach a much higher level of standards.\n\nThe new capital rules are intended to provide strong incentives for banks to change their business models in ways that make the system more stable and reduce the negative impact their actions have on others—for instance, by providing incentives to standardize OTC derivatives contracts and clear such standardized trades through central counterparties. To understand what these new requirements mean for the amount of capital banks will ultimately have to hold, it is important to note that one of the intended consequences of these changes is for banks to adjust their business models in ways that reduce the risks their activities generate. This adjustment will likely reduce the amount of extra capital that banks would need relative to a world in which they kept their business models unchanged even as the new rules were phased in. In other words, the impact on banks must be evaluated dynamically, not by taking a snapshot of the banks’ activities and balance sheets today.\n\nThat said, the new capital standards are much tougher than the existing regime. The requirements have been strengthened in several different dimensions. First, the standards emphasize common equity by creating an explicit quantitative capital standard for this highest form of capital, as compared with an implicit qualitative standard under the previous rules. This is important because the crisis demonstrated that bank investors and debt holders have a strong presumption that only common equity is truly loss absorbing outside bankruptcy. In the crisis, as losses climbed, Tier 1 capital ratios were eroded from the bottom, with tangible common equity ratios sometimes shrinking to levels that raised questions about a bank’s viability and its ability to access the equity and debt markets. Although common equity is typically a higher-cost form of capital for banks, it absorbs losses on a going-concern basis and so preserves an institution's viability in the eyes of the market much better than other forms of Tier I capital, such as perpetual preferred stock or trust preferred securities (TRUPS).\n\nSecond, the standards create a new definition of what constitutes common equity. The emphasis is on the ability of common equity to be loss absorbing. For that reason, there are limits on the amount of the assets that are not readily saleable or loss absorbing that can be counted toward a bank’s tangible common equity. These include assets such as mortgage servicing rights and deferred tax assets. Also, there is strict treatment of equity tied up in the form of minority interests. That is because this invested equity is not immediately available to the parent company to absorb losses in that company’s operations.\n\nThird, the minimum required ratio of total tangible common equity to risk-weighted assets will be increased significantly. Once the new standards are fully phased in, it will have to equal 4.5 percent of risk-weighted assets.\n\nFourth, the measure of risk-weighted assets—the denominator of the capital adequacy ratio—is constructed to better capture the risks that banks are taking in their activities. For example, the risks weights on trading account assets and for counterparty exposures have been increased substantially to reflect the lessons of the crisis. Note that due to better capture of the underlying risks, at least initially, aggregate risk-weighted assets in the system are likely to increase. This is not because the inherent riskiness of bank balance sheets has increased, but rather because that riskiness will be better captured.\n\nIn addition to the 4.5 percent minimum common equity standard, there is also a new capital conservation buffer requirement equal to 2.5 percent of risk-weighted assets. If a bank were to incur losses and fall deeper and deeper into this buffer, increasingly tough limitations would come into play in terms of the bank’s ability to make capital distributions by paying dividends or buying back shares. This capital conservation buffer is designed to forestall the type of behavior that we saw during the crisis—banks continuing to dissipate capital by paying out dividends in order to demonstrate that they were strong. Instead, banks will have an incentive to raise additional equity to exit the buffer and its restrictions on distributions.\n\nIn order to maintain operational flexibility in terms of their business operations and an ongoing ability to distribute capital to their shareholders, we expect that banks will want to maintain their level of tangible common equity at or above 7 percent, the sum of the minimum requirement and the conservation buffer. However, we do anticipate that the buffer may be penetrated from time to time during adverse economic environments.\n\nFinally, the risk-based ratios will be back-stopped by a new leverage ratio standard, which will constrain the amount of overall leverage that a banking organization can take relative to the sum of its non-risk-weighted assets and off-balance-sheet exposures.\n\nTogether, these changes represent a very significant upgrade of the standards: A much higher proportion of this ratio is now met by common equity; that common equity is much better quality than before; the amount of risk-weighted assets against which capital must be held has increased and better reflects underlying risk; a new capital conservation buffer is added, and there is a new backstop against excessive leverage.\n\nSo what were the considerations that went into constructing this new standard? The basic goal was to enable the big, internationally active banks covered by the Basel Accord to absorb the type of losses associated with a major marketwide financial shock and still retain sufficient market confidence so that they could continue to be able to fund themselves and, if necessary, to raise additional equity without the need for unusual government support.\n\nI believe that the requirements were the outgrowth of at least four major considerations:\n\n1. What type of losses could banks expect to occur in a crisis? In other words, how thick a buffer was needed to absorb shocks? This is represented by the 2.5 percent capital conservation buffer. Although this is not thick enough to protect every bank in every crisis, it does create a loss-absorbing cushion so that banks will retain their ability to access the capital markets even after incurring significant losses.\n\n2. How much common equity must a bank hold to be viewed as viable by financial market participants? This is important because beyond a certain point banks lose their access to the capital markets, and this makes failure much more likely. The 4.5 percent minimum common equity requirement is set at a high enough level so that a bank operating above this level would very likely still be able to access the capital markets to replenish its capital base after large losses.\n\n3. What was achievable internationally? It is important to have international convergence in terms of standards. This is necessary to minimize competitive inequity and to avoid creating incentives for a race to the bottom. If standards differed markedly around the world, then the conversation would inevitably shift to “what will help my banks competitively” from “what levels of capital do we need to have a sound financial system.”\n\n4. What is the appropriate tradeoff between benefits and costs? There are diminishing returns in terms of the benefits of ever higher capital requirements. Setting the bar at too high a level would increase intermediation costs too much and drive activities offshore or into areas that are not as closely regulated. At some point, higher requirements would not make the financial system safer, just the regulated sector much smaller.\n\nOn this last point, some argue that the new standards are too severe. They argue that, in the short run, the higher standards could lead to a significant constraint in credit that could hurt the nascent economic expansion. And, they argue, in the long run, that the higher capital standards will inevitably drive up lending costs and that this will hurt economic performance. Although I believe the new standards do impose some real costs on the financial system in order to achieve real benefits, I believe that concerns over the costs are exaggerated.\n\nTurning first to the issue of the transition to the new regime, we cannot precisely predict the size of the adjustment costs as they will depend importantly on the strategies bank managers employ to meet the new requirements, and how bank investors respond to these actions. Nonetheless, I believe the transition is likely to be quite manageable for three reasons.\n\nFirst, many of the large U.S. banks already have large amounts of tangible common equity. In part, this represents the regulatory response during the crisis. The Supervisory Capital Assessment Program (SCAP) in 2009 required the large banks to have a capital buffer consistent with achieving a Tier I common ratio of 4 percent under a stress environment considerably worse than what was anticipated (or did, in fact, occur). Banks that fell short of this were forced to raise additional capital. On top of this, Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) repayment terms provided strong incentives for banks to issue common equity to repay the TARP preferred stock. In addition, several banks converted preferred stock into common equity. Roughly speaking, the 19 banks subject to the SCAP generated more than $100 billion of common equity via share issuance and $80 billion via conversion of preferred stock into common equity in 2009.\n\nSecond, as noted above, the standards are being phased in slowly. For example, in 2013, the tangible common equity standard will be only 3.5 percent. In 2013, there will be no conservation buffer requirement and banks will still get credit for items that will ultimately be deducted from common equity, such as deferred tax assets. The Federal Reserve, as the consolidated supervisor of the largest and most complex banking companies, does not expect these banks to meet the fully phased in standards today. Instead, the Federal Reserve will require firms to develop an adequate capital plan to meet the Basel III requirements as they become effective and will track progress toward meeting those plans over time.\n\nThird, banks have many ways they can adjust their business models to meet the new standards as they are phased in. Many of these changes can occur without any risk of disruption to the flow of credit to households and business. For instance, banks can sell non-strategic assets to investors and can modify their minority investments in non-consolidated interests.\nLow-quality legacy assets, such as subprime mortgage loans and second mortgages, will mature and run off. Risk-weighted assets will tend to fall as the economy recovers. Moreover, as banks book profits, deferred tax assets will shrink, reducing the magnitude of these future deductions from common equity.\n\nFinally, it is important to note the significant potential earnings power of large U.S. banks, which have historically tended to have higher rates of return on their average assets relative to many of their foreign counterparts. Banks that currently are short of the 2019 standard could retain these future earnings to build up their capital ratios. Equity analysts project that the 20 largest U.S. banks will earn more than $80 billion in 2010, and consensus estimates expect that figure will increase to around $110 billion in 2011. Of course, because these estimates are dependent on an economy that continues to recover, we need to be cautious about relying entirely on as-yet-unrealized earnings as the primary means to meet the higher capital standards.\n\nSo what about the long-run consequences? It would be prudent to assume that requiring banks to hold more capital and higher cost capital is likely to result in somewhat higher lending spreads. Bank managements will need to generate sufficient income to support the rate of return on equity at a sufficient high level so banks can continue to attract capital from investors.\n\nOf critical importance is whether the increase in lending spreads is likely to be large or not. Those who argue that the new capital standards will necessitate a large increase in lending spreads generally start with a rigid set of assumptions. These include: 1) Return on bank equity is unchanged; 2) the increase in bank equity does not affect funding costs; and 3) there is no change in the banks’ book of business or on banks’ ability and willingness to adjust other expenses, such as compensation.\n\nSuch rigid assumptions are unrealistic. This is particularly important because each assumption is likely to be wrong in the direction that reduces the impact on lending margins. First, the necessary return on equity that banks will have to generate to be able to attract capital will likely fall. Because banks with more capital should be safer and have less volatile earnings, investors should demand a lower return on equity than before.\n\nSecond, by increasing the soundness of banks, an increase in bank equity, everything else equal, should also reduce funding costs. Third, higher bank lending spreads almost certainly will push some activity into the capital markets, constraining the magnitude of the rise in total lending costs. Finally, banks may be forced via competitive pressures to lower their compensation levels. By cutting compensation costs, banks could have smaller lending margins and still earn sufficient profits to generate a level of returns necessary to attract capital. Given all the potential margins for adjustment, there are good reasons to expect that the increase in lending margins will actually turn out to be quite modest.\n\nAlthough any increase will be a real cost, this appears to be a necessary and appropriate price to pay for a much more resilient financial system. The cost represented by higher lending spreads has to be weighed against the benefits of a more robust and resilient banking system. Recent years have surely taught us that easy access to credit that is underpriced because it is not backed by sufficient capital is not a sustainable route to prosperity. Indeed, to the extent that tougher standards reduce the misallocation of resources in the real economy that often accompanies periods of financial excess, ensure more consistent access to finance over time and encourage investment by holding out the prospect of greater economic stability, the new standards could be consistent with a more rapid sustainable growth rate over the long run.\n\nTurning next to the new Basel liquidity requirement, the new standard will likely necessitate a significant adjustment in behavior for those banks that historically relied on short-term wholesale funding and those that had negligible buffers but instead had relied on the Federal Reserve and the Federal Home Loan Bank System to be their liquidity backstops. However, the transition costs are likely to be quite manageable because, as was the case for the capital standards, there are many margins available for adjustment.\n\nBefore I assess the transition costs of the liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) standard, a few words about what the LCR is intended to do and how it operates. The notion behind the LCR standard is that large, internationally active financial institutions should have a liquidity buffer that enables them to operate for 30 days in a stress environment without having to rely on government support, including central bank liquidity backstops. Banks would have to have sufficient liquid assets that they could sell to be able to meet outflows stemming from deposit withdrawals; bank debt that matures and is unable to be rolled over; and drawdowns from committed credit and liquidity facilities provided to financial firms and other entities. The size of the required liquidity buffer depends, in part, on the maturity of the bank’s assets and liabilities, the stickiness of its deposit liabilities, the amount of irrevocable liquidity backstops and composition of its assets.\n\nThe adjustment costs associated with the LCR standard should be low because, like capital, there are different, relatively low-cost ways to adjust to the standards. For example, because the liquidity buffer only needs to last for 30 days, a bank that extends the maturity of its short-term wholesale borrowing or its deposit liabilities by a month or two will find that this goes a long way in helping to meet this standard. Banks could also cut the level of their backstop liquidity lines and other commitments to financial firms. The standard assumes that such lines of credit can be fully drawn upon and thus, count as potential draws against the buffer.\n\nBecause the common international liquidity standards are relatively untested, regulators are implementing LCR with an “observation period.” What this means is that unanticipated and unintended consequences generated by the new liquidity standard will be closely scrutinized and, if necessary, adjustments will be made to the rules if undesirable effects become evident over time. For example, the tough requirements on backstop liquidity lines could potentially be modified if such rules generated unintended negative consequences for short-term corporate funding markets, such as the nonfinancial corporate commercial paper market.\n\nMoving on from the changes to capital and liquidity standards, I now want to discuss how firms, markets and the official sector deal with distress in the event that it does occur. Of paramount importance in making the financial system more robust is the need for a viable resolution mechanism for large, complex financial firms. The Dodd-Frank Act does this for the nonbank operations of systemically important U.S. financial firms by authorizing the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), under certain conditions, to establish a “bridge” bank to liquidate the troubled firm’s operations in an orderly manner. Any net outlays incurred by the FDIC in this process must be recovered by assessing levies on the financial industry.\n\nThis resolution process is beneficial because an orderly resolution prevents the type of catastrophic collapse that leads to widespread market disruption. And it does so in a way that taxpayer funds are not at risk. However, much work needs to be done so that market participants can understand how such resolutions would work in practice. In particular, there will be some uncertainty about the precise conditions that will trigger a resolution under Title II of DFA. Even after DFA, the alternative of a normal Bankruptcy Code filing remains. In fact, DFA requires an evaluation as to why a filing under the Bankruptcy Code is not appropriate. In addition, the Dodd-Frank resolution process is complex, requiring multiple steps.\n\nMoreover, the resolution regime in Title II of Dodd Frank could be very difficult to implement for complex, globally active firms. These banks operate in diverse legal regimes worldwide and it is very doubtful that DFA will apply to these banks’ operations outside the United States.\n\nOne approach to this problem would be to harmonize the diverse insolvency laws in the various jurisdictions in which globally active firms have significant operations. But achieving this objective will be hard and take many years at a minimum.\n\nThis is one reason to require additional loss-absorbing capacity for systemically important firms, most (if not all) of which tend to be complex global organizations. Such a surcharge would be a mechanism to reduce the probability of failure for such firms below that of smaller firms.\n\nA surcharge for systemically important financial institutions has two motivations. First, it compensates for the distortion created by the fact that a large financial firm may still be resolved differently than smaller firms and that this could conceivably, by being an orderly resolution process, reduce the costs imposed upon creditors. To the extent creditors see this as a benefit, this might enable large banks to retain some funding advantage over smaller firms not likely to be resolved in the same fashion. Second, it recognizes the large costs imposed on the broader financial system by the failure of systemically important banks.\n\nSuch an approach is being pursued both internationally and in the United States. The recent Governors and Heads of Supervision meeting in Basel, for example, endorsed additional loss-absorbing capacity for systemically important firms. Similarly, the Dodd-Frank Act provides that the Federal Reserve shall establish prudential standards for systemically important financial companies, including capital and liquidity standards that are “more stringent” than for other institutions that do not present systemic risk.\n\nStrengthening financial market infrastructures is another important initiative underway to make the financial system more resilient and robust. In this regard, there are two important strands of work underway. First, there is strong momentum both in the United States and abroad to require that standardized OTC derivative products be cleared through central counterparties (CCPs) and that the information associated with all OTC derivatives trades be reported to trade repositories, with this information then being available to regulators around the world.\n\nSecond, the Committee on Payment and Settlement Systems (CPSS) and the International Organization of Securities Commission (IOSCO) are undertaking a review of international standards for financial market infrastructures. This review will lead to a comprehensive set of recommendations as to what constitutes best practice with respect to the operations of financial market infrastructures. These recommendations will apply to a broad array of financial market infrastructures, including CCPs and trade repositories. The final report will be completed during the first half of 2011. The goal will be to have these standards endorsed by the Financial Stability Board and the G-20 leaders. With those endorsements, it should be possible to harden the recommendations into more substantial standards.\n\nIn all of the reforms that we are implementing it is important that we pay close attention to the shadow banking system. By shadow banks, I mean the largely unregulated financial entities that take credit risk and/or engage in maturity transformation without access to explicit governmental backstops such as the Federal Reserve’s discount window and or deposit insurance. As we saw in the crisis, without such support, these institutions are vulnerable to runs. When this occurred, the shadow banking sector imploded in a way that imposed significant costs on the regulated sector.\n\nThe risk is that tighter capital and liquidity requirements for the large financial institutions could push much of the business of credit intermediation and maturity transformation from the regulated sector to the unregulated sector. However, this risk is mitigated by the fact that shadow banks heavily rely on credit support and liquidity lines from the regulated sector. The costs of such facilities will be affected by the new capital and liquidity standards for banks. Thus, the economics of the shadow-banking sector are likely to change in a way that makes such activities less attractive. In addition, by increasing transparency and requiring some risk retention by issuers, Dodd-Frank should make the securitization markets in which shadow banks operate less likely to support poorly underwritten credit. Taken together, these changes mean it is less likely that there will be widespread movement of credit and maturity transformation from the regulated sector to the unregulated sector. Nonetheless, as my colleague Governor Tarullo noted in a recent speech,1 more will need to be done to increase the stability of the unregulated sector, and developments in this area will need to be scrutinized carefully in the years ahead.\n\nBefore closing, let me reiterate the importance to achieve harmonized global standards. As noted earlier, this is important for competitive equity reasons. But more importantly, it is necessary to ensure that banks and other financial firms cannot move their activities to evade regulation. If that were to occur, we would just have a race to the bottom and a less transparent and even more complex financial system.\n\nIn this respect, it is important that we regulate the U.S. operations of foreign banks in a way that is consistent with how U.S. banks are treated. It is also important that we work for the same type of national treatment abroad, and when there are differences in regulatory regimes, that we find ways of reducing or eliminating the substantive differences over time.\n\nFinally, it is important that we clarify the responsibilities of the home and host countries and work to better share information across the regulatory community. This can help ensure that regulatory decisions are made and applied in a consistent and fair manner. It is also my hope that by establishing a robust global regime, we can mitigate the incentives for national regulators and supervisors to impose local rules that make it hard for globally active institutions to manage their operations on a global basis, thereby undermining the global integration of markets that has supported economic globalization.\n\nOver the next 12 to 18 months, regulators will be particularly busy in implementing these reform efforts. Broad legal statutes now have to be turned into specific rules and regulations governing business practices, conduct and operations. Doing this well—in particular, in a way that is sufficiently informed, deep and broad—will be very important. Basel III and the Dodd-Frank Act are important markers on this road, but it will always be a journey to a never-reached destination of perfection.\n\nThank you for your kind attention. I would be happy to take a few questions.\n\n__________________________________________\n\n1 Governor Daniel K.

        "content": "The evolution of the balance sheet going forward will depend on how the economic outlook unfolds. The current forecasts of FOMC members show the economy moving in the right direction, with a sustained recovery in GDP, a gradual reduction in the unemployment rate over time, and an increase in inflation towards the level that FOMC members see as desirable over the intermediate term. However, the anticipated recovery is relatively tepid and thus delivers only slow progress toward meeting the Federal Reserve's dual mandate. Indeed, according to their most recently published forecasts, most FOMC members expect the unemployment rate to remain above 8.25 percent through 2011 and the inflation rate to remain below its mandate-consistent level through 2012. In addition, the economy remains vulnerable to downside surprises that could take both output and inflation further away from the FOMC’s objectives.\n\nThe sluggish outlook for the economy and the risks that surround that outlook have raised the possibility of further monetary policy accommodation. The most recent FOMC statement indicated that the Committee \"is prepared to provide additional accommodation if needed to support the economic recovery and to return inflation, over time, to levels consistent with its mandate.\"\n\nThe FOMC has several policy tools that it could use to achieve more accommodative financial conditions, as Chairman Bernanke discussed in his speech at the Jackson Hole symposium in August. My remarks today will focus on one of those options—changing the size of the Federal Reserve's holdings of securities. In particular, I will review the FOMC’s recent decision to keep the size of those security holdings at their current level, and I will discuss some of the issues to be considered in any decision on whether to expand them further. As always, the views I express are my own and do not represent those of the FOMC or the Federal Reserve System.\n\nDecision to Reinvest Maturing Asset Holdings\nThe initial decisions by the FOMC to expand the Federal Reserve’s holdings of securities came at the height of the financial crisis. Before that time, the Federal Reserve maintained a relatively simple portfolio of between $700 billion and $800 billion of Treasury securities—an amount largely determined by the volume of dollar currency that was in circulation. In late November 2008, in the face of tightening financial conditions and a deep downturn in economic activity, the Federal Reserve announced that it would purchase up to $600 billion of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS). In March 2009, it expanded the program to include cumulative purchases of up to $1.75 trillion of agency debt, agency MBS, and longer-term Treasury securities. The use of the balance sheet in this manner was spurred in part by the inability to ease further using the traditional policy instrument, as the federal funds rate effectively reached the zero lower bound in late 2008.\n\nThe asset purchases were carried out from December 2008 through March 2010 by the Trading Desk (the Desk) at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, resulting in a significant expansion of the Federal Reserve’s portfolio. As the settlement of those purchases progressed, the amount of domestic securities held in the System Open Market Account (SOMA) reached a peak of $2.1 trillion in June 2010. From that point, the portfolio began to shrink because the agency debt and agency MBS held in the SOMA were being allowed to run off without reinvestment as they matured or were prepaid.\n\nAgainst that backdrop, an important policy decision regarding the Federal Reserve’s portfolio was made at the August FOMC meeting, when the Committee decided to halt this run-off and instead hold the size of the SOMA portfolio steady. To achieve this, the FOMC directed the Desk to purchase longer-term Treasury securities as needed to offset any principal payments realized on our holdings of agency debt and agency MBS.1\n\nThat was not just a symbolic policy decision, but instead involved a meaningful shift in the path of the balance sheet. At the time of the meeting, the Desk was projecting that about $340 billion of the Federal Reserve’s MBS holdings would be paid down from that time to the end of 2011. In addition, another $55 billion of agency debt holdings would mature over that period. Thus, the total portfolio was expected to shrink by nearly $400 billion by the end of 2011. The reinvestment decision therefore amounted to a sizable program to purchase longer-term Treasury securities.\n\nThe effect of asset purchases on the economy remains a point of ongoing debate, with some uncertainty about the channels through which such purchases operate and the magnitude of those effects. My own perspective is aligned with the view expressed by Chairman Bernanke in Jackson Hole—that the effects arise primarily through a portfolio balance channel.2 Under that view, our asset holdings keep longer-term interest rates lower than otherwise by reducing the aggregate amount of risk that the private markets have to bear. In particular, by purchasing longer-term securities, the Federal Reserve removes duration risk from the market, which should help to reduce the term premium that investors demand for holding longer-term securities. That effect should in turn boost other asset prices, as those investors displaced by the Fed’s purchases would likely seek to hold alternative types of securities.\n\nSome research studies have estimated that the effects of the earlier expansion of our securities holdings by just over $1.5 trillion lowered longer-term Treasury yields by about 50 basis points through this portfolio balance channel.3 These effects on Treasury yields appear to have been transmitted into lower rates on private credit instruments and higher asset prices more broadly.\n\nUnder this view, the FOMC’s influence on financial conditions is associated with the size and composition of its securities portfolio. This perspective provides a clear rationale for the reinvestment decision made at the August FOMC meeting. The decline in the size of the Federal Reserve’s portfolio that would have occurred in the absence of the reinvestment program would have amounted to a passive tightening in the stance of monetary policy, as the portfolio balance effect would have gradually reversed. Moreover, the extent of this tightening was increasing in response to the weakening of the economy, as lower longer-term yields were leading to more rapid repayment of MBS. This perverse effect was seen by the FOMC as working against its efforts to reach its dual mandate.\n\nIn effect, the policy approach that was implemented before the August meeting acted to mute the amplitude of movements in longer-term interest rates. As rates declined in response to a weakening of the economy, the Federal Reserve’s MBS holdings would decline more rapidly, effectively adding to the supply of duration held by the market.4 This increase in the duration held by the market would tend to damp the decline in yields. With the change in strategy at its August meeting, the FOMC no longer lets its aggregate duration holdings flow back into the market. This approach allows long-term interest rates to adjust fully to a weakening of the economy, which should act to better stabilize the economy.\n\nImplementing the Reinvestment Policy\nSo far, I have focused on the FOMC's August policy decision; however, you may also be interested in the details of how the Desk has actually implemented the reinvestment policy.\n\nThe instructions from the FOMC to the Desk, from both the August FOMC statement and the directive that was adopted at that meeting, were to keep the total face value of domestic securities held in the SOMA portfolio near their level at that time. The published size of the securities portfolio just ahead of the August meeting was $2.054 trillion, so the Desk adopted this level as the target for the portfolio. This is a notable development by itself, as the directive from the FOMC now involved two targeted variables—the target range for the federal funds rate, and the target size for its asset holdings.\n\nTo implement this directive, the Desk has been purchasing Treasury securities on a monthly schedule. In particular, we announce a plan around the middle of each month for the purchase operations to take place through the middle of the following month, once we know the principal repayments that will be received over that period.5 We are running at a pace of $27 billion in purchases this month, and we expect that pace to bump up to around $30 billion for the next several months. Looking further ahead, we currently project that the cumulative amount of principal payments on agency debt and agency MBS through 2011 will be somewhat higher than the estimates provided at the August FOMC meeting.\n\nI should note that the directive to the Desk is expressed in terms of the overall size of the portfolio. However, under the portfolio balance model described above, the effect on markets will be tied to the amount of duration risk that such purchases encompass. Thus, the composition of purchases across maturities will be quite important in governing the effects on financial conditions.\n\nThe strategy that the Desk has employed for the reinvestment program is to follow the pattern of purchases that was implemented in the earlier Treasury purchase program. The purchases will be concentrated in nominal Treasury securities with remaining maturities between 2 and 10 years, but with some purchases also occurring outside this segment. The average duration of the securities purchased is expected to be just over 5 years, although the exact realized outcome will depend on the offers that we receive in our operations. Under this approach, the purchases will remove a considerable amount of duration from the market relative to what the market would have held without reinvestments by the Federal Reserve.\n\nThe reinvestment strategy, of course, also involves a reallocation of our portfolio from agency debt and MBS into Treasury securities. The FOMC’s decision to reallocate was based on a variety of factors. However, one crucial consideration was whether purchasing Treasury securities would have an effect on longer-term interest rates comparable with that of purchasing MBS. My view was that the effects would be similar, because purchasing longer-term Treasury securities removes as much duration risk from the market as purchasing current-coupon MBS.6\n\nThe two approaches differ, however, in that purchasing MBS also removes prepayment risk from the market. If the market were to begin having trouble digesting that prepayment risk, the spread between MBS rates and Treasury yields could widen. A significant widening of MBS spreads to Treasuries, whether due to this or other factors, could affect policymakers’ decisions about which assets to purchase. The Chairman’s speech in Jackson Hole and the August FOMC minutes both indicated that reinvesting in MBS rather than Treasury securities might become desirable if market conditions were to change.\n\nBalance Sheet Expansion as a Policy Option\nAs you can see, the decision to simply keep the balance sheet unchanged involved a number of considerations and choices. Let me now turn to the possibility that the FOMC could go a step further and expand the balance sheet beyond its current levels.\n\nThis policy option has been the subject of intense focus among market participants. Chairman Bernanke has indicated that any decision about expanding the balance sheet would depend on the FOMC’s assessment of the costs and benefits involved. Of course, that assessment is difficult to calibrate. Federal Reserve Bank of New York President William Dudley discussed many of the relevant issues in his speech last Friday.7\n\nIn terms of the benefits, balance sheet expansion appears to push financial conditions in the right direction, in that it puts downward pressure on longer-term real interest rates and makes broader financial conditions more accommodative. One can reach that judgment based on the empirical evidence from the earlier round of asset purchases, as mentioned before. In addition, the market responses to more recent news about the balance sheet also lean in this direction. The market response to the reinvestment decision at the August FOMC meeting seemed largely in line with the estimated effects from the earlier round of asset purchases, once we account for the size of the surprise and the anticipatory pricing that occurred ahead of its announcement. And the increased expectations for balance sheet expansion in response to the September FOMC statement also generated a sizable market response.\n\nTo be sure, I think it is fair to say that this is an imperfect policy tool. Even under the estimates noted earlier, the Federal Reserve had to increase its securities holdings considerably to induce the estimated 50 basis point response of longer-term rates. In addition, there is a large degree of uncertainty surrounding the estimates of these effects, given our limited experience with this instrument. Lastly, it is reasonable to assume that the effects of balance sheet expansion would diminish at some point, especially if yields were to move to extremely low levels. Nevertheless, the tool appears to be working, and it is not clear that we have yet reached a point of diminishing effects.\n\nSome observers have argued that balance sheet changes, even if they influence longer-term interest rates, will not affect the economy because the transmission mechanism is broken. This point is overstated in my view. It is true that certain aspects of the transmission mechanism are clogged because of the credit constraints facing some households and businesses, and it is true that monetary policy cannot directly target those parties that are the most constrained. Nevertheless, balance sheet policy can still lower longer-term borrowing costs for many households and businesses, and it adds to household wealth by keeping asset prices higher than they otherwise would be. It seems highly unlikely that the economy is completely insensitive to borrowing costs and wealth, or to other changes in broad financial conditions.\n\nIn terms of the costs of balance sheet expansion, the assessment is perhaps even more complicated. I will not attempt a comprehensive discussion of all of the potential costs of balance sheet expansion, as that assessment falls to the FOMC. However, as manager of the SOMA, I will speak about two of the potential operational challenges involved—one associated with implementing additional asset purchases, and one associated with exiting from them.\n\nOn the implementation of a program, an important operational consideration is whether Federal Reserve purchases would strain the functioning of financial markets and cause an erosion of market liquidity. This consideration would be particularly relevant if the FOMC decided that a fairly sizable program was needed to have a meaningful effect on financial conditions and the economy. This issue was present during the first asset purchase program, especially when the pace of weekly purchases reached a peak of about $40 billion in the middle of last year. The pace of those purchases at times put pressure on liquidity in the MBS market, leading the Desk to take mitigating actions when possible.8\n\nIn the current circumstances, there would seem to be room for the Federal Reserve to expand its holdings of Treasury securities without creating difficulties for market functioning. The SOMA currently holds about 12 percent of the outstanding stock of Treasury coupon securities—a smaller share than it held before the financial crisis. Moreover, the supply of Treasury securities will remain ample, as the Treasury is expected to issue around $1.2 trillion of securities over the next year.\n\nAny purchase program that the FOMC decides upon, whether aimed at Treasury securities or MBS, would be designed to support market functioning as much as possible while still achieving the program’s economic objectives. The deep liquidity of these markets has considerable value to our economy, and we should take whatever steps possible to leave this liquidity intact.\n\nThe second operational challenge I mentioned comes at the other end of the program—the exit. In particular, it is important to consider whether balance sheet expansion would complicate the eventual exit of the Federal Reserve from its accommodative policy stance.\n\nI am confident that our ability to exit will not be compromised by any further expansion of the balance sheet. The exit strategy that is ultimately implemented will have to take into account the size and structure of the balance sheet at that time. However, in all potential circumstances the Federal Reserve should be able to tighten financial conditions to a sufficient degree when appropriate. The ability to pay interest on reserves, in combination with the ability to drain reserves as needed, will give us sufficient control of short-term interest rates. On that front, it is worth noting that both of the Fed’s reserve draining tools—the reverse repurchase program and the term deposit facility—are already operational, and their capacity to drain reserves will continue to expand. In addition, the Federal Reserve could always sell assets to reduce the size of its balance sheet if it desired.\n\nDesigning a Purchase Program\nIf the FOMC were to move forward with an expansion of the balance sheet, it would presumably want to take into consideration the perspective gained from the asset purchases conducted from late 2008 to early 2010. The FOMC would have to decide the extent to which a new purchase program would follow the approach from the earlier round of purchases.\n\nAn alternative approach would be to design a purchase program that shares more of the features of the FOMC’s adjustment of the federal funds rate in normal times. After all, adjustments to the balance sheet are in many respects a substitute for changes in the federal funds rate. Both instruments attempt to influence broader financial conditions in order to achieve a desired economic outcome. However, the way in which the FOMC implemented asset purchases differed in important ways from the manner in which it has historically adjusted the federal funds rate. With this contrast in mind, I raise a set of policy questions that could be considered in designing a purchase program.\n\nFirst, should the balance sheet be adjusted in relatively continuous but smaller steps, or in infrequent but large increments? The earlier round of asset purchases involved the latter approach, which caused the market response to be concentrated in several days on which significant announcements were made. That might have been appropriate in circumstances when substantial and front-loaded policy surprises had benefits, but different approaches may be warranted in other circumstances. Indeed, it contrasts with the manner in which the FOMC has historically adjusted the federal funds rate, which has typically involved incremental changes to the policy instrument.\n\nSecond, how responsive should the balance sheet be to economic conditions? Historically, the FOMC has determined the federal funds target rate based on the Committee’s assessment of the outlook for economic growth and inflation. If changes in the balance sheet are now acting as a substitute for changes in the federal funds rate, then one might expect balance sheet decisions to also be governed to a large extent by the evolution of the FOMC’s economic forecasts. The earlier purchase program, in contrast, did not demonstrate much responsiveness to changes in economic or financial conditions. Indeed, the execution of the program largely involved confirming the expectations that were put in place by the two early announcements.\n\nThird, how persistent should movements in the balance sheet be? An important feature of traditional monetary policy is that movements in the federal funds rate are not quickly reversed, which makes them more influential on broader financial conditions. A change that was expected to be transitory would instead move conditions very little. For similar reasons, one could argue that movements in the balance sheet should have some persistence in order to be more effective.\n\nFourth, to what extent should the FOMC communicate about the likely path of the balance sheet? The FOMC often communicates about the path of the federal funds rate or provides other forward-looking information that allows market participants to anticipate that path. This anticipation of policy actions is beneficial, as it brings forward their effects and thus helps to stabilize the economy. For the same reason, providing information about the likely course of the balance sheet could be desirable. In fact, such communication might be particularly important in the current circumstances, because financial market participants have no history from which to judge the FOMC’s approach and anticipate its actions.\n\nFifth, how much flexibility should the FOMC retain to change its policy approach? The original asset purchase programs specified the amount and distribution of purchases well in advance.9 However, the FOMC would be learning about the costs and benefits of its balance sheet changes as it implemented a new program. This might call for some flexibility to be incorporated into the program, providing some discretion to change course as market conditions evolve and as more is learned about the instrument.\n\nConclusion\nI hope that my remarks today have offered some insight into the recent balance sheet programs undertaken by the Federal Reserve. Adjustments to the size of the Federal Reserve’s securities holdings are a new policy instrument for the FOMC. That presents challenges, both to policymakers in terms of determining how to use the instrument and to market participants in terms of anticipating that usage and understanding its effects. Given these challenges, I believe it is important for the Federal Reserve to communicate effectively about the factors affecting its balance sheet decisions and the implementation of those decisions.\n\nIn my view, the evidence suggests that the expansion of the securities portfolio to date has helped to foster more accommodative financial conditions, and further expansion would likely provide additional accommodation. Of course, whether the FOMC decides to take such a step will be determined by its assessment of whether the benefits of additional policy stimulus outweigh the perceived costs of expanding the balance sheet."

        "content": "Viewed through the lens of the Federal Reserve’s dual mandate—the pursuit of the highest level of employment consistent with price stability, the current situation is wholly unsatisfactory. Given the outlook that the upturn appears likely to strengthen only gradually, it will likely be several years before employment and inflation return to levels consistent with the Federal Reserve’s dual mandate.\n\nToday, I will discuss why the recovery has been disappointing and highlight some of the issues facing the Federal Reserve and monetary policy, echoing some of the themes laid out by Chairman Bernanke in his Jackson Hole speech in late August. As always, what I am going to say reflects my own views and does not necessarily reflect the views of the Federal Open Market Committee and the Federal Reserve System.\n\nIn recent quarters the pace of growth has been disappointing even relative to our modest expectations at the start of the year. After rising at about a 3.25 percent annual rate during the second half of 2009, there has been a progressive slowing—to a 2.75 percent annual rate during the first half of the year and, very likely, to an even slower rate in the third quarter.\n\nThe factors responsible for the failure of the recovery to pick up speed include: (1) the gradual petering out of the contribution from the swing in inventories from rapid liquidation during the first half of 2009 to a modest increase in the second quarter of 2010; 2) the sluggish recovery in consumer spending; and 3) the continued weakness in housing. Normally, at this stage of recovery, the handoff from growth led by inventory accumulation to growth led by private final demand would have been more fully accomplished. This handoff has been delayed because households have been paying down their debts—a process known as deleveraging. In addition, many businesses have been reluctant to hire. This has limited income growth.  Slow income growth, and along with caution in the face of economic uncertainty, has also restrained spending.\n\nAlthough so-called “soft-patches” are quite common during the early stages of an economic expansion, this soft patch is a bit different. First, it looks like it will last somewhat longer because the deleveraging process is not yet complete. Second, the current weakness is somewhat more concerning because it is occurring at a time that the central bank has already cut interest rates to near zero.\n\nIn fact, this failure of the recovery to “catch fire” has occurred despite aggressive monetary and fiscal policy steps to stimulate the economy. On the monetary policy side, short-term interest rates have been nearly zero for a year and a half; the Fed purchased $1.7 trillion of long-term assets, and the proceeds from maturing securities are being reinvested to keep the balance sheet from shrinking unduly. On the fiscal side, a series of measures has provided support to a broad range of activities.\n\nThe sluggish nature of the recovery in the face of very substantial stimulus reflects the dynamics at work during the expansion that preceded it. Beginning around 2003, underwriting standards for residential mortgages were significantly relaxed, leading to a sharp rise in household borrowing and in home prices. The two trends were inextricably linked. The rise in home prices helped to support additional demand for credit as households used the collateral represented by their homes to borrow large sums of money via home equity lines of credit and second mortgages. Chart 1 illustrates how the growing proportion of nonprime first mortgage loans helped fuel the sharp rise in home prices.\n\nAs home prices rose and the stock market performed strongly, household net worth rose sharply. Households responded by borrowing more and saving less. After all, why save when the rise in home prices was adding to your wealth and the housing equity created by the rise in home prices could be easily tapped for funds as needed? The use of home equity as a source for funds to support consumption is evident in the fact that the homeowners’ equity as a share of home values was essentially flat over this period (Chart 2). This indicates that homeowners were borrowing against their accumulated gains. The surge in home prices pushed up the ratio of household net worth to disposable income to nearly 640 percent and the personal saving fell below 2 percent (Chart 3).\n\nThe surge in home prices was fueled by products and practices in the financial sector that led to a rapid and unsustainable buildup of leverage and an underpricing of risk during this period. These dynamics in turn provided the fuel that caused house prices and consumer spending to rise much faster than income. As shown in Chart 4, the share of GDP accounted for by consumption and residential investment climbed to a peak of 76 percent in 2005 from 71 percent in the mid-1990s.\n\nThe boom, of course, was unsustainable. The progressive easing of underwriting standards that was needed to support housing demand could only persist as long as housing prices were rising rapidly. But for home prices to rise rapidly, underwriting standards had to be progressively relaxed in order to generate more buyers. When home prices began to slip beginning in 2006, the dynamic swung into reverse. The collateral values supporting borrowing and spending began to fall.\n\nAs banks’ and other financial intermediaries’ credit losses began to mount, credit availability became impaired and this exacerbated the downward pressure on home prices and on borrowing and spending. Not only did households that had overextended themselves have to cut back; others also retrenched because they were also affected by declines in wealth and heightened uncertainty about the economic outlook and their job prospects.\n\nIt is not surprising that the workout from the excesses of this type of boom would take a long time. Just as it took several years for the boom to begin and run its course, so it would take years, not months, for households and financial intermediaries to adjust their balance sheets and behavior to the new environment. Households had to raise their saving rates in order to rebuild their balance sheets. Financial intermediaries had to replenish their capital to replace losses via loan charge-offs and other credit impairments. Both adjustments would need to occur before the economy could grow rapidly.\n\nWith this in mind, the key questions are: 1) Where are we in the adjustment process, and 2) what, if anything, can monetary policy do to facilitate a smoother adjustment and more rapid progress toward our dual mandate objectives?\n\nIn terms of the adjustment process, starting on the household side, most signs point to significant progress. For example, the revisions to the national income and product accounts announced in July revealed substantial upward revisions to the personal saving rate (Chart 5). The current saving rate is broadly consistent with the historical relationship between personal saving and the household net worth-to-income ratio. Of course, part of this story depends on the stabilization of household net worth, which had earlier fallen sharply due to declines in both home and equity prices. Although household net worth dropped significantly again in the second quarter according to the Flow of Funds accounts, the subsequent rise in the U.S. equity market is likely to have reversed that decline. Meanwhile, housing price declines have moderated substantially, helped, in part, by the fact that the low level of mortgage rates combined with the sharp drop in house prices has resulted in a substantial improvement in affordability (Chart 6).\n\nHouseholds have retrenched in terms of their borrowing and this has helped push down the household debt-to-income ratio sharply from its peak in 2007. Another factor behind the fall in the debt-to-income ratio has been credit losses and debt forgiveness. Since 2007, charge-offs have reduced household debt outstanding by over $880 billion.\n\nSome argue that the decline in the household debt-to-income ratio must go much further before the deleveraging process can be complete. After all, the household debt-to-income ratio is still far above the level reached as late as 2002, before the surge in household borrowing began. Some even argue that household debt-to-income ratios must fall back to the level of the 1980s. I think that this is an overly pessimistic view for a simple reason—both household debt and household financial assets have been rising faster than income growth on a secular basis since the 1950s. Focusing just on debt misses what is happening on the other side of the balance sheet (Chart 7). One reason why both household assets and debt have been rising faster than income is due to greater financial intermediation. For instance, tax incentives encourage people to fund their 401(K) pension plans rather than pay down mortgage debt as they get older.\n\nThe notion that the household adjustment process is well advanced is also supported by other data, as well. For example, the share of after-tax income devoted to servicing debts, as well as paying property taxes and homeowners insurance or rent, has declined sharply over the past two years and is now back to levels that prevailed in the late 1990s (Chart 8). In addition to the declining stock of debt, households have been able to refinance outstanding debt at lower interest rates.\n\nMoreover, mortgage delinquency rates, even in the most serious category, have started to fall, and data that tracks changes in the proportion of borrowers who are delinquent and then become current versus becoming even more delinquent is encouraging (Charts 9 and 10). Finally, the less serious delinquencies for credit card, auto and student loans have been trending lower, though not the more serious delinquencies (Chart 11). Of course, these recent improvements have come in the context of the stabilization in unemployment and house prices. To ensure that the more favorable trends in household balance sheets continue, the economic environment needs to become more supportive.\n\nWe should recognize that there is still considerable uncertainty about the level of the saving rate and configuration of household balance sheets that will prevail in the coming years. It is possible that households now perceive the world to be a riskier place than they did before and will want to have more “rainy day” funds. More saving may also be needed to meet higher downpayment requirements for home purchases. Thus, while we may be far along in the adjustment process, it is difficult to judge just how much further we have to go.\n\nTurning now to the issue of credit availability, there is no question that credit conditions are still tight. There are a number of impediments: 1) Financial institutions—many of which still face balance sheet problems of their own—have tightened underwriting standards and, 2) a decline in property prices has cut collateral values and made the refinancing of many residential and commercial mortgages difficult.\n\nOn the banking side, there is considerable differentiation across the industry in terms of health. The largest banks in the United States are generally in much improved health following the Supervisory Capital Assessment Program (SCAP) in 2009, which led to substantial additional equity raising. For smaller banks, the situation is more mixed. According to the FDIC, as of June 30, 2010, 829 of the nation’s 7,830 commercial banks and savings institutions remain on the FDIC’s problem institution list.\n\nBut overall, the situation is one in which credit availability is slowly improving. According to the Federal Reserve’s Senior Loan Officers Survey, the percentage of banks reporting that they were tightening credit standards across a wide range of lending categories peaked in late 2008. The most recent data indicate that virtually no banks are tightening standards, and a number of banks have begun to relax credit terms (Chart 12).\n\nIn addition to households, the small-business sector is another area that has seen a contraction in credit. Focus groups and surveys conducted by the Federal Reserve System suggest this contraction is the result of three distinct factors—a decline in demand for credit, a tightening of lending standards, and a weakening of credit quality due to lower collateral values and cash flows.1 Which is the most important is difficult to discern.\n\nHowever, surveys of small-business owners indicate that much of the weakness in lending to this sector reflects lack of demand. The National Federation of Independent Business (NFIB) Small Business Optimism Index, for instance, asks respondents to indicate their single most important problem from a standard list. For some time now, the response “poor sales” has been the most frequently cited problem. In contrast, relatively few respondents cite “financial and interest rates” as the most important problem (Chart 13). A caveat to this is that credit constraints could be inhibiting the formation of new small businesses—something that surveys of existing firms would not capture.\n\nAlthough credit availability has begun to improve, the decline in collateral values remains a significant impediment. For example, housing prices have declined so far that nearly one quarter of homes are now worth less than the value of the mortgages that finance them. Lacking sufficient collateral value, such homeowners cannot take advantage of the fact that conforming mortgage rates are at their lowest level in history and refinance their mortgages. Overall, the desire to rebuild wealth through savings and the limits on credit availability to households has acted to restrain consumer spending, keeping the recovery tepid.\n\nTo some degree, this adjustment is unavoidable, as the economy had reached unsustainable levels of consumption and housing demand. However, the fact that many of these adjustments are inevitable does not rule out a role for monetary policy to support economic activity. Very low interest rates can help smooth the adjustment process by supporting asset valuations, including making housing more affordable and by allowing some borrowers to reduce debt interest payments.\n\nBeyond this direct role in smoothing the deleveraging process—to the extent that monetary policy can “cut off the tail” of the distribution of potential adverse economic outcomes, making a truly disastrous outcome less likely—it can help encourage those households and businesses with money to spend to do so.\n\nToday’s low and falling rate of inflation—at a time when interest rates are near zero—is a problem that is slowing the adjustment process. Currently, by most measures, inflation is below the level that members of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) view as consistent with price stability. Although the Federal Reserve has no formal numerical inflation target, it is noteworthy that the long-run inflation forecasts of the FOMC members cluster around 1.75 percent to 2 percent for the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) deflator. This compares with a 1.5 percent year-over-year rate for the PCE deflator and 1.4 percent rate for the core PCE deflator, which excludes food and energy prices.\n\nLow and falling inflation is a problem for several reasons. First, low and declining inflation makes it harder to accomplish needed balance sheet adjustments. That is because, all other things being equal, lower inflation means slower nominal income growth. Slower nominal income growth, in turn, means that less of the needed adjustment in household debt-to-income ratios will come from rising incomes. This puts more of the adjustment burden on paying down debt.\n\nSecond, and even more importantly, low and falling inflation can cause inflation expectations to decline. This is important because inflation expectations are an important factor that influences actual future inflation. Moreover, when inflation expectations decline, the expected real cost of credit increases—a subject I will return to in a moment.\n\nSo what could the Federal Reserve do? As I see it, there are two potentially complementary avenues. First, we could take steps to make our current highly accommodative stance of monetary policy more effective in stimulating economic activity by providing additional guidance about what we are trying to achieve today and in the future. Second, we could find ways to increase the amount of stimulus we currently provide via our balance sheet.\n\nTurning to the first issue, clear communication about objectives and intent is an important element of effective monetary policy. For example, communicating clearly our intention to return inflation to more normal levels can help keep inflation expectations well anchored around levels consistent with our inflation goals. As the central bank, we and we alone can control inflation—if not precisely in the short run, then over the medium term. By clarifying our intentions, we can reduce the risk of further disinflation—or even an outright debt-deflation spiral that would make it still more difficult to accomplish the necessary balance-sheet adjustments.\n\nClear communication on the part of a central bank is important at all times, but it is even more critical when the federal funds rate is at or near its effective lower bound. In this environment, a decline in inflation expectations that drives up the real interest rate and thereby increases the real cost of credit cannot be offset by simply lowering the federal funds rate. Thus, in a very direct sense, a fall in inflation expectations when the target interest rate is at the zero bound represents a de facto tightening of monetary policy and of financial conditions. Such a tightening would clearly be highly undesirable at a moment when unemployment is too high, inflation is too low and the economy has only moderate forward momentum.\n\nIn this situation, the FOMC must be clear and resolute in its commitment to its price stability objective. This is why the most recent FOMC statement clearly stated that underlying inflation was running somewhat below levels consistent with the dual mandate.\n\nThere are a range of options we could pursue if we judged it worthwhile to go even further in communicating our objectives and intent. We could be even more explicit with regard to the inflation rate that the Committee views as compatible with price stability, for instance, by stating an explicit inflation objective as is common practice in other advanced economies. This could help anchor inflation expectations at the desired rate. It would also clarify the extent to which the current level of inflation falls short of that rate.\n\nIf we were to go down this path, it would be important to note that any provision of more information on our inflation objective would not be a signal that the inflation element of the dual mandate had become more important than the full employment objective. Instead, it would principally reflect the fact that inflation being “too low” (just like inflation being “too high”) is an impediment to achieving the full employment objective of the dual mandate.\n\nIf we judged it desirable, we could go still further and provide more guidance on how monetary policy would react to deviations from any stated inflation objective. One possibility would be to keep track of inflation shortfalls when the federal funds rate is constrained by the zero bound, as is the case today. For example, if inflation in 2011 were a 0.5 percentage point below the Fed’s inflation objective, the Fed might aim to offset this miss by an additional 0.5 percentage point rise in the price level in future years.\n\nIn the current environment, such an approach would have some advantages as well as some disadvantages. When there is a large amount of slack in the economy, the Federal Reserve might not easily be able to hit an inflation objective soon. But, the central bank could plausibly promise to make up the difference later on. Indeed, the further the Fed fell behind its inflation objective in the near term, the more inflation would need to increase in order to push the actual path of prices up to the path consistent with price stability over the long run. To the extent this policy was more credible, it might do a better job keeping inflation expectations from falling. This might make monetary policy more stimulative and, thus, might help the FOMC achieve its objectives more quickly.\n\nHowever, such an approach would only work well if people understood how it would operate and formed their expectations of future inflation accordingly. And there could also be significant costs. For example, if people mistakenly concluded that the Fed was tinkering with its long-run inflation objective, this could lead to greater uncertainty about future inflation. This might lead to higher risk premia and higher nominal interest rates that would undermine the effectiveness of such a policy to stimulate the economy.\n\nIn addition to communication strategies, the Federal Reserve has a second set of tools, namely the ability to expand its balance sheet to stimulate activity and move inflation toward desired levels—either by purchasing medium and long-term Treasuries or agency mortgage-backed securities. Such purchases of long-duration assets pull down the level of long-term interest rates by removing duration from private-sector hands, who respond by purchasing other long-dated assets.\n\nTwo interesting questions pertain to balance sheet expansion: (1) How much would the Fed have to purchase to have a given impact on the level of long-term interest rates and economic activity, and, (2) what constraints exist in terms of limits to balance- sheet expansion, and what are the costs involved that could impede efforts to meet the dual mandate now or in the future? The questions demand serious consideration prior to any decision to expand the balance sheet further.\n\nWith respect to the first question, some simple calculations based on recent experience suggest that $500 billion of purchases would provide about as much stimulus as a reduction in the federal funds rate of between half a point and three quarters of a point. But this estimate is sensitive to how long market participants expected the Fed to hold on to these assets.\n\nMore broadly, the clearer and more credible the framework governing purchases, the greater the likelihood that market participants would act in a manner that helped the Fed achieve its objectives. In particular, the more confident market participants are in the Fed’s ability to exit when the time is right, the more effective its purchases will be in stimulating the economy.\n\nSuppose the Fed was indeed successful in reducing long-term interest rates further—what then? Some claim that lower rates would have no effect on economic activity—that the Fed would be “pushing on a string.” This is too dark a view. Although the responsiveness of demand to reductions in interest rates is probably lower in a world in which balance sheet constraints are important, the responsiveness is not zero. I believe that it remains significant.\n\nEven in today’s challenging circumstances, lower long-term rates would support the economy through a number of channels. Lower long-term rates would support the value of assets, including houses and equities and household net worth. Lower long-term rates would make housing more affordable and support consumption by enabling households to refinance their mortgages at lower rates. This would increase the amount of income left over for other spending. Of course, this channel can be made more powerful to the extent that further progress can be made in efficient mortgage debt restructurings that allow households with negative equity in their homes to take advantage of the drop in mortgage rates. In addition, lower long-term rates would reduce the cost of capital for businesses, thereby fostering higher levels of capital spending for any given economic outlook.\n\nIn considering the limits to balance sheet expansion, there are two constraints—one major and one more minor. The first constraint is the risk that the balance sheet expansion might cause inflation expectations to become unanchored, leading to higher risk premia. This risk is presumably greater in a period in which budget deficits are high, as they are today.\n\nIf exit concerns were to rise as purchases increased, then a rise in inflation risk premia would offset at least some of the expected fall in interest rates. In contrast, the more credible the ultimate exit strategy, the less likely it is that inflation risk premia would go up and the more effective purchases would be in lowering long-term rates. Also, the more credible the ultimate exit plan, the more confident investors would be about the Fed’s willingness to do what is needed to accomplish its objectives. This is important because it would help stabilize longer-run inflation expectations at levels consistent with the dual mandate.\n\nThe FOMC should be able to assure investors that it has both the means and the will to exit when—but not before—the time is right. That is because the Federal Reserve has the tools to control financial conditions and credit creation even with an expanded balance sheet. Payment of interest on reserves allows us to control short-term rates with even a large amount of excess reserves outstanding. In addition, we can drain excess reserves in several ways. We have developed term deposit accounts and the ability to conduct reverse repurchase operations with a large number of counterparties that would allow us to drain a large volume of reserves. Also, when the time is right, the Fed can always sell assets. Such asset sales would lead to a rise in longer-term rates and this would have a contractionary effect on the demand for credit.\n\nI am very mindful of concerns here and abroad that balance sheet expansion could be interpreted as a policy of monetizing the federal debt. However, I regard this view to be fundamentally mistaken. It misses the point of what would be motivating the Federal Reserve. The FOMC would only engage in large-scale asset purchases in order to push the economy more rapidly toward the dual mandate goals of full employment and price stability. Once these goals were accomplished, there would be no basis for further purchases regardless of the government’s fiscal position because additional purchases would not be consistent with this mandate.\n\nThe second constraint is that further balance sheet expansion would increase the Federal Reserve’s interest rate risk by raising the maturity mismatch between its assets and liabilities. Recall that the bulk of the Fed’s liabilities are overnight reserves and the bulk of its assets are longer-term Treasuries, agency and agency MBS securities. The bigger the balance sheet becomes, the more a future rise in interest rates will squeeze the Federal Reserve’s net interest margin.\n\nSome worry that this exposure to higher short-term rates could conceivably affect the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy credibility in the future. Some market participants might worry that the Federal Reserve could become reluctant to raise short-term rates in a timely way because this would constrain the amount of revenue that it would earn and remit to the Treasury. I am confident there is nothing to worry about on this score.\n\nEven if the Federal Reserve was not obliged to act in keeping with its dual mandate—which it is—with its assets skewed toward longer-duration securities, the Federal Reserve would have every incentive to ensure price stability over the long term.\n\nIt is true that the larger the size of the balance sheet, the more likely it is that the Fed would ultimately sell assets back into the market, potentially at prices that could result in losses. Although some fear that such losses could compromise the Federal Reserve’s independence, there is no reason why this should be the case, providing we stick closely to our mandate at all times.\n\nTo date, the Fed’s actions in responding to the crisis have resulted in abnormally large profits that might reasonably be set against any subsequent losses. But much more importantly, our dual mandate does not state that we should do what is necessary to promote full employment and price stability only at times when we are virtually certain that in doing so we will make a profit. It directs us to promote full employment and price stability at all times. Profits and losses in any given year are much less important than getting the U.S. economy back to the highest level of employment consistent with price stability.\n\nIn making our assessments about next steps, we need to be a bit humble about our capacity to forecast how market participants would respond to our actions. We do not control their behavior nor have much historical experience that we can draw on to easily assess how they are likely to behave. Even viewpoints that turned out to be incorrect could persist for a long time and generate adverse consequences. It is not enough for us to be right in theory. We also have to be convincing in practice and in explaining why concerns we think are misplaced are indeed unwarranted.\n\nAs Chairman Bernanke indicated at Jackson Hole, the FOMC’s decision with respect to providing additional accommodation will be made by weighing the costs against the benefits. This is a dynamic process, which depends on the evolution of the economic outlook and our own ability to learn how to become more effective in improving the cost/benefit trade-offs.\n\nAnd, at its last meeting in September, the FOMC said it is “prepared to provide additional accommodation if needed to support the economic recovery and to return inflation, over time, to levels consistent with its mandate.”\n\nCurrently, my assessment is that both the current levels of unemployment and inflation and the timeframe over which they are likely to return to levels consistent with our mandate are unacceptable. In addition, the longer this situation prevails and the U.S. economy is stuck with the current level of slack and disinflationary pressure, the greater the likelihood that a further shock could push us still further from our dual mandate objectives and closer to outright deflation.\n\nWe have tools that can provide additional stimulus at costs that do not appear to be prohibitive. Thus, I conclude that further action is likely to be warranted unless the economic outlook evolves in a way that makes me more confident that we will see better outcomes for both employment and inflation before too long.\n\nThank you for your kind attention. I would be happy to take a few questions.\n\n__________________________________________\n\n1Chairman Ben S.

        "content": "During the crisis, Federal Reserve policymakers needed to respond to a series of extraordinary and hugely consequential problems, usually with little time and imperfect information. Today I will be speaking to you about the facts surrounding one of these problems, Lehman Brothers. In 2008, my job was to provide legal advice to Federal Reserve policymakers, and so while I am happy to share with the Commission my recollections of the events that I will describe, I do not want to exaggerate my own importance. It was Chairman Bernanke, the Board of Governors, and President Geithner who made the policy determinations on behalf of the Federal Reserve System—determinations that in my view were careful, creative, and right.\n\nWith this introduction, I would like to start with a question that I am often asked about Lehman: \"Why did you allow Lehman to fail?\" It is an understandable question, but one that nevertheless contains a false premise. The Federal Reserve did not \"allow\" Lehman Brothers to die, bankruptcy being the equivalent of death to a financial company. Instead, the Federal Reserve, the United States Treasury Department, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), and others tried hard to save it—not for its own sake, of course, but for the sake of all the families and businesses who would be harmed by the devastating effects of a Lehman bankruptcy. We did not succeed, but the effort made was serious and determined. We came very close.\n\nIn my remarks today, I will summarize the Federal Reserve's actions to address the Lehman problem in two parts. In the first part, I will describe how the Federal Reserve monitored Lehman's efforts to stabilize itself and pressed its most senior management to find a long-term solution for its liquidity and capital problems. In the second part, I will review how we attempted to facilitate a rescue from bankruptcy and, when this failed, to mitigate the impact of Lehman's demise on the economic system as a whole.\n\nLehman's Decline\nThe New York Fed had no role in supervising Lehman Brothers. The SEC supervised Lehman's broker-dealer pursuant to express statutory authority, and, as Chairman Mary Shapiro pointed out in her testimony before the House Financial Services Committee, the SEC also supervised Lehman's parent holding company under a voluntary program called the Consolidated Supervised Entity (CSE) program.1 The Federal Reserve had a business relationship with Lehman's broker-dealer, but our transactions with the broker-dealer were for the most part repurchase agreements done for monetary policy purposes, and purchases and sales of Treasury and agency securities.\n\nIn March, events in our financial system caused several responses that expanded the Federal Reserve's business relationship with Lehman Brothers and certain other investment banks. First, the Federal Reserve announced, on March 11, 2008, what became known as the Term Securities Lending Facility (TSLF). The TSLF was designed to address a liquidity problem that we had observed with respect to certain types of mortgage-backed securities. The TSLF addressed this problem by enabling primary dealers to borrow from the Federal Reserve certain securities that they could more easily exchange for cash and secure these borrowings by pledging securities to the Federal Reserve that were less easy to exchange. This enabled the primary dealers to obtain much-needed liquidity from the market.\n\nSecond, at around the time this program was announced, one of the primary dealers, Bear Stearns, was experiencing an extraordinary liquidity run. On Friday, March 14, 2008, the New York Fed received authority from the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve to make a loan that enabled Bear Stearns to avoid a bankruptcy filing and to continue in operation through the weekend of March 15 and 16. During that weekend, the Federal Reserve and the United States Treasury Department facilitated an acquisition of Bear Stearns by J.P. Morgan Chase. The Federal Reserve also developed a new liquidity facility to lend cash directly to primary dealers, the Primary Dealer Credit Facility (PDCF). The PDCF became operational on Monday, March 17, 2008, and it was intended to provide a liquidity backstop for primary dealers who might face circumstances similar to Bear Stearns. Lehman Brothers was one of these dealers.\n\nIt is impossible to know what would have happened to Lehman without the TSLF and the PDCF, but it is safe to say that these facilities calmed markets and allowed Lehman and others more time to examine available options and to seek potential solutions. As history shows, Lehman had six months from the date of the Bear Stearns transaction to find a long-term solution to its myriad problems. Of course Lehman's challenges were very serious—it suffered from capital deficiency, liquidity drain and a low level of market confidence. Any of these three could potentially prove fatal to a publicly traded financial company, even in the healthiest of economies. Lehman had the misfortune of trying to solve all three at once.\n\nWith the introduction of the TSLF and the PDCF, the New York Fed sent small teams of two monitors into each of the four remaining investment banks, Goldman Sachs, Merrill Lynch, Morgan Stanley and Lehman Brothers—something it had never done before. Let me again emphasize that we were not intending to conduct supervisory activities with our personnel, nor were we attempting to displace the SEC, the primary regulator of the investment banks. To the contrary, we were acting as a potential lender to these potential borrowers, and we wanted to know our new borrowers better. Because of concern that our monitoring role could be misunderstood or misconstrued, Vice Chairman Donald Kohn described our objectives in public testimony. He said that the on-site monitors had two narrowly tailored goals: (1) to ensure that any credit that the Fed extended to the investment banks would be repaid, and (2) to ensure that the investment banks did not become too dependent upon Federal Reserve credit and would continue to work on improving their liquidity positions and financial strength.2 The Federal Reserve monitors did not take on the broader responsibility of supervising Lehman. The SEC continued to be the supervisor of the broker-dealers and their parents, including Lehman's broker-dealer and its parent, Lehman Holdings.\n\nLehman showed some signs of recovery during this period. It raised capital in June of 2008. But liquidity continued to be a significant disability. As part of its monitoring, the New York Fed, in conjunction with the SEC, conducted liquidity stress analyses of the investment banks, in part to evaluate their creditworthiness. Those analyses suggested that Lehman needed to improve its liquidity should the credit crisis intensify. Again, to Lehman's credit, and in response to our analyses, Lehman took steps to, and did, improve its liquidity. At no time, however, did anyone at the New York Fed believe that Lehman had sufficient liquidity to withstand what was to come in September, events that Richard Fuld, Lehman's former chief executive officer, has described as the \"perfect storm.\"3\n\nAccordingly, as has been well-documented in the press and in the comprehensive report by Anton Valukas, the Lehman Brothers' bankruptcy examiner (the Valukas Report), senior Federal officials, including President Geithner, continually pressed Lehman to find workable solutions for its capital and liquidity problems from March to September 2008. Lehman executives pursued potential merger partners. They engaged in discussions with potential Korean buyers and approached Warren Buffett. At no time did the New York Fed tell Lehman that it would be bailed out with taxpayer money, nor did the New York Fed instruct Lehman to act as if such an option was available. Lehman's CEO, Mr. Fuld, and the Chairman of the Lehman board of directors, Thomas Cruikshank, have made clear that Lehman was not expecting any Federal bailout.4 Both men fully understood that Lehman was a public company and needed to be fully responsible for its own financial situation.\n\nLehman Weekend\nSeptember of 2008 will likely be remembered as an epochal period in the history of American finance. The bankruptcy filing by Lehman occurred during that month, and it must be analyzed in the context of that most distressing time. On September 7, the Federal Housing Finance Agency placed Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac into conservatorship, and the Treasury Department used its authority, granted by Congress in July 2008, to make financial support available to these two government-sponsored entities. While Lehman is often considered the trigger for the systemic consequences that were to come later in the month, it is also clear that Fannie and Freddie's decline, among other factors, caused a number of market participants to begin \"hunkering down\" to protect their balance sheets. Exposure to Lehman was one of the items to be addressed. Counterparties' reluctance to deal with Lehman intensified starting on Monday, September 8, 2008, such that by Thursday, September 11, 2008, it was apparent to us that Lehman faced a liquidity crisis—i.e., it would not be able to pay its debts as they came due. The issue was no longer whether this public company could fashion its own rescue. We had come to the point of no return, where Lehman faced two alternatives: bankruptcy, or some kind of third-party rescue.\n\nThe United States Treasury Department, working in conjunction with the Federal Reserve and the SEC, convened a meeting of the chief executive officers of major financial institutions at the New York Fed after the close of markets on Friday, September 12, 2008. Secretary Paulson opened the meeting with a short and plain declaration that there would be no public money to support Lehman. The Government then gave the CEOs two tasks. First, it was suggested they form a consortium to finance certain of Lehman's illiquid assets in order to facilitate an acquisition. Second, as a contingency, should the banking organizations fail to come up with a workable rescue plan, they should present an alternative plan to address the effects of a Lehman bankruptcy, because they should anticipate that would happen Monday morning.\n\nAs was the case with Bear Stearns, the Government knew that a third party would have to finance a portfolio of Lehman's illiquid assets in order to make Lehman acceptable as a merger partner. In this case, drawing upon the precedent of the rescue of Long Term Capital Management in 1998, the Government arranged for a consortium of private banks to provide the financing. And in fact, after much discussion and some disagreeable moments, the private banks agreed to do so. By Sunday, September 14, the counterparties had agreed to finance approximately $30 billion of Lehman's illiquid assets in order to facilitate Lehman's rescue. While the structure was never finalized, it would presumably have resembled a private sector version of Maiden Lane LLC, the vehicle used to acquire the assets from Bear Stearns. The banks would have lent $30 billion to their SPV, and the special purpose vehicle (SPV) would have purchased largely real estate-related assets from Lehman. This would have made Lehman more attractive to a potential acquirer.\n\nLining up financing for the illiquid assets was a necessary condition for a rescue, but it was not sufficient. The sine qua non of the plan, as Secretary Geithner and others have pointed out, was a willing and capable merger partner.5 In the end, the rescue failed because we had no willing and capable merger partner able to provide the necessary commitments to stabilize Lehman. And, lest there is confusion on the point, this would be true no matter who was financing the acquisition of Lehman's illiquid assets, the counterparties or the New York Fed.\n\nAs of that Friday, there were two prospective Lehman acquirers: Bank of America and Barclays. On Saturday, September 13, Bank of America abandoned the potential acquisition of Lehman and reached an agreement to acquire Merrill Lynch. Barclays was the only remaining suitor. On Sunday, September 14, with the consortium financing committed, we learned for the first time that Barclays would not be able to deliver a key document to carry the merger to conclusion: a guarantee of Lehman's trading obligations between the signing of the merger agreement and its closing.\n\nThe Bear Stearns transaction taught us the importance of the guarantee to a successful rescue. A guarantee maintains the ability of the troubled company to operate as a going concern and, thus, preserves value. It does this by providing protection to counterparties during an especially vulnerable period—the period between merger contract and merger closing. Without such a guarantee, the creditors and counterparties of the firm would be at risk in the event that the merger fell apart because of a failed shareholder vote or some other contingency. Consequently, as a market matter, the guarantee is an indispensable part of any such rescue operation.\n\nOn Sunday, September 14, we learned that Barclays could not proffer the needed guarantee without a shareholder vote. This vote would take days, if not weeks or months, and there was no way to predict if the shareholders would even vote for the transaction to proceed. I explored with counsel whether the U.K. government, or one of its instrumentalities like the FSA, might waive this U.K. requirement, such that the guarantee could be delivered and the rescue effected. I learned that the U.K. authorities were not amenable to a waiver. Thus, Barclays ceased to be available as the willing buyer that we needed to rescue Lehman, and there was no other interest from any firm of sufficient size and capability that could acquire Lehman, a company with consolidated assets of about $600 billion.\n\nMany have asked why, when the Barclays guarantee problem presented itself, the Federal Reserve did not step forward and guarantee the trading obligations of Lehman pending its merger with Barclays. They observe that we lent approximately $29 billion to Maiden Lane LLC to facilitate the merger of J.P. Morgan Chase and Bear Stearns, and they look at our commitment to lend up to $85 billion to AIG.\n\nUnder the law, the New York Fed does not have the authority to provide what I would characterize as a \"naked\" guarantee—one that would be unsecured and not limited in amount, and would put the U.S. taxpayers at risk for the entirety of Lehman's trading obligations. As Chairman Bernanke has observed, \"the Federal Reserve has done, and will continue to do, everything possible within the limits of its authority to assist in restoring our nation to financial stability and economic prosperity….\"6 In this case, Lehman had no ability to pledge the amount of collateral required to satisfactorily secure a Fed guarantee, one large enough to credibly withstand a run by Lehman's creditors and counterparties. As events subsequently played out, several weeks after Lehman weekend, on October 2, 2008, Congress passed the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act (EESA), which provides the U.S. Treasury Department with legal authority to issue a guarantee.7 Again, the Federal Reserve did not then, and does not now, have such authority.\n\nEven if it had been legally possible, a Government guarantee would have also placed the taxpayer at enormous risk because it would have undermined deal certainty. It is important for the acquirer—and not a third party—to issue the guarantee because it gives the acquirer a strong incentive to close the deal and assume control of the target. For example, J.P. Morgan Chase, which proffered the guarantee needed to merge with Bear Stearns, negotiated a host of provisions from Bear Stearns that assured deal certainty. And, during the period between March 2008 (when J.P. Morgan Chase and Bear Stearns agreed to merge) and June 2008 (when the merger closed), counterparties of Bear Stearns continued to do business with it because of the J.P. Morgan Chase guarantee.\n\nOn the other hand, where a third party provides the guarantee, the acquirer enjoys all the benefits if the target's condition improves and none of the burdens if the target's condition declines. It is the third party who is on the hook, and in this case that third party would have been the taxpayer. Similarly, from the perspective of the merger target, an unlimited guarantee by the Government could provide the merger target with the means to try to stay independent—its shareholders might vote the merger down with an unlimited Government guarantee.\n\nSome observers ask why if we were not able to backstop Lehman, we were able to provide substantial credit to AIG immediately afterwards. The answer is that in the case of AIG, there was sufficient collateral to support the commitment to lend. Unlike the naked guarantee needed to facilitate the merger of Barclays and Lehman, our committed credit to AIG on September 16, 2008, was fully secured by good collateral, namely, AIG's sound retail insurance businesses. In fact, before any money was disbursed to AIG on September 16, AIG delivered share certificates to the New York Fed that we continue to hold as collateral in our vaults. These shares fully secured every penny we lent to AIG on September 16, 2008. And today, the credit extended to AIG by the New York Fed remains fully secured.\n\nLikewise, the Federal Reserve's loan to Maiden Lane LLC, which facilitated the Bear Stearns rescue, was and is fully secured. The security is important because it is the taxpayer's protection in the event of a default. There is no similar protection to the issuer of a naked guarantee; if the obligor of the guaranteed obligation fails to perform, the guarantor is liable.\n\nOn Sunday, September 14, with an acquisition of Lehman no longer possible, a working group of market participants focused on the best way to mitigate the effects of a Lehman bankruptcy. They concluded that a contingency plan developed by the SEC, the Treasury, and the New York Fed was the best option. Under this plan, Lehman's parent would file a Chapter 11 petition, but the broker-dealer subsidiary would continue to operate. It would operate with intra-day credit from its clearing bank, J.P. Morgan Chase, and overnight credit from the Federal Reserve.\n\nThe Federal Reserve would provide credit that was fully secured by the collateral of the broker-dealer and this would continue for a period of time to enable the broker-dealer to wind down its trading book in an orderly manner—thereby mitigating to some degree the impact of the failure on financial markets and the economy. At the point in time when an orderly liquidation of the broker-dealer became practical, a petition would be filed for a receivership under the Securities Investor Protection Act. This became the contingency plan, although it was always subject to the Lehman board of directors deciding to file a Chapter 11 petition, a matter that was their responsibility and not ours. On September 15, Lehman's board of directors elected to place the parent company in Chapter 11 while leaving Lehman's broker-dealer open for business so it could wind down its operations.\n\nA look at the hypothetical alternative of lending to the Lehman holding company itself reveals that it was in fact not viable. By Monday, September 15, Lehman faced a total erosion of market confidence, and so the Federal Reserve would have been lending into a classic run. Had Lehman not filed for bankruptcy on September 15, but opened as if it were business as usual, creditors and counterparties would have rushed to protect their positions, using all legal remedies, causing the liquidity crisis to spread throughout Lehman's organization.\n\nBy contrast, the New York Fed affirmatively decided to continue extending credit to Lehman Brothers' broker-dealer. This decision was made to facilitate the broker-dealer's orderly winddown. Then, when Barclays returned to the negotiating table on Tuesday, September 16, with an offer to purchase substantially all of the assets of Lehman's broker-dealer, the New York Fed used this financing to facilitate a transition of certain broker-dealer operations from Lehman to Barclays. Once Judge Peck of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York approved the arrangement at the end of the week, those operations were in Barclays' hands.\n\nWhile there was nothing truly \"orderly\" about the Lehman bankruptcy, the New York Fed's overnight financing of the Lehman broker-dealer avoided further market disruption. This piece of the overall Lehman story is rarely told, and yet it deserves attention. In contrast, Lehman Brothers International Europe (LBIE), the U.K. broker-dealer, was immediately placed into administration, its employees were sent home without paychecks, and the U.K. broker-dealer had no opportunity to wind down its positions. As such, its counterparties' positions were likewise frozen, which created liquidity problems and significant market exposures as asset prices moved in the wake of Lehman's failure.\n\nConclusion\nIn conclusion, let me say a few words about regulatory reform and the tools we had to work with. I mentioned earlier the guarantee tool that the Congress added when the EESA was enacted. Another important development is the Dodd-Frank legislation, which promises more effective comprehensive consolidated supervision of systemically significant organizations like Lehman. This supervision will demand higher levels of capital and liquidity, precisely the type of medicine that Lehman needed. Systemically significant non-banking financial companies, like Lehman, will also be obliged to submit resolution plans which will help to avoid some of the problems experienced after Lehman filed its Chapter 11 petition. Further, if a systemically significant organization like Lehman needs to be resolved, Dodd-Frank creates a new resolution procedure that should facilitate a more orderly winddown.\n\nThank you again for the opportunity to appear before you today, and I look forward to answering your questions.\n\n____________________________________________________\n\n1Mary L.

        "content": "I. National economic conditions\nTo provide some context, I'll begin with a few words about national economic conditions. U.S. economic activity has expanded for four consecutive quarters, but at rates that can only be described as modest when compared with early stages of past recoveries. The June payroll numbers tell the story of this sluggish recovery in employment. The economy gained only 83,000 private-sector jobs, following a downwardly revised gain of only 33,000 in May. Growth in the third quarter may turn out to be a bit less than we saw in the first half of the year, though we think there is only a slight risk of a double dip. The road to recovery is turning out to be a bit bumpy as relatively weak consumer spending and the ongoing problems in financial markets are keeping growth far less robust than we would like.\n\nTo date, the manufacturing sector has been a key source of growth during the recovery. After an unusually steep decline from late 2007 to mid-2009, manufacturing output has grown rapidly over the past year, although the level of manufacturing output remains well below the previous peak. A major force behind the growth of manufacturing output has been an unusually pronounced inventory cycle. Production has expanded as firms across a variety of industries have been rebuilding their stocks to bring them into a better balance with sales. Another driver of manufacturing output over the past several quarters has been a pronounced rebound of our exports of manufactured goods. Economic activity abroad has been recovering from its weak levels in 2009, and that global recovery has helped fuel demand for our products, particularly capital goods.\n\nThe importance of manufacturing in the recovery makes it a timely topic for our regional economic briefing, namely, trends in the manufacturing sector here in the Second District.\n\nII. Regional Economic Conditions (update since the April regional press briefing)\nTurning to our region, we can see a nascent recovery in most areas, with a holding pattern in other parts. This mixed pattern of growth is not surprising in the aftermath of a recession, and particularly a deep one with a financial crisis, as well. On the positive side, I can report that economic activity has picked up in many parts of the region.\n\nTo measure activity we use a set of indexes of economic activity—called Coincident Economic Indicators—that we produce here at the New York Fed for New York State, New York City and New Jersey, plus a similar index produced in Puerto Rico. These indexes provide a timely, monthly gauge of economic activity. They show that in New York State and New York City, activity has expanded at a relatively brisk pace since the beginning of the year. In Puerto Rico, where the recession began three years before the mainland downturn, the economy also appears to be picking up in recent months. In contrast, economic conditions in New Jersey remain essentially flat. Although activity there is no longer declining, New Jersey has yet to establish a sustained recovery.\n\nBut, what about jobs—which are the key for people to truly feel the recovery in their lives? I am pleased to note that private-sector job growth has turned up moderately across much of the region in the past few months, just as it has in the nation. Growth in private-sector jobs signals that some firms need to hire workers to meet their production needs. This is a good sign and necessary for a sustainable recovery. The number of private-sector jobs has increased in and around New York City, in Northern New Jersey and in some parts of upstate New York. The June job market report for New York and New Jersey showed the recovery is likely to be a bit bumpy. Private-sector employment fell in both in New York State and New York City, though despite June's dip, employment in New York City remains above its low point in December 2009. In contrast, New Jersey's private-sector jobs picture improved in June, though a weak public sector there continues to weigh down overall job growth.\n\nDespite the improvements we have seen, unemployment in the region remains painfully high. In June, New York City's and New Jersey's rates were very close to the national jobless rate of 9.5 percent. The rate for New York State, which has been improving since the first quarter, is noticeably lower at 8.2 percent. Puerto Rico, which has had much higher unemployment than the mainland for the past several decades, had a jobless rate of 16.3 percent in June, with little evidence of recovery so far.\n\nIII. Regional Manufacturing Sector\nBackground\nThe manufacturing sector is important to our region because it provides a substantial number of high-wage jobs and, in some parts of the region, is a key driver of business cycles and longer-term trends. To understand manufacturing in our region, it is important to note that different parts of the region specialize in different products. For example, New York City's largest manufacturing industry is apparel; motor-vehicle parts is a large industry in western New York, as are computers and electronics in Syracuse, Binghamton and the Hudson Valley. The pharmaceuticals industry is dominant in Northern New Jersey and Puerto Rico.\n\nOver the past several decades, manufacturing wages have risen, while the number of workers it employs has fallen, These long-term trends stem from fundamental structural changes in trade, technology and consumption patterns. Some manufacturing has moved to other parts of the United States or overseas. The advent of information technology and computerization has also profoundly altered many manufacturing processes. And, the mix of products demanded by consumers has evolved over time. All of these factors have combined to reduce the number of factory jobs across the nation, with the New York/New Jersey region hit particularly hard. What is less well known is that despite this employment decline, manufacturing output has actually continued to grow moderately in much of the New York/New Jersey region. This means that the sector has experienced substantial gains in productivity. These productivity gains—the result of innovation and adaptation—have been accompanied by rising average wages in manufacturing. Like the rest of the country, our job losses have been heavily concentrated in lower-skill positions, resulting in a leaner and more skilled manufacturing industry.\n\nThe manufacturing sector and its structural job-wage dynamics are particularly important in upstate New York. Upstate (especially in its rural areas) manufacturing workers tend to earn higher wages than the average in their region, and the sector employs a larger share of the workforce there than it does nationally.\n\nOutlook\nHow will the current recovery in manufacturing employment play out? Nationally, the growth in manufacturing output over the past year has occurred in a variety of industries, including autos, machinery, and computers and other electronic equipment. This growth reflects a combination of the restocking of inventories, domestic demand growth (particularly in investment goods), and higher exports. The concentration of these industries in parts of our region meant that those areas were poised to take advantage of this growth. The region has seen some increase in factory jobs in recent months, which undoubtedly reflects the expansion of production that has occurred nationally in these industries.\n\nA number of indicators suggest that the inventory cycle may be largely complete—that is, the recent restocking has brought inventories into a better balance with sales. If so, we will lose restocking as an impetus for growth. Despite this, we expect manufacturing output to continue to expand because of improving domestic demand and foreign demand for U.S. manufactured exports. Yet, if this recovery follows the typical pattern for past recoveries, the prospect for growth in factory jobs will likely be weaker here than the rest of the nation.\n\nLonger term, the sector's prospects are likely to be governed by a continuation of the trends I mentioned before in international trade, technology and consumption patterns. This means that output and wages will likely continue to rise, both nationally and regionally. However, the sector is unlikely to be a major source of job growth. Beyond the national trends that work against an expansion of factory jobs, the New York–New Jersey region faces ongoing competitive pressures as a location for manufacturing production. That competition comes from other regions of the country, as well as from abroad. One key to meeting these competitive challenges will be for the region to ensure that it develops and attracts a highly skilled workforce that can meet the needs of innovative and rapidly changing firms.\n\nIV. The Empire State Manufacturing Survey\nIn order to monitor conditions in the region, the New York Fed conducts a monthly survey of manufacturing firms in New York State, our Empire State Manufacturing Survey. Let me tell you a little about the survey and then review recent patterns.\n\nThe survey is sent to a pool of about 200 manufacturing executives in a wide variety of industries across the state. About 100 responses are usually received. For the survey's main index—which is called the General Business Conditions Index—respondents report the change from the previous month in of overall conditions in their firm. To explain their answers, we also ask them to assess components of activity such as orders, shipments, inventories and employment. Respondents are also asked for their views on the likely direction of these indicators over the next six months. In addition, each month we ask supplementary questions on a topic of current interest. To share the information as quickly and broadly as possible, we post results on our public website on the 15th of each month or the next business day. In doing this survey, we join the four other Federal Reserve Banks that use a survey to monitor conditions in their manufacturing sectors.\n\nThis morning I want to highlight the results of our July survey, which we released last Thursday. Our main index began to signal an upturn in the manufacturing sector in New York State last summer and, despite a brief dip last December, has given a consistently positive signal for a year now. Our July survey showed that conditions continue to improve, but at a slower pace than in previous months. In this month's supplementary questions, we asked respondents about the importance of trade with various parts of the world to manufacturing activity in New York State. In general, respondents indicated that exports account for a growing share of their revenues. Their firms are devoting more resources to marketing abroad—particularly in Asia—and expect their export sales to be higher in the next 12 months than in the past 12 months.\n\nIn sum, the region is showing signs of a moderate recovery, and the manufacturing sector is playing a key role in that recovery in parts of the region.\n\nThank you for your kind attention. I will now ask Jaison Abel to provide more details on current regional economic conditions."

        "content": "With this background, I will outline the interventions that were carried out to mitigate the crisis, focusing on those conducted by the Federal Reserve. I will direct my remarks to the facilities that were created rather than to the actions taken for individual institutions since these have been discussed extensively elsewhere. The lessons learned from the crisis are important for the design of the policy response aimed at reducing the likelihood that the U.S. economy ever again experiences this degree of trauma.\n\nI begin with the simple exercise of what name we should assign to this past crisis. At first blush, this may not seem like a useful exercise. But, as Shakespeare reminded us, names are important as they convey a sense of our understanding of the event. One name that has gained popularity is the \"Great Recession,\" which is dated as beginning with the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers on September 15, 2008. This name conveys both the severity of what occurred, as well as the calamity of what was avoided. The contraction in real output in the six months following the demise of Lehman Brothers exceeded in size any other post World War II recession—in that sense, it was a great recession. However, aggressive monetary and fiscal policy actions both domestically and abroad were successful in preventing a complete meltdown of the U.S. and the world economy. In that sense, the name also emphasizes what the crisis was not. However, the name tends to focus one’s attention too much on the effect and not the cause of the crisis.\n\nAn alternative name is the \"Panic of 2007,\" which is dated as beginning with the announcement by BNP Paribus on August 9, 2007, of its suspension of redemptions for three of its investment funds. This name stresses the financial crisis as the precipitating event leading up to the severe decline in real economic activity slightly more than a year later. The name conveys that at its very basic level, the crisis was a form of a banking panic. The parallel to the name \"Panic of 1907\" is also a reminder to us that history has a way of repeating itself unless we learn and apply its lessons well. For this reason, it is useful to take a moment to recall the events of 1907.\n\nAt the turn of the 20th century there was no Federal Reserve System. Banks then as today borrow short term in order to lend long term, making their profit on the difference in rates. At the time, the banks’ short-term liabilities took the form of demand deposits. If depositors began to worry about the quality of a bank’s loans and its ability to pay back its depositors, a run on the bank could develop. Once started, no bank on its own can stop a run by its depositors. To deal with these liquidity problems, the banks developed a clearinghouse system whereby member banks could backstop each other. This system would work well as long as banking problems were sufficiently localized so that unaffected member banks could provide liquidity to those member banks facing a liquidity problem.\n\nThe problem in 1907 was that credit was also being supplied by trust companies that operated outside of the clearinghouse system. Many of these trusts, including the Knickerbocker Trust, lent money to speculators in the copper market, which was experiencing a boom. So long as copper prices kept rising, these loans paid off. However, when copper prices began to fall, there was a wave of loan defaults leading to a run on the trusts that could not be stopped by the clearinghouse system. The resulting credit contraction sent the economy into recession, transmitting the problems to the banking sector. In the end, more than 240 banks failed even though the problem started outside of the banking sector.\n\nThe basic mechanics of a bank run have remained the same over time. Due to the maturity mismatch involved in credit intermediation, banks in particular and financial institutions in general must rely on trust by their \"depositors\" that the institution’s assets will provide the ability to pay back the depositors. The fundamental connection between liquidity and trust was well described by Walter Bagehot in 1873:\n\nThere are two problems that depositors face. The first is that they typically know very little about a particular bank’s investments. This reflects both the lack of transparency in how banks are investing their funds, and a lack of incentive by individual borrowers to expend effort to try and learn this information—what economists call a public goods problem. The second problem is that a depositor does not know what other depositors think about the solvency of the bank. A bank may be solvent and a depositor may be convinced of that fact, but if most other depositors think differently and decide to withdraw their funds, then the bank will have to sell its assets and will likely become insolvent leaving the patient depositor unable to reclaim his funds—what economists call a coordination failure problem. The combination of these two problems implies that increases in uncertainty regarding values of assets on a bank’s balance sheet create an environment susceptible to deposit runs.\n\nThe failure of the clearinghouse system in 1907 was a catalyst for the formation of the Federal Reserve System and its power as a lender of last resort. The problem of deposit runs was effectively solved in 1934 with the institution of deposit insurance. Insurance solves the public goods and coordination failure problems discussed above. A depositor need not invest resources in determining which bank is a safe place to put his funds. Additionally, the depositor is guaranteed to get his funds back regardless of whether other depositors decide to withdraw their funds. The moral hazard problems created by deposit insurance necessitated that the banks covered be subject to supervision and that a mechanism was established so that problem banks could be resolved quickly in order to safeguard the taxpayers’ money.\n\nThere are many parallels between the Panic of 1907 and the events of 2007. In both cases, credit intermediation had shifted outside of the core banking sector. An investment boom preceded each panic—the earlier in copper and the later in housing—with much of the credit being funded by sources outside of any existing liquidity protections. When the bubbles began to deflate and prices began to fall, loan defaults quickly developed precipitating funding runs on the institutions involved in extending this credit. What seemed like large liquidity buffers by individual firms were quickly drawn down. Funding withdrawals precipitated asset sales, which put further downward pressure on asset prices. The resulting credit contractions adversely affected the real economy, setting up an adverse feedback loop that exacerbated the initial losses.\n\nGiven the parallels between the events of 1907 and 2007 and, more importantly, the similarities of the lessons learned from those episodes, I believe the most instructive name for our latest financial crisis is the \"Panic of 2007.\" In the rest of my remarks, I will explore in greater detail the factors behind the panic, as well as the responses by the Federal Reserve.\n\nThe first question to explore is the extent to which the financial system had evolved over the past several decades.3 Over this period, demand deposits lost their market share to money market mutual funds, which, while considered safe, are not guaranteed like deposits. This made it increasingly difficult and less profitable for banks to fund loans on their balance sheets using deposits. Securitization markets developed where loans could be funded through the market by investors. In addition, money market mutual funds, securities lenders, institutional investors and businesses needed a safe way to deposit funds where they would earn interest but retain ready access to their funds. Repurchase agreements or \"repos\" developed to serve this need. A repo is a short-term collateralized loan that shares many characteristics with a demand deposit except that repos are not guaranteed. At the same time, large firms increasingly raised funds by issuing commercial paper in the market rather than relying on bank loans—with the money market mutual funds being large investors in this paper. Large banks, as well, came to rely at the margin on non-deposit funding through the interbank funding market. The Fed acted as the lender of last resort for this market.\n\nThis system of market-based credit intermediation has been called the \"shadow banking system.\" The shadow banking system grew at a very fast rate over the past several decades. Chart 1 shows that by 1990, mortgage originations in the shadow banking system equaled originations in the banking system, and grew to more than double the level in the banking system by 2008. Chart 2 highlights the growth in securitization across many different asset categories besides residential mortgages, such as commercial real estate loans, auto loans, credit card loans and student loans. A direct consequence of this growth was that the short-term liabilities associated with the shadow banking system—repos and commercial paper—exceeded the level of demand deposits as seen in Chart 3. Despite this rapid transformation of the financial system, the liquidity protections put in place for demand deposits (deposit insurance and access to the Fed’s discount window) were not available to these new funding sources.\n\nThis lack of liquidity protection was a source of systemic risk that was building in the financial system—akin to underbrush that builds up in a forest over time increasing the risk of a major fire. The Panic of 2007, however, required a trigger—a spark to ignite the fire. As I will describe in more detail in a moment, subprime mortgages provided the spark. Once the fire was started, the Fed was confronted with fighting the fire using a set of tools designed for a 20th century banking crisis—not a 21st century shadow banking crisis. As a result, the Fed had to improvise and design new tools as it battled the financial blaze. Another choice would have been to let the fire burn on the theory that this is the best way to clear away the underbrush that has built up over time. The great risk with this strategy is that the fire burns out of control creating considerable collateral damage in the process. If the choice is to fight the fire, then once the fire is extinguished the job remains to aggressively act to remove the underbrush—thus the urgent need for regulatory reform.\n\nThere were two necessary ingredients for a catalyst for a financial panic in the shadow banking system. The first was the realization by investors of the possibility of incurring significant losses on some securities. The second was uncertainty over which securities would sustain these losses and consequently who held these securities. This uncertainty enabled the financial crisis to also impact the banking system. Finding a way to reduce this uncertainty would prove to be a key step to dealing with the crisis.\n\nThe housing boom had pushed house values significantly above fundamental values in some markets, creating the possibility of substantial losses on mortgages written on houses in these markets. The largest run-ups in house prices occurred in the \"sand states\" of Arizona, California, Florida and Nevada. One approach to measuring the degree to which houses had become overvalued is to compare the evolution of house prices to their replacement costs. For housing markets such as Las Vegas, which are surrounded by open land, the price of houses should not differ significantly from the cost of building a new house. These markets are characterized by what economists call a horizontal long-run housing supply curve.\n\nChart 4 shows the ratio of house prices to estimated replacement costs over time for the four sand cities of Las Vegas, Vallejo, Phoenix and Miami.4 In all four cities, prices relative to estimated replacement costs largely stayed in a tight range between 0.8 and 1.2 over the 1980s and 1990s. However, by 2002 to 2003, house prices broke out of this range and reached values well in excess of 200 percent of the replacement cost in Vallejo and Miami, and 180 percent of replacement costs in Las Vegas and Phoenix. When the bubble burst in these markets, house prices were likely to drop by a large magnitude.\n\nTwo factors were important in creating uncertainty over which assets were going to suffer losses given a burst of the housing bubble. The first is that not all housing markets experienced a boom. Chart 5 shows the ratio of house prices to replacement costs for Dallas and Chicago. This ratio never broke above 1.2 for Dallas, and peaked at 1.4 for Chicago. An implication is that the default risk on a mortgage (as well as the loss given default) depended not just on the risk profile of the borrower, but also on the specific location of the property. The second factor contributing to the uncertainty over the value of mortgage securities was the lack of transparency in their design. Key information about the specific mortgages was lost in the process of securitizing mortgages in the first place, and then later repackaging these mortgage securities into collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) and CDOs-squared.5 In addition, the complexity of the securities meant that it would be difficult to understand the risks even if an investor had access to all of the relevant mortgage-level information. Investors in AAA rated mortgage-backed securities were initially sanguine about these information problems since these securities were thought to have a very low loss probability as determined by the credit rating agencies. Once that assumption was no longer true, it was very difficult to acquire and process that information.\n\nHow did house prices manage to depart so significantly from their fundamental value in some housing markets? Asset booms and busts have been a feature of financial markets for centuries as documented by Reinhart and Rogoff in their recent book This Time is Different.6 During a boom, a strong motivation for purchasing an asset is the expected price appreciation on the asset. In the case of housing, rising prices however should ration demand through two constraints. The first is the downpayment constraint. For a given required downpayment percentage, as house prices increase a borrower must come up with more cash for the downpayment. The second is the cash flow constraint. For a given interest rate and downpayment percentage, as house prices increase, the mortgage payment relative to the borrower’s income increases making the mortgage less affordable.7 If lenders had maintained minimum downpayment percentages and maximum debt-to-income ratios as the housing boom began, then rising prices would have done a better job of rationing demand, thereby limiting the duration of the bubble and the extent of overvaluation in the markets.\n\nHowever, as Reinhart and Rogoff demonstrate repeatedly, \"this time is different\" so house prices were expected to continue to increase, which \"justified\" lenders’ decisions to lower the downpayment percentages and raise the allowable debt-to-income ratios. In 2001, at least half of new subprime mortgages had downpayments of 20 percent or less, and at least a quarter had downpayments of 11 percent or less. By 2006, at least half of new subprime mortgages had downpayments of 10 percent or less, and at least a quarter had no downpayment at all. Similarly, in 2001, 42 percent of new subprime mortgages had debt-to-income ratios that exceeded 34 percent (which is considered a high ratio meaning borrowers may face some payment stress), while by 2006 this had increased to 62 percent.8 The continued increase in house prices eventually came to a stop when lending standards could not be eased any further to offset the effects of the higher prices.\n\nThe turndown in house prices quickly led to a significant increase in subprime mortgage defaults. This happened for two reasons. First, most subprime mortgages were designed in a way that created rollover risk. The typical subprime mortgage was a hybrid adjustable rate mortgage with the initial \"teaser\" interest rate fixed for two or three years, and then adjusting every six months thereafter. The first rate adjustment could be quite substantial and provided a strong incentive for the borrower to refinance the mortgage at that point in time. So long as house prices were rising, borrowers were able to refinance and roll over the loan. However, when house prices began to decline, lenders were unwilling to refinance, and as a consequence, borrowers were often unable to pay the higher interest rates, which prompted defaults. Second, as the housing boom continued, an increasing share of new purchases were by investors (declared or undeclared) rather than by borrowers who intended to live in the house. The default decisions by investors are much more sensitive to declining house prices than those by owner-occupied borrowers.\n\nThe vast majority of subprime loans were financed by investors through placing the loans into securities that were sold onto the market. Most of the securities derived from these subprime mortgages were deemed to be AAA rated by the rating agencies. The subprime mortgage securities differed in an important way from those based on prime conforming mortgages. For prime conforming mortgage-backed securities, the degree of credit protection for the AAA investors is fixed in advance. In contrast, for subprime mortgage-backed securities, the degree of credit protection for AAA investors started out \"thin\" and built up over the initial couple of years so long as mortgages did not default early in their life.9 At the peak of the housing boom, not only was leverage high for the individual subprime borrower, but leverage was high for the investors in lower rated subprime mortgage securities.10 This dynamic buildup of credit protection worked well so long as house prices kept increasing, but proved to be disastrous for investors in AAA subprime securities when house prices began to decline.\n\nThe AAA rated subprime securities were then used as collateral against repurchase agreements. Given how safe the assets were thought to be, very small haircuts were required for these loans. In addition, the composition of repo loan terms shifted toward overnight, reaching 75 percent in 2008.11 These small haircuts implied that the broker dealers could use considerable leverage themselves in purchasing these securities. So, leverage was high at all levels of the financial chain from the individual subprime borrowers, to the investors in the lower rated securities, and to the broker dealers who invested in the highly rated securities. At their peak, subprime mortgage related securities amounted to only around $1.2 trillion dollars—a relatively small size given the overall size of the repo market. Leverage, however, amplified the losses as house prices began to decline.\n\nWhy did the point at which house prices peaked and started to fall in some housing markets spark a run on the repo market? Additionally, why did the problems in subprime mortgage assets spread quickly to other assets? Gary Gorton uses the analogy of an E. coli breakout.12 Suppose that E. coli is thought to have infected a small quantity of the country’s meat supply. The difficulty is that no one knows which batches of meat have been infected. If eating infected meat will cause the individual to become very sick, then the natural reaction is for everyone to immediately stop eating meat altogether. This will continue until the entire meat supply has been recalled and inspected. Subprime mortgage defaults were the E. coli that infected the financial system. Some mortgage assets would lose significant value as a result, but it was difficult to know which mortgage assets were \"infected\" and who was holding these assets.  The natural response was to pull back from these assets.\n\nIn a deposit run, when the quality of a bank’s assets is brought into question, depositors immediately withdraw their funds from the bank. In the case of the repo market, lenders raised the haircuts required for the repo loans or refused to roll over the repo loans collateralized by subprime mortgage assets. This is equivalent to a partial or a complete withdrawal of funds from the market by the lenders.13 In addition, the higher haircuts forced the owners of the assets to come up with additional cash which typically meant that they were forced to sell assets. Given that there was little appetite to purchase mortgage-related assets, high-quality assets had to be sold in order to raise this cash. This put downward pressure on the prices of these assets and increased the uncertainty regarding their future values leading to demands for higher haircuts on these assets, as well. The haircut spiral, can be seen in Chart 6. A fire sale dynamic developed, which depressed asset prices further leading to additional upward pressure on haircuts.\n\nThe rapid deleveraging of the shadow banking system as the run progressed led to a sharp contraction in credit. We saw this earlier in Chart 2 with the near complete collapse in the asset-backed security market. Banks were also adversely affected by this run on securitization markets since they used these markets as well to fund many types of loans. Several banks had to bring onto their balance sheets previously off-balance sheet entities that they had used to securitize loans. This used up balance-sheet capacity making it more difficult for banks to make up for the credit contraction going on outside of the banking system. The problems in the financial system spread to the real economy. When Lehman Brothers declared bankruptcy, a money market mutual fund—the Reserve Fund—\"broke the buck.\" The unanticipated losses incurred by the Reserve Fund expanded the bank run to the money market mutual funds. Since these funds were significant investors in the commercial paper market, this transmitted the strains to the commercial paper market. Dollar funding pressures were also increasing for firms operating outside the United States as their ability to access dollars through the foreign exchange markets began to become strained. The subprime \"E. coli scare\" had effectively been transmitted far and wide across financial markets.\n\nLet me turn now to the interventions used to combat the financial crisis. The Fed knew much less back in the autumn of 2007 than we know now about how far and wide the financial crisis was to spread and the implications this would have for the real economy. The initial response by the Fed was to use its traditional liquidity tools. On August 10, 2007, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) issued a statement indicating that the discount window was available as a source of liquidity to those firms that had access to the window. A week later, the FOMC cut the discount rate (the interest rate charged on discount window loans) by 50 basis points (a half of a percentage point) and extended the available term for these loans from overnight to 30 days. Given that the liquidity strains were affecting many firms that did not have direct access to the discount window, a key for this intervention to be helpful was that depository institutions would pass the liquidity on to those firms that needed it the most. Using the earlier forest fire analogy, it was as if the Fed could not drop water directly on the burning section of the forest; rather, it had to drop the water on an adjacent section of forest and hope that somehow the water got to where it was needed.\n\nSeveral problems became apparent with this strategy. First, few discount loans were being taken out. There is a history of \"stigma\" associated with borrowing from the Fed’s discount window. Given the high degree of uncertainty in the financial markets in the autunm of 2007, this stigma effect likely became amplified. Second, given uncertainty about their own future liquidity needs, banks developed a strong \"precautionary demand\" for liquidity. This implied that they were less willing to lend out liquidity to other financial firms. Finally, it was becoming increasingly difficult to assess the credit risk associated with lending to other firms even if only for short terms. To use a medical analogy, the progression of a fever can be measured by a person’s temperature. The progression of problems in the interbank lending market can be measured by the spread between LIBOR and the overnight index swap (OIS) rates for a given term. Chart 7 shows the 3-month LIBOR/OIS spread. Prior to the onset of the financial crisis, this spread had been very narrow. Very soon after the BNP Paribus announcement, the \"fever\" shot up dramatically.\n\nThe first new liquidity facility that was introduced to deal with these problems was the Term Auction Facility or TAF on December 12, 2007. The TAF program was designed to deal with the stigma problem associated with the discount window and also to make it easier for the New York Fed to sterilize the liquidity injections into the financial system. The TAF program auctioned off a fixed quantity of term funding to depository institutions using the same collateral to back up the loans as can be pledged at the discount window. Since the quantity of funding was set in advance, it made it much easier than for discount window borrowing to offset this liquidity injection. More important, however, was the design concept: term funding priced and distributed in a competitive auction would hopefully avoid any stigma for the winning participants of the auction. The TAF auctions were essentially a better way to dump more water on the same section of the forest  covered by the discount window. However, the fire was still burning elsewhere.\n\nThe inadequacy of the Fed’s traditional liquidity tools and their recent enhancement with the TAF came to the forefront in the spring of 2008. Conditions were deteriorating for several primary dealers, including Bear Sterns. The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (all of the governors are appointed by the U.S. president and confirmed by the Senate) decided to activate a little known or used section of the Federal Reserve Act—section 13(3)—which gives the Fed the ability lend to any \"individual, partnership or corporation\" in \"unusual and exigent circumstances.\"\n\nOn March 11, 2008, the Fed announced the establishment of the Term Securities Lending Facility (TSLF). This program allowed primary dealers to swap a broad range of what had become illiquid assets for Treasury securities that could be easily financed. This program leveraged the Fed’s large holdings of Treasury securities. The TSLF, however, came too late for Bear Sterns. On March 14, the Fed again using its section 13(3) emergency powers approved the takeover of Bear Sterns, the fifth largest investment bank, by JPMorgan Chase. Without the acquisition by JPMorgan Chase, Bear Sterns would have had to file for bankruptcy since they were essentially cut off from market funding. Two days later, on March 16, the Primary Dealer Credit Facility (PDCF) was introduced, essentially providing discount window access to all primary dealers in an effort to provide a backstop to their liquidity needs. Like discount window lending, PDCF loans had to be \"secured to the satisfaction\" of the Fed. Chart 8 shows borrowing from the PDCF in comparison to borrowing from the discount window. With the TSLF and PDCF, the Fed was now better able to direct water directly to where the fires were burning the hottest.\n\nAt the same time that the Fed was using its traditional liquidity and new liquidity tools, it was also aggressively cutting the federal funds rate, which is its primary instrument for stimulating the real economy. In the summer of 2007, the fed funds rate was at 5.25 percent. By March 18, 2008, the FOMC had reduced the federal funds rate by three percentage points to 2.25 percent—including two unusual 75 basis point reductions one on January 22, 2008, and the other on March 18. The FOMC was well aware of the impact that the financial crisis could have on the real economy and was actively trying to offset these adverse effects. The FOMC made an additional 25 basis point reduction in the federal funds rate on April 30, and then held the policy rate constant over the summer at 2 percent.\n\nThe Panic of 2007 turned into the Great Recession of 2008 following the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers on September 15 and the Fed’s emergency assistance to American International Group, Inc. In response, the Fed reduced the federal funds rate to essentially zero by mid-December, instituted swap lines to provide dollar liquidity to foreign central banks, added new liquidity facilities to target specific sectors of the shadow banking system and began to expand its balance sheet through asset purchases. To deal with problems in commercial paper market, the Fed introduced on October 27 the Commercial Paper Funding Facility (CPFF) to backstop issues of commercial paper. In an effort to restart the securitization market, on November 25, the Fed announced the Term Asset Backed Securities Loan Facility (TALF).14 In December, the FOMC announced that it would begin to significantly expand its balance sheet through purchases of long-term assets including agency debt, agency mortgage-backed securities and long-term treasuries – the Large Scale Asset Purchase or LSAP program. Other interventions were taking place directed by different agencies and in conjunction with the Treasury. At the same time, fiscal policy was engaging with Congress approving the $750 billion Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) program. Policy had entered the \"whatever it takes\" phase in an effort to keep the Great Recession from becoming something much worse.15\n\nBy the spring of 2009, the various guarantees and backstop liquidity facilities covering different sectors of the shadow banking system were in place. The last element required to deal with the Panic of 2007 was to address the uncertainty over the viability of the large systemically important financial institutions. A horizontal review of the 19 largest financial firms was conducted to assess their capital needs under a \"worse-than-anticipated economic scenario\"—this was called the Supervisory Capital Assessment Program or SCAP (you can tell that we are fond of acronyms).\n\nThere were two design features of the SCAP program that were essential for its ability to reduce the uncertainty in financial markets. First, the process was designed to be transparent with both the methodology published up front and the firm-by-firm results published at the conclusion. Second, if a firm was deemed to need capital but was unable to raise it in the market, Treasury pledged to provide the capital. The SCAP program was successful in restoring a degree of confidence in financial markets and in enabling these financial firms to raise capital on their own.\n\nBy the second half of 2009, the financial fever from the Panic of 2007 had finally broken with the 3-month LIBOR/OIS spread narrowing back to pre-crisis levels.16 The economy began to grow again. Having served their purpose, the Fed’s special liquidity facilities have been wound down. The policy focus has shifted to regulatory reforms and how to prevent a future financial crisis. To be successful, these reforms must deal with the run dynamics in the shadow banking system, as well as devise ways to limit the leverage cycle that is an integral part of asset booms and busts that can trigger a panic. If the lessons from the panics of 1907 and 2007 are incorporated into the reforms, we may well avoid the Panic of 2107.\n\n__________________________________________\n\n1 These views are my own and do not necessarily reflect the views of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York or the Federal Reserve System.\n2 Walter Bagehot, 1873.

        "content": "However, the context for this talk has shifted importantly with recent developments in financial markets. In particular, investors' concerns about sovereign risk in some European countries, with the attendant pressures on financial firms with exposures in those areas, have put renewed emphasis on liquidity provision and led the Federal Reserve and five foreign central banks to reestablish dollar liquidity swap lines.\n\nAccordingly, I will begin today with some remarks on recent financial market developments and the role of the liquidity swap lines. I will then turn to the TALF program, providing a review of its performance and assessing the benefits that it provided. Both of these programs provide important insights into the role of the central bank as a provider of liquidity, leading to a few observations and to a few questions that I believe warrant further exploration in considering future policy actions.1\n\nLiquidity Swaps with Foreign Central Banks\nThe second half of 2009 and the early part of 2010 were marked by substantial improvements in financial markets, ranging from short-term funding to longer term risk assets. There was good reason for those improvements: Efforts by the government to stabilize markets and support financial institutions were successful, and a virtuous circle appeared to be under way in which increasing optimism about the economic outlook and improving conditions in financial markets fed upon one another. The gains in asset prices were dramatic, with broad equity indexes reversing most of the declines experienced in late-2008 and early 2009 and with some measures of short-term funding spreads returning to pre-crisis levels.\n\nHowever, more recent developments have demonstrated that conditions in financial markets can change abruptly. These developments have been widely discussed at this point, and I will not go through them in detail, except to highlight the two broad themes in play.\n\nFirst, investors have become concerned about the fiscal positions of some European countries, leading them to re-price sovereign risk for those countries and to question whether austerity measures and other supporting efforts will prove sufficient to restore market confidence. Second, investors have increasingly worried about the exposures of European financial institutions to these countries and to European growth prospects more broadly. These uncertainties have led to sharp declines in the share prices of those financial institutions and have affected the ability of many of them to fund themselves in short-term credit markets.\n\nThe successful resolution of these problems ultimately rests on European policy actions. Those actions will determine the degree of fiscal adjustment that is required over time, the amount of fiscal support and risk sharing among European countries that is appropriate, and the extent to which European financial institutions are supported. The Federal Reserve had only a limited and supportive role in the policy response, taking steps to allow the European Central Bank and other foreign central banks to respond more fully to emerging liquidity pressures.\n\nThe liquidity pressures that have emerged stem from the balance sheets of European financial institutions. Those institutions still hold large amounts of dollar-denominated assets and finance a sizable portion of those holdings in short-term dollar-denominated funding markets. In the presence of concerns about the status of these institutions, investors have become more reluctant to extend term funding to many of them, putting upward pressure on term funding rates and forcing the firms to change their funding patterns.\n\nTo help prevent strains in dollar funding markets from intensifying and spreading, and hence creating more widespread pressure on financial markets, the Federal Reserve established liquidity swap arrangements with the Bank of Canada, the Bank of England, the European Central Bank, the Swiss National Bank and the Bank of Japan. These arrangements provide foreign central banks with the capacity to deliver U.S. dollar funding to institutions in their jurisdictions. The credit is extended by the foreign central bank against the collateral that each accepts, and the interest generated from those transactions is returned to the Federal Reserve.\n\nFrom the perspective of the Federal Reserve, the liquidity swap arrangements are safe. After all, the Federal Reserve is extending credit to the foreign central bank and not to the financial institutions that obtain dollar funding. The credit we extend to the foreign central bank is collateralized by foreign currency deposited with the Federal Reserve. Moreover, the operations do not involve any exchange rate risk for the Federal Reserve, because the swap transactions are unwound at the same exchange rate at which they are established.\n\nThere is currently only a very small amount of outstanding credit extended through the liquidity swap arrangements, in contrast to the dramatic usage that was observed during the financial crisis. The reason is that the circumstances surrounding the recent establishment of the swap lines differed from those in the middle of the financial crisis. During that earlier period, the need for dollar funding was more severe, and funding markets had become completely dysfunctional. The swaps were priced at rates that were well below those available in the market at that time, causing usage of the swap lines to rise dramatically to a peak of nearly $600 billion in December 2008.\n\nIn the current circumstances, although the swaps have been priced in the same manner as during the crisis, this pricing is less advantageous relative to the funding rates available in the market, limiting the usage of the swap lines at this time. The swaps were essentially put in place in a preemptive manner, under the view that their presence would provide a backstop for dollar funding markets and help to bolster market confidence.\n\nReflections on the TALF\nI am now going to switch gears and discuss the TALF, which is a liquidity program of a very different nature. Later this month, we will be holding our final subscription for the TALF. However, because no deals have been presented for review for the final subscription, we know that the extension of new credit under the TALF has effectively come to an end.\n\nAlthough the structure of the TALF differed considerably from the other liquidity programs initiated by the Federal Reserve, its basic role was similar in many ways to the traditional central bank function of providing liquidity to the financial system and encouraging the flow of credit. In this case, however, the program was geared toward providing support for market-based credit intermediation, as opposed to the traditional banking sector. More specifically, the TALF was designed to support the market for securitized credit.\n\nOverall, the TALF performed impressively in meeting that objective. The program contributed to a substantial improvement in conditions in the securitized credit market, facilitating an increase in the availability of credit to households and businesses. Moreover, it achieved this outcome with limited risk to the Federal Reserve's balance sheet.\n\nLet me begin with some general background information on securitized credit markets. Securitization is an important funding source for bank and nonbank lenders. When a lender extends credit, it makes the decision of whether to keep loans on its books or to securitize and sell them to other investors. If kept on the lender's books, the holdings have to be financed, either by borrowing or by using funds that could be deployed for other purposes, including making other loans. Thus, in many circumstances the lender finds it advantageous to sell assets through the securitization channel, allowing other investors to ultimately hold the assets and hence bear the risk. The amount of credit financed through securitization rivals that provided directly by banks. Indeed, even excluding the sizable securitization markets for mortgage credit, approximately $2 trillion in loans to consumers, students, and businesses were securitized over the past decade.2\n\nThe securitization market became significantly disrupted during the financial crisis in 2008 and 2009 in all areas outside of conforming agency mortgage-backed securities. Liquidity for securitized products deteriorated, leading to an unprecedented widening of spreads. Issuance virtually ground to a halt, resulting in significant funding concerns for a variety of lenders who relied on securitization. These funding strains prompted some lenders to dramatically tighten underwriting standards, thus reducing overall credit to consumers and businesses. A prolonged shutdown of the securitization market could have compounded the credit crunch and increased the risk of an even more severe contraction of the economy than we experienced.\n\nIn response, the TALF was created to provide liquidity in the form of term loans to investors in the least risky part—the AAA tranches—of particular types of asset-backed securities, including those backed by consumer loans, student loans, small business loans, and commercial real estate loans. The hope was that, by providing loans directly to investors against asset-backed collateral, the TALF would help stabilize and improve the prices at which those securities could be sold, thus reducing lenders' costs of funds. With lenders' funding strains alleviated, the extension of credit to consumers and other borrowers could occur on more favorable terms.\n\nWhile the TALF is essentially similar to other programs in its basic objective of providing liquidity and encouraging the extension of credit, it is worth highlighting that the TALF has several features that are not common in other liquidity facilities.\n\nFirst, TALF loans are non-recourse, meaning that the borrower can put the collateral to the Federal Reserve rather than repay the loan if the collateral value falls sufficiently below the amount owed. The provision of non-recourse loans helped to encourage investor participation. In late 2008, when secondary market spreads had spiked and risk aversion was high, investors were uncertain as to when and how the market would stabilize. Non-recourse lending helped place a floor on investor losses, thus increasing market confidence broadly and facilitating the return of structured product investors.\n\nSecond, TALF loans have considerably longer maturities than the lending from the Federal Reserve's discount window and its other temporary liquidity facilities. The term of the loans, which were either three or five years, was intended to more closely match the maturity of the underlying securities, as needed to encourage investors to return to the market. In addition, loans with longer terms were viewed as more effective, as financing would extend well beyond the expected end of the recession.\n\nThe combination of these two elements—non-recourse loans and long maturities—was critical to the success of program. Without one or the other, investors would have had exposure to short-term swings in risk premiums in a time of extreme volatility, which would have likely limited participation and thus reduced the program's effectiveness.\n\nA third notable feature of the TALF was that it was available to a wide set of market participants beyond the Federal Reserve's traditional bank counterparties. This feature reflected the program's broad focus on a financial market rather than a particular set of financial firms. Given the wide array of market participants, the program's broad reach was necessary to effectively support the entire market.\n\nLet me turn to the program's achievements. By providing liquidity and a backstop to limit losses to investors, the TALF contributed importantly to the revival of securitized credit markets. Secondary spreads narrowed significantly, and volatility moderated. Moreover, the improvements in the secondary market helped re-start the new-issue market. Issuance of non-mortgage asset-backed securities jumped to $35 billion in the first three months of TALF lending in 2009, after having slowed to less than $1 billion per month in late 2008. During those initial months that the TALF was in operation, about half of the issuance in the market was financed by the facility, with this degree of support then gradually declining as market function improved.3\n\nWhile each of the Federal Reserve's liquidity facilities was ultimately aimed at encouraging the flow of credit to the economy, the TALF may be distinctive in offering a more direct impact to the consumer. In fact, nearly all of the auto lenders supported by the TALF reported that the facility enabled them to offer more credit to consumers at lower rates. Lenders attributed this impact to the program's success in re-opening the securitization channel through which roughly half of consumer loans are financed.\n\nThe TALF also facilitated the first issuance of commercial mortgage-backed securities since mid-2008, which provided an important benchmark for pricing and helped establish the higher credit standards now seen in the market. These developments paved the way for subsequent commercial mortgage-backed deals to come to the market without TALF support.\n\nThe TALF accomplished these benefits while exposing the Federal Reserve to a limited amount of risk, as its design provides considerable protection. As I mentioned earlier, loans were made only against the highest rated asset-backed collateral.4 Moreover, TALF borrowers contributed significant capital in the form of a risk-based haircut, which means that the market value of collateral pledged exceeded the principal amount of the TALF loan. The prices of securities pledged to the facility have risen, giving the Federal Reserve an even larger cushion against loss, and no securities have been put to the facility to date. In addition, Treasury backstopped the facility by committing up to $20 billion to absorb any losses associated with the loans before the Federal Reserve would be at risk. And lastly, the interest earned on our loans is accruing, with about $400 million earned to date, and serves as a buffer against loss.\n\nThe risk to the Federal Reserve is also limited by the amount of balance sheet employed, which has been considerably less than envisioned at the height of the crisis. While $200 billion was authorized for the program, only approximately $70 billion in total was lent. Moreover, because loans were paid back as private credit markets improved, the maximum amount of credit extended under the program was about $50 billion. Today, there is about $44 billion of TALF credit outstanding.\n\nIt is worth considering why the program was able to achieve such significant market improvements with a limited amount of balance sheet. The success of the TALF may reflect that it targeted a market under severe stress, one characterized by extreme liquidity premiums that had caused asset prices to become detached from the underlying credit quality of the securities. Under those conditions, our involvement was able to have a substantial effect, in part by pushing those markets back toward more normal functioning and pricing.\n\nTo be sure, improvements in funding markets broadly and in the macroeconomic outlook during the course of the program clearly influenced the recovery of securitized credit markets. That said, the TALF lending mechanism has been widely credited with helping to jumpstart those markets.\n\nAs markets have improved and the liquidity premium on securitized credit has shrunk, the TALF has become a less appealing source of funding. Indeed, borrowers have been prepaying their loans as spreads have narrowed below the TALF lending rate. At this point, those asset-backed securities markets that were supported by TALF appear to be standing on their own. Going forward, the securitized credit markets will be shaped importantly by regulatory efforts, with some potential changes such as risk retention and transparency requirements still undecided.\n\nDefining the Central Bank's Role as Liquidity Provider\nLet me now turn to the broader issue of the appropriate role of the central bank as a provider of liquidity during periods of market strain. In effect, both of the programs I have just discussed expand the reach of the Federal Reserve's liquidity policies to a broader set of firms than those with access to our traditional discount window program. Moreover, the Federal Reserve launched a number of other facilities during the financial crisis that reached other types of firms and markets.\n\nThe scope and process for launching similar liquidity facilities in the future will be guided by the legislative efforts currently under way. Still, it is important for the Federal Reserve to reflect on what we have learned through our experiences so that we may better judge the actions that should be taken in the future within that legislative structure.\n\nThe liquidity programs that were launched by the Federal Reserve shared some common characteristics. In all cases, the programs provided credit in stressed markets, and for those facilities that offered credit at a predetermined interest rate, the rate was set at a penalty relative to normal market functioning. This approach yields several benefits.\n\nFirst, by acting in markets that are under stress, such programs have the scope to produce substantial improvements in market conditions. If they are seen as credible backstops, these programs can increase confidence and move financial conditions back toward normal levels. This feature was discussed earlier in the context of the TALF, in terms of the sizable market impact relative to the amount of risk taken.\n\nSecond, liquidity programs designed in this manner have a good chance of generating positive income for the central bank. The reason is that financing is offered at a time when market risk premiums are very high. The central bank therefore captures a high expected return relative to the actual risk it is assuming, especially when the lending is adequately collateralized to limit such risk. Indeed, the Federal Reserve is likely to make substantial returns from the liquidity facilities launched during the financial crisis.5 Achieving these returns, of course, was not an objective of the programs, but it does suggest that the Federal Reserve was prudent in the way in which it established these programs.\n\nThird, this approach gives the facilities a self-liquidating property. Loan rates are set at penalty levels that are not attractive in normally functioning markets. Given the scarcity of liquidity and the extreme movements of risk premiums during a crisis, the penalty rates are readily accepted by market participants in those circumstances. However, as the market gains confidence and returns to normal functioning, users of the facility have an incentive to stop borrowing from the central bank and to pursue better rates in private funding markets. In essence, pricing at penalty rates incorporates an exit strategy into the design of the programs.\n\nBut while the various liquidity programs shared these features, they differed in other dimensions, and it is these differences that prompt questions about the future scope and design of liquidity facilities.\n\nA primary question is whether liquidity support during times of stress should be offered only to banks or to a wider set of financial institutions. We have a financial system in the United States that is heavily dependent on nonbank institutions in the extension of credit to firms and households. Indeed, as noted earlier, the amount of credit provided by the securitization market has rivaled that provided by banks. Moreover, nonbank firms in many cases are just as vulnerable to liquidity pressures and run-like dynamics as are banks. Accordingly, there may be benefits to having the central bank extend credit to both banks and nonbank financial intermediaries during periods of financial stress. The experience with the TALF suggests that nonbank lending efforts can be successful at restoring market functioning and the flow of credit to firms and households.\n\nA second issue is the extent to which the Federal Reserve should be flexible in setting the structure of its liquidity programs to meet the needs of the market. As noted earlier, the TALF did this in several ways, including its extension of the duration of the loans beyond the short-term nature of most other liquidity facilities. That decision clearly improved the appeal of the program, suggesting that having some flexibility in structure can be beneficial. However, policymakers will have to decide the appropriate degree of flexibility to exercise in the future.\n\nOf course, both of those dimensions—having a wide range of counterparties and using a more flexible lending structure—have the potential to increase risk to the central bank. The TALF was able to offer credit on these terms without compromising the safety of the Federal Reserve's balance sheet by requiring sufficient collateralization of the loans and by relying on the loss buffer provided by the Treasury. Without the Treasury's contribution to the program, it would have been more challenging to design a program that was both appealing to the markets and safe for the Federal Reserve. Thus, a third open issue for future policies is determining the circumstances under which such cooperation between the monetary and fiscal authorities is appropriate.\n\nA final issue is that, if the central bank provides a back-up source of liquidity to the markets, whether through its traditional discount window function or these other facilities, it should consider the effects on the risk taking behavior of market participants. Efforts should be taken to ensure that expectations of the availability of Federal Reserve lending facilities do not lead to excessive risk taking on the part of financial institutions. In the case of banking institutions, this moral hazard is offset by appropriate supervision and regulation. Measures may be warranted for nonbank financial institutions if they expect Federal Reserve credit to be made available to them during times of stress.\n\nConclusion\nOverall, recent financial market developments serve as a reminder that the central bank's role as a liquidity provider can be critical during periods of financial stress.\n\nIn this speech, I discussed the reintroduction of the liquidity swap lines with foreign central banks and reviewed our experience involving the TALF—two programs that provide dollar liquidity to a broad set of counterparties. Our experiences with these two programs, and with the other facilities launched during the financial crisis, suggest that liquidity programs can be quite effective at restoring market functioning and facilitating the flow of credit to households and businesses. However, because these facilities differ from traditional discount window activity, they raise questions about the appropriate scope and structure of the Federal Reserve's role as liquidity provider.\n\nWe should continue to evaluate our experience with these facilities and with other liquidity programs to more clearly define an appropriate framework for providing liquidity to the markets in the future.\n\n__________________________________________\n1The views and opinions expressed are mine alone and do not necessarily represent the views of the Federal Open Market Committee or the Federal Reserve System.\n2Source: Morgan Markets.

        "content": "The four distinct phases of the recent crisis were as follows:\n\nOne consistent theme that emerges across all these phases is that central banks must have the ability to respond quickly and flexibly in a crisis situation. This ability is crucial in preventing the emergence of an adverse feedback loop between instability in the financial system and weakness in the real economy. Another theme that emerged as these phases played out, however, was that an ability to move with speed and flexibility comes with the challenge of ensuring that accountability and transparency keep pace with the actions being taken. The need for accountability and transparency is especially true when central bank actions are being used to innovatively fill holes in a regulatory and legal framework that has not kept pace with the evolution of the financial system.\n\n\"The complete evaporation of liquidity in certain market segments of the U.S. securitization market has made it impossible to value certain assets fairly regardless of their quality or credit rating.\"\n\nCentral banks immediately responded to the evaporation of liquidity in the standard manner. For example, the Federal Reserve issued a statement on August 10 indicating it was providing liquidity for the orderly functioning of markets, and in that statement the Federal Reserve emphasized that \"As always, the discount window is available as a source of funding.\"One week later it reinforced this statement with a 50 basis point cut in the discount rate and the addition of 30-day term loan to complement the standard overnight discount window loan.\n\nAt that time, the discount windows of Federal Reserve Banks were only open to depository institutions. Standard monetary economic theory and previous experience were consistent with the notion that depository institutions could act as intermediaries to pass liquidity through to the rest of the financial system. Indeed, in many earlier episodes the mere fact that this backstop liquidity was present had been sufficient to calm financial markets.\n\nCircumstances proved very different in this episode. For one, the rise of the shadow banking system meant that a preponderance of financial intermediation in the United States was being performed by non-depository institutions that funded themselves in wholesale rather than retail markets. Further, traditional discount window loans have always been vulnerable to stigma—that is, if a bank borrows from the central bank it runs the risk that markets and counterparties may infer that it is closer to insolvency than was previously thought.\n\nThe potential for stigma to damage the effectiveness of this crucial backstop facility explains why the identity of discount window borrowers is not disclosed by the Federal Reserve. Indeed, we saw early in this crisis that many depository institutions proved unwilling to take the risk of possible stigma, the result of which was an increasingly severe impairment to the flow of liquidity to the rest of the financial system. In late August 2007, a new facility was designed to help overcome stigma through the use of an auction mechanism. As the market calmed in September to late October, this facility was shelved but was ultimately introduced on December 12, 2007, as the Term Auction Facility in a coordinated announcement with other central banks.\n\nThis phase has some obvious lessons for financial stability.\n\nIn many respects these are old lessons that we should have learned already from what occurred in the run-up to previous episodes of financial crisis. However, the remarkable stability of the U.S. economy from the mid-1980s to 2007 unfortunately served to produce what amounted to a collective amnesia with regard to these earlier learned lessons. For example, most macroeconomists had become convinced that the widening and deepening of the financial system over the previous twenty years driven by deregulation, and given additional impetus by the return to low and stable inflation, was an important source for this economic stability.\n\nThis is not to say that there was no one pointing out the risks of the low risk premiums and the rapid growth of structured investment products, but many economists, analysts and commentators had reached the blissful state of mind that it was different this time. In this context, it is useful to recall an unease articulated by former Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan in 19962:\n\nThis uncertainty about the link between underlying fundamentals and current asset valuations is crucial to interpreting this initial phase of the crisis. For example, one relatively benign interpretation of what was playing out was that the financial system was experiencing a liquidity problem driven by a maturity mismatch in the shadow banking system. The liquidity problem was unusually severe because of the collapse of the shadow banking sector and the resulting pressures that collapse placed on the balance sheets and liquidity positions of the traditional bank sector. Nonetheless, the situation was fundamentally viewed as a liquidity problem rather than a solvency problem, meaning that any potential credit losses were likely to be small and easily absorbed.\n\nAn alternative darker view was that the global financial system was overexposed to land prices in the United States, through the home sale and mortgage refinancing boom that had taken place in the last four years. This darker view was given less credence, in part because the magnitude of the fall in U.S. nominal house prices necessary to produce a situation where the losses could not be easily absorbed was viewed by many as implausibly large. At that time, the conventional view was that by standard regulatory and accounting measures, most U.S. financial institutions had more than ample capital against the risks they faced. Furthermore, institutions were raising new capital to fill the reduction in accounting capital being produced by the write-downs associated with subprime related assets.\n\nTwo days later after the Federal Reserve announced the TSLF, Bear Stearns Co., the fifth largest investment bank in the U.S., ran out of cash to meet its obligations for the next day. Over the ensuing three days, the Federal Reserve, working with the Securities and Exchange Commission and U.S. Treasury, facilitated the takeover of Bear Stearns by JPMorgan Chase. The Federal Reserve used a lender-of-last-resort authority it had been granted in the 1930s under Section 13(3) of the Federal Reserve Act to facilitate the transaction. Further, on that Sunday, March 16, the Federal Reserve announced the introduction of the Primary Dealer Credit Facility (PDCF), an emergency extension of the standard discount window facilities to primary dealers.\n\nFinally two days later on March 18, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) cut the fed funds target by 75 basis points, bringing the total decrease in the target since the start of the crisis to 300 basis points. At that time, many saw this point as the peak of the crisis and assumed that the weaknesses in the financial and regulatory system would be fixed as the crisis subsided.\n\nAt this point, it is worth spending a moment to explain in a little more detail the basic elements of Section 13(3) of the Federal Reserve Act, a provision that had only previously been used for relatively small loans in the 1930s.4 Section 13(3) allows a Federal Reserve Bank to lend to any individual, partnership or corporation under the authority of a super-majority of the Federal Reserve Board in unusual and exigent circumstances, if adequate credit accommodations are not available from other banking institutions and if the Federal Reserve Bank is secured to its satisfaction. This last condition effectively represents the dividing line between lender-of-last-resort actions on one hand and capital injections or other forms of unsecured lending on the other hand, a critically important dividing line the Federal Reserve carefully respected in all its actions over the course of the crisis.\n\nOne lesson that emerges from this and later phases of the crisis is that while the Federal Reserve's authority and accountability for the 13(3) actions taken in March 2008 and throughout the crisis were well established under the Federal Reserve Act, what was crucially lacking was a public transparency regime that would allow the public to immediately track and understand the details of the extraordinary action taken. The complexity of creating a robust, responsible and safe transparency regime in the midst of rapid change and extreme market fragility notwithstanding, the fact that the public transparency of the central bank might lag the actions being taken by the central bank creates its own set of risks. In fact, the importance of transparency keeping pace with actions was actually the main theme of Greenspan's 1996 speech, where, just as an aside, he had coined the phrase irrational exuberance. One paragraph in particular seems particularly prescient:\n\nAnother lesson that emerged strongly in this phase of the crisis was the need for adding to the regulatory toolkit a robust and effective method for resolving complex financial institutions without imperiling the safety of the broader system. In the case of Bear Stearns, the presence of a willing acquirer presented the opportunity for an assisted transaction that effectively amounted to an ad hoc resolution mechanism for the failing firm. One sense in which this solution was ad hoc was that policymakers could not be sure that a willing acquirer would be found in the case of distress in the future, but another, perhaps more important sense is that the rules of the game were not clearly established in advance.\n\nIn this context, it is worth noting that the United States had led the world with its Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) Improvement Act in 1991 in establishing a state-of-the-art resolution regime for depository institutions to avoid the panics and runs associated with the risk of insolvency of a financial institution, while at the same time protecting the taxpayers. However, this regime did not address how to efficiently resolve holding companies that included a depository institution, investment banks or other financial institutions that were tightly and very intricately woven into the global financial system.\n\nPerhaps because many thought that March 2008 was the height of the crisis, the overwhelming importance of this lesson coming out of the Bear Stearns episode did not translate into this gap in our regulatory framework being addressed with sufficient urgency. As I will discuss momentarily, the gap re-emerged as a main accelerant of the crisis with the collapse of Lehman Brothers in September of that same year. Although, it is worth acknowledging in this context that Congress did approve legislation setting up a special contingent resolution process for the government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs) in the summer of 2008.\n\nA final lesson from this phase of the crisis was the critical need for policymakers to question the validity of the assumptions that are often taken for granted in assessing the risks to financial stability. For example, most macroeconomic models do not have an explicit banking sector. Thus, in simulations of the effects of house price declines, the main channel of propagation is an indirect one through a wealth effect on consumption. As house prices continued to decline at unprecedented rates, many analysts started to reconsider the adequacy of what had previously been considered ample capital in the U.S. banking system, and thus the extent to which this capital would be a firebreak against a significantly sharper contraction. If this firebreak was insufficient or perceived to be insufficient, then these analysts correctly anticipated that a vicious adverse feedback loop might take hold: declines in economic activity would make financial institutions reluctant to lend in order to conserve capital for possible credit losses, the decline in lending would further reduce economic activity and so on. This type of nonlinearity had not been part of pre-crisis evaluation of the risks of large house price declines, but by the spring of 2008, it was becoming a central concern.\n\nIt was unknown on September 16 just how quickly the panic would spread and how harmful it would be to the real economy. By the next evening it was already obvious that the panic had spread to prime money market mutual funds with devastating effects. These funds provided short-term financing to numerous firms and institutions through the commercial paper market. A myriad of other breakdowns were occurring as trust vanished from the global financial system. Against this backdrop, the request for the $700 billion Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) appropriation was made the next day.\n\nIn the short time it took Congress to pass the TARP appropriation, the panic continued to spread; on September 25, Washington Mutual, the sixth largest depository institution, was resolved by the FDIC and just days later Wachovia, the fourth largest bank holding company encountered severe funding difficulties and was eventually taken over by Wells Fargo. As with the need to place the two largest GSEs into conservatorship, it became apparent that much of the supposed ample capital in the U.S. financial system was not an effective bulwark against insolvency or the perception of possible insolvency. The latter possibility, whether true or not at its inception, can ultimately become a self-fulfilling prophesy if it results in a run on the financial system.\n\nThere are three broad forms of policy responses available to arrest the self-fulfilling prophesy dynamic that can take hold during a run on the financial system:\n\nBy early October 2008, it was apparent that a substantial escalation on all three fronts was required to give the financial system what was essentially a time-out in order to halt the self-fulfilling prophesy dynamics. It is useful to consider the analogy of the time-outs that parents give to their children when they are misbehaving. While the analogy is not appropriate in terms of the punishment aspect of time-outs for kids, there are a number of similar problems in establishment of a robust time-out strategy.\n\nFirst, how to define the boundaries associated with the time-out. In the case of arresting a run on the financial system, who does and who does not have access to the lender-of-last-resort, guarantees and capital injections? Next, can the parent/government credibly announce and then efficiently operate the time-out? Finally, as all parents are acutely aware, how does one build an appropriate exit strategy from the time-out?\n\nIn the second week of October there was no room for error on any of these strategic dimensions but instead of one unruly child and a parent playing out an enduring battle, a diverse set of policymakers were confronting a wide range of financial institutions with no experience with time-outs on either side.7 Further, full participation by systemically important firms was crucial due to the inter-connectedness of the financial system.\n\nThe solution for the efficient operation of the time-out was \"on the fly\" to combine the power of the FDIC to provide guarantees to liability holders of banks under the systemic risk exemption embedded in FDIC Improvement Act with two other authorities. The first was the U.S. Treasury's new ability to provide capital from the new TARP funds, and the second was the Federal Reserve's authority in unusual and exigent circumstances to flood the financial system with as much liquidity as it needed. In the latter case the appropriate measure of the escalation is not the actual amount of liquidity that was drawn from the Federal Reserve but the commitment to supply whatever was needed.8 \n\nThis commitment was captured succinctly in the minutes of the October 2008 FOMC meeting:\n\n\"...the Committee agreed that it would take whatever steps were necessary to support the recovery of the economy.\"\n\nThe time-out announced on October 14 was a critical success in terms of stopping the run on the global financial system, but it could not and did not address all the aspects of the crisis. The global propagation of the financial shock had already triggered an economic slowdown at least as abrupt as any during the Great Depression period. The underlying question was now how strong the adverse feedback loop would be between the rapidly deteriorating real economy and the condition of the banking sector.\n\nOne clear lesson from this phase was the need for formal coordination among the diverse authorities in the U.S. in establishing and maintaining financial stability. Another lesson that emerged was that some forms of regulatory and accounting capital were very weak defenses against the fear of insolvency. Both lessons are informing the ongoing work of regulatory reform and of enhancing the resiliency of the financial system through stronger capital and liquidity requirements.\n\nMeanwhile, the Federal Reserve was reacting with great speed to the deepening recession by cutting the fed funds target to its lower bound of close to zero, starting large-scale purchases of agency debt, mortgage-backed securities and treasuries, and introducing a facility to re-invigorate the securitization market.\n\nIt is important to understand that the objective of the Supervisory Capital Assessment Program (SCAP)—the so-called bank stress tests—was not to assess the solvency of the 19 companies. Instead the objective was to assess their capital needs under a deeper and longer recession than was the consensus in early 2009, and then require them to meet these capital needs in the very near term, before the adverse scenario developed. One important rationale for the program was that the presence of the additional capital would make the adverse scenario less likely. The credibility of this strategy was dependent on the availability of the U.S. Treasury's Capital Assistance Program to provide capital if the private market was unable to do so. Moreover, a brave decision was made to be transparent about the procedures the supervisors were using in their assessment and to pre-commit to disclose detailed results. In addition, the main measure of capital needs would be in terms of common equity rather than the preferred equity that was used in the U.S. Treasury's Capital Purchase Program.\n\nThe assessment process took just under three months to complete. It involved many innovations in the supervisory process that will continue to influence the approach to the supervision of large complex financial institutions in the future. The results of the assessment were striking. Under the more adverse scenario of a longer and deeper recession, the two-year loss rates on average across the 19 banks were projected to be as high as experienced during the Great Depression. Further, this average hid an incredible amount of heterogeneity across both banks and asset classes. Bank's ability to absorb such projected losses would depend on their ability to generate revenue in the future as well as on their current capital cushions. The assessment identified a net capital need of $185 billion based on the fourth quarter 2008 capital positions of the firms. After taking account of capital-raising actions already underway as well as the revenue generated in first quarter 2009, the net need for new capital was $75 billion spread across 10 of the 19 institutions. These capital needs were for the highest quality type—common equity.\n\nPerhaps the most striking outcome of the process was that a detailed publication of the results for individual banks proved to be confidence enhancing and served to help make banks \"investable\" again. Thus, a key lesson from the SCAP process was that, under certain circumstances, transparency about the methods used and a willingness to commit to disclosure of the results by public authorities can be a calming force.\n\nFinally, it is worth noting that while the financial crisis has taught us that financial institutions need high-quality common equity capital to absorb losses, that transparency and disclosure about their potential exposures are essential, it has not given any definitive indication of how much larger the capital buffers of financial institutions need to be to assuage worries about future tail events that can drive panics.\n\nAs the crisis intensified to unparalleled heights and without an efficient resolution process in place, the ability of the Federal Reserve, and then other governmental agencies after the TARP appropriation, to act with speed and flexibility was vital to stabilizing the system.\n\nHowever, hindsight is much less definitive on some of the lessons about the underlying stability of the financial system. In Alan Greenspan's thoughtful review of the crisis he summarized the issue this way:9\n\nThis motivates a final lesson coming out of this crisis, which is that policy making, whether it is fiscal, monetary, supervisory or other, must always strive to be as forward-looking as possible, and to be robust to the possibility that we will experience situations tomorrow that are unimaginable today."

        "content": "Chair Warren and Members of the Panel, thank you for giving us the opportunity to testify here today regarding the Federal Reserve Bank of New York's (New York Fed) involvement with AIG.\n\nI.The Decision to Lend to AIG\nOn the morning of September 16, 2008, it became clear to Federal Reserve and Treasury policymakers that AIG, then one of the world's largest insurance and financial firms, was facing a potentially fatal liquidity crisis. AIG's crisis was coming amidst the collapse of the housing market, within weeks of the receiverships of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, and within 24 hours of the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers. Confidence in the financial system was exceptionally fragile, and financial firms were taking dramatic and unusual measures to protect their balance sheets. Money market funds, long viewed as a safe investment by millions of Americans, were experiencing massive withdrawals. The run on these funds, in turn, severely disrupted the commercial paper market, a vital source of funding for American businesses. Securitization markets started to seize up, especially those that relied upon instruments backed by consumer loans. Banks sharply curtailed their lending.\nA full fledged panic had started and was spreading rapidly; the financial system was facing the threat of collapse.\n\nIn light of the circumstances at the time, a bankruptcy filing by AIG would have had disastrous consequences. Federal Reserve Chairman Bernanke has stated that it could well have \"resulted in a 1930's-style global financial and economic meltdown, with catastrophic implications for production, income, and jobs.\" Because of the decisions made that morning, we can never really know.\n\nLet us be clear, though, about the risks that the policymakers did know. Policymakers knew that AIG's largest creditors were other financial firms and that those firms clearly would have been directly impacted by an AIG bankruptcy filing. But the gravest risks were not the direct exposure of other financial firms to AIG. The gravest risks related to the indirect consequences of a bankruptcy of AIG, indirect consequences that would impact millions of Americans.\n\nAIG's role as one of the world's largest and storied insurance companies meant that its failure likely would have had a contagion effect, causing damage as it spread throughout the insurance industry. Policy holders would be hurt. Municipalities, who were already reeling from a lack of financing options for their building projects, would have seen their financial protection disappear. Workers whose 401(k) plans had purchased $40 billion of insurance from AIG against the risk that their stable value funds would decline in value would see that insurance disappear. Pension plans that had placed funds in AIG guaranteed investment contracts, or GICs, which function much like deposits in a bank, would have experienced significant losses, losses that would be passed along to retirees or to others whose aspirations to be retirees would surely have been changed.\n\nAnd these indirect consequences of an AIG bankruptcy would not have stopped at the U.S. border. AIG was global in scope. It conducted its operations in more than 130 countries, and across various parts of the financial industry, insurance as well as banking. The damage from an AIG filing would have been felt from the farms of Iowa to the streets of San Francisco to the far off corners of the world. The unplanned and chaotic bankruptcy of this trillion dollar financial conglomerate (especially a day after Lehman's filing) would have been a global catastrophe.\n\nThat catastrophe did not happen.\n\nMore than a year and a half later, it is easy to forget the level of panic and fear that gripped the world during the week of September 16, 2008. A bankruptcy of AIG would have fueled the fear, much as gasoline fuels a fire. And let us not forget what Federal Reserve and Treasury officials have said many times in testimony—we did not have the necessary tools, such as legal authority for a special resolution regime, with which to limit the damage of an AIG collapse.\n\nWe also did not have the luxury of time. AIG needed liquidity and it needed it that day. In the early days of the intervention, when we knew precious little about AIG, but knew that it needed billions of dollars, we were truly facing a binary choice to either let AIG file for bankruptcy or to provide it with liquidity. It is worth noting that this choice fell to the Federal Reserve because Congress had equipped it with an ability to lend to a non bank like AIG in extraordinary and exigent circumstances. Given AIG's situation on September 16, 2008, and given what had transpired over the preceding days and months, how could we responsibly not have lent pursuant to our statutory authority?\n\nWith authorization from the Board of Governors under Section 13(3) of the Federal Reserve Act, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York had the ability to provide liquidity to AIG by making a fully secured loan. The decision to activate the authority and lend was clearly justified on the merits but was difficult because of the collateral consequence, the moral hazard resulting from AIG's rescue. Within hours of the policy determination, the Federal Reserve took over the term sheet originally created by a private sector consortium of commercial banks. In the aftermath of Lehman's bankruptcy, the consortium was no longer prepared to lend to AIG. On the evening of September 16th, we advanced $14 billion in credit to AIG through a fully collateralized lending, and announced the term sheet for what would become an $85 billion revolving credit facility with AIG (Fed Facility).1 \n\nSome have asked why the Federal Reserve did not see the threat that AIG posed to the financial system before September 16th. The short answer is that AIG had hundreds of regulators, none of which was the Federal Reserve. The Federal Reserve had no regulatory authority over the firm—no authority over its capital, no authority over its liquidity, and no oversight over its control functions. The Federal Reserve was not engaged in supervision of AIG. It did not have the legal authority to do so. These roles and responsibilities remained with state insurance regulators, and with the comprehensive consolidated supervisor, the Office of Thrift Supervision. Throughout the weekend of September 13th and 14th we were assured by those regulators that a private sector consortium of commercial banks had a solution to AIG's liquidity problems, and we had no basis to question those assurances. But then Lehman filed for bankruptcy protection and the private sector consortium unequivocally stated that they were no longer prepared to lend to AIG.\n\nThe AIG situation is both different and similar to that of Long-Term Capital Management (LTCM), a hedge fund that nearly collapsed in the fall of 1998. In the LTCM situation, the Federal Reserve called together a private sector consortium made up of LTCM's major counterparties, who agreed to rescue LTCM by investing about $3.6 billion in new equity, in return for a 90 percent equity stake in LTCM's portfolio along with operational control. The counterparties made this decision after the Federal Reserve encouraged them to recognize their self-interest in saving LTCM. The consortium invested in LTCM because its members came to believe that the Federal Reserve staff was right. Several years later, when the investors received back all of their capital with interest, they came to see that the Federal Reserve was right. The market conditions in September 2008 presented a very different situation to AIG's counterparties who, in the aftermath of Lehman's failure, found themselves facing liquidity concerns that compelled them to maintain cash on their balance sheets rather than lend to AIG. Moreover, the unprecedented size of AIG's liquidity need—ultimately more than $150 billion—could not have been met by the private sector. There is, however, one very important similarity. We believe that we will receive full payment of principal and interest from AIG, much like the consortium did in LTCM.\n\nStill others have wondered why Lehman went bankrupt, while the Federal Reserve extended credit to AIG that prevented its default. The answer is that AIG presented a very different case. AIG had enough high-quality collateral to permit the Federal Reserve to extend a secured loan to provide liquidity to the firm. On September 16th, our focus was on providing liquidity so that AIG could meet its obligations and avoid default. To be clear, we were not making an investment in AIG; we were making a fully secured loan. We were not assuming management responsibility for the company; we were a lender to the company. The recently released Volukas Report shows in a thorough, exhaustive manner that an effective solution to Lehman required a strong merger partner that could provide much needed capital to ensure a going concern. While Federal Reserve and Treasury officials tried very hard to find that merger partner for Lehman, in the end we did not succeed as we had succeeded in March of 2008, when we brought in JPMorgan Chase to acquire Bear Stearns.\n\nAs a liquidity provider, we did not consider conditioning our lending to AIG on a requirement that the company obtain concessions from some of its major creditors. Conditioning our lending on AIG coercing certain creditors to agree to reduce the amounts due and owing from AIG would have been to ensure failure. The tactic would have undercut our primary goal in providing AIG with necessary liquidity—enabling AIG to pay creditors, maintain consumer, regulator, and counterparty confidence, and avoid default. A default would have triggered AIG's bankruptcy, with all of the systemic risk that bankruptcy would have entailed. While these tactics have been used in certain sovereign debt restructurings, they can be used there only because sovereigns cannot go bankrupt, and only with months of pre-planning.\n\nAny attempt to condition our lending would have created further uncertainty in a time of panic as to which of AIG's counterparties would get paid and which would be forced to take substantial losses. One of our objectives was to calm market participants, and uncertainty (and the allegations of favoritism that surely would have followed) does not do that—it fuels fear. Would the conditions extend only to AIG's Credit Default Swap (CDS) counterparties, or might the Federal government make value judgments as to other AIG contracts? Would senior unsecured debt holders be forced to take concessions? And most importantly, would a creditor who was pressed for a discount simply refuse and declare a default? Conditional lending would have heightened the risk of an AIG default, which is what we were trying to—and did—avoid.\n\nThe default risk would have been exacerbated by the credit rating downgrade that almost certainly would have followed any effort by AIG to coerce creditor concessions. AIG's failure to pay all of its contractual obligations in full would likely constitute a selective default resulting in a downgrade. That downgrade not only would have triggered potential terminations and collateral calls at AIG's Financial Products unit (AIG FP), but also would have resulted in substantial value destruction at AIG's insurance companies. Large annuity distributors likely would have stopped selling AIG products, replacing them with better-rated, more stable competitors. High-end life insurance sales would have decreased significantly, and remaining sales would have been vulnerable to adverse selection. Withdrawals and surrenders among existing customers would have increased, depleting cash reserves and creating pressure for asset sales at depressed levels. As a result of a downgrade, many of AIG's insurance companies may have been unable to write new business, and state and foreign insurance regulators may have begun seizing AIG insurance company assets in their respective jurisdictions. Conditional lending would not have allowed AIG to remain a going concern, but rather would have pushed it into bankruptcy.\n\nII.Continuing Pressures on AIG\nBy the end of September 2008, AIG had drawn $61 billion from the Fed Facility. While successful in providing AIG with the liquidity it needed to avoid default and bankruptcy in the short term, over the longer term AIG's borrowings from the Fed Facility were perceived by some to be potentially unsustainable. The company continued to experience pressing liquidity needs that necessitated rapid draws on the Fed Facility and concerns that AIG's needs might well exceed the facility's capacity. Even greater concerns arose out of the continued downgrade risk. The probability of a ratings downgrade was considered high unless the Federal Reserve took further action because the aggregate size of AIG's draws on the Fed Facility was greater than rating agency expectations—the rating agencies felt that AIG had too much debt—and AIG's expected third quarter losses, which were to be announced on November 10, 2008, far exceeded analyst estimates.\n\nAs discussed in Vice Chairman Kohn's testimony of March 5, 2009, in early October 2008, the Board of Governors approved an additional credit facility (the Securities Borrowing Facility) that permitted the New York Fed to lend to certain AIG domestic insurance subsidiaries up to $37.8 billion in order to allow them to return the cash collateral they received from their securities borrowing counterparties. Additionally, toward the end of October, four AIG affiliates began participating in the Federal Reserve's Commercial Paper Funding Facility (CPFF) on the same terms and conditions as other participants. The CPFF is a generally available program that involves the purchase, through a special purpose vehicle with financing from the Federal Reserve, of three-month unsecured and asset-backed commercial paper directly from eligible issuers.\n\nNotwithstanding AIG's access to these additional Federal Reserve credit facilities, AIG remained extremely vulnerable to the ongoing and intensifying financial crisis. Falling asset values generated both substantial losses on its balance sheet and increases in required payments to AIG's counterparties under the terms of its credit protection contracts. The liquidity crisis was not driven solely by AIG's need to meet collateral calls on its CDS; AIG also faced severe liquidity pressures arising out of its losses on residential mortgage backed securities (RMBS) in which its domestic life insurance companies had invested as part of its securities lending program. These factors undermined market confidence in AIG and again put its investment-grade credit rating at risk.\n\nTo address AIG's untenable debt burden, the Federal Reserve decided to reduce AIG's debt by transferring RMBS and CDO exposures from AIG's balance sheet to the balance sheets of the two Federal Reserve Limited Liability Companies (LLCs), Maiden Lane II and Maiden Lane III. The LLCs acquired these assets by paying to AIG the cash proceeds of certain loans and capital contributions made to the LLCs by the Federal Reserve and AIG respectively. On November 10, 2008, the Federal Reserve Board and the Treasury announced this restructuring of the government's financial support to establish a more durable capital structure, resolve liquidity issues, facilitate AIG's execution of its plan to sell certain of its businesses in an orderly manner, promote market stability, and protect the interests of the U.S. government and taxpayers. The details of this restructuring have already been the focus of an examination by the Treasury Special Inspector General for the Troubled Asset Relief Program. They have also been the focus of testimony before a number of committees in Congress, including Secretary Geithner and Thomas Baxter's January 27, 2010 testimony before the House Oversight and Government Reform Committees. A summary of the salient facts, however, follows.\n\nAs part of the November 2008 restructuring, Treasury invested $40 billion in newly issued Senior Preferred Stock of AIG under its TARP authority.2 In connection with that investment, the Federal Reserve modified the terms of the Fed Facility to be more sustainable: The maturity of the Fed Facility was extended to five years (due 2013), the maximum amount available was reduced from $85 billion to $60 billion, and the interest rate and commitment fees were reduced. The Fed Facility remained secured by substantially all of AIG's assets, and the company continued to be required to apply proceeds of asset sales to permanently repay any outstanding balances under the facility.\n\nAt the same time, the Board approved the establishment of an additional lending facility that would provide a permanent solution to the AIG securities lending program's losses and liquidity drains, thus eliminating the need for the Securities Borrowing Facility. Under the new facility, the New York Fed extended approximately $19.5 billion in secured, non-recourse credit to a special purpose limited liability company, Maiden Lane II, in which AIG would hold a $1 billion first-loss position. Maiden Lane II then purchased, at market prices, RMBS with a par value of $39.3 billion from certain AIG domestic insurance company subsidiaries. This facility allowed AIG to terminate its domestic securities lending program and to repay fully all outstanding amounts under the Securities Borrowing Facility, which was then terminated.\n\nThe Federal Reserve also took steps to help address the drain of liquidity on AIG arising from potential collateral calls associated with credit default swap contracts written by AIG FP on multi-sector CDOs. The New York Fed made a secured, non-recourse loan in the amount of $24.3 billion to another special purpose limited liability company, Maiden Lane III. Maiden Lane III then purchased, at market prices, multi-sector collateralized debt obligations with a par value of approximately $62 billion from credit default swap counterparties of AIG FP in return for the agreement of the counterparties to terminate the credit default swaps. AIG provided $5 billion in equity to Maiden Lane III to absorb any potential future losses on the CDOs held by Maiden Lane III. The Federal Reserve loans to Maiden Lane II and III have a term of six years and are secured by the entire portfolio of each LLC.\n\nIII.Ongoing Investment Management of the Maiden Lane II and Maiden Lane III Portfolios\nThe Panel has asked us to discuss the New York Fed's \"strategy for divesting its AIG holdings.\" We must emphasize that the New York Fed did not ever decide to invest in AIG. We cannot make such an investment. Our role has always been that of lender, although we are a lender that re-structured our original Fed Facility to accommodate AIG's changing circumstances. The New York Fed is the managing member of Maiden Lane II and Maiden Lane III, and, as set forth above, has control rights over the RMBS and CDOs that were acquired by these LLCs. BlackRock Financial Management Inc., an investment manager, has been retained to serve as the New York Fed's agent in managing the RMBS and the CDOs. The management objective for both is maximization of long-term cash flows to pay the New York Fed's Senior Loans to the LLCs (subject to certain fees, costs, and reserves that are senior to the Senior Loans), and refraining from investment actions that would disturb general financial market conditions. Distribution of all cash flows realized by the Maiden Lane II and Maiden Lane III occurs on a monthly basis.\n\nCash proceeds from the assets may be invested solely in U.S. Treasury or agency securities that have a remaining maturity of one year or less, U.S. 2a-7 government money market funds, reverse repurchase agreements collateralized by U.S. Treasury and agency securities, and dollar denominated deposits. However, in the case of Maiden Lane III, a broader range of assets may be acquired as part of a portfolio liquidation of one or more CDOs held in the Maiden Lane III portfolio.\n\nThe Maiden Lane II and Maiden Lane III assets continue to generate substantial proceeds, which are distributed monthly to pay down the New York Fed's Senior Loans to the respective Maiden Lane LLCs. While the New York Fed may direct its investment manager to sell Maiden Lane II and Maiden Lane III assets into the market at any time, as a practical matter, the value maximizing strategy has been largely to hold the assets to maturity while collecting interest income, and principal repayments. Currently, the hold-to-maturity expected proceeds of each LLC's portfolio are greater than the LLC's debt to the New York Fed. As of May 20, 2010, the balance on the New York Fed's Senior Loan to Maiden Lane II was $14.9 billion (inclusive of accrued interest), while the total asset value was $15.8 billion. The balance on the New York Fed's Senior Loan to Maiden Lane III was $16.6 billion (inclusive of accrued interest), while the total asset value was $23.4 billion. In sum, the LLCs have repaid approximately $13.1 billion of the loans made to them by the Federal Reserve. Based on the current performance of both portfolios, as well as our analysis of forecasts provided by our investment advisor, it is anticipated that the proceeds from both portfolios will exceed the principal and interest due on the New York Fed's Senior Loans to both Maiden Lane II and Maiden Lane III.\n\nWe expect to recover our principal and interest on the loans to the LLCs, and on the Fed Facility. The funds necessary to repay the balance of the Fed Facility will ultimately come from the cash proceeds of the AIA and ALICO transactions, cash AIG generates as it monetizes the non-cash sales proceeds of the AIA and ALICO transactions, the divestiture of certain non-core assets, and profit derived from AIG's core operating businesses. That said, our goal was never to make money—it was to avoid the systemic consequences that would have resulted from an AIG default and bankruptcy and to foster financial stability.\n\nIV.Conclusion\nIn all that the Federal Reserve has done, we have been motivated by two goals: to foster financial stability and to protect the U.S. taxpayer. Had we not acted to prevent an AIG failure, the financial crisis would have been substantially worse and even greater economic damage and suffering would have occurred. The decision to lend to AIG was a difficult one because addressing the systemic issues required us to provide liquidity to a non-banking company we did not supervise whose management had made poor business decisions. Still, our understanding of the consequences of an AIG failure left us no real choice.\n\nThank you again for giving us the opportunity to appear before you today. We look forward to answering your questions.\n\n__________________________________________\n1The Fed Facility was (and remains) secured by a pledge of a substantial portion of AIG’s assets, including ownership interests in the company's domestic and foreign insurance subsidiaries. As additional compensation for the Fed Facility, AIG agreed to issue to a trust for the benefit of the Treasury, preferred stock convertible into 79 percent of AIG's outstanding common stock.\n2In April 2009, Treasury restructured this investment and provided an additional preferred stock facility of $29.8 billion, of which only $7.5 billion has been drawn."

I am very grateful for the opportunity to speak here today in such a beautiful setting. It's nice to be back.\n\nEarlier today, I had the pleasure of meeting a few of you—in a smaller setting—to hear about your plans for after graduation; or should I say, tomorrow. I am very impressed with the high caliber of graduates in your class. I also had a tour of the campus today, which I must say has changed a lot in the past 30 years. One thing that hasn't changed, however, is the Palm Court—or as you all so affectionately call it, the \"center of the universe.\"\n\nI have very fond memories of my time at New College, aside from those great Palm Court parties. I received a terrific education and made some life-long friends. I hope the same has been true about your New College experience.\n\nI am especially grateful for the support from the faculty over the years—both while I was a student and afterwards. There are two people I would particularly like to highlight:\n\nJan Van der Veen—Jan was the professor who really got me started in economics.\n\nBob Bennedetti—Bob agreed to a contract in which I would get a semester of college credit mainly through working on the 1972 presidential campaign in the California primary election and in Ohio for the general election. Probably learned more from that experience than anything else I have ever done in higher education. I would encourage all of you—Republicans, Democrats and Independents—to get involved in public service at some point in your careers.\n\nI have many memories of New College—some about people such as Jan and Bob, and others about events and experiences. For example, one of the most remarkable events I have ever witnessed occurred here one night in December 1972—the first Apollo spacecraft night launch. I remember staring out from the top of a dormitory roof not far from here across the horizon looking at the star specks —wondering, is that the rocket? When it actually came up over the horizon it truly was amazing. I remember it as no bigger than a half-inch gap between your thumb and index finger at arm's length. And as the liftoff proceeded and the vapor trail started to decline over the horizon following the curvature of the Earth—I really could see clearly that the world was truly round. Maybe that's a good metaphor for my New College experience!\n\nMy only truly unpleasant memory here was one literature course (student taught, I might add) in which I received an evaluation that essentially noted that I could not read, write or think. I like to think that was a bit harsh, but everyone is entitled to their own opinion!\n\nNew College truly is a special place. I like to call it \"graduate school for undergraduates\" because it really is a place that encourages students to intellectually engage, learn, think and communicate.\n\nThe unstructured format of evaluations and contracts rather than grades is not for everyone—some folks need more structure. But I see that you have made it through and I congratulate you for that—it is an important milestone in your life.\n\nToday, I want to talk about two issues: the economy you face as you graduate, and some advice—call it \"lessons learned\"—that might have some value to you as you contemplate what you are going to do with the rest of your life.\n\nThe Economy You Face as New Graduates\nThe U.S. economy is recovering and we are now seeing the first signs of significant employment growth. Thus, this is a better year to graduate than last. However, finding a job will not be easy—the unemployment rate is much too high—nearly 10 percent. And the recovery seems likely to be more sluggish than we would like.\n\nThe economy is suffering from the hangover of the real estate and consumption boom that ended a few years ago. That boom collapsed beginning in mid-2007. The result was a very deep downturn from which we are now only emerging.\n\nAlthough the Federal Reserve has been aggressive about easing monetary policy to support economic activity, the recovery is not likely to be as robust as we would like for several reasons.\n\nFirst, households are still in the process of deleveraging. The housing boom created paper wealth that households borrowed against. This pushed the consumption share of nominal gross domestic product to a record high of about 70 percent. When the boom turned into a bust, those paper gains evaporated. In fact, many households now find that the value of their homes is less than the amount of their mortgage debt. This has created a difficult time for many families and has caused the hangover to last longer.\n\nSecond, the banking system is still under significant stress. This is particularly the case for small- and medium-sized banks that have significant exposure to commercial real estate loans. This stress means that banks have been slow to ease credit standards as the economy has moved from recession to recovery.\n\nThird, some of the sources that have supported the nascent recovery are temporary. The big swing from inventory liquidation during the recession back to accumulation will soon end as inventory levels come back into better balance with sales. And fiscal stimulus from the federal government is subsiding and will soon reverse.\n\nCoupled with the benign outlook for inflation, these headwinds to growth and employment explain why the Federal Reserve is keeping short-term interest rates unusually low. We want to do all we can to support more rapid economic and employment growth, subject to keeping inflation low and stable, and inflation expectations well anchored. The situation has improved and total employment is now growing—for example, U.S. payrolls rose by 290,000 last month. But we are still far from where we want to be.\n\nIn this environment, finding a job will be tough, but when you hit the pavement remember that the job market is improving. Don't get discouraged. Get your foot in the door by doing something productive, even if it may not be exactly what you want to do for the rest of your life. Gaining knowledge and experience is what is important at this point. The first job out of college is a foot on the ladder—the job doesn't have to be perfect to be valuable to you.\n\nA Bit of Advice\nIn terms of your career, my first bit of advice is: don't rush. There is plenty of time for your careers to unfold. It's not a sprint, it's a marathon. I didn't really start my career until I went to work for the Federal Reserve Board at 28 after graduate school and didn't begin working on macroeconomics until I joined Goldman Sachs when I was 33.\n\nWhen I entered the job market from New College in the fall of 1974—the economy was in recession. I interviewed for many jobs, and I was told that I was overqualified for a few and under qualified for many. I eventually got a job as a methods analyst, which is essentially an internal efficiency consultant. It wasn't much, but it was a start and I went from there. My second bit of advice is to take the time to find out what really interests you. This means you may want to try a few different things before settling on a particular career path. When I left New College I certainly didn't know where I was headed. I only made the decision to become a professional economist two years later when I was deciding between law school and economics. And I didn't decide to opt for more policy-related work rather than become an academic until I entered the job market from Berkeley five years later.\n\nThe important point is that if you like what you are doing, you almost certainly will be successful at it.\n\nMy third bit of advice is to be true to yourself. It is a lot easier to keep things straight and be happy if your public persona and private persona are not in conflict—you are one integrated person.\n\nBeing true to yourself also means facing up to problems and mistakes early. Early on in my career as a professional economist, I got involved in writing a paper about tax reform with the head of the firm's research department. The night the paper went to the printers, I woke up with complete clarity that there was a mistake in the paper. The mistake did not affect the conclusions of the paper. It just slightly changed all the numbers and was obscure enough that no one would probably catch it.\n\nWhat to do? I decided to take my medicine. I walked into the office of my co-author the next morning and said that we needed to throw out the 10,000 copies of the paper that had been printed. The head of research—Leon Cooperman—was known for his—let me say this delicately—strong personality. But rather than blowing up at me, he said fine, let's fix it.\n\nFacing up to the error must have actually worked in my favor since I won his respect. A few months later, he introduced me to Robert Rubin—who, as you know, went on to become the U.S. Secretary of Treasury. And through Robert Rubin I met all sorts of interesting people in the Clinton administration.\n\nMy fourth bit of advice is to continue to build your human capital. That means seeking out jobs and opportunities that give you new experiences and skills. Keep up with your mentors and continue to cultivate relationships and build your network. Education isn't just about college course work, it should be a lifelong experience. If your employer asks you do something new—don't shy away from it. Instead, think of it as a wonderful deal: Your employer is going to pay you to deepen your skills and knowledge base. You will be paid to become more valuable.\n\nFor me, the ability to build my human capital has happened—in spades—several times. The first occurred here at New College and at Berkeley for graduate school. Here I learned to really read critically and how to write—the one literature course that I mentioned earlier notwithstanding.\n\nThe second was the opportunity early on in my career to become involved in macroeconomic forecasting and policy analysis. Up to that point, I had been a regulatory economist. I had only taken one course in macroeconomics in graduate school and it was the only course on which I received a \"B\" grade—I had not revealed any great affinity for that subject. At first, the work was stressful. When people asked me questions, I wasn't sure whether I was supposed to know the answers or not. At first, I felt quite ignorant, but eventually that passed.\n\nThe third was when I was asked to head the Markets Group at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York at the beginning of 2007. It was an unexpected opportunity for public service after spending the bulk of my career in the private sector. The Markets Group is the operational arm of the Federal Reserve System. It helps to have an economics background, but it was a very different task managing 300 people who worked in many complex businesses ranging from Treasury auctions to providing services to foreign central banks. And, when the financial crisis began in earnest in August 2007, the learning curve accelerated sharply.\n\nAnd the fourth was when I had the opportunity to succeed Timothy Geithner as president of the Bank in January 2008. Now it is 3,000 people, not 300 to manage and a much wider set of responsibilities.\n\nSome of the most interesting parts of the job have been getting troubled financial institutions onto a stronger footing so that these firms could provide greater credit and support to the U.S. economy. Obviously, working closely with Chairman Ben Bernanke and my Fed colleagues at the Board of Governors and around the other 11 Reserve Banks has also been particularly rewarding.\n\nEach time, the opportunities helped me broaden my knowledge and skills. My career benefited as a consequence.\n\nIn implementing this advice, it also helps to have lots of good luck. In that regard, I have been blessed. Think of the chain of events for me to get my \"dream job\"—head of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. I had to decide to leave Goldman Sachs at the end of 2005; be asked by Timothy Geithner to be head of the Markets Group in 2006 and be smart enough to take him up on his offer; Barack Obama had to win the presidential election; Tim had to be selected to be Treasury Secretary; and the Board of Directors of the Bank in collaboration with the Board of Governors in Washington, D.C., had to agree on me as Tim's successor. If you ever thought that train of events was even remotely likely, I think you would have been considered delusional!\n\nMy final piece of advice is the most important one: Don't forget all that they have taught you here about thinking critically and speaking up.\n\nSo, let me sum up. Go into the job market with enthusiasm and don't be daunted by the inevitable rejections. That's part of the process of getting started. Don't feel in a rush to figure out all the details of your career. If you are true to yourself, continue to build your human capital and don't forget everything that they have taught you here, I know that you will meet with every success."

        "date": "Apr 14, 2010",
        "speaker": "Unknown",
        "url": "https://www.newyorkfed.org/newsevents/speeches/2010/dud100414",
        "content": "The past few years have been an extraordinary time for policymakers. We have been very aggressive in providing support to the economy and it now appears that we are emerging from a deep and protracted recession. Economic activity expanded over the second half of 2009, suggesting that a recovery has begun. While we continue to receive encouraging news, growth is likely to be muted compared with the early stages of past recoveries. As a result, the unemployment rate is likely to decline over the near term at a very gradual pace, if at all.\n\nIn the labor market, employment has begun to expand. We hope this is the beginning of a sustained period of job growth. Total employment shrank by roughly 8 million jobs since the peak of the cycle, and the current unemployment rate of 9.7 percent remains unacceptably high.\n\nAt the regional level, here in the New York—New Jersey region, the labor market was not hit as hard as in many areas in the country, and the pace of job losses in our region has eased. Nevertheless, the unemployment rate in New York and New Jersey has risen to levels not seen in almost two decades.\n\nIn New York City, employment has typically recovered more than a year later than the recovery of national employment and has, in the past, been led by a recovery of Wall Street employment. Although Upstate New York has seen little overall job growth for the past several decades, job losses in this downturn were not as severe as losses for the nation, in part, because the upstate metro areas did not experience a boom-and-bust housing cycle. In addition, Puerto Rico, which is also part of our District, has experienced a considerably longer and deeper downturn than the mainland or this region.\n\nBefore I continue, it is important to explain the integral role of the Federal Reserve System in regional economies across the country. One of our key responsibilities here at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York is to connect the Federal Reserve System to Main Street across our District. Real activity takes place on Main Street in the form of the millions of decisions made every day by households and businesses around the country. When we talk to them, we learn how firms and consumers are experiencing the economy.\n\nThat essential insight from Main Street informs the policy decisions that we make in pursuit of our goals of stable prices, full employment and financial stability. Staying connected with Main Street is also important because the effectiveness of our policy actions is enhanced when private actors have a clear understanding of what our actions are intended to accomplish. For these complex policy decisions, the Federal Reserve System needs accurate and timely information on business and financial conditions, and the perspectives of participants in markets throughout the United States.\n\nEconomic conditions often differ in various parts of the country, and it is important that the Fed takes all of this into account when it formulates policy. This input is particularly important for the Second District of the Federal Reserve, where we sit today, because the forces that drive economic conditions here often do not mirror the forces driving other regional economies.\n\nIn order to monitor and understand the various aspects of local economic conditions, we utilize a number of different measures. Two of these measures we have developed here at the New York Fed—a survey of manufacturers and indexes of economic activity. We regularly produce the Beige Book and report information on local credit conditions. These measures supplement and extend the understanding gleaned from public data sources. We also seek input from regular meetings with several advisory groups representing different facets of the District’s economy—such as our Small Business, Upstate New York and Thrift Institutions panels—and from interactions with key academic researchers at local universities and public policy organizations.\n\nWe recognize that timely and accurate information about our region, which is highly valuable to us, can also help to reduce uncertainty and inform the economic and financial decisions of regional residents, businesses, communities and governments. To that end, we make our various regional measures and analysis available to the public through our website and a variety of outreach activities. These activities include making presentations on topics of current concern to business and community organizations throughout the District.\n\nWe welcome you here today to brief you on our views of the current state of activity and employment in the regional economy and to review the rich portfolio of resources that we make available to help monitor economic conditions across the region."

        "title": "Asset Bubbles and the Implications for Central Bank Policy",
        "date": "Apr 7, 2010",
        "speaker": "Unknown",
        "url": "https://www.newyorkfed.org/newsevents/speeches/2010/dud100407",
        "content": "As I see it, we need to reexamine how central banks should respond to potential asset bubbles. After all, recent experience has underscored the fact that poorly regulated financial systems are prone to such bubbles and that the costs of waiting to respond to an asset bubble until after it has burst can be very high.\n\nToday, I will try to define some of the important characteristics of asset price bubbles. I will argue that bubbles do exist and that bubbles typically occur after an innovation that has created uncertainty about fundamental valuations. This has two important implications. First, a bubble is difficult to discern and, second, each bubble has unique characteristics. This implies that a rules-based approach to bubbles is likely to be ineffective and that tackling bubbles to diminish their potential to destabilize the financial system requires judgment.\n\nDespite the fact that it is hard to discern bubbles, especially in their early stages, I conclude that uncertainty is not grounds for inaction. Instead, the decision whether to act depends on whether appropriate tools can be deployed to limit the size of a bubble and whether the benefits of acting and deploying such tools are likely to exceed the costs.\n\nThat cost-benefit calculus, in turn, depends crucially on the tools we can deploy to limit the growth of bubbles and the consequences when they burst. In this respect, I will argue that, in most cases, use of the bully pulpit and macroprudential tools, such as rules limiting loan-to-value ratios or leverage, are likely to prove superior to monetary policy.\n\nTurning to the first issue of whether there are asset bubbles, I am going to be a bit of a heretic and argue that there is little doubt that asset bubbles exist and that they occur fairly frequently. By an asset bubble, I mean price increases (or declines) that become unmoored from fundamental valuations. I want to be clear that I am distinguishing this from price movements that are tied to changes in fundamentals. I know this runs afoul of the efficient markets hypothesis—which in this context would argue that if a bubble were obvious, then people would take the other side and the bubble would not occur in the first place.\n\nThere are several reasons why this argument does not hold in practice. First, it is not always easy to take the other side. There may be constraints on the ability to short the asset in question. Such limits on the ability to short sell can arise for many reasons. For some assets, short selling in size might simply not be possible because the markets are not sufficiently developed. Also, even if there were instruments that can be used to go short, it may not be an easy trade to undertake. For example, if a bubble builds up over many years and market participants’ compensation is based on year-to-year performance, there may be disincentives to take the short side. Compensation schemes and other practices that skew incentives may create a bias to simply “trade with the market.”\n\nSecond, bubbles may simply emerge from the way market participants process information and trade. Experimental work done by behavioral economists has shown that people often trade in ways that generate price bubbles. In many carefully controlled experiments in which the intrinsic value of the asset could be determined with certainty, participants still bid prices up far above fundamental valuations, with the bubbles being followed by sharp declines in prices.\n\nLet me give you an example of one of the seminal studies of this type. In this experiment, all investors start with an identical asset that pays the same dividend generated from a known probability distribution at the end of each trading period.1 This means that all participants know the expected value of the dividend stream with certainty. The participants are allowed to buy and sell these assets from one another. In this framework, if all participants were fully rational, then trading should occur only at intrinsic values based on the expected dividend stream. But this is not what happens in practice. In 14 of the 22 experimental runs, prices rose significantly above fundamental valuations and these price bubbles were followed by crashes. When traders in these experimental runs were “experienced,” meaning that they had participated in the experiment before, the probability of a bubble was reduced, but not eliminated. The authors conclude: “What we learn from the particular experiments … is that a common dividend and common knowledge thereof is insufficient to induce initial common expectations. …” The lack of common initial expectations leads to a willingness to trade to try and earn capital gains above fundamental value.2 Relaxing the conditions in these types of behavioral studies to admit more uncertainty about fundamental asset valuations works to enhance the propensity for bubbles by increasing the degree of divergence in participants’ initial expectations.\n\nLastly, over the past few decades, there simply have been too many episodes in which asset prices have dramatically overshot on the upside and then violently corrected to suggest that the behavioral studies conducted in the laboratory do not also have real world counterparts. In the United States, these include the run-up in the value of the dollar in the mid-1980s, the stock market rise and crash in 1987; the compression of spreads due to convergence trades in the run-up to the Long-Term Capital Management debacle in 1998; the technology stock market boom of the late 1990s; and the credit and housing price bubble and crash of recent years. All these episodes were marked by spectacular price booms, followed by subsequent collapses.\n\nAn examination of some of these recent bubbles suggests that while asset bubbles are idiosyncratic in terms of their causes, institutional features, duration and severity, they often share several significant features. These shared features are important in assessing how policy might be used to temper incipient bubbles in the future.\n\nIn my view, asset bubbles often come about through a particular sequence of events. First, there is typically an innovation that changes the fundamental valuation in a meaningful, but uncertain way.3 Asset valuations associated with the innovation change (as they should), but there is significant uncertainty about how valuable the innovation will turn out to be. This leads to a divergence in expectations concerning how much the fair value of the assets should increase. I believe that this uncertainty about what constitutes fair value is important in fueling the bubble.\n\nFor example, the technology stock market boom in the late 1990s coincided with the development of the Internet, which fostered the reorganization of many business processes and generated significant productivity improvements. At the time, it was unclear just how significant the innovation would be or how successful the companies would be that sought to take advantage of it. On the one hand, there were companies such as Cisco, which sold the “shovels”—the routers that enabled the Internet to work—that were very successful. On the other hand, there were companies such as Webvan, which sought to use the new technology to revolutionize the delivery of grocery supplies and services, and that failed miserably.\n\nSimilarly, the recent housing boom was driven by two innovations: (1) in housing finance, where subprime lending made mortgage credit available to households that were much less creditworthy, and (2) in structured finance instruments such as collateralized debt obligations (CDOs). The first innovation significantly broadened the availability of mortgage credit to households. The second innovation reduced the cost of this credit. Cash flows from the underlying mortgage assets were apportioned among senior and junior tranches. These tranches, which had been rated by the rating agencies, were then distributed to a wide range of investors. This structured finance innovation, in turn, was supported by innovations in the shadow banking system. Securities lenders, structured investment vehicles and conduits bought the highly rated tranches of the structured financed products and financed these assets in the wholesale short-term funding markets.\n\nThe second element common to many asset bubbles is a surge in economic activity in the particular sector associated with the innovation. In the case of the technology stock market boom, there was a surge in business investment in technology goods and services. In the subprime/structured finance boom, there was a surge in demand for housing as credit availability increased sharply. This surge in activity is important because it reinforces the notion that the innovation is indeed significant and that “this time is different.”\n\nThird, there is often a positive feedback mechanism that tends to reinforce the belief system that underpins the extreme valuations associated with the boom. Without this, the boom isn’t likely to persist for long or push valuations far above what is justified by the fundamentals. As a result, the asset price movements are unlikely to be big or broad enough to threaten financial and macroeconomic stability.\n\nDuring the technology stock boom there were a number of reinforcing mechanisms. One important reinforcing mechanism was the strong notion that those who got to the market with their new Internet innovations would achieve large first-mover advantages. This perception was due to the fact that successful Internet-based models could expect to achieve strong network effects, which created significant barriers to entry and the prospect of extraordinary profits. Amazon might be a good example of a company that (eventually) succeeded at this.\n\nIn this environment, many firms—both well-established companies and start-ups—invested heavily in the new technology. The ensuing sharp rise in investment in technology equipment and software led in turn to rapid earnings growth, which helped (for a time) to sustain stratospheric valuations.\n\nIn addition, the sharp rise in stock prices led to a re-assessment of the appropriate equity risk premium. The higher that stock prices rose, the more people thought that equities had little risk. Everyone could become a millionaire with little risk or effort.4\n\nSimilarly, in the subprime/structured finance boom, there were several important positive feedback mechanisms. In particular, the surge in credit availability drove up the demand for housing and pushed up housing prices. This increase in demand caused the default experience associated with such lending to be very low, reinforcing the notion that subprime lending was not very risky. It also reinforced the demand for the complex CDOs secured by such assets. During the boom, the structured finance models appeared to be sound because losses on the underlying subprime mortgage loans were low and because the correlation rates in performance across different assets in the pools were low, just as the models had assumed.\n\nFourth, the proportion of market participants who believe that a particular episode of asset price increases are justified by the innovation tends to rise as the boom persists. Those that had doubts about the importance of the innovation or the persistence of the gain in asset prices lose confidence in their opinions as they underperform and lose business and market share. Those who believed that the large gains in asset prices were justified by the innovation and who benefited from those beliefs become more dominant. Casual investors see the large rise in prices and jump in. This shift is important because, in markets, prices are driven by the marginal investor. As new and often less well-informed investors plunge in to participate in the boom, they can overwhelm the so-called “smart money” that gets frustrated after having lost repeatedly trying to take the other side.\n\nIn this respect, a bias toward optimism may also play an important role. Studies have found that most people believe that they are above average in terms of their acumen, be it as investors, car drivers or in other activities.5 This overconfidence may cause some people to keep investing in the asset, even when they are skeptical about its valuation because they are overly confident that they will anticipate the end of the bubble and be able to get out in time.\n\nFifth, asset bubbles occur more easily when it is difficult to short the assets. For example, the technology stocks associated with initial public offerings were very difficult to short because the available supply or “float” was small—a high proportion of the shares in the companies were held by the original venture capital investors and subject to lock-up periods before the shares could be lent out to short sellers or sold. Similarly, housing is notoriously difficult to short. The option of selling one’s home in order to rent is expensive not only in terms of time and effort, but also in terms of transaction costs. And, shorting complex structured finance products was difficult because there were no standardized instruments; the securities rarely traded and were very difficult to value. It was not until the development of the ABX indexes—which allowed investors to buy and sell credit default swaps on pools of structured finance obligations—that investors had a vehicle that allowed them to short subprime mortgage-backed securities more easily.6\n\nAsset bubbles often come to an end when the basic belief system is contradicted by events. This can happen very naturally as a matter of course because economic fundamentals deteriorate, or because there is a change in rules or regulations that disrupts the balance between supply and demand. In the technology boom, this might occur because each company cannot get to the market first. So even if there is a first-mover advantage, not everyone will be able to take advantage of it. Over time, the failure to achieve first-mover status becomes evident and valuations adjust to reflect this, or lock-up provisions on Internet stocks expire, leading to a large increase in supply that leads to a sharp fall in prices.7\n\nIn the housing boom, the end came about for several reasons. One limiting factor was that the rise in home prices outstripped income growth. Thus, for the boom to persist, underwriting standards had to be continually relaxed; only in this way could a new cohort of first-time buyers qualify for big enough mortgages to be able to “afford” to buy their homes. The difficulty in replenishing the pool of new home buyers limited how fast demand could keep rising. In addition, the rise in home prices led to an explosion of supply especially in areas like Arizona, Florida, Nevada and inland California, where buildable land was plentiful.\n\nAs supply caught up to demand, this led to a downturn in prices. Once this occurred, the poor underwriting standards associated with subprime mortgage lending became apparent. Subprime borrowers could no longer easily refinance or sell the house at a higher price and repay the original mortgage. As Warren Buffett reportedly once quipped: “Only when the tide goes out do you discover who has been swimming naked.”\n\nSo what does this analysis imply for a central bank that might want to limit the development of such bubbles? The first conclusion is that assessing whether there is a bubble or not or the size of the prospective bubble is going to be very challenging. Because there is an innovation, asset values should rise, but by how much? It is difficult to assess what is the new, appropriate valuation after an important innovation. For example, consider some questions that might have arisen relative to the technology bubble: What does the Internet mean for technology investment? How many of the new business startups will survive and prosper? Is an Amazon rare? How fast will the volume of Internet traffic grow and for how long?\n\nSimilar questions arose with respect to the recent housing bubble: How much will subprime lending increase the demand for housing? How will this increase in demand translate into prices? What will the default rate be once demand growth slows? What is the appropriate correlation rate in terms of the loss experience across the different subprime and Alt-A mortgage pools that should be used in assessing the value of collateralized debt obligations? How are such correlations likely to differ in the boom versus in the bust?\n\nThis uncertainty means that policymakers can never be sure about the existence, size or persistence of an incipient asset bubble. As a result, this task of dealing proactively with bubbles will be very difficult!\n\nSo what should the policymaker do? I think the first step is for the policymaker to work hard to investigate what is generating the sharp rise in prices for the asset in question. Sustained price increases are a symptom of changes in demand and supply. The policymaker needs to develop a perspective about whether these demand and supply changes are realistically sustainable to the extent implied by market prices. In particular, carefully analyzing the assumptions that underpin sustained increases in asset prices—which might be symptoms of a bubble—and considering the risk that these assumptions might be wrong is important. Also, looking carefully at the dynamics of the system on which the beliefs are based may be useful. In particular, are the dynamics of the system reinforcing or dampening? If the dynamics are reinforcing, then there is greater likelihood of an asset bubble.\n\nThe next step is for the policymaker to evaluate what tools might be available to curb the imbalances that have been identified. The idiosyncratic nature of the innovations and belief systems associated with particular bubbles implies that the tools used to respond to each bubble will likely have to be different and tailored to the features of the particular bubble in question.\n\nFinally, the policymaker needs to conduct a careful cost-benefit analysis, weighing how successful a particular policy might be in restraining the rise in asset prices versus how costly it would be to remain passive, letting the bubble grow and then potentially burst disruptively. Many factors will affect the outcome of this analysis including the magnitude of the potential asset bubble and whether the potential asset bubble is occurring in the equity or debt markets.\n\nIn this analysis, the policymaker is likely to find that compared with equity market bubbles, credit market bubbles are more prone to generate higher costs when they burst. Thus, the benefits of preventing credit bubbles from forming and collapsing are likely to be higher.\n\nCredit bubbles that burst threaten the stability of the financial system much more directly than equity bubbles.8 That is because much of the debt is held by banks and securities dealers that are highly leveraged. As a result, when the bubble deflates, it can take the financial system with it. In contrast, because most equities are held on an unleveraged basis by investors, such as pension and mutual funds, a sharp decline in equity prices will not typically threaten the entire financial system. A comparison of the consequences of the technology stock market crash in equities versus the mortgage debt market crash strongly supports this thesis. Although the wealth loss was roughly comparable, the bursting of the housing bubble had a much greater negative effect on the financial system and the macroeconomy.\n\nIn this cost-benefit analysis, the central bank must understand that it will make mistakes. On one hand, it may fail to temper bubbles that turn out to be disruptive when they collapse. Or, on the other hand, it may try to temper price movement that it thinks are bubbles but are not bubbles at all. The costs of these types of errors much be weighed against the potential benefits of tempering an asset bubble and limiting the damage from its subsequent collapse.9\n\nSo what are the tools with which the policymaker should respond? As I see it, there are three broad sets of tools available: 1) The bully pulpit; 2) macroprudential tools; and 3) monetary policy. Let me now discuss each of these in turn.\n\nThe first tool available is to simply lean against the wind of conventional wisdom by speaking out about the dangers associated with the incipient bubble. The policymaker could point out the assumptions embedded in the rapid rise in asset prices and question the accuracy of the assumptions. Obviously, the policymaker might be ridiculed by true believers about the lack of understanding about the important nature of the innovation. But I suspect that over time, a proactive central bank that laid out the risks clearly would gradually gain credibility with market participants. Use of the bully pulpit would allow the central bank to signal its concern. This might shift the risk/reward trade-off by raising the risks that the talk might foreshadow more forceful action. That, by itself, could temper behavior. Announcement effects can be very powerful, especially when they can be followed by changes in policy.\n\nThe second set of tools includes those that are macroprudential in nature. I would define macroprudential tools as regulatory and supervisory actions that are not applied on a firm-specific basis. These include tools designed to temper demand or increase supply in the asset subject to the bubble or to increase the ability of skeptics to take the other side of the market in which the bubble may be occurring. For example, to counteract a housing bubble, tools available might include limiting loan-to-value ratios, limiting debt service-to-income ratios or increasing the taxes on housing transactions. Several Asian and some European countries have used such tools to limit speculative real estate activity, apparently with some success, although the counterfactual cannot be known by definition.10 To limit a subprime lending boom, the authorities might wish to enforce strict underwriting practices, including verifying purchasers’ incomes and enforcing rigorous appraisal valuations. Increasing the ability of investors to short the assets in question might also be helpful.\n\nIn terms of macroprudential tools, I’d also include tools that influence how the financial system operates and functions. Such tools might include supervisory measures that set liquidity and capital requirements for financial institutions and other intermediaries. They might also include tools that try to limit the overall buildup of leverage in the financial system. For the equity market, macroprudential tools might include margin rules for cash, options, futures and equity over-the-counter derivatives. For the fixed income market, such tools might include raising the haircuts charged to securities dealers on their repo financing; raising the haircuts that the securities dealers assess against the collateralized borrowings of their customers as part of their prime brokerage business, or raising initial margin requirements on OTC derivatives transactions.\n\nMacroprudential tools are undoubtedly difficult to use effectively in practice. For example, it is difficult to judge their impact. If, for example, loan-to-value ratios for single-family mortgages are lowered by 5 percentage points, how big an impact will this have on housing demand? There also is a risk that the rules or regulations will simply be circumvented. For example, investors might move to instruments or to off-shore regimes with less stringent margin and leverage restrictions. Thus, it is important that the authorities have the ability to apply the macroprudential tools broadly throughout the financial sector.11\n\nNone of this is going to be easy. A lot more work will be required to develop a portfolio of tools that could be used, that would be effective and would not be subject to significant evasion or unintended consequences.\n\nIn terms of the use of macroprudential tools, let me briefly take note of another issue that requires significant consideration—the issue of governance. Who controls all these tools? Who decides when the tools will be deployed and how extensively or intensively? Having a sufficient toolkit seems like a good idea. But lodging all this authority within a single entity or institution might not be practical or desirable.\n\nThe final tool available to the central bank is monetary policy. This tool is not likely to work as well as macroprudential tools because it is too broad. Typically, monetary policy will not address specifically the sources of the changes in supply and demand that are driving the bubble and, obviously, monetary policy will have big effects elsewhere.\n\nSome argue that monetary policy should “lean against” incipient asset bubbles. The notion is that by pursuing a slightly tighter monetary policy, the central bank would take out insurance against the risk that the rise in asset prices is a bubble and that its busting would be disruptive. Although this sounds attractive, it critically depends on how expensive the insurance is relative to the losses that the insurance protects against. It is not clear to me that a modest tightening in monetary policy beyond that needed to achieve full employment and price stability in the absence of a bubble would represent a favorable cost-benefit trade-off. The costs of the deviation from the optimal monetary policy in terms of lost output and employment might be high relative to the benefits of a somewhat smaller bubble. This seems likely to be the case in most instances. Historical experience does not suggest that bubbles are very sensitive to the level of short-term interest rates.\n\nThat said, there is some evidence that a tighter monetary policy will reduce desired leverage in the financial system by flattening the yield curve and reducing the profitability of maturity transformation activities.12 To the extent this is true, that may imply a somewhat more favorable trade-off in “leaning against” a bubble. More research is needed on this subject. For now at least, monetary policy appears to be inferior to macroprudential tools that seek either to limit the size of prospective bubbles or to strengthen the financial system so that it is more resilient when asset prices fall sharply.\n\nIn conclusion, let me underscore the challenge that central bankers face in combating asset price bubbles. Doing so effectively requires us to be successful in both identifying the incipient bubble and in developing and implementing a response that will limit bubble growth and avert a destructive asset price crash. This is not easy because asset bubbles are hard to recognize in real time and each asset bubble is different. However, these challenges cannot be an excuse for inaction. Recent experience strongly suggests that asset bubbles exist and that their collapse can be very damaging to the financial system and the macroeconomy.\n\nIn my view, a proactive approach is appropriate when three conditions are satisfied: First, circumstances should suggest that there is a meaningful risk of a future asset price crash that could threaten financial stability. Second, we have identified tools that might have a reasonable chance of success in averting such an outcome. Third, we are reasonably confident that the costs of using the tools are likely to be outweighed by the benefits from averting the prospective crash. When these three conditions are satisfied, we should be willing to act.\n\nThank you for your kind attention.\n\n__________________________________________\n\n1See Vernon L. Smith, Gerry L.

For example, the run-up of the dollar in the mid-1980s was not associated with any particular innovation. Instead, a sharp shift in fiscal policy led to high real interest rates that stimulated a strong demand for the dollar, which caused the dollar to appreciate sharply. This eventually unwound as the dollar's rise undercut U.S. trade competitiveness. This caused the U.S. economy to slow, interest rates to decline and the dollar to fall. The lack of experience with a floating exchange rate regime undoubtedly played a role here. The world moved to a floating exchange rate system in the early 1970s. There was not much experience with how an expansive fiscal policy would affect exchange rates. This undoubtedly increased uncertainty about the sustainability of the dollar's appreciation.\n\n4In fact, one book, Dow 36,000, which was published in 1999 shortly before the stock market peaked, argued that “fair value” for the Dow Jones Industrial Average should be 36,000 because the appropriate risk premium for the equity market versus Treasury bonds should be zero.\n\n5Overconfidence actually applies to a broad range of activities, not just investing. For a more general treatment of this issue of overconfidence and other ways in which economic agents depart from complete rationality, see Richard Thaler. “From Homo Economicus to Homo Sapiens.” 2000. Journal of Economic Perspectives 14, no. 1 (Winter): 133-41.\n\n6This is not to argue that short positions could not be established at all. Monoline guarantors, AIG Financial Products and some securities dealers were willing to sell protection in the form of credit default swaps on some of these assets. Michael Lewis examines how some investors managed to take positions that benefitted from a collapse of the housing bubble in The Big Short: Inside the Doomsday Machine.\n\n7See Eli Ofek and Matthew Richards. 2003. “Dotcom Mania: The Rise and Fall of Internet Stock Prices.” Journal of Finance LVIII, no. 3 (June): 1113-37.\n\n8This argument has been made by many others. See, for example, Frederic Mishkin. How Should We Respond to Asset Bubbles?  May 15, 2008.\n\n9An example of a sustained rise in asset prices that was not a bubble is the bull market in U.S. equities that began in the 1950s. At the start of the sustained rise in equity prices, stock dividend yields exceeded the yields on Treasury bonds and this was perceived as normal, partly reflecting the searing experience of the Great Depression. Instead, corporate earnings rose relatively steadily, supporting dividend growth. This observation led investors to bid up stock prices and push down dividend yields and this proved—more or less—sustainable. Even today, the yield on the S&P 500 index is below the 10-year Treasury note yield.\n\n10However, in the recent crisis, the different outcomes in the United States and Canada might be instructive. Canada had a tougher regime in terms of mortgage underwriting standards. Also, Canada had imposed an overall leverage limit on its banks, which helped to limit the amount of gearing in the financial system. Both of these differences may help to explain why the Canadian financial system and macroeconomy were less affected by the global financial crisis than the United States.\n\n11Imposition of tighter rules and regulations may also be politically unpopular.\n\n12Adrian, Tobias, Arturo Estrella, and Hyun Song Shin. 2010.

        "content": "What I would like to do today is to explain in some detail the logic underlying this expectation that economic conditions will warrant exceptionally low levels of the federal funds rate for an extended period. This conclusion stems from the observation that the current economic environment is qualitatively different from previous post-World War II business cycles. Most post-war recessions were preceded by high rates of resource utilization and rising trend inflation. This prompted a tightening of monetary policy, which, in turn, dampened interest-rate sensitive spending, particularly on housing and consumer durable goods. Then, as underlying inflation pressures subsided, monetary policy was eased and interest-rate sensitive spending rebounded, often quite sharply.\n\nThe current business cycle is different in one key respect. It was preceded by a global financial crisis. The financial crisis was due, in large part, to excessive leverage and excessive investment in real estate assets. It will take time to unwind these excesses.\n\nToday, I will offer a framework for assessing the forces that have shaped the recent performance of the U.S. economy. This framework will provide context to the fiscal and monetary policy responses to what is now being called the “Great Recession.” Then, I will discuss the economic outlook for the United States over the next year. Before I proceed, I want to emphasize that these views are my own and do not necessarily reflect the views of the FOMC or the Federal Reserve System.\n\nBuilding an Analytical Framework\nSay's law—named after the French economist Jean-Baptiste Say—states that the aggregate value of incomes earned in an economy over some period of time must by definition equal the value of all goods and services produced over that same time period. Or, put somewhat differently, on an ex post (i.e., realized) basis, saving must equal investment. Investment in this case means current spending on new physical, human and intangible capital. This insight is the conceptual basis for national income accounting and the gross domestic product (GDP) statistics that we follow so carefully.\n\nEven so, economists have been debating the implications of Say's Law since it was first expounded. Classical economists argued that this ex post balance would occur in a way that kept the economy quite stable at full employment. If there were shocks to saving or investment spending that pushed the economy away from full employment, prices and wages would adjust quickly, providing the market signals needed to bring about the reallocation of resources required to restore full employment.\n\nThe global depression of the 1930s raised serious questions about this classical theory. Although saving must equal investment on an ex post basis, the two can diverge ex ante, potentially sharply. For example, when ex ante (i.e., desired) saving exceeds ex ante (desired) investment spending, inventories rise above desired levels. If prices of the products in question do not fall sufficiently rapidly so that this unwanted build-up of inventories is sold quickly, then production and employment must fall. Perhaps most famously, Keynes, in The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money, argued that there are institutional rigidities that inhibit price and wage flexibility. This means that periods in which ex ante saving exceeds desired investment might lead to periods of persistent unemployment.\n\nIn this respect, the financial system plays an important role. Financial intermediaries match borrowers and savers. If the financial system is under stress and lending standards are being tightened, ex ante investment is likely to decline relative to saving, all else being equal.\n\nThe financial intermediation process and the creation of credit is the primary channel through which monetary policy affects the economy. By influencing the volume of credit creation, monetary policy strives to keep ex ante saving and investment—alternatively, aggregate demand and aggregate supply—in rough balance. Too rapid a pace of credit creation would overstimulate investment relative to saving, potentially increasing the rate of inflation and this, in turn, could damage the economy's long-run performance. Too slow of a pace of credit creation would likely lead to an ex ante shortfall of investment relative to saving, causing unemployment to increase.\n\nThis analytical framework also applies to the global economy, but with an added level of complexity. At the global level, income equals output and saving equals investment on an ex post basis. However, for an individual country, saving can exceed investment or, alternatively, production can exceed domestic demand to the extent that a country's exports exceed its imports. This requires that, for some other economy or group of economies, investment must exceed saving, or alternatively, domestic demand must exceed production and imports must exceed exports. This means that what happens abroad in terms of desired saving and investment also influences the performance of our domestic economy.\n\nThis framework provides a simple way to evaluate the recent economic environment and the current economic outlook. When desired investment rises relative to saving on an ex ante basis, then an economy tends to strengthen. If the strengthening persists, inflation may rise to levels above what is regarded as consistent with maximum sustainable growth and full employment. This was the story for much of the 2004-06 period. The Federal Reserve responded to rising trend inflation by tightening monetary policy to keep the economy from overheating.\n\nIn contrast, when investment falls relative to saving on an ex ante basis, an economy weakens and may slip into recession, as was the case between 2007 and mid-2009. During this period, the Federal Reserve tried to support employment by cutting its federal funds rate target nearly to zero; by creating a number of special liquidity facilities to support the extension of credit; and by engaging in a large scale asset purchase program, buying Treasuries, agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities.\n\nAn economic recovery requires that desired investment must rise relative to saving. This has happened recently as fiscal stimulus and an inventory cycle have led to a fall in ex ante saving relative to investment. But for the recovery to strengthen further, this process must continue. There has to be a further demand impulse—be it a decline in household saving rates, a rise in business investment relative to profits, a further expansion of fiscal stimulus or an improvement in the net trade balance via an increase in exports relative to imports.\n\nLet's now apply this framework to evaluate what happened over the past decade and what it implies for the economic outlook.\n\nThe last three decades have been marked by a shortage of U.S. domestic saving relative to investment. The United States has almost continuously run a current account deficit since the early 1980s (Chart 1). In 2005 and 2006 that current account deficit averaged around 6 percent of GDP. Yet, the real exchange value of the dollar today is not terribly different from what it was in the early 1990s (Chart 2). A massive flow of saving into the United States from around the world offset forces that otherwise would have driven the exchange value of the dollar lower.\n\nIn addition to its sheer size, this inflow of saving into the United States is significant in several respects. First, note the direction of the flow. One might expect that capital would flow from the developed world to the developing world, but just the opposite has been the case. In addition, foreign savers have been willing to lend to the United States in the U.S. currency. This means that foreign savers are exposed to the exchange rate risk that the dollar's value might change relative to their own currencies. Finally, one might expect that over time, as their holdings of dollar-denominated assets increased, foreign savers would demand higher interest rates, but, in fact, U.S. interest rates—in both nominal and real terms—have been generally declining over the past three decades1 (Chart 3).\n\nThese facts are at odds with the prevailing view that spendthrift U.S. consumers and governments are pulling those savings into the United States. Indeed, for some time the “twin deficits” view held that large fiscal deficits in the United States were causing large U.S. current account deficits. However, even when the federal government ran surpluses in the late 1990s, our current account deficit continued to increase. Subsequent research at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York indicates that the link between fiscal deficits and capital inflows is not as strong as commonly suggested.2\n\nBefore proceeding, a few important qualifications are in order. First, despite the large flow of foreign saving into the United States, our international financial position does not appear precarious at the present time. The United States still has substantial investments in foreign countries, and income from U.S. investments abroad still exceeds the income generated by U.S. assets owned by foreigners. Part of the reason is that U.S. firms operating abroad earn higher rates of profit than foreign firms operating here. In addition, low interest rates minimize the cost to the United States of our substantial negative net debt position.\n\nIn addition, the fact that our foreign indebtedness is for the most part denominated in our own currency is a huge advantage in the event the dollar were to come under significant downward pressure. That is because a decline in the dollar would raise the value of the income earned on our foreign direct investment and foreign-currency denominated assets, relative to the income that foreigners earned on their dollar-denominated investments in the United States. All else being equal, this would boost our net investment income balance.\n\nNote that borrowing per se is not necessarily a bad thing. The key is what the borrowing is used for—to finance consumption or investment. And, if it is used to fund investment, it is also important how productive that investment turns out to be over time.\n\nSo what did we do with this inflow of foreign saving? We invested in a substantial volume of physical capital, particularly residential and nonresidential real estate (Chart 4). It seems clear that one important factor behind this investment was the decline in long- term interest rates. For example, from 2003 through 2005 mortgage rates declined to just under 6 percent on average, the lowest level since the first half of the 1960s. These lower mortgage interest rates were capitalized into asset prices. Rising prices for residential and nonresidential real estate assets induced entrepreneurs to produce more of those assets. In the housing market, this increase in prices was helped along by the relaxation of loan underwriting standards, which made it easier to obtain a mortgage and become a homeowner. Credit growth was the strongest among households with relatively low credit scores (Chart 5). The homeownership rate rose after being relatively stagnant for two decades (Chart 6). The increased availability of credit to lower income borrowers and the sharp rise in housing values contributed to the rise of consumption as a share of GDP and the decline of the personal saving rate3 (Chart 7).\n\nNow, with the aid of hindsight, it is clear that we built too many houses, invested in too much commercial real estate and overvalued both significantly. The market overshot for several reasons. First, there was rampant speculative behavior. The longer these asset prices continued to rise, the stronger the belief became that they would keep rising in the future. Second, the rise in prices reinforced the initial relaxation of underwriting standards. During the period of rising prices, defaults and loan losses were very low. A homeowner who had difficulty servicing the debt could typically sell the home for a profit and pay off the loan. Third, the boom was fueled by new financial products, such as collateralized debt obligations that were backed by subprime and Alt-A mortgages. Investors misunderstood how risky these products were and this resulted in lower mortgage rates for non-conforming residential mortgages and lower funding costs for commercial real estate borrowing.\n\nIn the housing sector, these factors interacted to create a strong reinforcing dynamic. The relaxation of underwriting standards that made it easier to become a homeowner and the low mortgage rates—supported in part by the new financial products—made it easier to speculate in real estate. Moreover, as home prices rose, household net worth increased, making households more willing to consume a greater share of their current income.\n\nNot surprisingly, this bout of speculative fever ended badly. Eventually, the supply of houses caught up with and then vastly overshot demand. Easing underwriting standards to support demand could only go on for so long. Prices turned down. At the national level, home prices peaked in late 2005 to early 2006 with commercial real estate prices peaking about one year later (Chart 8). From those peaks, home prices have fallen by about 30 percent on average, with much larger declines in some areas, while commercial real estate prices have fallen by about 40 percent on average.\n\nAs price declines intensified, the number of serious mortgage delinquencies surged and, in fact, continue to rise (Chart 9). Research indicates that by 2007 the percentage of nonprime mortgages that went into default within their first year rose to 10 percent compared with 3 percent of such loans originated in 2003. While falling home prices appear to be the primary factor explaining this sharp increase in early defaults, most of the increase cannot be explained by traditional risk factors.4 A potential explanation is that individual home buyers often falsely indicated on their mortgage applications that the property they were buying would be their primary residence. Using an extensive set of data on loan performance that we have developed with Equifax, we find that multiple first mortgage lien holders—that is, people owning more than one home—account for about 40 percent of the dollar volume of seriously delinquent mortgage balances, up from about 5 percent in 2004 (Chart 10).\n\nAs delinquency and foreclosure rates rose, structured finance products backed by riskier mortgage loans performed particularly poorly. The securitization market for non-conforming mortgages collapsed. Credit availability tightened as underwriting practices became much more restrictive, even for plain vanilla mortgages.\n\nThe cascading effect of the sharp increase in mortgage delinquencies and the resulting steep decline in the market value of mortgage assets was a key contributing factor to the financial crisis. As the financial crisis intensified and the economic outlook deteriorated, equity prices eventually declined by 50 percent from their late 2007 peak before bottoming out about one year ago.\n\nBut while the value of real estate and equities plunged, the debt incurred to acquire those assets remained, leaving households very highly leveraged. According to the Flow of Funds Accounts, the ratio of household liabilities to net worth rose from around 20 percent to nearly 30 percent in just three years (Chart 11).\n\nThe result was a sharp decline in desired investment relative to saving. The number of housing starts plunged, commercial real estate investment fell and households cut back on their spending as their net worth plummeted. The economy slumped into what is now called the “Great Recession”.\n\nThe Dimensions of the Downturn\nAccording to the Business Cycle Dating Committee of the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER), the U.S. economy has experienced 10 recessions since 1950. The duration of those previous recessions averaged slightly less than a year during which real GDP fell an average of 1.75 percent and the unemployment rate increased an average of 2.3 percentage points.\n\nThe Great Recession was far worse. From its peak, real GDP declined 3.8 percent—more than double the average decline of prior downturns (Chart 12). The unemployment rate began to increase in the second half of 2007. Over the next two years, it increased 5.5 percentage points. The rise would have been even more pronounced except that the average workweek and the labor force participation rate declined unusually sharply (Charts 13 and 14). Overall, total hours worked in the nonfarm business sector declined a staggering 10.6 percent (Chart 15). In addition to the decline in demand for labor, the manufacturing capacity utilization rate declined to 65.1 in June of 2009, the lowest level of the post-World War II period.\n\nThe result is that the “output gap”—that is, the difference between actual output and the output achieved at the highest resource utilization rate consistent with price stability—has climbed sharply. This, in turn, has put downward pressure on trend inflation. For example, on a year-over-year basis, the core inflation rate declined to 1.5 percent in January 2010 from nearly 3 percent in the fall of 2006 (Chart 16).\n\nThe Road Ahead\nFortunately, the U.S. economy is very flexible and resilient. Although it does not adjust as fast as classical economists envisioned, in the United States prices and wages respond relatively quickly. Moreover, policymakers have been aggressive in supporting the economy by easing monetary policy and by implementing a large fiscal-stimulus program.\n\nAs a result, although the unemployment rate remains unacceptably high, output has begun to expand again, and we appear to be on the verge of seeing sustained growth in employment. We'll know more about this tomorrow when the March employment figures are released. Equity prices have recovered sharply and home prices and commercial real estate prices appear to be stabilizing. Household indebtedness is declining, due to a combination of debt repayment and credit that has been written off by lenders. After falling off a cliff during the first half of 2009, global trade has rebounded. Both U.S. exports and U.S. manufacturing output have expanded rapidly over the past six months (Chart 17).\n\nAlthough these are encouraging developments, I believe that the recovery is likely to be quite muted compared with past recoveries. This comes back to the framework discussed earlier. For faster growth, we need ex ante investment to rise relative to saving and ex ante spending to rise relative to the current trend of income. But it is difficult to see where this impulse will come from in the near term.\n\nThe early stages of past recoveries have been led by consumer spending, particularly for durable goods and residential investment. For example, in the first year of recovery following the deep recessions of 1973-1975 and 1981-1982, real consumer spending increased an average of 6.5 percent and residential investment rose an average of 38 percent. It is unlikely that we will experience this type of strength this time. Households have suffered unusually large shocks to both income and wealth and many remain highly leveraged (Chart 18). Although the household debt to net worth ratio has declined considerably from its peak, it is still around 26 percent, well above the already elevated average of the past decade (Chart 19). Moreover, even if consumers wanted to borrow, credit availability is still constrained and underwriting standards remain relatively tight. Real consumer spending increased at a 2.25 percent annual rate over the second half of 2009 and looks to be growing at about that rate in the first quarter of 2010.\n\nGiven that the personal saving rate is still relatively low, it will be hard for consumer spending to grow more quickly without large increases in real labor income. But big increases in real labor income won't be possible without a much stronger recovery in output. And a much stronger recovery in output is unlikely without stronger consumption.\n\nResidential investment did increase over the second half of 2009, boosted by relatively low mortgage interest rates, lower home prices and the first-time home buyer tax credit. But recent data on the housing sector indicates that the recovery has stalled (Chart 20). As with consumption, we are unlikely to see the typical surge of housing starts and residential investment that was a key feature of most past recoveries. There is already an unusually large volume of vacant homes for rent and for sale (Chart 21). More are likely to come onto the market in the months ahead due to the large volume of mortgage loans currently in the foreclosure process.\n\nFor the government sector, large federal budget deficits are a constraint and fiscal policy is slowly shifting from an expansive policy back toward restraint. At the state and local level, the constraints are even more binding, as budgetary gaps will need to be addressed by spending cuts and tax increases (Chart 22).\n\nExports rebounded sharply over the second half of 2009, particularly to the emerging world (Chart 23). However, domestic demand in Europe and Japan—important export markets for the United States—remains very weak. This suggests that the U.S. trade balance is likely to change little over the next year or two, and, thus, will be relatively neutral in terms of its impact on growth.\n\nOnly business fixed investment is in a position to be a true locomotive of growth. Profits have stayed high relative to investment, and corporate balance sheets are awash with cash (Charts 24 and 25). However, even here, the growth impulse is likely to be weak. Prospective startup businesses are going to find it difficult to obtain funding. And larger businesses will unlikely increase investment spending sharply at a time when capacity utilization rates remain unusually depressed (Chart 26).\n\nRelatively sluggish growth implies that the output gap will be closed very gradually. This suggests that inflation pressures will stay subdued. The excess supply of housing is putting downward pressure on rents, which represent a large share of the consumer price index (CPI) (Chart 27). In addition, unit labor costs have declined sharply over the past year due to the combination of unusually rapid productivity growth and slowing labor compensation growth (Chart 28). Fortunately, longer term inflation expectations remain well anchored. These expectations have not declined and are broadly consistent with my views on the appropriate inflation goal (Chart 29). This is actually a welcome development right now because it will likely help to keep the trend inflation rate from falling too much.\n\nLessons to be Learned\nWe have just lived through a period in which rapid increases in asset prices led to a serious misallocation of resources and a severe financial crisis. What do we need to do to minimize the likelihood of this type of experience in the future?\n\nAs I noted in a recent speech, we face three major challenges that will determine how smooth this economic expansion turns out to be.5 First, we need regulatory reform that makes our financial system more stable and resilient. This requires many steps, including systemic risk oversight and solving the so-called too-big-to-fail problem. In this respect, we need to think hard about what we can do to prevent the type of speculative bubbles that occurred from causing so much damage in the future. In particular, are there macro prudential tools that the Federal Reserve and other regulators can use to limit leverage and speculation and thus prevent the type of asset price booms and busts that have proved so troublesome?\n\nSecond, we need viable exit strategies from this recent period of monetary and fiscal policy stimulus. On the monetary policy side, we have been working hard to ensure that we have the tools in place so that we can be effective in tightening monetary policy when the time is right, even with an enlarged balance sheet. Third, we need a rebalancing of global economic growth. That means a smaller share of consumption relative to GDP in the United States and offsetting shifts in Asia.\n\nCircumstances have improved considerably from what they were a year ago. But job creation is still much too slow and we have much to do on the regulatory side to make our financial system more resilient and robust.\n\nThank you very much for your kind attention. I would be happy to take a few questions.\n\n__________________________________________\n\n1Brender, Anton and Florence Pisani. 2007. “Global Imbalances: Is the World Economy Really at Risk?” Dexia SA.\n2 Bartolini, Leonardo and Amartya Lahiri. 2006. Twin Deficits, Twenty Years Later, Federal Reserve Bank of New York Current Issues in Economics and Finance, 12, no. 7 (October).\n3There are a few caveats to note about this trend. First, there are several categories of spending by households that are lumped into the personal consumption expenditures category in our official GDP statistics that can fairly be counted as investment. These include spending on consumer durable goods, education, and, possibly, medical care, and their combined share of total personal consumption expenditures (PCE) rose over the period in which the saving rate declined. Second, other forces were at work to push down the personal saving rate. Prominent among these is a secular decline in the share of health care expenditures paid out-of-pocket by consumers, lessening the motivation for precautionary savings.\n4Haughwout, Andrew, Richard Peach, and Joe Tracy. 2008. “Juvenile Delinquent Mortgages: Bad Credit or Bad Economy.”, Journal of Urban Economics, 64, no. 2 (September): 246-57.\n5Financial Market Turmoil: The Federal Reserve and the Challenges Ahead, William C.

        "content": "Indeed, for many of the markets involved in the intermediation of credit in the U.S. financial system, the crisis revealed structural deficiencies that made the system unstable. Once revealed, this instability required an immediate and forceful policy response to limit the damage. As certain markets ground to a halt, policymakers took extraordinary actions to mitigate the damage to the broader financial system and, ultimately, to the real economy. Those actions, which included a range of liquidity facilities launched by the Federal Reserve and by central banks around the world, proved effective and brought the financial system back from the brink of a complete meltdown.\n\nHowever, the provision of emergency liquidity and other forms of support were only a bridge to bring the financial system to a more stable point. It is now necessary to work towards creating a more robust financial system that addresses the structural deficiencies that brought us to the brink in the first place. Many reform initiatives are now being debated, with the discussions involving a range of market participants, central banks, regulatory agencies and the U.S. Congress. It is important that these initiatives result in outcomes that reduce the chances and consequences of another financial crisis; and it is equally important that they not impede the effective functioning of financial markets during normal periods.\n\nMy comments today will review the lessons that can be drawn from the performance of U.S. financial markets during the crisis and will describe some of the changes that may occur as we migrate toward a more stable and effective financial system.\n\nCapital Markets that Demonstrated Resilience\nIn many ways the crisis underscored the unique characteristics of dollar-denominated asset markets. This can be seen in one simple fact: Despite the fact that most of the troubled housing assets at the root of this crisis were dollar-denominated, the dollar rallied sharply during the depths of the crisis. This pattern at least partly reflected strong investor demand for particular dollar-denominated assets in response to the financial turmoil.\n\nU.S. Treasury securities clearly stand out in this regard, as they again proved to be a key safe-haven asset. The combination of the size and liquidity of the market and the risk-free credit status of the instruments made Treasury securities extremely appealing at the height of the financial turmoil. Treasury bill yields actually went negative for a time after the Lehman bankruptcy, as investors were willing to pay for the opportunity to hold this instrument. Longer-term Treasury yields also declined sharply, with the ten-year yield falling to nearly 2 percent at one point.\n\nWhile government securities around the world benefitted from safe-haven flows during the crisis, there are several features of Treasury securities that made them stand out even relative to other sovereign markets. At more than $7 trillion, the size of the Treasury market provides investors with a homogenous asset class in which they can place large amounts of funds. Moreover, Treasury liquidity seems to compare favorably to the liquidity of other sovereign debt markets, whether measured by average daily trading volumes, turnover ratios or other metrics. The Treasury market is supported by a sound and extensive infrastructure for trading, deep financing markets, sizable derivative markets and an active dealer community.\n\nThis is not to say that Treasury market liquidity was not tested during the crisis. Liquidity did suffer some in the face of greater volatility, strong investor flows and deleveraging by primary dealers. Despite these strains, however, investors were able to continue to trade Treasury securities in decent size at reasonable cost and with transparent pricing throughout the crisis.\n\nThe effective functioning of sovereign credit markets was a critical development in the crisis, as it allowed fiscal authorities around the world to respond aggressively in a manner that helped stabilize financial and economic conditions. In the United States, net borrowing through marketable Treasury securities jumped from about $200 billion in 2007 to $1.4 trillion in 2009—a shift that was achieved through a notable increase in issuance across all maturities. But the appetite for Treasury securities kept up with the increase in issuance, with auction coverage in 2009 even exceeding that seen in 2007. Moreover, the increase in gross issuance appears to be behind us, as the U.S. Treasury Department has indicated that the next adjustment to its issuance of coupon securities is likely to be towards smaller sizes.\n\nMarkets for almost every asset class outside sovereign debt were adversely affected by the financial crisis. However, important distinctions can still be drawn across these affected asset classes in terms of their relative performance. While some markets completely shut down and have had difficulty recovering, others demonstrated aspects of resilience.\n\nThe markets for U.S. equities and non-financial corporate bonds fall into this latter category. To be sure, holders of these instruments suffered sharp capital losses as the crisis unfolded. But a portion of the re-pricing was fundamental, in that it was driven by a significant revision to the economic outlook rather than to poor market functioning. Indeed, equity markets continued to operate throughout the crisis, in that investors were able to transact and price discovery was occurring. The same was true for most high-quality corporate bonds, even though that market had more notable episodes of illiquidity. The fact that these markets held up better than others in part reflects that they were less dependent on the availability of leverage and on the continued value of the assets as collateral.\n\nMoreover, the crisis did not reveal any major structural flaws in equity and corporate bond markets, thus paving the way to a vigorous recovery of those assets. Indeed, risk premiums on both of these assets have narrowed sharply since early 2009, and corporate bond issuance has rebounded impressively. This recovery has been driven by market forces. Firms have been motivated to issue bonds in order to reduce their reliance on bank funding and other sources of short-term credit, while investors have realized that corporate yield spreads offered appealing returns given that firms in most sectors appear fairly healthy.\n\nLastly, while not a U.S. asset market, it is worth mentioning the performance of the foreign exchange markets, particularly for this audience. Foreign exchange markets also functioned relatively well during this period of turmoil. This resilience has been highlighted in recent reports issued by the Foreign Exchange Committee in the United States and by similar bodies abroad. Broadly speaking, trading in spot foreign exchange markets remained transparent, accessible and relatively liquid. There were signs of strain in particular segments of these markets, such as dislocations in forward exchange rates and a notable decline in the liquidity of currency swaps. However, market participants were generally able to execute trades and manage currency exposures in these markets on an uninterrupted basis. The resilience of foreign exchange markets owed in part to the availability of CLS Bank for eliminating time gaps in the settlement of different currencies, to the efficient collateral exchange achieved through credit support annexes and to the standardization of trade documentation.\n\nCredit Intermediation and Market Disruption\nWhile those capital markets demonstrated meaningful resilience to financial stress, that was not the case for other parts of the financial system—namely, those involved in more complicated forms of credit intermediation. Many of the most acute problems were driven by a build-up in leverage in which large amounts of opaque, illiquid, long-term assets were financed by short-term liabilities. These activities took place both in traditional financial intermediaries and in what is often referred to as the shadow banking system.\n\nThe shadow banking system performs a function similar to that carried out by banks and other financial institutions. In particular, it takes the short-term, highly liquid investments that households and other investors want to hold, and it uses them to fund the longer-term, relatively illiquid loans that businesses and households demand to finance their economic activity. However, while a bank performs this transformation of maturity, liquidity and credit risk from end to end within a single institution, the shadow banking system involves a wide range of institutions and markets in the process.\n\nIn particular, the shadow banking system has included money market mutual funds, enhanced money funds, other real money accounts and securities lenders as providers of short-term funding; banks, industrial loan companies, independent finance companies and other non-bank firms as originators of private credit; and an array of entities including structured investment vehicles (SIVs), securities arbitrage conduits, real estate investment trusts, broker dealers, clearing banks, hedge funds, mortgage insurers, monoline insurers and credit rating agencies as part of the maturity and credit transformation between the lenders and the borrowers.\n\nGiven the number of steps and firms involved, the process of intermediating credit through this system was a complicated one. However, it is not the multiplicity of steps itself that was problematic; indeed, analogous steps would be taking place within a financial intermediary in the traditional banking system. What was problematic was that these steps involved a wide range of firms that did not have adequate coverage under any one regulatory umbrella and that did not operate with the benefit of either government-guaranteed liabilities or the Federal Reserve's discount window.\n\nThe shadow banking system grew rapidly in the years leading up to the crisis. By the middle of 2007, the volume of outstanding credit that was securitized had reached more that $4 trillion. If the debt securitized by the government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs) is included, the amount of securitized credit had reached $9.5 trillion in 2007. Clearly, the shadow banking system was not in the shadows, but was a market-based credit intermediation system that was at least on par with the banking system in terms of its importance to the economy.\n\nMoreover, this system was not completely separate from the traditional banking system. In fact, much of the risk that the shadow banking system had assumed was ultimately borne by banking organizations. Banks had provided backstop lines of credit and had other contractual or reputational reasons to absorb structured credit and other assets back onto their books once they could not be financed in the shadow banking system. In effect, regulated banks functioned to some degree as the lenders of last resort for the shadow banking system.\n\nThe entire financial system, both in the banks and outside, got caught. It was holding too much risk on too narrow of terms, it did not have sufficient capital, and it was too leveraged and dependent on short-term funding. As it became clear that the value of the U.S. housing stock had to decline considerably, these financial conditions complicated the adjustment. Indeed, what started as a seemingly narrow concern about subprime residential mortgage-backed securities cascaded into a widespread and abrupt re-pricing of credit more broadly and a desperate scramble for liquidity.\n\nAs market participants and investors came to realize that the system was overexposed, they began to withdraw funding. Credit lines were reduced, lending terms shortened and demand shifted towards high-quality collateral. Major funding markets came under tremendous strain and experienced run-like threats, including the triparty repo market, interbank lending markets, money market mutual funds and the commercial paper market. Facing significant redemptions, money market mutual funds withdrew from wholesale funding markets, including from both secured and unsecured commercial paper programs, which further exacerbated those dynamics. The withdrawal of funding raised the possibility of fire sales of assets, which, in a vicious circle, further heightened concerns about financial exposures and accelerated investors' flight to safe and liquid assets. Asset-backed securities markets virtually shut down as distressed asset sales by SIVs and other entities prompted sharp spikes in secondary market spreads.\n\nThe fact that the regulatory structure had allowed the shadow banking system to operate with less capital and liquidity than the regulated banking system added to the stress of the situation. However, banks and other traditional financial institutions were caught up in the same dynamics. In part, their involvement reflected the connection between the banking system and the shadow banking system noted earlier. As the shadow banking system came under pressure, regulated banks had to provide funding by extending lines of credit or by absorbing assets onto their balance sheets. As such, the shadow banking system effectively collapsed onto the regulated banking system.\n\nThe bottom line is that the entire system was suffering from a self-reinforcing cycle of liquidity runs and concerns about the solvency of financial institutions. An effective policy response had to address both aspects of this cycle.\n\nResponding to the Demand for Dollar Liquidity\nIt took government actions on many fronts to stabilize the financial system. Many of these efforts were aimed at addressing the solvency problems facing the financial sector, including the injection of capital into financial institutions and two of the housing GSEs. These efforts were critically important to the recovery of financial markets. However, l will focus my remarks on another important part of the government response—the actions taken by central banks and other government entities to address the liquidity strains in the markets.\n\nCentral banks around the world responded vigorously to the erosion of liquidity conditions. The lender-of-last-resort function of central banks proved to be critical for supporting market functioning and stemming contagion.\n\nFor the Federal Reserve, this function had to evolve in response to the nature and location of the liquidity disruptions it sought to address. The Fed's traditional lender-of-last-resort tools are designed to ensure adequate liquidity for depository institutions. But the liquidity strains went beyond the banking sector and into the market-based credit system. The traditional tools were not adequate to address the problems faced in this more complicated intermediation system, and hence the Fed had to innovate—under extreme market conditions and with little time to spare.\n\nWhile some of the innovations were still aimed at depository institutions, most of the facilities introduced were intended to address liquidity pressures at sets of firms in various financial markets, including primary dealers, money market mutual funds, commercial paper issuers and holders of asset-backed securities. In the end, these facilities effectively backstopped many of the different components of the shadow banking system.\n\nThe efforts to ensure that the system had adequate liquidity also involved other government programs, such as the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation's (FDIC) debt guarantee and the U.S. Treasury Department's money market guarantee. Those programs in effect broadened the insurance provided by the FDIC on bank deposits to other liabilities in the banking and shadow-banking systems. The combination of the liquidity and guarantee programs was instrumental in stabilizing the financial system.\n\nIt is also worth noting that the demand for dollar funding proved to be global in nature, as financial institutions around the world faced an elevated need for dollar funding in response to market stress. This need was met by the liquidity swap lines that the Federal Reserve set up with fourteen central banks around the world. These swap lines provided dollar funding to foreign central banks so that they could inject dollar funding into their own markets, in order to address the funding demands of institutions operating during their market hours.\n\nThe broad intent of all of these facilities was the same—to keep an extreme increase in the demand for liquidity from significantly disrupting the functioning of financial markets and impairing the flow of credit to the economy. The facilities, along with other efforts from governments, helped to halt the downward spiral and to alleviate the pressure on global financial institutions and markets. In the absence of such effective actions, the implications of the crisis for real economic performance would have been much worse.\n\nThe success of the programs has been apparent in a number of dimensions. Most clearly, the degree of counterparty concern and liquidity hoarding in the money markets has diminished, as reflected in the decline in term funding spreads. Moreover, issuance of both commercial paper and some types of asset-backed securities has rebounded, and it has done so increasingly without reliance on the Fed's liquidity support.\n\nIt is also worth noting that the exit from the Federal Reserve's liquidity facilities has been quite smooth. At their peak, these facilities provided about $1.5 trillion of short-term dollar credit. Today, the remaining balance across them is well under $100 billion. This reduction was achieved without creating any significant problems for financial markets or institutions. That success largely reflects the effective design of those programs, as most were structured to provide credit under terms that would be less and less appealing as markets renormalized. This design worked incredibly well, as activity in most of the facilities gradually declined to near zero, allowing the Fed to simply turn them off with no market disruption.\n\nOverall, central banks were able to accommodate the most extreme shift in the demand for liquidity that has been seen in a generation, and to do so in ways that responded to the specific needs that arose in a market-based credit system.\n\nStructural Changes in Dollar Asset Markets\nAlthough U.S. authorities managed to provide the financial system with sufficient liquidity and support to stem the market panic, they must now find a way to foster more enduring changes that will result in a sounder financial system. The crisis revealed significant structural flaws, but reforms are being debated to address many of these issues.\n\nSome of the required changes are associated with the oversight of large and interconnected financial institutions. The reform efforts underway in Congress are intended to address several points of weaknesses, including gaps in the coverage of systemically important firms and the absence of a resolution process for an orderly wind-down of failing firms. In addition, regulatory standards are being reevaluated to strengthen capital and liquidity requirements and to improve the risk capture of those standards.\n\nThe crisis also revealed weakness related to specific financial markets involving structured products, housing-related GSEs, over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives, triparty repo and money market mutual funds. Reforms are underway in each of these areas. For securitization markets, the U.S. Congress as well as regulators are considering changes to ensure incentives are properly aligned and that there is sufficient transparency around the underlying assets. For the housing GSEs, reforms are beginning to be crafted to reach an appropriate model, as described in the testimony by U.S. Treasury Department Secretary Geithner earlier this week. For OTC derivatives, financial reform legislation contains provisions to increase the transparency of the market and to clear trades through central counterparties. For the triparty repo market, a task force is considering recommendations to make the market more robust to weather financial strains among its participants. And for money market mutual funds, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has offered a reform proposal to better prepare those institutions for abrupt changes in investor demands.\n\nAs you can see, the efforts are extensive and affect many different areas. Together, they should be aimed at achieving some common goals. We should have a system in which regulatory arbitrage is not the primary driver of where or how financial activity or innovation takes place. We should have a system in which government support is well defined and is priced correctly. We should have a system in which investors receive adequate, accurate and timely information to make independent judgments about credit risk through the life of a security. And we should have a system that ensures adequate capital and liquidity standards for firms with deep and intertwined linkages to the financial markets. Overall, the reforms in these markets, along with the regulatory reforms to the oversight of financial institutions, should result in more robust system of credit intermediation, whether it is taking place through traditional intermediaries or through the markets more broadly.\n\nThis reform process faces several important risks, though. First, there is a possibility that the process will stagnate or end up incomplete, given that the issues are complex, the stakeholders are numerous and the solutions are not always obvious. Second, there is a risk that, with so many efforts taking place in so many areas, the results will not fit together into an effective, cohesive solution. And third, there is the risk that the pursuit of reform will be overly zealous, resulting in a set of restrictions that will significantly undermine the functioning of financial markets during normal periods and thereby impede employment and growth.\n\nOn this last point, it is worth making a few observations about the functioning of financial markets as we think about how to encourage a safe and yet efficient financial sector. These points may be obvious but are worth emphasizing.\n\nFirst, securitization is a powerful vehicle that should play an important role in the intermediation of credit in the economy. Securitization can be quite effective at transforming illiquid assets into negotiable securities and transferring risk to a more diversified set of holders. To be sure, the expansion of securitized credit was much too extensive, and its subsequent collapse was terribly disruptive, contributing significantly to the damage to the economy. However, those developments do not mean that securitized credit, if structured properly, should not return in size. Reform efforts, to be effective, should foster development of a securitization market that properly aligns incentives and provides adequate transparency about risk transfer.\n\nSecond, the use of derivatives is integral to the broader functioning of financial markets and the intermediation of credit. Derivatives allow for the redistribution of risks through hedging activities, and they foster improvements in price discovery and market efficiency by facilitating appropriate investments in long and short positions in some types of assets. But while OTC derivatives already provide important benefits, more could be done to enhance the robustness of this market. The measures under consideration promote greater use of central counterparties, increased regulatory and public transparency, wider involvement of exchanges and electronic trading platforms for actively-traded products, and stronger operational and risk management practices.\n\nThird, the financial system cannot operate efficiently without leverage. The preferences of businesses and households in their regular economic activities require that intermediation and maturity transformation be conducted somewhere in the financial system. Of course, much of the turmoil we witnessed across financial markets was due to the build-up of excessive leverage in the system, and we cannot miss the chance to learn from this painful lesson. But we should also understand that a reduction in leverage to near zero in the financial system is not desirable, as it would significantly reduce the efficiency of credit intermediation. Instead, discussion should be focused on how to make the use of leverage less procyclical, to identify those sources of leverage that are most productive and to better monitor the vulnerabilities that can result from excessive leverage.\n\nConclusion\nThe crisis offered a rare view into how our capital markets function under extreme stress. Those circumstances revealed vastly different degrees of robustness across alternative segments of our financial system. At one end of the spectrum, markets for certain dollar assets demonstrated considerable resilience to financial stress and were extremely appealing to investors in stress circumstances. At the other end, the crisis highlighted that segments of U.S. credit markets had structural shortcomings that must be addressed to ensure the viability of these markets going forward. Those shortcomings have necessitated two waves of policy response. The first wave was aimed at putting out the fire. To that end, the crisis demonstrated that U.S. and global authorities have the ability and willingness to respond in a manner that meets dollar funding needs in a time of crisis and that promotes broader market stability. The second wave is aimed at building a sounder financial system for the future. Those efforts are still underway, and the reform process may be long and involved. However, I am hopeful that many of the shortcomings are likely to be addressed, and that we will emerge from this episode with a more robust and efficient financial system.\n\nForeign Exchange Committee"

I include the Term Securities Lending Facility in with short-term lending facilities, even though it provided the market with Treasury securities rather than reserves, because it was often used to find funding for positions in less liquid securities.\n3 An alternative explanation is that the large-scale asset purchases have had no effect and that the low levels of rates and spreads simply reflect other factors. However, I believe the evidence indicates that the asset purchases have contributed to the low level of longer-term rates.\n4 Some have discussed whether the draining of excess reserves has effects on the economy beyond the implications for short-term interest rates. In my view, it would be surprising if there were significant effects on the real economy or inflation associated with substituting one short-term, liquid, risk-free asset (reverse repos or term deposits with the Fed) for another (reserves), except for the degree to which that substitution affects the Fed's control of overnight interest rates."

        "content": "I am glad that Narayana Kocherlakota is here as well as I don’t think I qualify as the most “objective” person to be a panelist on this particular topic. After all, I have long been a proponent of using a financial conditions framework to think about the economic outlook and monetary policy. When I was working as the chief U.S. economist at Goldman Sachs, we built one of the earliest financial conditions indexes, the Goldman Sachs Financial Conditions Index (GSFCI).\n\nI am going to divide my remarks today into two parts. First, I will discuss why a financial conditions framework is useful when thinking about the economic outlook and monetary policy. Second, I will discuss the paper, “Financial Conditions Indexes: A New Look after the Financial Crisis,” by Jan Hatzius, Peter Hooper, Frederic Mishkin, Kermit L. Schoenholtz and Mark W. Watson, in some detail—evaluating its considerable strengths and pointing out some areas where additional work would be useful.\n\nThere are a number of reasons that a financial conditions framework is likely to be useful when evaluating the economic outlook and the conduct of monetary policy. Most important, monetary policy works its magic through its effect on financial conditions; it does not operate directly on real economic variables. That is because the level of the federal funds rate influences other financial market variables such as money market rates, long-term interest rates, credit spreads, stock prices and the value of the dollar, and it is these variables that influence real economic activity.1 This means that if the linkage between the fed funds rate and this broader constellation of financial indicators is not stable or completely predictable, then knowing what is happening to the fed funds rate is not sufficient to predict economic activity. The instability of the linkage between the fed funds rate and financial conditions indicators means that these indicators provide additional information about real activity and also are relevant in deciding the appropriate fed funds rate target. In contrast, if the transmission mechanism from the fed funds rate to financial conditions and onward to real economic activity were completely predictable, then there would be no need to focus on financial conditions as an intermediate target variable. The level and path of the fed funds rate matters, but it also matters how this gets transmitted to the real economy through the financial sector.\n\nOver the past 15 years, there have been two important instances in which the relationship between the fed funds rate and financial conditions have diverged significantly. The first was the late 1990s technology stock market bubble and its aftermath. The second was the mid-2000s credit market bubble that culminated in the recent financial crisis. During these episodes, the relationship between the fed funds rate and financial conditions was particularly unstable. As a result, developments in the financial markets became very important in the conduct of monetary policy.\n\nIn this respect, I would note that financial conditions indicators have implications for “Taylor Rule” formulations for monetary policy. As you all know, Taylor-type rules provide a short-hand metric for the appropriate stance of monetary policy. In such rules, the fed funds rate is set at a level equal to the equilibrium real fed funds rate, plus the inflation objective, plus the weighted deviation of output from its potential and of the inflation objective from actual or, if forward looking, expected inflation. Often, analysts and economists assume that the equilibrium real fed funds rate is equal to 2 percent, its long-term historical value. Although, in principle, such rules allow the equilibrium rate to be time varying, it typically is assumed to be constant.\n\nI have always been uncomfortable with this usage of a 2 percent equilibrium real rate assumption because it ignores the possibility that the equilibrium rate changes in response to technology shocks or in response to changes in how monetary policy is transmitted via the financial system to the real economy. For example, in the late 1990s, when trend productivity growth shifted upward, it seemed logical that this would also push up the equilibrium short-term real interest rate. That is because higher productivity growth, by raising the return on capital, spurs greater investment, thereby driving the equilibrium rate higher. Similarly, if stock prices rose sharply in response to higher productivity growth, this should also lead to a higher equilibrium real rate through the effect of greater stock market wealth on consumer spending. Higher stock prices meant that financial conditions were easier. This needed to be offset by a somewhat higher fed funds rate target.\n\nFinancial conditions also appear to have become more important in terms of their influence on business cycles. On the one hand, the fed funds rate has been more stable and the range of the fed funds rate over the cycle has been smaller. However, on the other hand, relative to what has happened to the fed funds rate target, financial conditions have become more volatile. The hypothesis that Ed McKelvey and I put forward in 1997 in response to evidence of the so-called “Great Moderation” seems to be well supported by the past two economic downturns and their aftermaths:\n\nPut simply, longer stretches of economic growth imply greater leverage and complacency and thus, greater financial problems when recessions do occur. In brief, longer U.S. business cycles logically lead to four linked consequences—more financial leverage, longer bouts of balance sheet repair, more subdued recoveries and longer periods of decline in inflation and interest rates during the early stages of recovery.2\n\nIf the economy is more stable, then market participants will have more appetite for risk. This works fine during the expansion stage, when growth is relatively stable. However, when a recession finally arrives, it is a bigger shock than when recessions were more frequent. This surprise results in a more substantial adjustment in financial conditions. Ironically, the increased stability of the business cycle during the expansion phase appears to increase the volatility and importance of financial conditions when recessions do occur.\n\nAt this stage, incorporating indicators of financial conditions into forecasting and into evaluating the conduct of monetary policy probably requires relying on constructing a “rough and ready” index. Macroeconomic models—especially dynamic stochastic general equilibrium models—do not incorporate robust financial sectors. Instead, these models have implicitly assumed that the monetary transmission mechanism and the financial intermediation process always works smoothly and predictably.3\n\nEvents of the past decade confirm that financial conditions matter and that the fed funds rate is not a sufficient statistic with which to assess the impact of monetary policy on the real economy. Of course, this is not news to the Federal Reserve, which has explicitly taken financial conditions into account in its conduct of monetary policy. This is evident in the transcripts of the FOMC meetings that are publicly available and the numerous references to financial conditions in the FOMC minutes that go back more than a decade.\n\nAn analysis of the FOMC minutes over the past decade indicates that references to financial conditions have been frequent, especially recently. Exhibit 1 illustrates the percentage of paragraphs in the minutes (excluding the directive and some other paragraphs associated with administrative matters such as the election of the chairman) that mention the phrase \"financial conditions.\" As can be seen, there have been frequent references over the past decade. One peak occurred in 2000 when the stock market peaked and began to deflate. Thereafter, references fell off a bit until rising sharply again recently. Clearly, the recent financial crisis has underscored the importance of financial conditions.\n\nToday’s paper makes clear the importance of financial conditions. The paper’s analysis of the many financial conditions indexes that have been constructed as proxies for overall financial conditions finds that many of these indexes have done better than the fed funds rate or other single-variable financial indicators as predictors of real economic activity.\n\nHowever, as the paper also makes very clear, the indexes that have been developed are still very rudimentary. In particular, most financial conditions indexes are ad hoc and incomplete. In their review of the existing financial condition indexes, the authors find considerable differences across the indexes in the way that they are constructed and in terms of the variables included.\n\nIn addition, there is another difficulty. As the financial system changes over time, both in terms of structure and in terms of financial products, the financial variables that we might determine to be important are also changing. For example, in the wake of the recent financial crisis, the variables that the paper’s authors call “neoclassical”—such as the yield curve and stock market prices—appear to have become less important relative to the variables that the authors term “non-neoclassical”—such as quantity and survey measures of credit availability. Variables that would work best 10 years ago as forecasting tools may no longer be very useful. As the structure of the financial system changes, the identity of variables that capture financial conditions naturally changes.\n\nLet me now discuss the paper in more detail. I will do this in two steps. First, I will discuss the considerable contributions of the paper. Second, I will talk about where the paper might be extended and other areas of future research that might seem appropriate.\n\nIn general, I liked the paper. I think it makes some important contributions in how to construct a more complete and robust financial conditions index. In particular, I thought the paper makes two important points:\n\nThe authors deserve considerable credit for constructing a financial conditions index (FCI) that is more rigorous and complete than any that have been developed in the past—44 financial variables divided across five categories. Moreover, this is not just innovation for its own sake. The new FCI does a better job than single-factor models in forecasting real gross domestic product (GDP).\n\nSo what are the shortcomings of this approach? First, including 44 variables may generate good results more because the additional variables add greater flexibility to soak up variability in real GDP, rather than providing a more solid theoretical underpinning. As the authors note, the variables were selected, in part, on the basis of what we know today about which variables are likely to be important. But this type of selection process—even if conducted on a pseudo real-time basis—introduces selection bias, which the authors do admit could be important.\n\nSecond, despite the inclusion of a large number of variables, some important ones may still be missing. In particular, leverage variables—such as the leverage ratio of the major securities dealers—may be an important component of financial conditions. The work of Tobias Adrian and Hyun Shin suggests that the increase in leverage of the major securities was a major factor that fueled the asset bubble preceding the recent crisis. If this was indeed the case as seems likely, this type of variable should also be included in a financial conditions framework.4\n\nThird, as the authors note, the resulting FCI is complex; it is difficult to estimate, update and to communicate what the results mean. I think FCIs have value as heuristic devices in highlighting what is important. One loses that benefit when the number of variables becomes large and the indexes become complex.\n\nFourth, it would be interesting to know how financial conditions indexes for other countries and regions would differ. The authors focus only on the United States. Thus, it is difficult to know whether the value of financial conditions indexes are specific to the United States or should be applied more broadly.\n\nFifth, I thought the paper could have gone further in exploring the implications of its results. The focus of the paper is on how to construct a financial conditions index that does a good job of forecasting economic activity. The paper does not tackle the implications for monetary policy stemming from developments in financial conditions as measured by the new FCI. If financial conditions evolve in an unanticipated way, how should this influence the conduct of monetary policy?\n\nIn particular, the authors note that during the 2003-06 period, financial conditions tightened less than expected given the rise in the fed funds rate and, during the 2007-08 period tightened even as the Federal Reserve slashed its fed funds rate target. These results raise a number of interesting questions. In particular, does the behavior of the new FCI imply that the Federal Reserve should have tightened more aggressively during the 2003-06 period or eased more aggressively during the 2007-09 period? The paper’s results seem to imply this, but it would be interesting to see whether this is the case or not.\n\nIt also would be useful to know how qualitatively important these differences are. If the differences are worth only a few basis points on the fed funds rate, then having a good indicator of financial conditions is not going to be a very important input in the formulation of monetary policy. In contrast, if a shift in financial conditions implies that the fed funds rate path was “off” by a hundred basis points relative to what actually occurred, then this obviously has big implications for monetary policy. The development of equilibrium models that incorporate financial conditions in a meaningful manner might prove helpful in answering these types of questions.5\n\nIn addition, I would like to know how the various linkages have changed over time. Is the linkage between the fed funds rate and financial conditions as measured by the new FCI loosening over time or not? If so, why is this happening? Is it due to financial market innovation or the growth in share of the non-bank financial sector? I also would like to know how the linkage between financial conditions and the real economy is changing over time. If this is happening, what are the implications for macroeconomic stability and monetary policy?\n\nFinally, I would like to know about the dynamic properties of the new FCI. Are particularly high (expansive) readings dangerous and should they be taken as suggestive of asset bubbles? Should the Federal Reserve try to prevent such occurrences because loose financial conditions precede episodes of financial instability? In this respect, when financial conditions become unusually expansive, is the fed funds rate the right tool to use to constrain or counteract such expansiveness? Or would it be better to use macroprudential tools such as leverage limits or loan-to-value requirements on residential real estate to keep financial conditions from becoming unusually expansive in the first place? I could imagine circumstances in which macroprudential tools might be used to tighten up the relationship between the fed funds rate and financial conditions. Would the use of such tools be helpful in achieving greater macroeconomic stability?\n\nAt this stage, there are many more questions than answers. I would strongly encourage the authors and others to continue their work on financial conditions and in exploring how developments in the financial sector influence both the real economy and monetary policy. The financial crisis has demonstrated that financial market developments matter greatly. The paper successfully makes the case that it would be useful to have a good set of summary statistics to serve as benchmarks to keep track of such developments. It also would be useful to have a better understanding of how shifts in financial conditions should be considered in the ongoing conduct of monetary policy.\n\nEXHIBIT 1\n\nThe percentage of paragraphs in the FOMC minutes that mention the phrase \"financial conditions,\" excluding the directive and paragraphs associated with administrative matters such as election of the chairman.\n\n__________________________________________\n\n1In my comments, I am going to assume that inflation expectations are always well anchored so that I do not need to distinguish between the real and nominal fed funds rate.\n2See The Brave New Business Cycle: No Recession in Sight, William Dudley and Edward McKelvey, January 1997, Goldman Sachs Economic Research Group.\n3Adding financial intermediation to these models has become a very active area of research.

        "content": "I welcome this opportunity to talk with business leaders, workers and educators. My goals are to hear what issues are on the minds of people here and to let you know what the Federal Reserve has been doing to help improve the economy. So I'm very grateful to the Center for the New Economy (CNE) for giving me the opportunity to speak to—and learn from—you. As always, what I have to say reflects my own views and not necessarily those of the Federal Open Market Committee or the Federal Reserve System.\n\nI want to start by talking about the implications of the close economic ties between the mainland and Puerto Rico. Since the economies of the mainland and the Commonwealth are very tightly linked, what happens on the mainland has important consequences for Puerto Rico, as well. In the aftermath of the financial crisis, we anticipate that the mainland recovery will prove to be sustainable, and that this will ultimately benefit the economy here. But Puerto Rico faces some significant challenges beyond its ties to the weaknesses in the broader U.S. economy, including problems in its own financial sector. Dealing with these problems forcefully and expeditiously is crucial to ensuring that Puerto Rico benefits fully from the expected economic recovery over the next few years. The Fed is assisting in several ways: by setting the stage for a resumption of world economic growth, by helping to resolve problems in the U.S. mainland and Commonwealth financial sectors and by partnering with Puerto Rican groups to make meaningful contributions toward resolving some of the Commonwealth's other underlying issues.\n\nPuerto Rico's Special Economic Relationship with the Mainland\nPuerto Rico has what economists often call an “open economy.” What this means is that Puerto Rico is especially dependent on external trade, so what happens to the Puerto Rican economy is greatly affected by what is going on with its major trading partners. When demand from Puerto Rico's export customers is weak, then sales and prices for the Commonwealth's products fall, so jobs and incomes on the island suffer.\n\nIn the recent recession—as in many financial crises—global trade declined even faster than output. As a result, the shock generated by the financial crisis spread quickly throughout the world. Economies and regions far from where the problems began suffered. This was especially true for economies dependent on trade, such as Puerto Rico's. In fact, Puerto Rico suffered much more than most because the Puerto Rican economy was already in recession when the financial crisis struck.\n\nWhile Puerto Rico interacts with many other economies, one partner looms especially large for the Commonwealth. For generations, the mainland United States and Puerto Rico have had a special economic relationship in many dimensions. One of the most obvious of these ties is the free flow of people between the mainland and the island. Indeed, according to the U.S. Census, about one half of the people who identify their origin as Puerto Rican lived on the mainland in 2008. The active migration, return migration and remittances to family members reflect and reinforce the close personal and economic ties between Puerto Rico and the mainland.\n\nAnother link is our common use of the dollar. This means that tourists from the mainland can visit without worrying about changing currencies. In addition, businesses can make long-term investments in Puerto Rico without worrying that currency fluctuations against the dollar will undermine their competitiveness. It also means that when the U.S. dollar falls in value, Puerto Rico's exports become more competitive around the world, although not, of course, in the United States.\n\nSomewhat less obvious are the consequences of the mainland's role as Puerto Rico's largest trading partner. The mainland accounts for half of the island's imports and three-quarters of its exports. With such heavy trade flows, when the mainland economy does poorly—as during the past year—Puerto Rico's economy and job growth suffer.\n\nFinancial regulation also represents an important linkage. Of course, my presence here representing the New York Fed is one example of that particular connection—Puerto Rico is part of the Second District of the Federal Reserve System, along with New York, the U.S. Virgin Islands and parts of New Jersey and Connecticut. I'll return to the theme of financial regulation shortly. For now, let me just say that we share, along with the rest of the world, a commitment to taking the necessary steps to prevent the type of financial crisis that we just experienced from recurring in the future.\n\nThe Fed's Role in Coping with the Crisis and the Outlook for the United States\nThe close ties with the mainland means that the broader outlook for the United States is very important for Puerto Rico. The U.S. economy has been through a terrible period, having suffered the worst financial crisis in 70 years. Extensive study of banking crises shows that they tend to be “protracted affairs” with surprisingly similar, if unpleasant, contours. Downturns average four years, during which the unemployment rate rises an average of 7 percentage points. The peak-to-trough decline in output averages 9 percent.\n\nThose statistics point out the risks that we faced. Well aware of the threat of a second Great Depression, U.S. policymakers took very aggressive actions to support economic growth in 2008 and 2009. The Fed provided liquidity facilities and took many other actions to contain and reduce pressures in financial markets, while the U.S. Treasury supported the banking system and provided cash and incentives to households, businesses, and state and local governments to support spending during 2009.\n\nThe Fed's “lender of last resort” interventions—including facilities such as the Term Securities Lending Facility (TSLF) and the Primary Dealer Credit Facility (PDCF), as well as programs such as reciprocal currency agreements—are examples of the rapid application of central banking tenets to the unique challenges we faced as this crisis evolved. Indeed, in many ways, the crisis has underscored why the Federal Reserve was created almost a century ago: to provide a backstop for a banking system prone to runs and financial panics.\n\nWhere it proved necessary and feasible, the Fed also used its emergency lending authority to forestall the disorderly failure of systemically important institutions. These actions truly were extraordinary—well outside the scope of our normal operations—but our judgment was that not taking those actions would have risked a broader collapse of the financial system and a significantly deeper and more protracted recession. Faced with the choice between these otherwise unpalatable actions and a broader systemic collapse, the Fed, with the full support of the Treasury, invoked its emergency lending authority and prevented the collapse of certain institutions previously considered to have been outside the safety net.\n\nMake no mistake: these necessary moves were unprecedented and controversial. The U.S. government's financing of Treasury's actions required federal debt to rise sharply, and stabilizing the financial system temporarily boosted the size of the Fed's balance sheet.\n\nBut there still is a lot of work to do. Smaller banks—especially those with large commercial real estate exposures—are under pressure, while households and smaller businesses find that their access to credit is still constrained.\n\nMoreover, regulatory reform is essential to prevent this type of financial crisis going forward. We need to ensure that no financial institution is “too big to fail.” This means we need Congress to enact a resolution mechanism that allows large, complex financial firms to be wound down smoothly, without the need for extraordinary interventions. In addition, we need to take steps to make the financial system as a whole more resilient and robust. This requires many steps—some already in train—including higher capital requirements for large banks, bigger liquidity buffers, and changes to ensure that compensation practices are consistent with safety and soundness and financial stability. It's a long list—there is no single silver bullet—and it will take time, but the regulatory community and the political leadership will fail to meet our shared responsibility as stewards if we do not implement the necessary reforms in a timely and effective manner.\n\nOutlook for the Recovery and Risks from the Financial Sector\nThe U.S. economy has begun to recover. Growth in the second half of 2009 was a bit stronger than expected and the pace of layoffs has diminished. We currently expect that the economy will keep expanding, but at a somewhat slower growth rate than during the second half of 2009 as the temporary boost from the inventory cycle fades and the effects of the stimulus bill gradually weaken. With modest growth, we expect price pressures to remain well contained.\n\nNonetheless, it's far too early to pop the champagne corks. While the U.S. economy is growing, unemployment remains unacceptably high and certain impediments could restrict growth in the near term. One set of challenges are current conditions in the financial system.\n\nThe initial stages of the financial crisis have been widely attributed to a rapid rise in residential mortgage defaults. Many large financial institutions turned out to have direct exposure—and often indirect exposure through complex linkages—to residential real estate, and found themselves facing severe funding problems as the value and liquidity of their assets sharply diminished.\n\nAs the real economy slipped into recession in 2008 and unemployment began to rise, other financial instruments came under stress, including commercial real estate loans and instruments based on these loans. Commercial real estate loans are frequently originated by medium-sized regional banks that have significant expertise in their local areas and are often held in the lending bank's portfolio.\n\nIn many parts of the United States, including Puerto Rico, these commercial real estate loans have now soured, and many banks are seeing the value of their assets decline and their revenues shrink. In extreme cases, some banks have become insolvent. Finding ways to address problem assets and the health of the exposed banks is fundamental to restoring the banking industry to the firm footing that is needed to properly support economic growth.\n\nTo bring this point home, let me step back and offer some observations on the importance of a well-functioning financial system. A healthy banking sector is crucial for economic growth because banks and other parts of the financial system play a key role in determining how savings are allocated among competing projects and users of credit. If households and businesses cannot get credit on reasonable terms, then the economy sputters. To underline this point, the Fed and Treasury did not intervene during the recent crisis to save the financial system (and with it, some big financial firms) for its own sake. We intervened because a collapse of the financial system would have done irreparable harm to Main Street. With the limited tools at hand, we made our choices (often between unattractive options) with the goal of supporting the economy, households and small businesses.\n\nA well-functioning financial system is also crucial in fostering economic development. History shows that substantial risks to the economy come from a persistently weak banking sector. Economists have debated whether healthy banks drive real economic growth, or vice-versa, but a wealth of recent evidence suggests that the causality runs at least partly from banks to growth, and not just the other way around. So, from my perspective, getting Puerto Rico's banking system back onto solid footing is “job one” for supporting growth here.\n\nPreparing Puerto Rico to Benefit from Recovery in the World Economy\nOf course, that isn't the whole story. Growth may also be impeded by factors that are specific to particular regions or policies.\n\nI work in New York and live in New Jersey, where we know a thing or two about fiscal problems. Puerto Rico's large public debt has the potential to reduce its growth prospects as the world economy recovers. Puerto Rico's fiscal situation has deteriorated sharply over the last five years as the Commonwealth's recession has deepened. Throughout this period, public debt has risen quickly as revenues that are sensitive to economic activity—such as income taxes—have declined.\n\nBut the fiscal problem in Puerto Rico pre-dates the current crisis. Even when the economy was growing, public debt was growing even faster. This structural imbalance is difficult to sustain in the long run, and requires attention if Puerto Rico is to prosper.\n\nA critical factor here is ensuring that the Commonwealth's tax system is designed to generate the revenue required to sustain government operations. Furthermore, any good tax system should satisfy three important criteria: simplicity, fairness and neutrality. The current system suffers from some problems that make it difficult to meet these tests and generate adequate revenue. In particular, high rates are levied on a narrow tax base.\n\nOne of the key public services funded by these taxes is education. Workers need skills to produce the complicated technological products of the future. There is clear evidence that workers with the sort of flexible thinking skills not easily duplicated by computers have seen their productivity and earnings rise, a trend that is likely to persist in the future. Thus, technology and skills are essential for healthy economic growth and for the financial health of workers and their families.\n\nAs the economy and financial system become more complex, financial literacy is also increasingly central to family financial well-being. Improved understanding of budgeting, saving, financial products and planning for retirement is not only a high priority for people in their own lives, but also for the Fed with its responsibility for monetary policy.\n\nEducation thus plays a key role in fostering upward mobility for future generations. All of this underscores the importance of achieving the best possible education for all of Puerto Rico's young people and making lifelong learning and skills development a part of everyone's future. Yet, about half of Puerto Rico's low-income students drop out of high school. Reducing this dropout rate will not be easy, but should also be a priority for the Commonwealth.\n\nThe private and public sectors both need accurate, timely and comprehensive economic statistics to perform effectively. It is impossible to make good decisions without a solid factual basis for those decisions. For example, the government needs good economic information to develop effective fiscal, economic development and regulatory policy. Likewise, to make the best production, investment and pricing decisions, businesses need accurate and timely information on things such as wages, income and prices. Poor quality information increases uncertainty and this uncertainty inhibits well-considered risk-taking and investment decisions.\n\nAlthough Puerto Rico's statistical system was once a model for other countries, now there are major opportunities for improvement in comparison with the mainland and other countries. In recognition of this need, the government of Puerto Rico recently established the Institute for Statistics to work with its statistical agencies.\n\nOne key example of these efforts concerns the Consumer Price Index (CPI) as a measure of inflation. A recent study by the Institute, aided by the Department of Labor, found that the island's official inflation rate was overestimated by more than double between 2001 and 2006. Overestimating inflation can have tangible consequences, such as excessive wage increases in certain sectors that can damage the island's global competitiveness and cause unnecessary job loss.\n\nAlso thanks to the Institute, the government of Puerto Rico now has a release schedule, called the “calendario,” for its statistical publications. This basic tool helps people, businesses and investors by ensuring that they use the latest available data for their decisions. It also boosts confidence in the data, which reduces economic uncertainty.\n\nHow the Fed Is Helping\nThere are many challenges ahead, and we are committed to being an active partner in confronting them. The Fed's most important roles in helping Puerto Rico, of course, emanate directly from our responsibilities for economic growth, stable prices and a resilient financial system. We continue to take the actions required to promote maximum sustainable growth in the U.S. economy. These efforts have and will continue to benefit the mainland and the Commonwealth.\n\nIn addition, we are working very closely with all of the banking supervisors and other key parties to facilitate an effective resolution to the current problems facing the island's banking sector. Some consolidation is likely needed to produce stronger, healthier institutions more able to make the sound lending decisions that support economic growth.\n\nI mentioned financial literacy a few minutes ago. The Federal Reserve System and the New York Fed have taken a great interest in economic education and financial literacy and will continue to do even more in the future. I, personally, believe that financial literacy is essential so that households can make the type of good financial decisions that help to ensure better futures.\n\nThese teachers take what they learned back to the classroom and many of their students enter the Federal Reserve Economics Competition. The students apply analytical skills to a local problem of their choosing and work as a team to create a presentation outlining their solution and responding to questions. The winning team develops skills—in analysis, presentations and teamwork—that will help them in their future studies and careers in the knowledge economy.\n\nWe have also had a productive relationship with our good friends at the Puerto Rico Bankers Association. Each year during “Community Reinvestment Act Week,” our staff highlights new ideas and products especially suited to the Puerto Rican market.\n\nFor example, this November we held a forum for Puerto Rican and U.S. Virgin Islands financial institutions, state and local governments, and nonprofit organizations to introduce “Bank On,” a financial product proven to attract under-banked people into the financial mainstream. Since then, several local banks have formed a group to explore how to best implement it here.\n\nAnother example of collaboration is our work with the Bankers Association and local universities. During the fall, we held a “Financial Awareness Video Contest” for college students. This pilot project explores building peer-to-peer financial awareness among young adults by having contestants create a 90-second video. We look forward to hosting the first place winners during their trip to New York in the spring.\n\nTo improve our understanding of the Puerto Rican economy, the New York Fed has joined a group of local businesses—including some represented here—to sponsor and fund a household survey, undertaken by the Center for the New Economy, our hosts today, to benchmark Puerto Rican consumer finances. As of today, the data have been collected and Fed economists are collaborating with the CNE to provide technical assistance, to make the results of this study public and to make these data available for further research.\n\nTo help businesses and government in Puerto Rico, we have also been providing technical assistance to Puerto Rico's new Institute for Statistics. We recognize the importance of this work and applaud its efforts to improve Puerto Rico's inflation measures, national income accounting and business activity measures, just to name a few.\n\nAll of these activities, from monetary policy and financial regulation to fostering community development and economic literacy and measurement, complement and reinforce each other. Our policy actions are most effective when people understand how financial markets work. Our decisions are always better when we are well informed about the concerns of families and businesses. Thus, outreach to the region and communities we serve is an important part of my job. Thank you for your kind attention. I would be happy to take a few questions.\n\nLos retos del futuro\nReflexiones de William C.

        "content": "As always, my views are my own and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Open Market Committee or the Federal Reserve System.\n\nWith respect to what went wrong, it is important to recognize that the financial crisis occurred for a host of reasons and, thus, there is no single silver bullet to avoid such crises in the future. At the heart of the crisis was a tremendous buildup in leverage, which our regulatory framework failed to prevent. Large amounts of opaque, illiquid, long-term assets were financed by short-term liabilities, and much of this financing occurred in the shadow banking system. When the housing bubble burst, financial asset prices fell and exposed the deep linkages and overall fragility of our system. Interbank funding markets seized up, the shadow banking system crumpled and several major financial firms—banks and nonbanks alike—collapsed or approached the brink of collapse. Extraordinary interventions of governments and central banks around the world were necessary to prevent a complete collapse of the financial system and the broader economy.\n\nAs a general matter, regulators did not appreciate beforehand how vulnerable the system was to shocks. In particular, there was a failure to appreciate the important interconnections among the banking system, capital markets, and payment and settlement system. For example, the disruption of the securitization markets caused by the poor performance of highly rated debt securities led to significant problems for major financial institutions. These banks had to take assets back on their books, backstop lines of credit were triggered, and banks could no longer securitize loans, thus increasing the pressure on their balance sheets. This reduced credit availability, which increased the downward pressure on economic activity, which caused asset values to decline further, and in turn, increased the degree of stress in the financial system.\n\nMoreover, regulators did not adequately understand how the dynamics of the system tended to exacerbate shocks, rather than dampen their impact. For example, with respect to capital, firms under stress had incentives to continue to pay dividends to show that they were strong. These dividend payments actually depleted capital, making the firms weaker and vulnerable to credit rating downgrades. When credit ratings were indeed cut, that increased collateral calls, which intensified the pressure on scarce liquidity resources.\n\nRegulatory gaps were another important factor in causing the crisis. American International Group, Inc. (AIG) is a case in point. AIG Financial Products, a subsidiary of the AIG parent company, provided guarantees against default on complex collateralized debt obligations, leveraging the AAA rating of the AIG parent company in the process. This activity was conducted with inadequate regulatory oversight, poor risk management and insufficient capital.\n\nFinally, many of the incentives built into the system ultimately undermined its stability. The problems with incentives were evident in a number of areas, including faulty compensation schemes and risk management that was too narrowly focused on one business area without regard for the broader entity. These incentives created important externalities in which participants did not bear the full costs of their actions.\n\nTurning to where we are now, the U.S. financial system is in much better shape today than it was a year ago. The capital markets are generally open for business—with the important exception of some securitization markets—and the major securities dealers that survived the crisis have seen a sharp recovery in profitability. The largest U.S. bank holding companies, which went through the Supervisory Capital Assessment Program exercise, have more and better quality capital, having raised more than $100 billion of common equity over the past year in the capital markets and generated nearly as much common equity via preferred stock conversions and from gains on asset sales.\n\nHowever, many smaller and medium-sized banks remain under significant pressure. This reflects several factors. First, such institutions hold assets that are carried mainly on the books on an accrual basis. Compared with mark-to-market assets, such assets adjust much more slowly to changes in market conditions and the economic environment. Second, many of these banks have a much more concentrated exposure to commercial real estate, a sector that remains under considerable pressure. Not only have capitalization rates risen sharply—meaning the investors will pay much less for a dollar of rental income than before—but the rental income streams on these properties also have declined as the performance of the U.S. economy has declined. Together, these two factors have pushed U.S. commercial real estate prices down by about 40 percent to 50 percent from the peak reached in 2006. Loan losses in commercial real estate and consumer and mortgage loans seem likely to continue to pressure smaller banks for some time to come. This in turn means that credit availability to households and small businesses will still be curtailed.\n\nThe improvement in the overall health of the financial system and in market function has allowed the Federal Reserve to phase out many of the special liquidity facilities that were enacted in response to the crisis. These facilities were generally successful in achieving their objectives—helping to restore confidence and rebuild market liquidity in a way that safeguarded the taxpayers' interests. When a full accounting of the special liquidity facilities is complete, it seems likely that the facilities will have generated substantial incremental earnings that the Federal Reserve will remit to the Treasury. Although these incremental earnings were not the objective of these facilities, they are a pleasant outcome relative to the alternative.\n\nAs the crisis has abated, our attention has shifted to what we need to do to prevent another crisis in the future. We need to take the necessary steps to build a strong and resilient financial system. In my opinion, three broad sets of actions are needed:\n\nMacroprudential supervision is essential for two reasons. First, it addresses the problem of gaps in the regulatory regime and the regulatory arbitrage that such gaps can encourage. Second, macroprudential supervision is needed because the financial system is interconnected. Siloed regulatory oversight is not sufficient. Supervisory practices must be revamped so that supervision is also horizontal—looking broadly across banks, nonbanks, markets and geographies. This also means that regulatory standards need to be harmonized across different regions. Without harmonization, there will inevitably be a \"race to the bottom\" and regulatory arbitrage will be encouraged, rather than inhibited.\n\nMany steps are needed to make financial institutions and infrastructure more robust. For example, we need to strengthen bank capital requirements, improve liquidity buffers and make financial market infrastructures more resilient to shocks when individual firms get into trouble.\n\nIn terms of capital requirements, many changes are needed, including global capital standards that put more emphasis on common equity, establish an overall leverage limit and better capture all of the sources of risk in the capital assessment process. Improved risk capture, for example, includes the trading accounts of banks. Some institutions had clearly not set aside adequate levels of capital given the risks that were embedded in their trading positions.\n\nIt would also be very desirable to develop a mechanism to bolster the amount of common equity available to absorb losses in adverse economic environments. This might be done most efficiently by allowing the issuance of debt instruments that would automatically convert to common equity in stress environments, under certain pre-specified conditions. Such \"contingent capital\" instruments might have proven very helpful had they been in place before and during this crisis. Investors would have anticipated that common equity would be replenished automatically if a firm came under stress, and this knowledge might have tempered anxieties about counterparty risk. At a minimum, contingent capital instruments might have enabled common equity buffers at the weaker firms to be replenished earlier and automatically, thereby reducing uncertainty and the risk of failure.\n\nOn the liquidity front, there are a host of initiatives underway. The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision is working on establishing international standards for liquidity requirements. There are two parts to this. The first is a requirement for a short-term liquidity buffer of sufficient size so that an institution that was shut out of the market for several weeks would still have sufficient liquidity to continue its operations unimpaired. The second is a liquidity standard that limits the degree of permissible maturity transformation—that is, the amount of short-term borrowing allowed to be used in the funding of long-term illiquid assets. Under these standards, a firm's holdings of illiquid long-term assets would need to be funded mainly by equity or long-term debt.\n\nWith respect to financial market infrastructures, the Federal Reserve is working with a broad range of private-sector participants, including dealers, clearing banks and tri-party repo investors to dramatically reduce the structural instability of the tri-party repo system. Similarly, over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives clearance activity is being pushed toward central counterparties and exchanges. In addition, the Federal Reserve and others are evaluating how greater transparency with respect to OTC derivatives prices would improve financial stability. The Committee on Payment and Settlement Systems and the Technical Committee of the International Organization of Securities Commissions are doing a review of standards for payment, clearing and settlement systems. This work will inform the efforts of the Financial Stability Board to strengthen such standards.\n\nThere is also work underway on the problem of how to ensure that financial institutions have compensation structures that curb rather than encourage excessive risk-taking.\n\nFinally, it is critical that we ensure that no firm is too big to fail. This is about both fairness and having proper incentives in the financial system. Having some firms that are too big to fail creates moral hazard. These firms are able to obtain funding on more attractive terms because debt holders expect that the government will intervene rather than allow failure. In addition, too big to fail creates perverse incentives. In a too-big-to-fail regime, firms have an incentive to get large, not because it facilitates greater efficiency, but instead because the implicit government backstop enables the too-big-to-fail firm to achieve lower funding costs.\n\nTo solve the too-big-to fail problem, we need to do two things. First, we need to develop a truly robust resolution mechanism that allows for the orderly wind-down of a failing institution and that limits the contagion to the broader financial system. This will require not only domestic legislation, but also intensive work internationally to address a range of legal issues involved in winding down a major global firm.\n\nSecond, we need to reduce the likelihood that systemically important institutions will come close to failure in the first place. This can be done by mandating higher capital requirements, improving the risk capture of those requirements and by requiring greater liquidity buffers for such firms.\n\nAlthough the raging crisis appears to be over, our work is not close to being complete. Making sure this work keeps moving forward and is coordinated internationally is hugely important. Differences in views across countries and regions should not divert the international community from the more important prize—taking the actions collectively that will ensure a robust and resilient financial system."

        "content": "Stabilizing AIG\nI. Background\nAs is now well known, AIG’s liquidity crisis emerged at nearly the same time that the securities firm Lehman Brothers collapsed, one week after the GSEs Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were placed in conservatorship, and amidst ongoing acute stress in U.S. and global financial markets. It was against this backdrop, and in recognition of the financial stability threat posed by the abrupt and disorderly failure of an even larger and more complex firm than the one that had failed a day earlier, that the Board of Governors, with the full support of the Treasury Department, decided to intervene to prevent the bankruptcy of AIG on September 16, 2008.\n\nAIG was a $1 trillion company when it alerted the Treasury and the Federal Reserve that it was encountering severe liquidity problems. It remains one of the largest insurance and financial services companies in the world. AIG conducts insurance and finance operations in more than 140 countries and has more than 76 million individual and corporate customers globally. In the United States, AIG has approximately 30 million customers, including commercial, institutional and individual customers. It is also a major provider of protection to municipalities, pension funds, and other public and private entities through guaranteed investment contracts and products that protect participants in 401(k) retirement plans.\n\nIn terms of net premiums underwritten, AIG is both the largest life and health insurer, and the second largest property and casualty insurer in the United States. It has written more than 81 million life insurance policies worldwide, with a face value of $1.9 trillion. The company insures approximately 180,000 small businesses, non-profit organizations and other corporate entities. Estimates are that close to one-third of the United States population, or 106 million people, are employed by entities that are protected by insurance coverage issued by AIG. AIG is the largest issuer of fixed annuities in the United States. It is also one of the largest providers of retirement services to non-profit healthcare groups, schools and universities. More than six million people hold retirement plans or accounts with AIG.\n\nAIG had also been a major participant in derivatives markets through its Financial Products business unit (AIG FP), an unregulated subsidiary. AIG FP had engaged in financial transactions with a broad range of customers, which include many major national and international financial institutions, as well as U.S. pension plans, stable value funds and municipalities.\n\nAn AIG bankruptcy under the economic conditions existing in the fall of 2008 would have had catastrophic consequences for our financial system and our economy. Money market mutual funds to which so many Americans entrust their savings were major holders of the roughly $20 billion of commercial paper issued by AIG. Losses to these funds would have had potentially devastating effects on confidence and would have accelerated the run on financial institutions of all kinds. By way of comparison, money market mutual funds and other investors held approximately $5 billion of commercial paper issued by Lehman Brothers. Lehman’s collapse triggered a run on money market funds after the Reserve Primary Fund “broke the buck” due to losses on Lehman commercial paper.\n\nGlobal commercial banks and investment banks would have suffered losses on loans and lines of credit to AIG and on derivatives contracts and other transactions with AIG FP. This could have led to the outright collapse of the financial system. At a minimum, it would have caused even greater constraints on the availability of credit to homeowners and businesses.\n\nIn the event of an AIG failure, many of AIG’s insurance subsidiaries likely would have been seized by their state and foreign regulators, leaving U.S. policyholders facing considerable uncertainty about their rights and claims. State and local government entities that had lent in excess of $10 billion to AIG would have been exposed to losses in an already difficult and deteriorating municipal budget environment.\n\nAIG also had approximately $38 billion of what are called stable value wrap contracts. These contracts allow trustees and investment managers of defined contribution plans to manage the asset-liability mismatch arising from withdrawals. Workers whose 401(k) plans had purchased these contracts from AIG to insure against the risk that their stable value funds would decline in value could have seen that insurance disappear in the event of an AIG bankruptcy. Pension plans would have been forced to write down their assets from book to market value, resulting in significant losses in participants’ portfolios.\n\nUltimately, AIG, the world’s largest insurance company, received extraordinary assistance because of the impact its failure would have had all across America. As Federal Reserve Vice Chairman Donald Kohn has testified, “because of the dependence of modern economies on the flow of credit, serious financial instability imposes disproportionately large costs on the broader economy. The rationale for public investment in the financial industry is not, therefore, any special regard for managers, workers, or investors in that industry over others, but rather the need to prevent a further deterioration in financial conditions that would destroy jobs and incomes in all industries and regions.”\n\nII. AIG Credit Facilities\nOn September 16, 2008, the Board of Governors authorized the New York Fed to lend up to $85 billion to AIG through a secured revolving credit facility (Fed Facility). The Fed Facility was (and remains) secured by a pledge of a substantial portion of AIG’s assets, including ownership interests in the company’s domestic and foreign insurance subsidiaries. As additional compensation for this Facility, AIG issued, to a trust for the benefit of the Treasury, preferred stock convertible into approximately 78 percent of AIG’s outstanding common stock.\n\nThe policy decision to authorize a loan to AIG was a difficult one, because addressing the systemic crisis facing the United States required the Federal Reserve to assist a private company at the center of the risks that led to the crisis. Nonetheless, the potentially far-reaching consequences of an AIG bankruptcy compelled policymakers to take affirmative action. The failure of AIG in the fall of 2008 would have imposed significant financial losses on many individuals, households and businesses, shattered confidence in already fragile financial markets, and greatly increased fear and uncertainty about the viability of our financial institutions. Last month, Chairman Bernanke observed that the Federal Reserve did not lend support to AIG for the Fed’s own benefit, “because it obviously has hurt the Federal Reserve in the public’s view. We did it because we felt that there was no other way to avoid what [many] have called the risk of a catastrophic collapse of the financial system.”\n\nThe initial emergency $85 billion Fed Facility was successful in stabilizing AIG in the short term, but the company’s financial condition and capital structure remained vulnerable to further deterioration in market conditions. AIG’s pressing liquidity needs were resulting in rapid and sizeable draws on the Fed Facility, prompting concern that AIG’s needs might well exceed the facility’s capacity. The prospect of further downgrades of AIG’s credit rating by rating agencies intensified the liquidity concerns AIG faced, because such downgrades would have immediately triggered billions of dollars of additional liquidity demands related to AIG FP’s business. Absent further government action, a ratings downgrade was all but inevitable.\n\nIn early October of 2008, the Board of Governors approved an additional secured credit facility that permitted the New York Fed to lend AIG up to $37.8 billion in order to address liquidity needs related to the securities lending program of certain AIG domestic insurance subsidiaries. Additionally, toward the end of October 2008, four AIG affiliates began participating in the Federal Reserve’s Commercial Paper Funding Facility (CPFF) on the same terms and conditions as other participants.\n\nNotwithstanding AIG’s access to these additional Federal Reserve credit facilities, AIG continued to face serious liquidity pressures. Some of these pressures arose out of AIG’s losses on residential mortgage backed securities (RMBS) it had invested in as part of its securities lending program. In November 2008, the Board of Governors authorized the New York Fed to take a second step to alleviate these pressures by funding Maiden Lane II, which purchased RMBS at market value and allowed AIG to unwind its securities lending transactions. With this transaction, the original $37.8 billion facility to fund AIG’s repayment of its securities lending transactions was fully repaid and terminated.\n\nA substantial additional cause of AIG’s liquidity pressure was its exposure to credit default swaps, or CDSs, one of many derivative products AIG FP offered. A CDS is essentially an unregulated insurance policy that protects the holder of a security from default. AIG FP, the CDS seller, agreed to protect its counterparties, the CDS buyers, from losses incurred on certain securities owned by the counterparties. In return, the counterparties paid AIG FP periodic premiums.\n\nUnder the terms of these particular CDS contracts, counterparties had the right to require AIG FP to post cash collateral as a result of adverse events relating either to the underlying securities, which in this case were multi-sector collateralized debt obligations (CDOs), or to AIG’s credit condition, such as a ratings downgrade. The posted collateral secured each counterparty in the event AIG FP was not able to perform on the contract as contemplated. AIG FP’s performance on these contracts was also guaranteed by its parent, AIG, making it impossible to isolate AIG FP’s problems from AIG or its insurance subsidiaries. As AIG’s financial condition deteriorated in 2008, and as the CDOs declined in value as the nation fell deeper into crisis, AIG FP was forced to post more and more collateral to the counterparties, a cash outflow that in turn caused AIG’s liquidity and credit condition to deteriorate further. It was a vicious cycle.\n\nAs explained in the report by the Office of the Special Inspector General for the Troubled Asset Relief Program, or SIGTARP, entitled “Factors Affecting Efforts to Limit Payments to AIG Counterparties” (SIGTARP-10-003), the Federal Reserve considered a number of options in an effort to address the liquidity drain created by AIG’s CDS exposure. One critical constraint applied to any option chosen: it had to be arranged by the earnings announcement on November 10th, when AIG was facing an imminent credit ratings downgrade in connection with its announcement of a $25 billion loss for the third quarter.\n\nThe first proposed option would have allowed the counterparties to keep their multi-sector CDOs and the protection provided by the credit default swaps. The counterparties would have agreed to forego additional collateral calls in exchange for a New York Fed guarantee of AIG’s performance under the credit default swaps. Under this proposal, the New York Fed would not own the underlying CDOs, but the New York Fed—through the guarantee—would eliminate the downside risk to the counterparties of a further decline in the CDOs’ market value. Not only did this structure have unappealing economics—taxpayer funds would have been exposed to the downside risk with no opportunity to participate in the upside—it also was not viable because the Federal Reserve lacked legal authority to issue the proposed guarantee under this structure.\n\nThe second proposed option would have involved persuading AIG’s counterparties to take back some of the risk relating to the CDOs from AIG by canceling their credit default swaps and selling the underlying CDOs to an SPV. The SPV would be funded by the counterparties, the New York Fed, and AIG, with the counterparties’ interests subordinated to those of the New York Fed. The New York Fed was concerned that the counterparties would not be motivated to cancel the swaps if they were left with un-hedged CDO risk associated with their part of the financing. This option was also deemed impractical because the complex negotiations required for each counterparty could not be completed quickly enough to satisfy AIG’s liquidity needs, i.e., before November 10th.\n\nThe third option became Maiden Lane III.\n\nIII. Maiden Lane III\nIn the months leading up to early November 2008, AIG had been actively engaged in efforts to negotiate tear-ups of its CDS contracts with its counterparties. AIG was completely unsuccessful. The need for the tear-ups was real; AIG was effectively hemorrhaging cash. Throughout October, while the New York Fed worked to identify various restructuring options, AIG continued to negotiate with its counterparties. The New York Fed ultimately agreed to participate in these counterparty negotiations, extremely mindful of the exigency of obtaining final agreement with at least the eight largest counterparties by Monday, November 10th, when earnings were to be released by AIG.\n\nThe earnings release would show a third quarter loss of approximately $25 billion. The ratings agencies had advised AIG that, absent a parallel announcement of solutions to its liquidity problems, a ratings downgrade was certain following the earnings announcement. With that further downgrade, additional collateral calls, and possibly terminations, would be triggered. As of November 6, 2008, AIG had drawn down approximately $61 billion of the $85 billion Fed Facility, leaving $24 billion of liquidity for operations and further collateral calls. Continuing to borrow from the Fed Facility, however, was not a solution to AIG’s problems. First, additional borrowing from the Federal Reserve would significantly add to AIG’s overall debt burden, which was a very negative factor in the eyes of the rating agencies. Second, it was doubtful that the remaining $24 billion in the line of credit would cover the anticipated collateral calls under the CDS contracts and AIG’s other liquidity needs.\n\nIn the limited time available, agreement had to be obtained from at least the eight largest counterparties, who together represented the bulk of AIG’s CDS exposure. A ratings downgrade on November 10th would have created a possibly fatal downward spiral for AIG. Unless the Federal Reserve was prepared to pump substantially more funds into AIG by increasing the $85 billion credit line, the only option would have been to reverse course and allow AIG to file for bankruptcy. This abrupt reversal of course would not only have triggered all of the adverse consequences for the U.S. and global economies that prompted the initial intervention, it would also have undermined the public’s trust in the U.S. government’s commitment to the broader range of extraordinary financial stability initiatives underway during that very fragile period. With bankruptcy not an option, it was necessary to find a solution that stemmed the liquidity drain arising from the continuing collateral calls on the CDS contracts, stabilized AIG and protected the taxpayer interests. The Maiden Lane III transaction was that solution.\n\nIn this context, the Board of Governors authorized the New York Fed to lend Maiden Lane III up to $30 billion, and to secure that loan with the multi-sector CDOs that were insured by the AIG CDS contracts. Pursuant to this authorization, the New York Fed lent $24.3 billion to Maiden Lane III that it used, in combination with a $5 billion equity investment from AIG, to purchase CDOs from 16 of AIG’s counterparties. At the time, the CDOs had a fair market value of about $29.6 billion and a par value of approximately $62 billion. In exchange for agreeing to terminate AIG’s CDS contracts and turning over the underlying CDOs to Maiden Lane III, the counterparties would also be allowed to retain approximately $35 billion in collateral previously posted by AIG. The result was that counterparties essentially received “par,” with Maiden Lane III obtaining the CDOs and AIG obtaining the tear-up of the CDSs.\n\nAIG’s $5 billion equity investment in Maiden Lane III was subordinated to the Fed’s $24.3 billion secured loan, and the Fed also obtained two-thirds of the upside in Maiden Lane III—securing both downside protection and upside participation for the U.S. taxpayer. Moreover, because Maiden Lane III can hold the underlying CDOs to maturity, it is largely immune from trading prices and liquidity needs, and is therefore in a better position to maximize the value of the CDO portfolio.\n\nThe Federal Reserve executed a transaction that involved an asset purchase and the termination of AIG’s CDS contracts. By terminating the CDS contracts, the Federal Reserve stopped the collateral calls and the resulting liquidity drain on AIG. By stopping this liquidity drain, the Federal Reserve avoided AIG’s downgrade and downward spiral and the resulting threat to the U.S. economy.\n\nIV. Negotiating Concessions from AIG’s Counterparties\nThe Federal Reserve has been criticized by some for not using its regulatory power to force the counterparties to accept less money for the CDOs. The critics overlook a number of key factors.\n\nFirst, there was little time, and substantial execution risk and attendant harm of not getting the deal done by the deadline of November 10th. As noted above, AIG had attempted for some time to negotiate tear-ups of its CDS contracts with its counterparties under terms more favorable than Maiden Lane III. It did not succeed. When the Federal Reserve reached out to AIG’s counterparties, we believed, based on AIG’s own experience, that our probability of success of getting them timely to agree to concessions was slim. Even in a best-case scenario, we did not expect that the counterparties would offer anything more than a modest discount to par. In our judgment, taking additional time to press further for a discount was not justified in light of the overwhelming risk and catastrophic consequences of failing to complete the transaction by November 10. Today, it might be tempting to suggest that a transaction that was in the best interests of the taxpayers could have been improved had the New York Fed pressed harder for concessions. But it is much more likely that continuing to push the counterparties toward concessions would not have gotten us to final agreements on November 10th. The consequences to AIG and our economy of failing to reach an agreement made obtaining concessions a lower priority than executing the transactions.\n\nSecond, the Federal Reserve had little or no bargaining power given the circumstances. This restructuring negotiation was taking place in November of 2008, less than two months after the decision to rescue AIG from insolvency and the infusion of tens of billions of dollars. The Federal Reserve had already acted to rescue AIG, and the counterparties fully expected that we would stand by that decision, especially because the economic situation had gotten worse, not better. So, the typical threat in such negotiations—we will stand down and watch AIG file for bankruptcy—would have been an idle threat had we made it. In addition, the counterparties were unwilling to offer concessions because their contractual rights were already well-protected. The value of the CDOs they held, combined with the $35 billion of collateral they had previously obtained from AIG was, in most cases, equal to or in excess of par value. Thus, if AIG defaulted, and even filed for bankruptcy protection, the counterparties would have kept both the collateral and the underlying CDOs (and would have been made whole if they had sold the CDOs for fair value).\n\nFinally, even if we had had bargaining power, the rating agencies, as discussed above, were closely examining AIG for signs that it would not be able to address its financial situation. If they saw the Federal Reserve take any action that seemed to suggest a lack of full support, in particular a bankruptcy threat, it might well have led to an immediate downgrade and the irreversible destruction of AIG, with the attendant consequences on the financial stability of our economy.\n\nSome have said that, in the absence of other bargaining power, the Federal Reserve should have used its regulatory power—threatening an adverse use of that power, or suggesting some kind of a benefit flowing from it—to make regulated counterparties give up or compromise their contractual rights. We see that as an abuse of regulatory power. The idea that the Federal Reserve would threaten a financial institution with supervisory action when no grounds for such action exist, or give a financial institution special treatment simply to gain an advantage in a commercial transaction is, in our view, an abuse of our authority. Such conduct by the Federal Reserve might have generated bargaining power over the counterparties, but it is simply inconsistent with the rule of law.\n\nIt also would have resulted in unfair treatment of supervised firms. Institutions regulated by the Federal Reserve would have been required to make concessions, while those not subject to the Federal Reserve’s supervisory authority would not. As a result, domestic banking organizations regulated by the Federal Reserve would have received less for their property than would foreign banks. This would violate the principle of equality of treatment, a fundamental value of the Federal Reserve.\n\nBy getting the eight largest counterparties and AIG to execute term sheets by November 10th, and another eight to do the same shortly thereafter, the Federal Reserve accomplished its overarching goal of avoiding the failure of AIG. As a subsidiary objective, the taxpayers have a well-structured vehicle with downside protection and upside potential, which owns a securities portfolio worth billions more than the loan balance. Moreover, it bears mention that more than $6 billion of the loan has already been repaid.\n\nThe situation faced by AIG and the Federal Reserve in the fall of 2008 with respect to the CDS contracts pointedly demonstrates the urgent need for adoption of new resolution procedures for systemically important nonbank financial firms. Had such a tool been available at that time, it could have been used to put AIG into conservatorship or receivership. Not only would this option have allowed AIG to be unwound in an orderly way, protecting policyholders, customers and taxpayers, but it would have provided a clear and effective mechanism for imposing appropriate haircuts on creditors and counterparties.\n\nAIG’s Securities Disclosures\nOn November 25, 2008, Maiden Lane III began purchasing the underlying CDOs from AIG FP’s counterparties. Under SEC rules, because AIG had entered into a “Material Definitive Agreement,” it was required to file a Form 8-K with the SEC within four business days. On November 24th, a lawyer for AIG sent a draft version of the 8-K to lawyers for the New York Fed to review, asking for their comments. This made sense: Maiden Lane III was created, funded and majority-owned by the New York Fed, and AIG wanted to ensure that its public filings would be accurate.\n\nIt is commonplace for a publicly traded company to share draft securities filings with another company where the subject matter involves a material transaction affecting both companies. Both the reporting company and the second company—whether the second company is publicly traded or not—want to ensure that the public filing is accurate. What is described here is the kind of thing that routinely happens in major transactions.\n\nAlthough AIG was consulting regularly with the New York Fed, it is important to note that AIG fully understood that it was wholly responsible for the content of its SEC filings. Indeed, lawyers for both sides were very aware of their respective roles. Lawyers for the New York Fed, both at the Bank and through its outside law firm of Davis Polk & Wardwell LLP, made suggestions about content and timing. AIG and its outside counsel at Sullivan & Cromwell LLP and Weil Gotshal & Manges LLP, accepted the edits that they felt improved the accuracy of the descriptions of the transactions, and declined those edits that they felt did not.\n\nThe first 8-K was filed by AIG on December 2, 2008, after Maiden Lane III purchased the first group of CDOs. On December 18 and 22, 2008, Maiden Lane III purchased a second group of CDOs. Also, an agreement struck in November in conjunction with the original transaction, known as the Shortfall Agreement between Maiden Lane III and AIG FP, was amended as of December 18th. These events required the filing of a second 8-K on December 24, 2008. As with the initial public disclosure three weeks earlier, there were many e-mails among all the lawyers before the filing on the 24th. Once again, the New York Fed lawyers had two goals: (1) to help AIG make this filing accurate and consistent with the first; and (2) to protect, where appropriate, the substantial taxpayer funds at stake in Maiden Lane III. And once again, after receiving the New York Fed’s suggestions, AIG, aided by its two outside law firms, made the disclosures that they deemed to be legally required and otherwise appropriate.\n\nWith that factual backdrop in place, I would now like to turn to the assertions that the New York Fed somehow pressured AIG into “covering up” parts of the transactions in its securities disclosures. There have been four separate allegations, and I would like to address each one in turn.\n\nI. Disclosure of Par Value Payments to CDS Counterparties\nFirst, let me address the assertion that the New York Fed pressured AIG to remove a line in the second 8-K filed on December 24th stating that “the AIG FP counterparties received 100 percent of the par value of the Multi-Sector CDOs sold.” The New York Fed believed that disclosure of the actual arithmetic showing that the counterparties received essentially par value was more accurate and would make the new 8-K consistent with AIG’s prior 8-K announcing Maiden Lane III. The draft 8-K listed the par value ($16 billion) as well as the amount paid to the counterparties ($6.7 billion), and the amount of collateral previously paid to the counterparties that AIG was surrendering ($9.2 billion). Adding up the last two numbers (which total $15.9 billion) shows that the counterparties were receiving essentially par (which was listed as $16 billion). Because the sum tendered to the counterparties was slightly less than par, the proposed sentence about it being 100 percent of par value (and which was not in the prior 8-K) was not completely accurate, and it was therefore suggested that it be removed.\n\nThis was done to be accurate, not to cover up the fact that the counterparties were essentially receiving par. The New York Fed lawyers were motivated by concern for accuracy and precision in the content of these Form 8-Ks. In fact, the clearest evidence that there was no cover up was that it was widely understood in the market and reported in the press at the time that the counterparties were receiving very close to par value. For example, an analyst report published by Credit Suisse on December 2, 2008—the same day as the initial 8-K filing addressing the first settlements with the counterparties—opens with the following sentence: “This evening AIG terminated $46.1b of its $71.6b of targeted multi-sector CDO exposure, at par.” Similarly, a Fox-Pitt-Kelton report dated the next day, December 3, 2008, contains the following statement: “Along with surrendering $25.9 billion of collateral that had been previously posted by AIG with the counterparties, the purchase of the $46.1 billion of par value essentially made the counterparties whole.” On November 12, 2008, a month earlier and shortly after the initial announcement of the Maiden Lane III facility, an article in The Wall Street Journal stated: “The banks that participate will be compensated for the securities’ full, or par, value in exchange for allowing AIG to unwind the credit default swaps it wrote.” On December 25, 2008, the day after the second 8-K was filed, an article in The Washington Post further reported that, “The fund, called Maiden Lane III, paid about $6.7 billion to the investors for the securities in the latest purchases. The counterparties were also able to keep more than $9 billion that AIG had posted in collateral, reimbursing them at face value for the assets.” The fact that the disclosure included all of the actual numbers, and that analysts and the media understood them immediately, belie any assertions of a cover up.\n\nII. Disclosure of Transactions Involving Synthetic CDOs\nThe second assertion relates to the New York Fed’s suggestion to delete that portion of AIG’s draft press release accompanying the December 24th 8-K that implied that the New York Fed would enter into additional transactions with AIG concerning the termination of a portfolio of CDS relating to synthetic CDOs. This edit was proposed because there was in fact no commitment at the time for either the Federal Reserve or Maiden Lane III to acquire the synthetic CDOs that backed this portfolio of CDSs. Indeed, neither the Federal Reserve nor Maiden Lane III has acquired any synthetic CDOs from any counterparty of AIG FP. Thus, rather than seeking to conceal information, the New York Fed comment was made in an effort to help ensure the accuracy of the disclosures so as to avoid any suggestion that the New York Fed had made a commitment that was not made at the time (and in fact was never made). The comment also ensured that there would be no incorrect expectation created in the public markets that such additional Federal Reserve assistance to AIG would be forthcoming.\n\nIII. Disclosure of the CDS Counterparties\nThird, some have suggested that in November 2008, AIG had planned to disclose the identities of the CDS counterparties and that the New York Fed pressured or compelled AIG not to. This is not true. In December 2008, circumstances were very different than today. Markets were much more fragile, and AIG was concerned at the time that its counterparties, and potentially other AIG customers, would stop doing business with AIG if they believed that the government would cause the disclosure of what is ordinarily confidential customer information, including, in some cases, customer identities. If counterparties and customers began moving away from AIG, the company feared that it would be subject to a loss of business and possible additional downgrades from the rating agencies. This would have had the effect of harming the taxpayers’ investment in AIG by reducing the public’s interest in doing business with AIG.\n\nFor this reason, the New York Fed actively supported AIG’s application to the SEC to have the names of its counterparties remain confidential. In March 2009, in response to requests by Congress that the identities of the CDS counterparties be made public, and after taking account of its decision to wind down the AIG FP derivatives business, AIG changed its view and decided to reveal the counterparty names. The Federal Reserve agreed with this decision. Indeed, the counterparty names were disclosed nearly one year ago.\n\nIV. Disclosure of Information Identifying Specific CDOs in the Portfolio\nFinally, there have been allegations that the New York Fed inappropriately pressured AIG not to disclose certain commercially sensitive information, including CUSIPs and tranches, that would have identified the individual securities in the Maiden Lane III portfolio. To be sure, the New York Fed actively supported the idea of keeping this information confidential, but once again, only to maximize the value of the Maiden Lane III portfolio for the benefit of the taxpayer.\n\nThe portfolio of securities held by Maiden Lane III represents substantial value to the American taxpayer. At the end of the third quarter of 2009, the fair market value of the securities was several billion dollars more than the outstanding balance on the loan. The New York Fed also owns two-thirds of any eventual upside. The New York Fed’s investment staff, with the concurrence of its outside advisors, was (and is) strongly of the view that if information identifying these individual securities in the portfolio and the individual prices paid by Maiden Lane III were to become available to traders in such securities, those traders would be able to use that information to their advantage. This, in turn, would undercut the ability of Maiden Lane III to sell those assets for their highest value, to the detriment of taxpayers. Furthermore, as AIG stated in its application to the SEC for confidential treatment, this data does not provide any additional information that would be material to investors in AIG. After lengthy and detailed dialogue, on May 22, 2009, the SEC concluded that this commercially sensitive information need not be disclosed. To be clear, it is only this sensitive security-by-security information that has received confidential treatment and has not been included in AIG’s 8-K filings.\n\nThe Federal Reserve System shares this committee’s goals of transparency and accountability. That is why the Federal Reserve provides weekly public reports on the aggregate performance of the Maiden Lane III assets—information that is highly relevant to taxpayers’ evaluation of the success of this program, but that does not undercut the ultimate taxpayer recovery that is such an important objective. Also, on a monthly basis, the Federal Reserve publishes a transparency report called “Credit and Liquidity Programs and the Balance Sheet” that provides still more information and analysis regarding Maiden Lane III and the Federal Reserve’s other lending programs. This represents a middle ground where our performance as stewards of taxpayer funds can be analyzed and evaluated, but without potentially compromising the taxpayers’ prospective return on their investment.\n\nThank you again for giving me the opportunity to appear before you today. I look forward to answering your questions.\n\nMaiden Lane Transactions »\nStatement Regarding Public Disclosures of AIG Concerning Maiden Lane III LLC »"

        "content": "In my opinion, this crisis demonstrated that a systemic risk oversight framework is needed to foster financial stability. The financial system is simply too complex for siloed regulators to see the entire field of play, to prevent the movement of financial activity to areas where there are regulatory gaps, and, when there are difficulties, to communicate and coordinate all responses in a timely and effective manner.\n\nEffective systemic oversight requires two elements. First, the financial system needs to be evaluated in its entirety because, as we have seen, developments in one area can often have devastating consequences elsewhere. In particular, three broad areas of the financial system need to be continuously evaluated: large systemically important financial institutions, payments and settlement systems and the capital markets. The linkages between each must be understood and monitored on a real-time basis. Second, effective systemic risk oversight will require a broad range of expertise. This requires the right people, with experience operating in all the important areas of the financial system.\n\nIn this regard, I believe that the Federal Reserve has an essential role to play. The Federal Reserve has experience and expertise in all three areas—it now oversees most of the largest U.S. financial institutions; it operates a major payments system and oversees several others; and it operates in the capital markets every day in managing its own portfolio and as an agent conducting Treasury securities auctions. Also, as the central bank, it backstops the financial system in its lender-of-last-resort role.\n\nCompared with where we were in late 2008 and early 2009, financial markets have stabilized, and the prospect of a collapse of the financial system and a second Great Depression now seems extremely remote. Even with this progress, however, credit remains tight, especially for small businesses and households. Economic growth has resumed, but unemployment has climbed to punishing levels. So while circumstances have improved, they are still very far from where we want them to be. We have no cause for celebration when the challenges facing so many businesses and households remain so daunting.\n\nAggressive and extraordinary official interventions were imperative to bring about this nascent stabilization of our financial markets and economic recovery. The Federal Reserve has been at the center of many of these interventions. For example, its efforts over the past two years to promote market functioning and minimize contagion were critical in preventing the strains in our financial markets from resulting in even more severe damage to the economy. These “lender of last resort” interventions on the part of the Fed, including facilities such as the Term Securities Lending Facility (TSLF) and the Primary Dealer Credit Facility (PDCF), as well as programs such as the foreign exchange reciprocal currency agreements, are examples of the rapid and responsive application of basic central bank tenants to the unique challenges we faced as this crisis evolved. Indeed, in many ways, the crisis has underscored why the Federal Reserve was created almost a century ago: to provide a backstop for a banking system prone to runs and financial panics.\n\nWhere it proved necessary and feasible to do so, the Fed also used its emergency lending authority to forestall the disorderly failure of systemically important institutions. These actions truly were extraordinary—well outside the scope of our normal operations, but our judgment was that not taking those actions would have risked a broader collapse of the financial system and a significantly deeper and more protracted recession. Faced with the choice between these otherwise unpalatable actions and a broader systemic collapse, the Fed, with the full support of the Treasury, invoked its emergency lending authority and prevented the collapse of certain institutions previously considered to have been outside the safety net.\n\nThe fact that the Fed needed to take those actions provides a stark illustration of the significant gaps in our regulatory structure, gaps that must be eliminated. Among those holes was the absence of effective consolidated oversight of certain large and deeply interconnected firms; the collective failure of regulators—including the Federal Reserve—to appreciate the linkages and amplification mechanisms embedded in our financial system; and the absence of a resolution process that would allow even the largest and most complex of financial institutions to fail without imperiling the flow of credit to the economy more broadly. Addressing these shortcomings will require important reforms in our country's regulatory architecture.\n\nWe entered the crisis with an obsolete regulatory system. For one, our regulatory system was not structured for a world in which an increasingly large amount of credit intermediation was occurring in nonbank financial institutions. As a result, little attention was paid to the systemic implications of the actions of a large number of increasingly important financial institutions—including securities firms, insurance conglomerates and monolines. In addition, many large financial organizations were funding themselves through market-based mechanisms such as tri-party repo. This made the system as a whole much more fragile and vulnerable to runs when confidence faltered.\n\nWith the benefit of hindsight, it is clear that the Fed and other regulators, here and abroad, did not sufficiently understand the importance of some of these changes in our financial system. We did not see some of the critical vulnerabilities these changes had created, including the large number of self-amplifying mechanisms that were embedded in the system. Nor were all the ramifications of the growth in the intermediation of credit by the nonbank or “shadow banking” system appreciated and their linkages back to regulated financial institutions understood until after the crisis began.\n\nWith hindsight, the regulatory community undoubtedly should have raised the alarm sooner and done more to address the vulnerabilities facing our banks and our entire financial system. But this was difficult because our country didn’t have truly systemic oversight—oversight that would be better suited to the new world in which markets and nonbank financial institutions had become much more important in how credit was intermediated. Without a truly systemic perspective, it was unlikely that any regulator would have been able to understand how the risks were building up in our contemporary, market-based system. The problem was that both banking and nonbank organizations played an important role in credit intermediation but were subject to differing degrees of regulation and supervision by different regulatory authorities.\n\nAlthough these gaps had existed for years, their consequences were not apparent until the crisis. Difficulties in one part of the system quickly exposed hidden vulnerabilities in other parts of the system, in a way that our patchwork regulatory system had not been designed to detect or readily address. In the same way, the crisis revealed the critical deficiencies in the toolkits available to the regulators to deal with nonbank institutions in duress. Emergency lending by the Fed might be enough to forestall the disorderly failure of a systemically important institution and all the wider damage such a failure might cause, but it was a blunt and messy solution, employed as a stopgap measure because better alternatives were not available. What is needed—what our country still lacks—is a large-firm resolution process that would allow for the orderly failure even of a systemically important institution.\n\nThus, in the fall of 2008, regulators and policymakers found themselves facing the prospect of the total collapse of a complex and interconnected system. It was these circumstances, and the prospect they created for an even deeper and more protracted downturn in real economic activity and employment, that required truly extraordinary actions on the part of the Federal Reserve, as well as the Treasury and many other agencies. This is a situation in which the United States must never again find itself.\n\nFor its part, the Federal Reserve is hard at work on developing and implementing new regulations and policy guidance that take on broad lessons of the recent crisis. We are working with other banking regulators in the United States and overseas to strengthen bank capital standards, both by raising the required level of capital where appropriate and improving the risk capture of our standards. We are issuing new guidelines on compensation practices so that financial sector employees are rewarded for long-term performance and discouraged from excessive risk-taking. And we are working with foreign regulators to develop more robust international standards for bank liquidity. We are working to make the tri-party repo system more robust and reducing settlement risk by facilitating the settlement of over-the-counter derivatives trades on central counterparties (CCPs). But more needs to be done and much of this requires action by Congress.\n\nCongress is now considering several proposals for comprehensive regulatory reform, proposals that merit careful study and debate. Let me offer some general thoughts on the principles that should guide how we approach reform.\n\nFirst, it's important to take a clear-eyed and comprehensive view of the financial system we have today. As I've already suggested, if there is one overriding lesson to be drawn from the events of the past 18 months, it is that the financial system is just that: a system, and a very complex one at that. The operational, liquidity and credit interdependencies that characterize contemporary financial markets and institutions mean that the well-being of any one segment of the system is inextricably linked to the well-being of the system as a whole. Because of this, our approach to reform must be guided by a coherent sense of the system as a whole, not merely by a focus on some of its component parts, as important as they may be.\n\nWe need a new regulatory structure that provides for comprehensive and consistent oversight of all elements of the financial system. This includes effective consolidated oversight of all our largest and interconnected financial institutions and oversight of payment and settlement systems. We must make sure that the people doing the regulation have the power and expertise to ferret out and bring to heel regulatory evasion as it occurs to prevent abuse and excess from building up in the financial system. In the end, the gaps, not the overlaps, have been the main shortcoming of our existing regulatory framework.\n\nA second fundamental point is that regulatory reform has to ensure that the financial system will be robust and resilient even when it comes under stress so that it will not fail in its critical role in supporting economic activity. No economy can prosper without a well-functioning financial system—one that efficiently channels savings to the businesses that can make the most productive use of those savings, and to consumers that need credit to buy a home and support a family. The fact that our financial system isn't functioning well right now is part and parcel of our current economic difficulties. This critical link between the “real” and the “financial” is why we care so much about the systemic risks inherent in banking and finance.\n\nOne critical element of systemic risk is what is known as the “too big to fail” problem. Without sufficiently high capital and liquidity standards, and, as a backstop, a resolution mechanism that is credible, regulators are faced with a Hobson’s Choice when a large, systemically important financial firm encounters difficulties. On the one hand, if authorities step in to respond to prevent failure, contagion and collapse of the broader system, that action rewards the imprudent and can create moral hazard—that is, encouraging others to act irresponsibly or recklessly in the future in the belief that they will also be rescued or “bailed out.” On the other hand, if authorities do nothing and let market discipline run its course, they run the risk that the problem will spread and unleash a chain reaction of collapse, with severe and lasting damage to markets, to households and to businesses.\n\nSo what can we do about the “too big to fail” problem? It is clear that we must develop a truly robust resolution mechanism that allows for the orderly wind-down of a failing institution and that limits the contagion to the broader financial system. This will require not only legislative action domestically but intensive work internationally to address a range of legal issues involved in winding down a major global firm. Second, we need to ensure that the payments and settlement systems are robust and resilient. By strengthening financial market infrastructures, we can reduce the risk that shocks in one part of the system will spread elsewhere. Third, we need to reduce the likelihood that systemically important institutions will come close to failure in the first place. This can be done by mandating more robust capital requirements and greater liquidity buffers, as well as aligning compensation with the risks that are taken by the firm’s employees. In addition, instruments such as contingent capital–debt that would automatically convert to equity in adverse environments–need to be considered. Such instruments would enable equity capital to be replenished automatically during stress environments, dampening shocks rather than exacerbating them.\n\nI would now like to take some time to discuss some of the proposals that Congress is debating regarding regulatory reform. As Congress and the Administration consider what legislative changes are warranted, the Federal Reserve's actions before and during the crisis have been getting close inspection. Given the Federal Reserve's key role in our financial system, and the scale of the damage caused by the financial crisis, this careful scrutiny is necessary, appropriate and welcome.\n\nNot surprisingly, there are legislative proposals that would significantly alter the Federal Reserve's powers and responsibilities, particularly with respect to supervision of bank holding companies. Again, that's entirely within Congress's purview: the Federal Reserve only has the powers and responsibilities that Congress has entrusted to us. But in drawing up new legislation, it's important not to throw the baby out with the bathwater—we should preserve what has worked and fix what hasn’t. A dispassionate analysis of what is needed will almost certainly lead to better decisions and a more effective regulatory framework.\n\nThe legislative proposals concerning the Federal Reserve are not limited to the Federal Reserve’s role in supervision. Consider, for example, one proposal that calls for what it terms \"audits\" of the Federal Reserve by the U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO), an arm of Congress. These wouldn't be audits at all in the commonly understood sense of the term. The Federal Reserve's financial books and transactions are already audited by wide range of professionals internal and external to the institution. Rather, these new audits would involve ex-post review of Federal Reserve monetary policy decisions, a potential first step toward the politicization of a process that Congress has carefully sought to insulate from political pressures.\n\nThe notion that the Federal Reserve's financial dealings are somehow kept hidden from the public is a surprisingly widely held view—and it is simply incorrect. An independent outside audit of the Federal Reserve's books is conducted annually. You can find the results online, including a detailed accounting of the Federal Reserve's income and operating expenses in its annual report. The financial books of the regional Federal Reserve Banks also undergo independent outside audits, also available online. In addition, the GAO is empowered to review almost all Federal Reserve activities other than the conduct of monetary policy, including the Federal Reserve's financial operations, which the GAO has done so frequently. The Federal Reserve's balance sheet is posted online weekly, with considerable detail, in what's called the H.4.1 report. Finally, an additional accounting of the Federal Reserve's emergency lending programs created over the last two years is available online in a monthly report.\n\nBut my objection that GAO oversight would be broadened to include a review of monetary policy decisions is not based just on the fact that the Fed is already subject to considerable oversight. My principal concern is the damage that could potentially result to the Fed’s ability to achieve its mandate of price stability and maximum sustainable employment. The effectiveness of monetary policy depends most of all on the Federal Reserve’s credibility with market participants and investors. In particular, both groups need to know that the Fed will always act to keep inflation in check. That's why Fed Chairman William McChesney Martin famously joked that the Fed would sometimes need \"to take the punchbowl away just as the party gets going.\" As you can well imagine, this may not always enhance our popularity, especially among those who were enjoying the party. But, the fact that markets know that the Federal Reserve will tighten monetary policy when needed helps keep inflation expectations in check. This, in turn, helps keep inflation low since inflation expectations affect actual inflation. The consequence is credibility with respect to the conduct of monetary policy. This gives the Fed more latitude not to tighten when inflation rises for transient reasons—say, due to a short-lived spike in oil prices—and more scope to ease credit to support the economy during economic downturns.\n\nRecognizing these benefits, Congress wisely acted many years ago to exempt monetary policy decisions from the GAO's wide powers to review Federal Reserve activities. Congress' decision to bolster the Fed's monetary policy independence has been followed by similar actions around the world—substantial independence for the central bank in the conduct of monetary policy is now widely regarded as international best practice. Policy independence does not absolve the Federal Reserve from accountability for its monetary policy decisions and the need to clearly explain why they were taken. But it avoids the politicization of monetary policy decision-making. And this is good because politicized central banks generally do not have enviable records with regard to inflation, economic growth or currency stability. Risk premia on financial assets are typically much higher in countries with politicized central banks.\n\nOf course, a reversal of Congress's earlier decision would not amount to legislative control over monetary policy decisions. That's not the issue. The issue is that a reversal of Congress’ earlier decision could create the appearance that the legislature seeks to influence monetary policy decisions by establishing a mechanism to publicly second guess those decisions. Such a move would blur what has been a careful separation of monetary policy from politics. Market confidence here and abroad in the Federal Reserve would be undermined. Asset prices could quickly build in an added risk premium, which might lead to tighter credit conditions. These unintended consequences would undermine the legislation’s intent.\n\nI’m also concerned about those proposals under consideration that would move the regulatory and supervisory functions now held by the Federal Reserve to other agencies, new or existing. At present, the Federal Reserve is the consolidated supervisor for bank holding companies, a group that has expanded recently as investment banks and other companies formerly outside the Federal Reserve's purview have been brought under Federal Reserve oversight. In my view, further disaggregation or fragmentation of regulatory oversight responsibility is not the appropriate response to our increasingly interconnected, interdependent financial system. Funneling information streams into diverse institutional silos leads to communication breakdowns and too often to failure to \"connect the dots.\"\n\nIn addition, there are clear synergies between the supervisory process and the Federal Reserve's monetary policy and financial stability missions. The information we collect as part of the supervisory process gives us a front-line, real-time view of the state of the financial industry and broader economy. Monetary policy is more informed as a result. Only with this knowledge can a central bank understand how the monetary policy impulse will be propagated through the financial system and affect the real economy.\n\nSimilarly, involvement in the supervisory process gives us critical information in fulfilling our lender-of-last-resort responsibilities. Information sharing with other agencies is simply not as good as the intimate knowledge and understanding of markets and institutions that is gathered from first-hand supervision. Indeed, many institutions at the center of the crisis and arguably the most troubled—Bear Stearns, Lehman Brothers, Merrill Lynch, AIG and the GSEs—were not supervised by the Federal Reserve. Consequently, when those institutions came under stress, the Federal Reserve had poorer quality and far less timely information about the condition of these institutions than would have been the case if we had had the benefit of direct supervisory oversight.\n\nIn fact, some of the hardest choices the Federal Reserve had to make during the most chaotic weeks of the crisis concerned systemically important firms we did not regulate. It is not surprising that, in the wake of the crisis, some countries that had separated bank supervision from the central bank monetary policy role are now reconsidering that division of labor. That is mainly because coordination problems created difficulties in responding quickly and effectively in the crisis. Separation made it more difficult to communicate in a timely way and to understand the broader implications of what was transpiring. It is critical that we not introduce new inefficiencies and impediments. No matter what steps are taken to improve our regulatory system and strengthen market discipline, history tells us that there will inevitably be circumstances in which an informed and effective lender of last resort will play a critical role in preventing shocks and strains in financial markets and institutions from generating a broader collapse of the financial system.\n\nOf course, there are legitimate questions as to how broad the Federal Reserve's regulatory and supervisory responsibilities should be. That question is up to Congress, and should be decided on the merits. What is fundamentally at issue here is not “turf,” but rather how we as a nation can best ensure that we never again re-live the events of the past few years—that the legitimate public interests associated with a safe, efficient and impartial banking and financial system are well served.\n\nIn the end, it is critical that financial reform be decided on the basis of the merits. If objective and careful policymaking prevails, we will all be the better off for it. In contrast, if we fail in this endeavor, that would truly be tragic. We must act informed by the important lessons that we have learned from this crisis.\n\nThank you for your kind attention."
