        "content": "Thank you, Laura, and hello to those of you attending in-person and virtually. It is a pleasure to be speaking at the Global Banking Summit.\n\nThe New York Fed is responsible for supervising a wide range of financial institutions, from some of the nation's largest banks, to the U.S. operations of foreign banking organizations, to regional and community banks. We also have oversight responsibilities for financial market utilities and significant service providers. I'm looking forward to sharing some perspectives from this unique vantage point.\n\nI'll begin my remarks today with an overview of the current state of the U.S. banking system. Then, I will highlight a few risks in the present environment. I want to note that my remarks today are my own and do not necessarily reflect the views of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York or the Federal Reserve System.\n\nCurrent State of the Banking System\n\nThe U.S. banking system entered the year in sound condition, but market conditions are changing and, as Vice Chair for Supervision Michael Barr recently said, we must ensure we are keeping pace as supervisors. 1 Let me discuss in more detail.\n\nThe vast majority of banks remain above regulatory capital minimums. 2 For large banks, we conduct annual tests to assess their capital positions under a stressed economic scenario. The Fed's most recent stress test showed that large banks would maintain capital above minimum requirements in a simulated severe downturn. 3\n\nBanks' liquidity profiles also remain ample. 4 As described in the Fed's semiannual Supervision and Regulation Report, large banks maintain sufficient liquidity to meet modeled stressed outflows. 5\n\nFinancial performance has also been stable. Banks continue to provide their core financial services of lending, deposit taking, payments, and market intermediation. Year to date, total loans have grown at an annualized rate of over 10%, with robust growth across household and corporate borrowers. 6 Return on equity remains in line with historical levels. 7\n\nWhile the current picture is one of resilience, we remain attuned to risks faced by banks. I'll highlight three risks we are focused on from a supervisory perspective.\n\nAn Unfamiliar Economic Environment\n\nThe first risk relates to the unfamiliar, uncertain, and fast-changing economic environment. Interest rates are one example. Higher interest rates have benefited net interest margins, but they have also led to significant unrealized losses in banks' securities portfolios. For the broader banking system, declines in the value of securities have led to reductions in liquidity. Interest rate risk remains a watchpoint.\n\nHigher interest rates could also challenge some borrowers' ability to service or repay debt, particularly for borrowers with interest payments tied to floating rates. For example, commercial real estate loans are often linked to floating rates, and the outlook for commercial properties is also affected by the shift to remote work. 8 This sector is particularly relevant to the New York Fed—one of the largest commercial real estate markets in the world is in our district. 9\n\nImproving our Understanding of Climate-Related Financial Risks\n\nThe second risk I'll highlight relates to climate change, which poses financial risks to individual banks and the financial system. Here, the Federal Reserve Board is leading workstreams that will enhance supervisors' and banks' ability to understand and manage these risks. Early next year, the Board will conduct a pilot study with six of the largest U.S. banks to analyze the impact of different climate scenarios. 10 Four of those banks are headquartered in New York.\n\nThis exercise will provide supervisors and banks with insight into how climate-related financial risks may manifest. It will also help with the management of those potential risks.\n\nThe pilot exercise is distinct from the annual stress tests the Federal Reserve conducts. It will not result in supervisory or capital implications—rather, it will be a way for both banks and supervisors to learn.\n\nBanks' Engagement in Crypto-Asset Activities\n\nThe third and final risk I'll highlight is related to banks' engagement with crypto-assets and crypto-asset-related businesses. Financial innovation presents opportunities, but it can also present risks—to banks, customers, and the financial system. The growing size of the crypto-asset industry, the volatility of underlying crypto-assets, and the recent failures of crypto-asset-related businesses make clear the need to evaluate banks' engagement in this space.\n\nAt present, U.S. banks' direct involvement in crypto activity is small and largely in the planning stages. Banks' provision of traditional financial services to crypto-asset-related businesses also remains limited. However, the risks associated with future activity can be hard to quantify.\n\nIn August, the Federal Reserve outlined key steps that banks should take before engaging in crypto-asset-related activities. These include notifying the Federal Reserve before engaging in crypto-asset-related activities and having effective controls and systems in place to manage associated risks. 11 Key risk management considerations will vary with the type of activity. For example, if a bank accepts crypto-related deposits, it must consider the funding implications in the event those deposits were to exit the bank quickly.\n\nImportance of Strong Risk Management Practices\n\nThrough our supervision work at the New York Fed, we will continue to monitor, examine, and evaluate these and other risks to promote the safety and soundness of the banking system. While the banking system is currently resilient, it is essential that banks have strong risk management practices to identify challenges and maintain resiliency in this evolving environment.\n\nThank you, and I look forward to our discussion."

        "url": "https://www.newyorkfed.org/newsevents/speeches/2022/wil221128",
        "content": "Introduction\n\nIt's an honor to serve as chair of the Economic Club of New York. I am proud of the Club's continuing role as a preeminent forum for both in-person and virtual discussions of the most urgent issues facing this city and the world today.\n\nEarlier this month, we celebrated the Club's 115th anniversary at an in-person gathering. Today is a good day to host a virtual event. That way, you can enjoy your Thanksgiving leftovers at home while I speak.\n\nIn my remarks, I'll address the No. 1 economic concern across the globe: inflation. Inflation is far too high, and persistently high inflation undermines the ability of our economy to perform at its full potential. The Federal Reserve is mandated by Congress to achieve price stability and maximum employment, and the two sides of this dual mandate are closely related. Price stability is essential to achieving maximum employment over the long term.\n\nThe problem of inflation is clear, but how it evolved and what it portends is more complex. One way I've been thinking about it is through an analogy that I've been calling \"the inflation onion.\"1 While onions may not have been the focus of your Thanksgiving table, they can be found in many dishes. So, I'll give them the spotlight for the next few minutes and explain the layered features of inflation, why high inflation emerged last year, and how it is evolving. I'll also share why I am confident that the Federal Reserve's actions will restore price stability.\n\nBefore we get into that, I will give the standard Fed disclaimer that the views I express today are mine alone, and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) or others in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nInflation's Impact\n\nI'll start by highlighting the immense impact that rising inflation has on families and businesses. The FOMC has set a 2 percent longer-run goal for inflation, as measured by the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index. This level of inflation is deemed most consistent with the Fed's price stability and maximum employment mandates.2\n\nFor the three decades preceding the pandemic, the inflation rate averaged almost exactly 2 percent. But that changed dramatically last spring, when inflation suddenly soared to 40-year highs. It's been elevated for the past several months and currently stands at over 6 percent.\n\nA trip to the supermarket or gas pump will tell you the rest of the story. But the pain is not felt equally. The data show that those who can least afford the rise in costs for food, housing, and transportation suffer the most.3 The priority for monetary policy is clear. The Federal Reserve is strongly committed to bringing inflation back down to its 2 percent longer-run goal.\n\nAn Allium Analogy\n\nThere are many sources of high inflation, and they are not unique to the United States. In fact, nearly all economies across the globe are experiencing unusually high rates of inflation. To better understand the root of high inflation and what it means for the future, I will start to peel the \"inflation onion\" that I mentioned earlier.\n\nIn this allium analogy, there are three distinct layers. The outermost layer consists of prices of globally traded commodities—such as lumber, steel, grains, and oil. When the global economy rebounded from the pandemic recession, there was a surge in demand for these critical goods, leading to sizable imbalances between supply and demand and large price increases. Then, energy and many commodity prices soared again as a result of Russia's war on Ukraine and consequent actions. Skyrocketing commodity prices led to higher costs for producers, which in turn got passed on as higher prices for consumers.\n\nThe middle layer of the inflation onion is made up of products—especially durable goods like appliances, furniture, and cars—that have experienced both strong demand and severe supply-chain disruptions. There were not enough inputs to manufacture products, which meant not enough products to sell—all at a time when demand has been sky-high. This imbalance contributed to outsize price increases.\n\nIf we continue paring the onion, we'll reach the innermost layer: underlying inflation. This layer is the most challenging of the three, reflecting the overall balance between supply and demand in the economy and the labor market. Prices for services have been rising at a fast clip. Measures of the cost of shelter, in particular, have increased briskly, as an earlier surge of rents for new leases filtered through the market. And widespread labor shortages have led to higher labor costs. And this is not limited to a few sectors—inflation pressures have become broad-based.\n\nA Multilayered Reality\n\nWhen examining where all these inflationary layers stand today, we are seeing a multilayered reality. So, what can we expect to see in the future?\n\nI'll start with the outer layer, where there have been positive developments that point to some relief on this front. The prices of commodities have come way down from peaks reached earlier this year. Absent further disruptions to supply, I expect that slowing global growth, in part reflecting tighter monetary policy here and abroad, will continue to reduce demand for these products, putting downward pressure on their prices.\n\nCore goods prices that make up the middle layer have yet to come down from elevated levels, as demand continues to outstrip supply. But there are signs that this is changing.\n\nFor one, we've seen significant improvement in global supply chains. Unlike last year, there are no longer ships stalled at ports in California. The Global Supply Chain Pressure Index, developed by economists at the New York Fed, shows that global supply chain disruptions soared to unprecedented levels late last year. Since then, this index has retraced about three quarters of that rise, and I expect improvements in global supply chains to continue.4\n\nWe have also seen wholesale used auto prices decline by more than 15 percent since the start of the year, and these decreases are starting to pass through to consumer prices. New auto inventories are slowly edging back up, which should in turn bring relief to new car prices. Overall, the combination of waning global demand, improving supply, and falling import prices from the strong dollar points to slowing core goods inflation going forward.\n\nHowever, lower commodity prices and receding supply-chain issues will not be enough to get inflation back to our 2 percent inflation goal—it's the innermost layer where the hard work lies. Overall demand for labor and services still far exceeds available supply, resulting in broad-based inflation, which will take longer to bring back down.\n\nThat said, a few forward-looking indicators paint a more encouraging picture. Growth in rents for new leases has slowed sharply recently, implying that average rent growth and housing shelter price inflation should turn back down. We're also seeing some signs that the heat of the labor market is starting to cool, with quits and job openings declining from the high levels of the spring, along with indicators of slowing wage growth.\n\nThe FOMC's Policy Actions\n\nBut there is still more work to do. This brings me to the FOMC's strong, decisive policy actions in support of our steadfast commitment to price stability.\n\nTo help bring demand back to levels consistent with supply, and thereby bring inflation back down to our 2 percent goal, the FOMC raised the target range for the federal funds rate to 3-3/4 to 4 percent at our meeting earlier this month, the sixth consecutive increase.5 The FOMC statement indicated that \"the Committee anticipates that ongoing increases in the target range will be appropriate in order to attain a stance of monetary policy that is sufficiently restrictive to return inflation to 2 percent over time. In determining the pace of future increases in the target range, the Committee will take into account the cumulative tightening of monetary policy, the lags with which monetary policy affects economic activity and inflation, and economic and financial developments. In addition, the FOMC continues reducing its holdings of Treasury securities and agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities.\"6\n\nMany other central banks are focused on taking strong steps to reduce inflation in their economies as well. One concern that has arisen is that large and rapid shifts in monetary policy across the globe could contribute to stresses and expose vulnerabilities in global financial markets. And heightened uncertainty can add to market volatility, resulting in diminished market liquidity. For example, measures of liquidity in the U.S. Treasury market have declined this year, but this is largely in line with the historical relationship between volatility and liquidity. Importantly, Treasury and funding markets continue to function well, effectively transmitting monetary policy to broader financial conditions.\n\nBecause many of the sources of inflation are global, these policy actions from around the world should alleviate supply-chain issues, speed the process of restoring balance to global supply and demand, and reduce global inflationary pressures.\n\nThere are other factors that work in our favor too. The Fed's commitment to achieving and sustaining 2 percent inflation as a bedrock principle has no doubt had a positive effect on the public's inflation expectations.7 The transparency about our objectives provides a \"North Star\" for policy decisions and improves the public's understanding about our goals and actions.\n\nThe benefits are evident in the stability of longer-run inflation expectations. Even during the current period of high and volatile inflation, longer-run inflation expectations in the United States are very well anchored in the past year and a half. They are at levels broadly consistent with the FOMC's longer-run goal. Although inflation uncertainty has increased, it does not appear to be due to unmoored longer-run expectations.8\n\nEconomic Outlook\n\nWe are already seeing some of the effects of tighter monetary policy. Broad measures of financial conditions, including borrowing and mortgage rates and equity prices, have become significantly less supportive of spending. This has led to a decline in activity in the housing market and signs of general slowing in consumer expenditures and business investment spending. As this continues, I expect real GDP to increase only modestly this year and in 2023.\n\nThe labor market remains remarkably tight: Hiring is robust, and we still are seeing rapid wage gains. But with growth slowing, I anticipate that the unemployment rate will climb from its current level of 3.7 percent to between 4-1/2 and 5 percent by the end of next year.\n\nTurning to inflation, I expect cooling global demand and steady supply improvements to result in declining inflation for goods that rely heavily on commodities, as well as for those that have been heavily affected by supply chain bottlenecks. These factors should contribute importantly to inflation slowing from its current rate to between 5 and 5-1/2 percent at the end of this year, and to slow further to between 3 and 3-1/2 percent for next year.\n\nBringing down underlying inflation—the inner layer of the inflation onion—will take longer. But further tightening of monetary policy should help restore balance between demand and supply and bring inflation back to 2 percent over the next few years.\n\nConclusion\n\nWhen it comes to the complicated nature of inflation and assessing the economic outlook, it's important to know your onions. Tighter monetary policy has begun to cool demand and reduce inflationary pressures. It will take some time, but I am fully confident we will return to a sustained period of price stability."

        "date": "Nov 17, 2022",
        "speaker": "Beverly Hirtle",
        "url": "https://www.newyorkfed.org/newsevents/speeches/2022/hir221117",
        "content": "Good morning. It is my pleasure to welcome you to the 2022 Global Research Forum on International Macroeconomics and Finance, jointly sponsored by the European Central Bank, the Federal Reserve Board, and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. The papers and discussions today will highlight a number of important issues related to the global economy and financial markets, as well as the policies that central banks and other official sector bodies can take to address existing developments and emerging risks affecting growth, inflation and financial stability. As always, I need to caveat my remarks today by saying that they reflect my personal views and not necessarily the views of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York or the Federal Reserve System.\n\nThis biennial conference is an important opportunity for our organizations to collaborate on bringing frontier research to our audiences. Past conferences have highlighted cutting-edge research by leading experts on global financial markets, the effect of macroprudential regulation in the open economy, international monetary policy coordination, and many other topics that are very relevant in today\"s world. The fourth and most recent in-person edition of the conference was held before the pandemic, in 2018, and hosted by the ECB. At that time, the focus of the conference, as well as academic research and policymakers, was on the progress made in achieving and maintaining global financial stability in the decade after the eruption of the global financial crisis.\n\nThe pandemic and more recently geopolitical tensions have brought unique challenges to all economies around the world. In this respect, this year\"s forum will focus on these challenges facing central banks, including paths of recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic, the effects of sanctions and elevated inflation. The world economy is experiencing a period of heightened volatility and uncertainty. Inflation is very high in the U.S. and abroad. In response, central banks around the world are tightening monetary policy rapidly to contain demand in their own jurisdictions.\n\nAs it will be discussed in this conference in the next two days, there are non-negligible cross-border effects of domestic monetary policy tightening in each country.  The timing and degree of tightening by each country spill over through demand for real goods and services, through financial conditions, and through international capital flows. For example, monetary policy tightening reduces domestic demand for foreign goods, dampening trade flows both at the level of intermediate goods and final goods. At the same time, tightening domestic financial conditions can spill over to foreign financial conditions, amplifying the effects monetary tightening by foreign central banks.   \n\nTherefore, in this global environment, it is very important to remember that global capital flows and trade linkages transmit and may amplify the impact of domestic shocks and policy actions across borders. Understanding these spillovers and spillbacks is a critical element of determining appropriate policy to meet domestic mandates for growth, employment, and price stability.\n\nThe other side of imbalances we have been facing since the pandemic is related to the supply side of the global economy. Supply chain disruptions have become a major challenge for the global economy since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. For example, changes in the Global Supply Chain Pressure Index (GSCPI) developed by the New York Fed staff are shown to be associated with goods and producer price inflation in the United States and the Euro area. Recent news on the supply side is encouraging for inflation developments: the GSCPI has been declining since April. The ongoing easing of global imbalances, through both improvements in supply disruption and reduction in demand at the global level, should help bringing inflation back to central banks\" targets.\n\nToday\"s conference will cover these issues in depth. More specifically, the sessions cover themes related to exchange rates, monetary policy in the international context, trade and banking, global liquidity flows, investor portfolio reallocations around climate shocks, and key drivers and prospects of inflation in the global context. Let me provide a brief walk through of the conference agenda, to whet your appetite for what\"s to come over the next two days.\n\nThe conference\"s first session – up next after my remarks – focuses on exchange rates. It features papers that seek to better understand the behavior of exchange rate movements in reaction to changes in economic fundamentals or policy shocks, such as sanctions, as well as the impact of relative price changes on the spillover of monetary policy across economies.\n\nThe second session examines trade and the international banking system. The research presented in this session studies how the \"real\" and \"financial\" side of the international economy are intertwined. Papers in this session explore how cross-border trade integration impacts countries\" decisions on opening the economy to international capital markets, as well as exploring how the \"trade-finance\" interaction affects banks\" lending decisions, firms\" financial risk, and the ability for firms to react to external shocks.\n\nTomorrow, the first session turns to the ever-pertinent topic of capital flows and the international role of the U.S. dollar. Papers in this session provide an in-depth analysis of how capital flows react to changes in the global landscape. The first paper asks how climate change impacts the global portfolio reallocation of capital, while the remaining sessions analyze the unique role of U.S. monetary policy and the U.S. dollar in explaining international financial flows.\n\nThe conference will conclude with a Policy Panel of esteemed colleagues from academia, policy institutions and the private sector who will discuss the key drivers and prospects for inflation in the current global environment. Our panelists bring a diverse range of perspectives, which is critical for garnering rich insights.  They are Elaine Buckberg, of General Motors; Matteo Ciccarelli, from the European Central Bank; Mark Gertler, from New York University; Steve Kamin, from the American Enterprise Institute; and Ṣebnem Kalemli-Özcan of the University of Maryland. The panel will be moderated by Linda Goldberg, my colleague here at the New York Fed. The discussion promises to be lively and engaging. The expertise our distinguished panelists bring should deepen our understanding of the key drivers and prospects of inflation at the global level arising both from supply and demand side factors, as I alluded to at the beginning of my remarks.\n\nLet me conclude by thanking the Organizing Committee of this conference.  This team includes Ozge Akinci, Julian di Giovanni, and Linda Goldberg from the NY Fed; Juan Londono and Friederike Niepmann from the Federal Reserve Board, and Arnaud Mehl, Georg Strasser, and Isabel Vansteenkiste, European Central Bank.\n\nSo once again, let me welcome you to the New York Fed and to the Global Research Forum. With that, I will turn it over to Ozge, who is chairing the first session."

        "content": "Good morning, everyone. We are excited to have you back in person at the New York Fed for the annual U.S. Treasury Market Conference. You may have noticed that our auditorium has gotten a new look since you were last here. I hope you'll find it a comfortable space since we have a very busy day ahead.\n\nThe Last Time (LIBOR's Version)\n\nThe topic of today's conference is resiliency in the U.S. Treasury market. Before I speak about that, I'd be remiss if I did not take this opportunity—hopefully for the last time—to remind everyone that we are entering the final stretch of the transition away from the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR). I'm pleased to report that the transition has been extremely successful so far, thanks to the significant and coordinated efforts from stakeholders across the globe.\n\nA special shout-out to the Alternative Reference Rates Committee (ARRC) for its outstanding work and dedication in guiding the move off of U.S. dollar LIBOR and promoting the adoption of more robust rates like the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR). They proved that LIBOR was far from irreplaceable.\n\nBut there's still more work to do. Over the next several months, the industry's focus needs to be on the remediation of legacy contracts well before the cessation of LIBOR, so we don't have a last-minute rush. Once we complete this final stretch of the transition, we can say good riddance to LIBOR.\n\nEven when the transition from LIBOR is complete, the ARRC's work will continue to shape the future. The ARRC has laid out best practices for the use of reference rates grounded in overnight SOFR.1 Importantly, this envisages only limited use of term SOFR, which doesn't share overnight SOFR's foundation in the deep and robust Treasury financing markets. It's incredibly important that financial institutions consistently act in ways that are aligned with these best practices so that we don't have to come back and clean up another mess. Unlike with Star Trek, the last thing anyone wants to watch is the sequel, \"LIBOR: The Next Generation.\"\n\nThe LIBOR transition is tangible proof of what can be accomplished when all stakeholders—public and private—work together and persevere, against all odds. That sense of purpose, collaboration, and accomplishment gives me hope for the main topic of the conference today: Treasury market resilience. And yes, there is much work to be done.\n\nBefore I go on, here's a reminder that you know all too well I cannot leave behind—and that's the usual disclaimer that the views I express are mine alone and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) or anyone else in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nWell-Functioning Markets and Monetary Policy\n\nI've long made the case that a well-functioning U.S. Treasury market is critical to our economy, and, in fact, the entire world.2, 3 But now, I'd like to take it a step further to explain how critically important a resilient financial system—and especially a resilient U.S. Treasury market—is for monetary policy.\n\nIn the current environment of high global inflation, central banks around the world have been taking strong, decisive actions to restore price stability. Restoring price stability is of paramount importance because it is the foundation of sustained economic and financial stability. Price stability is not an either/or, it's a must have.\n\nFor monetary policy to be most effective, financial markets must function properly. Monetary policy influences the economy by affecting financial conditions, with the Treasury market at the center of it all. If the Treasury market isn't functioning well, it can impede the transmission of monetary policy to the economy.\n\nThe Great Debate\n\nThese issues recall a longstanding debate over what should be done when there is a trade-off between monetary policy and financial stability goals. In the decade before the pandemic, this debate occurred in the context of inflation running persistently below the FOMC's long-run 2 percent target.4\n\nOn one side, there were those who argued that an extended period of accommodative policy aimed at boosting inflation would contribute to a buildup of asset prices, leverage, and risk-taking that would ultimately undermine financial stability. They concluded that policy should lean against the wind of financial stability risks, even at some cost to achieving the price stability goal.\n\nOn the other side, I and others have argued that using monetary policy to address longer-term financial stability considerations could come at a high cost in terms of current economic activity and could also undermine credibility in the central bank's long-run inflation goal. For example, based on the estimated effects of monetary policy on GDP and house prices, using monetary policy alone to fully deflate the housing bubble that preceded the global financial crisis would have caused a decline in output much larger than the one that occurred during the recession of 2007-09.5\n\nToday we are seeing this debate resurface, but in a very different economic reality. Some now argue that there is again a trade-off between price stability and financial stability goals, but this time it is because large and rapid shifts in monetary policy may contribute to stresses and expose vulnerabilities in global financial markets. Investors and financial institutions need to adjust to a rapidly changing and highly uncertain environment. And heightened uncertainty can add to market volatility, resulting in diminished market liquidity.\n\nBut these debates about trade-offs expose a basic problem.\n\nEveryone is familiar with the idea of a \"jack of all trades.\" Using monetary policy to mitigate financial stability vulnerabilities can lead to unfavorable outcomes for the economy. Monetary policy should not try to be a jack of all trades and a master of none. There must be a better way.\n\nFortunately, there is. Instead of looking at this as a problem of choosing the point on an unfavorable trade-off curve, we must look for ways to shift the curve by enhancing the resilience of the financial system. The value of this approach to building resilience was demonstrated by the global efforts to strengthen the banking system following the global financial crisis. Despite the economic disruptions caused by COVID-19 and Russia's war on Ukraine, the banking system has functioned well, serving as a source of strength for the economy, not a weak link.\n\nAlternative Solutions, Prudent Results\n\nAs monetary policymakers, we need to count on well-functioning markets that promote financial stability as we pursue our price stability and maximum employment goals. So, what can be done to enhance financial stability?\n\nAt the Federal Reserve, we have instituted changes over the past few years that support market functioning in times of stress. In 2021, the FOMC introduced the Standing Repo Facility and the FIMA Repo Facility.6 These standing facilities are priced such that they are not used often in normal times but remain ready to provide liquidity as needed should funding pressures arise.\n\nWe also must continue to prioritize having a robust financial system, and that starts with the most core market of all: the U.S. Treasury market. The Inter-Agency Working Group for Treasury Market Surveillance is doing just that. Ahead of today's conference, the group published a progress report around its work to enhance the resilience of the U.S. Treasury market, which I strongly encourage everyone to read.7 The report emphasizes progress made on the proposed expansion of central clearing, enhancements to data collection and transparency, and the potential for evolution in market structure.\n\nIt's also important to recognize that the world is not static. The Treasury market has increased enormously over the past quarter century, and the key players have changed significantly. And the rest of the financial system continues to evolve, with nonbank financial institutions (NBFIs) playing an increasingly important role. The Financial Stability Board has been actively engaged in this space, assessing global trends and risks through a monitoring exercise and developing policy recommendations to strengthen oversight and regulation.8 Here at the New York Fed, we too are deepening our expertise and monitoring of NBFIs.\n\nBut this is not just a job for the official sector. Just like the successful public-private collaboration that is moving the world off of LIBOR, the private sector must do its part to enhance resilience as well. It means constructively and actively engaging in improving the resilience of the Treasury market and related markets. It also means planning to build resiliency for episodes of volatility that can impair market liquidity, and preparing for periods that have less certain funding, such as at year-end. And it means being a source of strength to the financial system and the economy, not a weak link.\n\nConclusion\n\nDebates around financial stability and monetary policy have been longstanding and have tended to focus on unfavorable trade-offs. Central banks must avoid being a jack of all trades and master of none. The time is now to find solutions that strengthen our financial system without compromising our monetary policy goals. These issues are complex, but the need for meaningful progress on strengthening the resilience of core financial markets is clear."

        "content": "Under any circumstances it is an honor to present the Mundell-Fleming Lecture of the IMF Annual Research Conference. Thank you Kristalina Georgieva (Managing Director, IMF) and Gita Gopinath (First Deputy Managing Director, IMF) for this honor. Thank you Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas (Economic Counsellor and Director, Research Department, IMF) for your generous words of introduction. You are united in your commitment to a well-functioning international monetary system, to strong economies around the world, and to addressing those vulnerabilities that limit the ability of countries to obtain their best outcomes.\n\nI speak today on my own behalf, and the views expressed do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York or the Federal Reserve System.\n\nIt is a special privilege to be at this 23rd Jacques Polak Conference, as during these two days we honor Maurice Obstfeld, an economist for whom we all have tremendous respect. Maury has made so many deeply insightful contributions to our understanding of international monetary history and international finance.\n\nSome foundational contributions are in modelling inter-temporal considerations — for example with his work with Ken Rogoff on New Open Economy Models, which served as the starting point for Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas's Mundell-Fleming Lecture last year (Gourinchas 2021). Pierre-Olivier showed how theory is increasingly able to incorporate economic and financial granularity: networks, frictions, heterogeneity. I will discuss this granularity, but from an empirical perspective.\n\nI am personally inspired by Maury's scholarship and intellectual integrity, and his deep thinking about big picture questions of the entire international monetary system. Likewise, by Maury's capacity to position his observations into the broader contributions of diverse thought-leaders, taking sweeping views of the history of thought on these topics. In developing my own comments for this lecture today, I follow Maury's lead a bit. I will tie some of my key points to some history of thought showcased here at the IMF in past Mundell-Fleming Lectures.\n\nThe stamps of such rich perspectives are reflected in the broader work of the IMF Research Department, and of the Monetary and Capital Markets Department. Importantly, as a community we think about the design, scope, and efficacy of policy toolkits available to countries, and frameworks for when and how different tools are utilized.\n\nThe extensive work of the IMF on the Integrated Policy Framework (IMF 2020) is an important step forward. Countries face difficult tradeoffs in policy. Research and analytics inform the prospects and challenges around specific domestic tools—including macroprudential measures (MPMs), foreign exchange intervention (FXI), and capital flow management measures (CFMs).  My remarks today also will discuss these tradeoffs and toolkits, working through insights around global liquidity.\n\nToday, my remarks focus on the topic of global liquidity.  In 2011, the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) defined two types of global liquidity (CGFS 2011):\n\nOfficial liquidity is that component created by central banks.\n\nPrivate liquidity refers to the funding conditions for the broader international economy. It reflects the behavior of the financial sector in providing cross-border and/or foreign currency financing .\n\nThis private liquidity is my focus.  It is proxied by the volumes of financial flows, largely intermediated through global banks and nonbank financial institutions, that can be reallocated at relatively high frequencies (can be intra-day or even intra-month).\n\nGlobal liquidity is central to international macroeconomics, especially around international spillovers, monetary policy, capital flows, and credit provision. Within this space, my perspective is one shared by many previous Mundell Fleming Lecture presenters — with exchange rates determined in response to international capital flow pressures, and with financial factors the dominant driver. I take the position that global liquidity is central to the financial stability considerations.\n\nTwo drivers of this private global liquidity are monetary policy changes, including those from the US, and risk conditions.  In recent years, both have received attention in previous Mundell Fleming Lectures.\n\nHelene Rey's influential works including at the 2013 Jackson Hole meeting (Rey 2015) and the 2014 Mundell Fleming Lecture (Rey 2016) raised important challenges about country toolkits. That US monetary policy receives attention in discussions of international spillovers and the global financial cycle is not surprising, given the centrality of the US dollar in the international financial system.  Indeed, there are channels through which the monetary policy and risk drivers overlap, including through the risk-taking channel of monetary policy.\n\nBen Bernanke in his 2015 lecture called for more work on understanding cross-border financial linkages that reflect destabilizing spillovers, as opposed to more benign factors (Bernanke 2017). Later the whole of the 2017 Annual Research Conference highlighted different aspects of such spillovers.\n\nRagu Rajan, in his 2018 lecture discussed consequences of such spillovers for foreign countries based on his work with Douglas Diamond and Yunzhi Hu (Diamond, Hu, and Rajan 2020). \n\nMy lecture has a particular emphasis on risk conditions as a driver of global liquidity.  A key theme of my lecture is that volatility of global liquidity is associated with the vulnerabilities of and constraints on institutions participating in international financial markets. I will make a few key points from the vantage points of data at different levels of disaggregation by country, by types of flows, and across individual banks.  I will conclude by talking about toolkits, building on the dedicated focus of the last decade.\n\nBefore I spell out my main points, some concept definitions are in order.\n\nPrudential policies include so-called micro-prudential work done within countries to make individual financial institutions, more robust. We generally discuss prudential policies with respect to banking organizations, but this limitation is not required.  The supervision and regulation of banking organizations includes a focus on how risk is managed, on the buffers that institutions have against types of risk, and on the approaches for recovery and resolution if the banking organizations get into trouble. \n\nMacro-prudential work is about managing the cycle through tools that can target specific sectors or financial activities. The so-called macro-prudential focus certainly appeared on some radars early in the 2000s. Here at the IMF, in 2001 the conversation in front of the Executive Board was around furthering the compilation, use, and analysis of macroprudential indicators (MPIs) of the health and stability of financial systems in the light of experience gained to date (IMF, 2001}. The early focus on macroprudential indicators, however, was more closely aligned with early warning indicators than with a toolkit to directly influence the structure of financial activity. \n\nIn the aftermath of the global financial crisis, efforts shifted toward developing toolkits to manage financial conditions associated with excessive booms and avoid damaging busts in credit availability. Macro-prudential policies, as well as capital flow management tools, have received considerable attention.\n\nMy lecture today emphasizes a few main points that are relevant for both research and policy:\n\n Here my key message has a focus on the home country of the financial institutions.  The global regulatory community focused on large and internationally active banks after the global financial crisis. Strong micro-prudential policies and supervision have enhanced risk absorption and improved risk management. I will argue that banks with higher capitalization and better liquidity are associated with a lower amplitude response of cross border lending to deteriorating risk conditions.  If large banks fail, improved recovery and resolution frameworks should shorten periods of disruption and unintended consequences.  Overall, I will argue that more robust institutions in international financial flows relax some of the tight tradeoffs articulated in international monetary and financial stability trilemmas.\n\nAnalytics using granular data on financial flows inform the constraints, the institutional features, and the amplification channels that are relevant for designing effective policy.  In the case of global liquidity, granularity also means considering the players -- those agents that are in need of financing, and the composition of creditors and investors.   \n\nThis type of granular perspective has motivated some of the important work presented by Hyun Song Shin, as discussed in his 2011 Mundell-Fleming Lecture (Shin 2012). Hyun's contributions with Tobias Adrian take aim at understanding frictions and value at risk constraints in global banks (Adrian and Shin 2008), (Adrian and Shin 2010). Hyun's work with Valentina Bruno (Bruno and Shin 2015) highlights the financial channel of exchange rates working through banks. Both of these approaches are embedded in active agendas of researchers around introducing financial frictions into models.\n\nThe Bank for International Settlements and other institutions are active in collecting some of this granular data from central banks. Institutions are investing in even more granular collections and associated repositories. Insights from analyses of granular data increasingly contribute to our understanding of mechanisms and frictions at work in shaping the dynamics of capital flows across borders. This type of granularity even shapes how we should talk about groups of countries and their respective policy challenges.  And we learn where we have blind spots.\n\nWe often talk about spillovers from home or source countries active in the international financial system.  In this lecture, the granular data approach focuses attention on the supervision and regulation in the home countries of providers of global liquidity. \n\nSome of the global liquidity flows —including the riskier projects and borrowers— have migrated away from funding provision through banks toward more market-based financing.  Nonbank financial institutions now play important or even dominant roles in some global liquidity flows.  Nonbank financial institutions consist of a broad spectrum of agents distinguished by the riskiness of their projects, their business models, their collateral holdings, leverage, and access to sources of funding.\n\nThis shift in funding composition can potentially undo some of the recent progress made on dampening shock amplification after the global regulatory communities focused on large and internationally active banks following the global financial crisis.\n\nThese points underscore the importance — in an international context —of progressing on the largely domestic country efforts to address the vulnerabilities associated with some classes of nonbank financial institutions. Weaknesses and systemic risks propagate across borders, and domestic policy has externalities.  Developing effective liquidity facilities for the official lender of last resort function, associated with official provision of global liquidity, also plays a role.\n\nEquity markets can quickly adjust to shocks through asset prices.  Equity owners absorb losses and volatility.  Institutions and tax codes can favor debt financing. What is the right mix domestically, and how does this interact with global liquidity?     \n\nArguments about global liquidity tie closely to overall capital flows and relate to the classical Monetary Trilemmas faced by countries. The well-known Monetary Trilemma posits the incompatibility of three economic features: monetary policy autonomy, maintaining fixed exchange rates, and having free and open international capital flows.  Maury Obstfeld has provided empirical evidence that some monetary policy autonomy exists, including for emerging markets, especially for countries with flexible exchange rates. Countries with flexible exchange rates have better economic outcomes relative to countries under fixed exchange rate alternatives, even if complete achievement of domestic goals is not accomplished.\n\nAdditional challenges for policy autonomy are highlighted around the Financial Trilemma, in which Dirk Schoenmaker (2005 and 2011), builds on the more general principles of extensive domestic objective incompatibilities in a globalized world as argued by Dani Rodrik (2000). This Financial Trilemma brings into focus the conflicting nodes in the international financial stability realm that are sharpened by the substantial growth in cross-border financing over recent decades. In this case, the three mutually incompatible nodes are: financial stability, nonintervention in cross border financial flows, and national control over financial supervision and regulation.\n\nAt the IMF 15th Annual Research Conference on \"Exchange Rates and Financial Globalization,\" Obstfeld (2014)discussed how financial stability policy is harder in open economies and financial fragility is more pronounced when agents choose not to hedge foreign dollar credits.\n\nObstfeld (2014) provides some ingredients of a more efficient international system, including: \n\nConsiderable progress has been made in developing and implementing the integrated policy framework here at the IMF.  Regulators have also made some progress on the banking side, as I will discuss. It also has been made on capital control frameworks and enhanced facilities. At least as pertains to domestic macroprudential policies, one issue with effectiveness is that some parts of the toolkit are applied to specific types of institutions — for example banks —instead of activities.\n\nMore than a decade ago, the potential for risk migration was anticipated by researchers.\n\nJonathan Ostry, Atish Ghosh, Marcos Chamon and Mahvash Qureshi (2012) were early in the space of exploring the empirical consequences of macroprudential and capital control policies using data for 51 EMEs for the period 1995 through 2008. They found evidence of effectiveness for indicators of financial fragility.  However, they also noted the difficulty of using macroprudential policy effectively when activity can migrate to unregulated venues.\n\nValentina Bruno and Hyun Song Shin (2015) observed that \"the shifting patterns of financial intermediation means that tools geared toward the regulated banking sector have diminished efficacy\" on the procyclicality of the financial system.\n\nMaury with Alan Taylor (2017) emphasized the importance of focusing more on rapidly evolving financial markets, as risky activity was being pushed outside the perimeters of regulation.\n\nHelene Rey (IMF 2017)called for a \"research agenda for the Global Financial Cycle [including the] source, propagation, amplification mechanisms, endogenous risk build ups; Models with heterogeneous intermediaries and moral hazard (risk-taking not properly priced) …(among other things); Ex ante: Regulatory policies,  Micro and macro prudential policies, capital flow management policies, … policies subsidizing debt.\"\n\nAll of Maury's ingredients will come up in the rest of this lecture.  I will set up issues pertaining to the trilemma and the ingredients by considering the relationship between global liquidity and risk conditions.  I will present evidence at different levels of data disaggregation, and ultimately make arguments about the roles of prudential policy and then the challenges from risk migration.   \n\nInternational capital flow pressures manifest as an excess demand for foreign currency relative to domestic currency. Global liquidity is a big portion of these flows. \n\nExchange rates are frequently used as indicators of these international capital flow pressures. However, some countries through central banks or finance ministries, at some times, meet excess demand for foreign currency by using foreign exchange intervention (FXI) instead of letting all the international capital flow pressure materialize in the depreciation.  Similarly, when there are appreciation pressures on currencies, some central banks accumulate official foreign exchange reserves instead of realizing the full currency appreciation. In these cases, the exchange rate is no longer a sufficient statistic for international capital flow pressures, across countries and over time.\n\nThe new Exchange Market Pressure (EMP) index from Signe Krogstrup and I (Goldberg and Krogstrup 2018) includes the actual rate of currency depreciation or appreciation that occurs, along with contributions of both FXI conducted and monetary policy rate changes.  But FXI is a quantity, for example billions of euros or USD, while currency depreciation is a rate. How can they be added up? \n\nWe derive the factor that converts how much currency depreciation was avoided by that FXI.  The derivation starts with the standard balance of payments accounting, which captures the flows associated with net exports, interest payments on foreign debt and interest earnings, and changes in gross foreign asset and liability positions.  FXI is the residual of all the other currency flows across borders for a country at a point in time.\n\nAs the exchange rate influences some of these flows, we work through how much of a change in the exchange rate — working through mostly financial channels— would have been needed to generate such an excess demand for foreign currency. This gives the conversion factor.  It represents the quantity of currency depreciation avoided by every billion dollars or euros of FXI is country and time specific and depends on features like country-specific gross foreign assets and liabilities, the currency denominations of these positions, and the sensitivity of different types of investors to shocks. \n\nWe compute monthly series for the EMP for a large group of countries. And we use this to demonstrate the evolving risk sensitivity of international capital flow pressures. Our Global Risk Response (GRR) series is a rolling 5-year correlation between the EMP and a measure of risk sentiment (in this case the VIX).\n\nThis slide shows in blue the averages across advanced economies at each date, along with a standard error band showing variation across countries and shows in red the comparable averages across emerging market economies.\n\nThis exhibit demonstrates a broadly accepted characterization.  Increases in the VIX elicit a much greater risk off pressure on emerging market currencies - negative values are the tendencies of a currency to depreciate when risk sentiment deteriorates and the VIX is higher. These depreciation tendencies are stronger across emerging markets compared to advanced economies. Across these two groups of countries the differences in risk sensitivities are no longer so pronounced.\n\nThis inference is misleading. And it provides a first take of why looking at granular data is helpful.\n\nFor context, the past decade has focused our attention on safe haven properties of some currencies, with the dollar associated with convenience yields and the US considered a liquidity provider or global insurer. Many participating in this conference have contributed insights on this topic.1 Some other currencies also exhibit the so called \"safe haven\" currency characteristics, as these countries are net recipients of global liquidity flows or experience similar international capital flow pressures as the US dollar as risk conditions deteriorate.\n\nThe next exhibit separates these so-called \"safe haven\" currencies from the broader group of advanced economies. Now we have average GRR values for two categories of advanced economies — with and without the \"safe haven\" feature — and have the average GRR for emerging market economies.\n\nAbstracting from the so-called safe haven currencies, other advanced economies and emerging markets exhibit similar risk sensitivities. Advanced economies are not appropriately combined into a single category when considering policy challenges from risk-induced international capital flow pressures. The risk sensitivity for the currencies of other advanced economies and those of emerging market economies are quite similar after the GFC. Meanwhile, risk sensitivities have trended downward for the so-called safe havens.\n\nWhy? For answers, it is important to understand the composition of players in global liquidity flows.\n\nIncreasingly granular data will now help us to understand drivers of these reduced sensitivities and to gain insights on whether this status of lower risk sensitivity is likely to persist. It is helpful to have a schematic in mind as we consider the players.\n\nThis schematic is intended to capture the key elements of global liquidity. The boundaries of Country A are indicated by the dashed orange lines. Within country A are banks, on the left, and all others in need of funding on the right. The global liquidity flows to borrowers in a Country A can be intermediated through banks (upper left) and through non-bank financial institutions (upper right). \n\nCross-border loans (XBL) are made by the internationally active banks to domestic banks. Internationally active banks also directly fund non-bank borrowers in country A. This funding can take the form of sovereign loans or syndicated lending to large non-financial corporations, exporting and importing firms, and leveraged non-bank financial firms.\n\nSome global banks also engage in cross-border lending to their branches and subsidiaries located in Country A. Intra-bank lending is how global banks manage liquidity across parts of their organizations around the world. The hosted banks then provide loans and services within the borders of country A.\n\nThe right side of this graphic shows the role of global players in the non-bank financial intermediation space.  Funding through non-bank financial institutions (NBFIs) is sometimes described as market-based finance. This can be through purchasing international debt securities (IDS) that are issued by banks or by nonbanks within country A. The purchasers of these securities tend to be pension funds, insurance companies, money market funds, and hedge funds.\n\nHow large are these different types of flows?\n\nMy recent research with Stefan Avdjiev, Leonardo Gambacorta, and Stefano Schiaffi (2022) expands on earlier work we published in 2020 in the JIE (Avdjiev, Gambacorta, Goldberg, Schiaffi 2020). Our current analytics look at BIS data on cross border loans and international debt securities, aggregated at the country level, with series that cover 44 lending countries and 64 borrowing countries, 2000 through 2021.\n\nThese exhibits show the evolving composition of bank-based funding and market-based funding for borrowers in advanced economies (top panels) and emerging markets (bottom panels). We separate the banks as borrowers (left panels) from the nonbanks as borrowers (right panels). Red blocks show outstanding XBL. Blue blocks show outstanding IDS. \n\nFocus your attention on the left panels, which depict how bank borrowers are financed internationally. Banks in both advanced economies (on top) and in emerging markets (on bottom) have had relatively steady positions in total global funding in recent years. Cross-border loans (represented in red) are the largest form of international funding for banks.\n\nFocusing your attention on the right panels, the most dramatic shifts in the composition of global liquidity are for non-bank borrowers. This change is evident both within advanced and emerging market economies. While banks have experienced moderate shifts in funding sources, nonbanks have tilted sharply toward market-based finance.\n\nNext, the same data are deflated by GDP in each country at each quarter. We then consider the medians across countries and by date.  Post GFC, the median advanced economy has international debt securities issued by nonbanks financed at about 25 percent of GDP, while the median emerging market economy has experienced sharp increases over a decade from around 5 percent of GDP to 13 percent of GDP. \n\nLet's go back to big picture, and back to Maury Obstfeld, as he so often places lessons in the context of international financial history.  In 2005, Maury and Alan Taylor published their book on Global Capital Markets (Obstfeld and Taylor 2005) in which they presented a stylized visualization of capital flow history from the mid-1800s to 2000.  The first era of financial globalization occurred prior to 1914, then collapsed during the interwar period. The world economy experienced the second era of financial globalization from 1980 through 2000.\n\nNext, I provide my own brief history of the period since 1980. For this purpose, I return to the stylistic diagram introduced earlier. The period from 1980 through the present will be divided into 3 episodes, also helping to motivate a bigger and durable point about risk migration in global liquidity.\n\nEpisode 1 - 1980s to early 1990s: Global Liquidity flows started out bank-based, and to sovereign borrowers. This is reflected in the pattern of bold black arrows.  \n\nEpisode 2 - mid 1990s through early 2000s:  Often following crises, countries liberalized their capital accounts and permitted more participation of foreign banks in the local economies. Global banking expands through branches and subsidiaries in foreign locations, and then direct lending increases to other nonbank customers. Other banking services also were more broadly provided. Global banking organizations became more complex with many legal entities as part of these financial conglomerates. Plus, there was some increase in the role of NBFIs.\n\nEpisode 3 – Post GFC to the present: The last and current era is a period of expansion of rapid global liquidity flows directly to non-bank borrowers and an increasing role of NBFIs.  Part of this arose as regulation generated with risk migration away from banks and technological changes also occurred.\n\nNext, our analytics use the borrower type and funding type granularity by country over time to explore evolving risk (and monetary policy) sensitivity over time, along with drivers of these changes. Sensitivities of flows are explored relative to the VIX. However, robustness has been done in some parts of the work to other measures —for example using the RORO measures of Chari, Dilts Stedman and Lundblad (2020) and the risk sentiment from Bekaert, Engstrom and Xu (2021).\n\nThese next slides draw on my new research with Stefan Avdjiev, Leonardo Gambacorta and Stefano Schiaffi (Avdjiev, Gambacorta, Goldberg, Schiaffi 2022) and our earlier work in the JIE 2020.\n\nThe data cover IDS and XBL, by bank and non-bank borrowers. Analytics consider characteristics of source country banking systems and composition of NBFI types in inflows, from the perspective of the borrowing country. \n\nThe econometrics:  estimate sensitivity to global factor components: change in U.S. federal funds rate (or shadow policy rate), risk sentiment (VIX), global GDP growth; control for local conditions: GDP growth, sovereign rating, capital account openness;  estimate sensitivity pre-GFC and patterns post-GFC; separate borrowers by \"safe havens\", other advanced economies, and emerging markets; and test for drivers of sensitivities, including composition and characteristics of banking systems and NBFIs.\n\nI illustrate findings applied to granular data at the country and funding type levels for EM borrowers.  In the exhibit below, the horizontal orange lines are the pre-GFC sensitivities to risk.  The blue lines are the post GFC sensitivities, sequentially adding quarterly observations.   These blue lines are surrounded by a 90 percent confidence interval at each date.\n\nThe sensitivities to risk of different types of flows vis-a-vis borrower types have changed dramatically.\n\nAcross emerging markets, and across other country groupings (not shown), all borrower types have reduced cross-border lending sensitivity to the VIX.  This is illustrated by the top panel of graphics, where the leftmost panel uses the total amount of XBL each quarter by country, the middle panel shows the perspective of banks as recipients of interbank funding, and the right panel provides the perspective of non-bank borrowers.\n\nThese risk sensitivity results through bank lending stand in contrast to patterns in market-based funding for bank and nonbank borrowers. Risk sensitivity of IDS has not declined and exhibit considerable heterogeneity across borrowing countries. This type of funding has grown in importance. It is also less transparent, and more heterogeneous, as I will shortly discuss.\n\nThere are important differences across so-called safe havens and other advanced economies (not shown here). Pre-GFC, cross-border lending to banks located in all groups of countries contracted when risk sentiment deteriorated. After the GFC, on average funding flowed into the safe haven country banks and non-bank borrowers when deteriorations in risk conditions occurred.\n\nIn sum, the post GFC period has been characterized by been dramatic changes\n\nWhat is behind this changing pattern of risk sensitivity across countries and over time?  The next body of work points to stronger prudential policy and official liquidity facilities in reducing the amplitude of response of global liquidity to risk deterioration. Key findings are based on considering risk sensitivities in post GFC, both compared to pre GFC and over time (through 2021 data).\n\nBetter capitalization in banks is the major contributor to less risk sensitive XBL. The amplitude of risk transmission across borders is sharply magnified through banks that are less well capitalized. The role of bank capitalization is particularly important for EM borrowers.\n\nAdditional stabilizing effects have come from compositional changes within XBL activity.  Less well capitalized banking systems lost market share after the GFC, as they focused more on balance sheet repair. In addition, the shorter term and more volatile cross-border flows vis-à-vis unrelated banks abroad (Interbank lending) has declined, increasing the relative importance of intra-bank lending.\n\nData limitations make it more difficult to be as conclusive about the characteristics of NBFIs involved in market-based funding.  Our research uses two NBFI indicators:  the asset share of NBFIs with high leverage and the asset share of NBFIs with high liquidity transformation.2 We do not have institution specific details on leverage, including for institutions involved in global liquidity flows. The results are much noisier.\n\nIn market-based funding of borrowers, risk sensitivity appears to be higher when higher leverage types of NBFIs account for larger shares of flows. The share of high leverage NBFI types associated with global liquidity inflows are quite different across safe havens, other AEs, and EMs.  For EMs this share represents over 40 percent of the NBFIs, down from over 50 percent a decade prior. For other advanced economies, the share is considerably lower, down to about 20 percent in the past decade.\n\nResearch conducted through projects organized by the International Banking Research Network provides additional insights.  Friederike Niepmann, Tim Schmidt-Eisenlohr and Emily Liu ( 2021) find that only banks that comfortably passed the CCAR (the Federal Reserve's annual Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review) stress tests issued more loans to EMs borrowers. Banks also shifted their lending to safer borrowers within EMs in response to monetary easing, leaving the risk of their overall loan books unchanged. \n\nOther studies find that prudential policy spillovers across borders depend on bank characteristics in source and recipient countries (Buch and Goldberg 2017). As there are Heterogeneous results across the different countries participating in this initiative, we reach general findings using meta-analysis. Spillovers occur internationally through bank lending. Country- and sector-specific dynamics documented by individual countries. Effects on lending differ with bank balance sheet characteristics and business models. Direct effects are not large on average.\n\nBank capital requirements are tied to migration of activity across banks/ banking systems. Banks with higher initial capital were poised to increase lending internationally, and sometimes pivoting from domestic loan growth, when foreign countries tightened their capital requirements. Changes in some prudential instruments spur market share repositioning across banks and foreign countries.\n\nRecovery and resolution frameworks for large and systemically important banks have also played a role in changing risk sensitivity of banking organizations.  My work with Ricardo Correa on US banks and the introduction of living wills shows that these large banks reduced their organizational complexity, but at the same time this altered forms of risk exposures ( Correa and Goldberg 2022)    \n\nNew research also points to Central Bank Swap Lines and Funding Facility access as reducing risk sensitivity. When tail risk events in global liquidity occur, high stress episodes are reflected in higher cost of dollar funding facing borrowers in offshore markets. Some of the amplification effects arise as borrowers increase demand for liquidity due to meeting existing balance sheet funding needs or due to positioning towards more liquid positions. At least from the perspective of liquidity for such insurance purposes, access to lender of last resort and liquidity facilities should weaken the amplitude and amplification of some global liquidity responses to extreme risk events.\n\nIn dollar funding, the Federal Reserve's swap lines with central banks and the Foreign and International Monetary Authority (FIMA) repo facility - introduced in March 2020. By reducing some of the tail risk on dollar funding costs in systemic events, access to such facilities support continued credit provision and reduced amplification effects when large shocks hit global markets.\n\nAnalysis conducted with my colleague Fabiola Ravazzolo, using data during the early months of the pandemic in 2020, explores if the risk sensitivity of different components of global liquidity flows are differentiated across countries, and decline with facility access (Goldberg and Ravazzolo 2022 ). Analytical results support the conjecture that facility access in a large risk event stabilizes credit flows through banks and bond funds, but also depends on the features of funds. 3\n\nThese types of findings reinforce the point about understanding the heterogeneity of nonbank financial institutions, as well as types of mutual fund flows. Recent analytics by Anusha Chari, Karlye Dilts Stedman, and Christian Lundblad (Chari, Dilts Stedman, and Lundblad 2022) show extensive heterogeneity across bond and equity funds, as well as across institutional funds versus retail funds, in response to risk levels and risk aversion, with distinctions sorting along passive versus active funds and along the composition of these funds.\n\nMy last two themes focus on risk migration and toolkits.  Think back to the stylized history of the past 40 years, and to the drivers that I have presented. Pre-GFC, liberalized access by global banks shifted some XBL to local lending. More credit access to smaller, riskier local borrowers. Plus, global bank liquidity allocation across organizations responds to risk. Lending by branches and subsidiaries is less risk sensitive than XBL.  Intra-bank lending more stable than inter-bank lending.  When shocked, global banks follow pecking order on liquidity reallocation across foreign affiliates: core locations are more protected than periphery ( Cetorelli and Goldberg 2012 )\n\nAfter the global financial crisis those internationally active banks with stronger balance sheets and risk absorbing capacity expanded market share relative to banks that had to focus more on balance sheet repair.  Over time, the frameworks focused on large and systemically important banks require more capital to be set aside in association with riskier borrowers.  This led to some migration of those financing activity to market-based finance through NBFIs. This likely was aided by prudential developments including enhanced recovery and resolution frameworks, reduced some of the organizational complexity of global banks (Correa and Goldberg 2022).\n\nRegulation and innovation fuel both NBFI expansion and their locations in cross-border financial centers. Pamela Pogliani, Goetz von Peter, and Phil Wooldridge (2022) find that NBFIs now account for the largest share of intermediation via cross-border centers. NBFIs locate more in cross-border financial centers with less stringent regulation.  Funds are channeled across borders often via entities with a minimal physical presence, such as booking offices, special purpose entities (SPEs) and shell companies.4\n\nExtensive work on toolkits has focused on managing priorities, conditional on characteristics of global liquidity. My main lesson is that Trilemmas – both the monetary trilemma and the financial trilemma - bind less under stronger foreign prudential policies.  This is a positive externality.\n\nThis insight reinforces importance of: Continued focus on risk management and ample risk buffers of global banks – positive global externalities for XBL; liquidity management within global banks helps fund more information-intensive, relatively stable local lending by affiliates. However, more peripheral locations are less protected (even less so by XBL); and liquidity facilities by central banks: reduce amplification of strains, enable liquifying instead of liquidating official reserve assets.\n\nIt also emphasizes additional considerations, as the IMF Integrated Policy Framework has a focus on recipient country policy.  Can the framework explore introducing thresholds on prudential strength of source countries? Or around characteristics of specific global liquidity providers?\n\nThe research community can collectively enhance this effort so that we collectively learn more about the mechanisms for transmission and amplification across specific types of institutions. Issues arise around institutional oversight and regulation, access to liquidity backstops with moral hazard risks, where procyclicalities arise in financing flows, differences in dynamics through new and old players in financial markets along with entry costs to intermediate and participate in liquidity provision, and differences in behaviors in normal times versus crisis periods when stresses are broad-based. In addition, the central banking community is working to understand how NBFIs contribute to monetary policy implementation, with details about the granular composition of the types of institutions including insurance companies, investment funds, and pension funds. While banks and NBFIs are discussed separately, there are interconnections with channels of shock transmission that are still not fully understood.\n\nIn the global liquidity environment, even if domestic toolkits are not complete, the tradeoffs in the Financial Trilemma should be improved if both global banks and overseas nonbank financial intermediaries abroad are more robust, without amplification effects that worsen the effects of shocks, whether associated with risk sentiment or other causes. From a borrowing country perspective, perhaps the future is one where every institutional provider of funding is rated, and there is a required diversification of providers as well as threshold rating of providers. Perhaps this type of approach can help deal with regulatory fragmentation.\n\nAs a final point, the international financial and research communities can collectively pose the question about the optimal composition of global liquidity flows.  It is clear that funding should be somewhat diversified to minimize counterparty risk concentrations. A mix of domestically owned and foreign banks provide additional dimensions of diversification, as do diversified business models within banking organizations. However, less well developed is the optimal structure of debt versus equity.\n\nV. Concluding remarks\n\nI have argued today that prudential policies in the source countries of global liquidity are important for reducing the amplitude of responses to risk as transmitted across borders.  Managing challenges from global liquidity has four key elements.  First, appropriately target policy using a layered approach with granular data. Second, maintain a focus on strong prudential policies and effective supervision. Third, focus on features of liquidity facilities that help dampen the global financial cycle, but do not create moral hazard. Fourth, address the continuing challenges that arise from risk migration.\n\nIn addition there are many areas that are ripe for careful research and analytics.  Among this is a forward-looking vision of what countries would target as an ideal structure of debt and equity in financing."

        "content": "It is a pleasure to be here today to discuss a timely and important topic: the anchoring of inflation expectations. Against the backdrop of the stormy seas of the global inflation of the past year and a half, a steady anchor is more critical than ever. But, what does it mean for inflation expectations to be well anchored, and how would we know if they are? In my remarks, I will describe three criteria for well-anchored inflation expectations. I will then provide an initial assessment of the behavior of inflation expectations in the United States against these three criteria since inflation surged in the spring of last year. I should emphasize the word “initial,” since we are still in the midst of the storm, and definitive conclusions on the anchoring of expectations will await the ship’s safe return.\n\nThis is the perfect time to give the usual Federal Reserve disclaimer that everything I say reflects my own views and not necessarily those of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) or anyone else in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nThe critical importance of anchoring inflation expectations is now enshrined as a bedrock principle of modern central banking. One way central banks have sought to anchor expectations is through a commitment to an explicit longer-run inflation goal. For example, the FOMC’s Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy, issued in January 2012, set a 2 percent longer-run inflation goal. It declared: “Communicating this inflation goal clearly to the public helps keep longer-term inflation expectations firmly anchored, thereby fostering price stability and moderate long-term interest rates and enhancing the Committee's ability to promote maximum employment in the face of significant economic disturbances.”1 The 2 percent longer-run goal and the importance of well-anchored inflation expectations were reaffirmed in the FOMC’s updated Goals and Strategy statement released in 2020.2\n\nTheory\n\nIt is one thing to say that anchored inflation expectations are important, but what do we mean by well-anchored expectations, and how would we know if they are well anchored? I will start by describing some theoretical implications of well-anchored inflation expectations, and then turn to an empirical assessment based on U.S. data from the past few years.\n\nMy thinking on this issue is based largely on a series of research papers I wrote with Athanasios Orphanides. We used models with adaptive learning to contrast the predicted behavior of inflation and inflation expectations in two environments: when the public anchors its expectations on the central bank’s long-run target and when the public’s perception of the central bank’s target evolves depending on incoming data.3\n\nThis analysis and related studies imply three criteria for well-anchored inflation expectations: “sensitivity,” “level,” and “uncertainty.” Let me take each in turn.\n\nThe sensitivity criterion states that although near- and medium-term inflation expectations may respond to economic shocks, expectations of inflation far in the future should not. Well-designed monetary policy will generally allow for some response to shocks of short- and medium-term inflation expectations in order to balance competing objectives, but long-run inflation expectations should not be affected. In a formal sense, this criterion is about the very long-run response of inflation to shocks, but as shown in my research with Orphanides, the beneficial effects of anchored expectations on macroeconomic performance only occur when the inflation response to a shock is not expected to extend over many years. As Keynes admonishes us, in the long run we are all dead, and the notion of long-run expectations cannot be too long.\n\nThis sensitivity criterion requires long-run inflation expectations to be invariant to shocks. In contrast, the level criterion applies the more stringent standard that the rate of long-run inflation expectations be consistent with the central bank’s long-run inflation target. In other words, it demands that expectations not just be anchored, but anchored to the right spot. These first two criteria are present in the FOMC’s statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy, which stresses the anchoring of longer-run inflation expectations at the target level and recognizes that short-run trade-offs between inflation and economic activity may arise.\n\nThe third criterion—uncertainty—requires that uncertainty about future inflation increases less than linearly with the forecast horizon. Transitory responses of inflation to shocks imply uncertainty about future inflation, even far in the future. The uncertainty criterion is about the relationship between the magnitude of uncertainty and the forecast horizon. It is closely related to the sensitivity criterion, in that permanent shocks to inflation are ruled out. The counterexample is if inflation follows a random walk process, whereby shocks have permanent effects on inflation, then uncertainty, as measured by the standard deviation from the distribution of future outcomes, rises linearly with the forecast horizon.\n\nApplying Theory to the Real World\n\nIn the years up to and including the first year of the pandemic, inflation had been running consistently below the FOMC’s 2 percent longer-run target. Then, in the spring of 2021, inflation readings surged, bringing the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) inflation rate to around 6 percent, where it has remained through the first nine months of 2022. Consumer price index (CPI) inflation rose by even more. This episode represents a unique opportunity to assess the three criteria of well-anchored expectations during a period of high and volatile inflation.4\n\nIn empirically assessing the sensitivity and level of longer-run inflation expectations, one must specify what forecast horizon corresponds to the “long run.” Surveys don’t typically ask about inflation in the “long run,” but rather the inflation rate over a specific period of time. A reasonable and oft-used benchmark of longer-run inflation expectations is to look at inflation five or more years in the future. Such a forecast horizon is sufficiently long enough for typical business cycle dynamics and the effects of monetary policy on inflation to have played out, although under some circumstances, this may fall short of the “long run” implied by theory.\n\nOver the past year and a half, measures of longer-run inflation expectations have been insensitive to the rapid rise in inflation. Figure 1 shows the time series of these measures of longer-run inflation expectations. This includes median expectations from the Survey of Professional Forecasters (SPF) for inflation measured by the PCE price index 6-10 years in the future; breakeven inflation rates 6-10 years in the future as implied by nominal and inflation-protected U.S. Treasury securities; and the University of Michigan survey of inflation expected over the next 5-10 years.5 Realized 12-month CPI inflation is also shown in the figure for reference.\n\nAs seen in Figure 1, SPF longer-run inflation expectations have remained remarkably stable over the past year and a half, while the market-based measure and the Michigan survey rose modestly during 2021 before retracing some of those gains this year. Because the Michigan survey asks about inflation over the next 5-10 years, it is a mixture of short-run and longer-run expectations, which may be related to its modest sensitivity to inflation. Market-based measures include a time-varying risk premium that may explain the modest movements in that measure.6\n\nIn contrast to longer-run expectations, short-run and, to a lesser extent, medium-run inflation expectations responded to the sharp rise in inflation. The lower portion of Table 1 reports summary statistics for one-year-ahead inflation expectations from the Michigan survey and one- and three-year-ahead expectations from the New York Fed’s Survey of Consumer Expectations (SCE). Consistent with past experience, one-year-ahead inflation expectations have been highly sensitive to incoming inflation during the recent period. The sensitivity of three-year-ahead inflation expectations is far less than that for one-year-ahead expectations. And they have been significantly less sensitive to incoming information during this period of high inflation than during the period before the pandemic. This suggests households view the run-up in inflation in 2021 as likely being less persistent than in prior episodes.7\n\nAlthough the SPF includes a longer-run forecast of PCE price inflation, most other measures of inflation expectations do not exactly correspond to the PCE price index that the FOMC has stipulated for its long-run goal. This complicates a direct comparison of these measures to the FOMC’s stated goal. For example, the SCE refers to the “rate of inflation,” and the Michigan survey refers to “prices in general,” rather than referring to a specific price index. Similarly, “breakeven inflation” measures derived from inflation-indexed Treasury securities are based on the CPI and include time-varying risk and term premiums in addition to expectations of inflation.8 To address the lack of direct comparability of different measures of inflation expectations, I compare readings over the past two years to the levels observed during 2014-2020, after the FOMC’s announcement of a 2 percent long-run goal and before the onset of rising inflation in the spring of 2021.\n\nThe level of longer-run expectations in the SPF has consistently stayed very close to the FOMC’s 2 percent goal. The other measures have generally stayed within pre-pandemic ranges, with most recent readings only slightly higher than corresponding average levels from 2014-2020. The upper portion of Table 1 provides statistics on these comparisons. Interestingly, during the period of sustained low inflation before the pandemic, the market-based and Michigan measures declined, and their current levels are similar to those seen prior to that decline.\n\nAssessment of the uncertainty criterion for well-anchored inflation expectations is more challenging given data limitations. In theory, prices on inflation options contracts could be used to infer investors’ distributions of beliefs about future inflation.9 However, there have been virtually no trades recorded in the U.S. market for inflation caps and floors since 2015. Over that time, the “prices” reported for these options were based on models—not transaction prices—and cannot be used to measure investors’ inflation uncertainty during the current episode. Instead, I will turn to the SCE, which asks about consumers’ uncertainty of inflation expectations, as well as options on future interest rates, which provide some indirect insights into markets’ uncertainty of future inflation.\n\nOver the past year and a half, two aspects of increased inflation uncertainty are evident in the SCE: an increase in disagreement in mean expectations across respondents and an increase in the width of respondents’ reported inflation distributions. Although disagreement does not directly correspond to uncertainty, research has identified it as a useful indirect indicator.10 Figure 2 and Figure 3 illustrate the increase in disagreement across SCE respondents over the past several years. Figure 2 shows the share of respondents who have deflation expectations—that is, they expect inflation to be at or below zero percent—either one, three, or five years in the future.11 As discussed in research with my colleagues at the New York Fed,12 there has been a striking increase over the past year in the share of respondents who expect deflation three and five years in the future.13 At the same time, as shown in Figure 3, the share expecting inflation above 4 percent grew, but part of the increase has since reversed. Based on the most recent reading in September 2022, about a quarter of respondents have deflation expectations five years in the future, nearly as large as the share expecting inflation above 4 percent at the five-year horizon.\n\nFollowing the onset of the pandemic, aggregate uncertainty—which combines disagreement and individual uncertainty—increased but has also become more symmetric. Figure 4 shows the aggregate distributions of inflation three years in the future based on the SCE.14 Two-thirds of the widening of distributions reflect greater dispersion across respondents, and the remainder is due to greater uncertainty reported by individuals.15 Interestingly, the distribution of aggregate uncertainty before and during the first year of the pandemic was skewed to the upside, as seen in Figure 4. Since then, the rising share of those who report deflation expectations has caused the overall distribution to become more symmetric relative to the median.\n\nIn terms of the uncertainty criterion, uncertainty does not increase linearly with the forecast horizon in the SCE. Figure 5 shows the distributions of aggregate uncertainty for one-, three-, and five-year-ahead inflation forecasts from September 2022. As Figure 5 shows, the distributions are very similar for the different forecast horizons. This seems consistent with the evidence that many respondents view the inflation surge as reflecting a unique set of developments.16\n\nAn additional, albeit indirect, measure of inflation uncertainty is provided by the distribution of expectations of interest rates from options.17 Although future interest rates depend on a variety of factors, the expectations about inflation are a key determinant. Therefore, changes in the distribution of beliefs about future inflation should affect the distribution of beliefs about future interest rates as well.\n\nMarket-based uncertainty of far-future interest rates has increased relative to the immediate pre-pandemic period. Figure 6 shows the options-implied distributions of short-term interest rates seven years in the future. Note that these distributions are truncated by the lower bound on interest rates. Compared with early 2019, the median interest rate expectation is about the same, but the upper tail of the distribution is now much wider, and the probability of being at the lower bound has increased somewhat. To the extent that this reflects an increase in inflation uncertainty, it is also consistent with the pattern of greater aggregate uncertainty about future inflation, both to the upside and downside, as seen in the SCE.\n\nDistributions of future interest rates also appear consistent with the uncertainty criterion. Figure 7 shows the options-implied distributions for up to 10 years in the future, as of September 2022. Although the implied standard deviation of interest rates increases with the forecast horizon, this relationship is less than linear.18\n\nConclusion\n\nThe importance of maintaining well-anchored inflation expectations is a bedrock principle of modern central banking, but its precise meaning and validation has been open to interpretation. My goal today has been to use economic theory to identify empirical criteria that can be used to assess the anchoring of inflation expectations during the ongoing episode of high inflation. The news is mostly good—longer-run inflation expectations in the United States have remained remarkably stable at levels broadly consistent with the FOMC’s longer-run goal. Inflation uncertainty has increased, but this does not appear to be due to unmoored longer-run expectations. The one surprising wrinkle worth further study is the increasing divergence in views about future inflation, including the high share of those expecting deflation, and what this portends for the future.\n\nTable and Figures\n\nReferences\n\nArmantier, Olivier, Fatima Boumahdi, Gizem Kosar, Jason Somerville, Giorgio Topa, Wilbert van der Klaauw, and John C.

        "content": "Good afternoon. It is a pleasure to be here with you at the Singapore Fintech Festival. It is exciting to be a part of this gathering of industry professionals, policy leaders, and investors to discuss key developments in the fintech industry. Digital innovation has the potential to benefit the financial system writ large by reducing transaction costs, increasing competition, and broadening access to a wider range of participants. However, harnessing the full potential of financial innovation and related technologies – especially regarding cross-border settlements and payments – will require collaboration across a range of international partners. In my remarks today I will discuss the landscape of digital assets and some of the ways that the Federal Reserve System is engaging in research and experimentation that support ongoing innovation. As always, the views I express today are my own, and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York or the Federal Reserve System.\n\nDigital Assets and the Federal Reserve\n\nWe are all experiencing the incredible pace of growth and change within the digital asset domain, which encompasses a range of opportunities and risks. The market capitalization of digital assets reached $3 trillion in November 2021.1 The rapid growth of digital assets presents opportunities to both reinforce the role of central banks and regulatory bodies in stewardship of the global financial system and be positioned at the technological frontier. However, this growth is not without risks: in May, the crash of Terra, an unbacked algorithmic stablecoin, and the subsequent wave of insolvencies, wiped out over $600 billion of investor and consumer funds.2,3 Currently, the total cryptoasset market capitalization rests around $1 trillion, a 66 percent decline from its November 2021 peak.\n\nWhen I consider the ways in which digital assets impact the mission of the Federal Reserve, I see several channels – including monetary policy and the provision of an elastic currency, the preservation of financial stability, and the smooth operation of the payments system. Regarding monetary policy and currency, in January, the Federal Reserve released a discussion paper that considers a future where digital assets may play a large role in our financial system, and in particular, establishes some broad principles and outlines some of the pros and cons of a central bank digital currency, or CBDC.4 While at present the Federal Reserve has neither issued a CBDC nor plans to do so imminently, ongoing research improves our understanding of the risks and opportunities inherent to a CBDC. Central bank money – a liability of the Federal Reserve – is the bedrock of the U.S. financial system. It is held by depository institutions as bank reserves or by individuals in the form of paper currency. Demand for central bank money is driven by many fundamental factors, including the settlement of both retail and wholesale transactions and its role as a store of value. In addition to these factors, which are likely familiar to any of you who have studied monetary economics, demand for the U.S. dollar is also driven by international factors owing to the role of the dollar in the global economy. In fact, while precise estimates are challenging to come by, available data suggests that more than half of all dollars in circulation may be held outside the United States.5 As a result, innovation related to money provided by the Federal Reserve will have impacts that extend far beyond U.S. borders.\n\nA U.S. CBDC – a digital form of the U.S. dollar that is a direct liability of the Federal Reserve– has the potential to offer significant benefits. It could enable a payment system that is more efficient, provide a foundation for further technological innovation, and facilitate faster cross-border transactions. It could promote financial inclusion and equity by enabling access for a broad set of consumers and foster economic growth and stability. In order to fully realize benefits such as these, a digital dollar would need to be thoughtfully designed and implemented. A CBDC would need to protect against cyber and operational risks, safeguard the privacy of sensitive data, and minimize risks of illicit financial transactions. Additionally, one of the most important aspects in our deliberations is that any form of a CBDC in the future would need to be intermediated. This means that the private sector would need to act as intermediaries in that system, and a direct account approach would not be contemplated.\n\nWhile the Federal Reserve has made no decision on whether or how to issue a CBDC, we are actively conducting technical investigations into both retail and wholesale CBDC design. Project Hamilton, which is a partnership between the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston and MIT, has experimented with potential approaches to a digital dollar, with work focused on retail uses and payment channels. In the use case they explored, the Hamilton team was able to demonstrate the potential for usage at scale, which would be a key design element of a retail CBDC.6 As a complement, and in line with the New York Fed's unique role in the Federal Reserve System with wholesale payments in both domestic payments and foreign exchange, the New York Innovation Center is researching technical aspects related to wholesale CBDCs.\n\nIn addition to CBDC, the broader digital assets landscape, which includes stablecoins – cryptoassets that are backed by assets such as U.S. Treasury securities to stabilize their value – and unbacked cryptoassets, has grown significantly in recent years, and continues to evolve quickly. While many digital-asset-related activities fall within existing U.S. laws and regulations, the rapid evolution and adoption of digital assets highlight unique risks that warrant a more comprehensive and aligned approach by agencies across the U.S. government with different regulatory remits. The Federal Reserve, as an independent central bank, is only one part of the puzzle. Many of these other stakeholders across the U.S. government, such as the Treasury Department, market regulators, and federal banking supervisors, will be involved in providing guidance and guardrails to the financial system as the universe of digital assets continues to evolve.7\n\nIn the current environment of rapid technological change, it is crucial that innovation proceeds responsibly in order to safeguard the stability of the financial system. To that end, on March 9 of this year, President Biden issued an Executive Order on Ensuring Responsible Development of Digital Assets.8 This executive order outlined the first whole-of-government approach to addressing the risks and harnessing the potential benefits of digital assets and their underlying technology. In response, over the past six months, agencies across the government have worked together to develop frameworks and policy recommendations that advance the six key priorities identified in the executive order: consumer and investor protection; promoting financial stability; countering illicit finance; U.S. leadership in the global financial system and economic competitiveness; financial inclusion; and responsible innovation. The executive order will be a catalyst to increased coordination among U.S. regulators. Last month, as part of the approach outlined in the executive order, the Financial Stability Oversight Council, or FSOC, released a report that considers the financial stability risks of crypto assets. In the report, the FSOC noted that financial stability risks of crypto assets are drawn mainly from interconnections with the traditional financial system. The report identified vulnerabilities unique to crypto assets and recommended approaches to regulation and supervision in the future, highlighting the importance of ongoing research to improve our understanding of risks and opportunities, and planning to ensure we can continue to achieve our mission including supporting safety and stability in this evolving domain. The Fed also collaborates with other U.S. regulators on the topic of stability risks arising from digital assets, and coordinates with international authorities through forums including the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) and the Financial Stability Board.\n\nFinally, a third key dimension through which innovation – both broadly and in digital assets specifically – impacts the mission of the Federal Reserve is in relation to the payments system. On a daily basis, roughly $4 trillion of transactions are settled through FedWire, the real-time gross settlement (RTGS) service offered by the Federal Reserve.9 FedNow, targeted for release in mid-2023, represents a key innovation to modernize the future of payments. This new cloud-based RTGS system will enable consumers and businesses to send payments instantly through their depository institutions on a 24-hour, 365-days-a-year basis.\n\nOf course, payments do not always stay within national borders. The Federal Reserve is an active participant in international efforts regarding payment systems via the Committee on Payments and Markets Infrastructures (CPMI) at the BIS. The CMPI collects best practices and issues recommendations for managing payments, clearing, and settlement risk across financial market utilities. At present, a high-priority area of study for the CMPI is coordinating the development of 24/365 RTGS systems – like FedNow – globally. Innovation in cross-border settlements will reduce liquidity outlays and settlement risks, leading in turn to cheaper cross-border payments.\n\nThe New York Innovation Center and Project Cedar\n\nIn the remainder of my remarks, I'd like to focus on an example of ongoing innovation research that is currently underway at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. To further enhance our ability to contribute to financial innovation globally, the New York Innovation Center, or NYIC, was established in 2021. The NYIC bridges the worlds of finance, technology, and innovation. Through technical research, experimentation, and prototyping, our team generates insights into high-value central-bank-related opportunities, enabling stakeholders and the central bank community to enhance the functioning of the global financial system.\n\nProject Cedar is the inaugural project of the NYIC and represents the first stage of the NYIC's research efforts into CBDCs, the NYIC's biggest focus area in 2022. A goal of the NYIC is to progress CBDC research with an objective of defining a technical design for a CBDC addressing the wholesale market in the Federal Reserve context.\n\nAfter taking a close look at the foreign exchange space with economists, traders, and market analysts, the NYIC team zeroed in on settlement of foreign exchange spot transactions as a first area of investigation. FX spot transactions are critical in the context of cross-border payments, and serve as a building block for longer, more complex transactions. Traditionally, settlement generally takes two days after a transaction, which leaves some room for improvement. By demonstrating improvements in settlement of FX spot transactions, the NYIC could address settlement time and risk, which would have implications to speed and access for the broader cross-border market. We are not the first to address this topic, of course, but the NYIC wanted to investigate it from the perspective of the Federal Reserve, through the lens of a wholesale CBDC.\n\nThe NYIC developed a hypothesis that there is a distributed ledger technology solution for wholesale FX settlement that results in instant and atomic settlement in which a wholesale CBDC is the settlement asset. NYIC then built a working prototype and tested it. Results from the experiment indicated that settlement could occur in fewer than 10 seconds on average and that horizontal scaling was possible. This indicates that a modular ecosystem of ledgers has the potential for continued scalability, and that distributed ledger technology could enable settlement times well below the current industry standard of two days, with the added guarantee of atomic settlement.\n\nConclusion\n\nInnovations in digital assets have the potential to impact financial markets in many fundamental ways; it is essential to understand these developments and the impact they may have on the mission of the Federal Reserve. Through ongoing investment in research, experimentation, and collaboration, leveraging the full potential of digital assets is possible. I look forward to building on the successes of Project Cedar and similar efforts."

        "content": "Good morning, good afternoon, or good evening depending on whether you are at the event in person or logging in remotely from another part of the world. I am very grateful to Dr. Blaise Ijebor for inviting me to present today at the Central Bank of Nigeria's Second National Risk Management Conference.1\n\nLet me start by saying that the views I will express are my own and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York or the Federal Reserve System.\n\nToday, I'd like to share my perspectives, experiences, and learnings to reflect on how we can use risk management to enable us to achieve our goals even in the face of surprises and challenges. The main point I want to make is that, by integrating risk management into plans, decisions, and actions, we can succeed over a wider range of possible futures, not just the future we expect (or hope for).\n\nI'll initially highlight a few potential misunderstandings that might prevent us from getting the most out of risk management.\n\nThe first is that risk management is mainly a way to stop bad things from happening. Of course, risk management should help us reduce the frequency and size of negative events and then recover more quickly and effectively when negative events occur.\n\nBut, risk management, in my view, should also help the right things happen by giving us tools to work more effectively.2 Innovation is an essential tool to manage risks, because not changing can be riskier than changing. For example, an incredibly powerful risk management activity is to transform a slow, manual process that often fails into a fast, efficient, automated process that can self-correct when there is a problem. Clearly, it is just as important to understand the risk of not doing something as it is to understand the risk of doing something. And, when we understand our risk appetite and our risks, we can comfortably conduct controlled experiments, learn faster, and innovate. We're no longer driving in the dark; we're getting where we want to go with headlights on, and we can stay inside the guardrails and not skid off the road.\n\nSecond, risk management could be misunderstood as primarily the responsibility of risk management specialists. Actually, effective risk management is a way for everyone in an organization to help things go right. From the economic analysts to the cash processing operators to the software engineers, we can make better plans, decisions, and actions when we are prepared for change and have the capacity to adapt to surprises. So, most of the risk management that occurs in an organization will be done by people who don't have the word \"risk\" in their job title.\n\nAnd third, risk management could be misinterpreted as an attempt to create a contingency plan for every possible thing that could go wrong. It is important to prepare by scanning the horizon, exploring the range of possible futures, and understanding how those futures could help or impair desired outcomes. We do want to invest in effective responses to key scenarios.\n\nHowever, no organization has the resources to prepare for all possibilities. And, no matter how creative we are, we still can't imagine every one of them anyway. As it is said, \"Things that have never happened before happen all the time.\"3 So, effective risk management is more than planning. It is creating the capacity to adapt to and recover from unexpected shocks, which is what we often mean when we talk about resilience.4\n\nTo me, successful risk management is as much about culture as it is about structure. My version of the saying \"culture eats strategy for breakfast\" is: \"culture eats structure for breakfast.\"5 Practically speaking, we have policies, procedures, and rules to help us make decisions. But, much of the time, decisions aren't clear, and it is organizational culture that shapes the tradeoffs that we make and the actions we take. We want to define and chart a course toward our desired culture, so that individual decisions reflect the interests of the organization and the intent of the rules.6\n\nTo me, there are four central aspects of culture that support effective risk management: learning, listening, helping, and speaking up.7 In a learning culture, we think about and plan for what might happen. And, we learn from experience, what went well and what didn't, so we can improve for next time. In a listening culture, we seek advice, appreciate a fresh perspective, and are open to new ideas and feedback so we can improve. In a helping culture, we work together across the organization, building on each other's strengths, and helping when we have an opportunity. And, in a speaking up culture, we let our colleagues know when we see a problem or after something goes wrong so that we can get started fixing it.\n\nRisk management is a creative, social process. It is a way of thinking, doing, and interacting. To bring it to life, we need to work together across the organization, staying continuously curious about the changing risk landscape and possible futures.\n\nRisk Management During the Pandemic Crisis\n\nIn mid-March of 2020, the health crisis was especially severe in the New York City area, where our main office is located and where most of our employees live. To protect the health and safety of all employees and to continue our critical activities, we had to adapt to a situation none of us had ever seen before.\n\nThat started with changing how we worked. To reduce the health risks to our employees, we only allowed staff who had to be onsite to remain in the office, while everyone else worked remotely. For example, some open market operations, cash services, and technology support activities could only be conducted on location. To protect onsite staff, we implemented a range of protective measures including masking, social distancing, quarantine requirements, and staggered work schedules.\n\nAnother priority was helping employees cope with added responsibilities like lack of childcare and elder care, so we provided as much flexibility as possible to staff to manage their time.\n\nOn the technology side, we had an immediate need for teleconferencing bandwidth to support remote work. While not all technology worked perfectly right away, our technology providers quickly adjusted. With most staff working from home, a new risk we identified and addressed was the failure of home internet connectivity. Without going into detail, we've mitigated this risk, and successfully worked remotely through subsequent severe weather events.\n\nOur business continuity planning and testing helped us navigate the early days of the pandemic, but this event was far more extreme than anything we had practiced, and we learned many lessons. I highly recommend a recent paper by the Consultative Group on Risk Management that brings together insights from central bank experiences managing business continuity risks during the pandemic.8\n\nAt the New York Fed, as we were changing where and how we worked, the pandemic's impacts spread to the economy and financial markets. From March to May 2020, gross domestic product in the United States fell by nearly one third (on an annualized basis) and employment dropped by 22 million. Equity markets sold off, and credit spreads surged to levels not seen since the 2008 Global Financial Crisis. Financial market functioning deteriorated with significant declines in liquidity; and, in the municipal bond market, underwriters cancelled new deals and municipal borrowing stopped.\n\nIn response to these conditions, the Federal Reserve System took action to support a strong economy and a stable financial system.9 As part of this effort, pandemic crisis facilities were established to restore market functioning and support the flow of credit to households, businesses, and state and local governments.10 The New York Fed was responsible for operating five of these facilities.11\n\nRisk management was a cornerstone of that work, and we used our three-lines-of-defense risk model to build strong risk management into facility operations.12 The first line of defense, the facilities teams, were responsible for understanding and managing their risks. The second line – my group (the Risk Group), the Compliance Function, and others – was responsible for independent assessment and oversight of those risks. And, the third line – our Internal Audit Group – was responsible for fully independent assurance.\n\nJust to give a bit more detail about the second line of defense, we are responsible for designing and delivering a set of products, services, and relationships that lead to better plans, decisions, and actions that help the Bank thrive in any environment. We serve as trusted risk advisors, independent risk experts, and enterprise risk guardians.13\n\nIn our guardian role, we identify material risk issues and make sure that risks are understood, communicated, and addressed. We provide the stakeholders who are ultimately responsible for organizational success with a clear picture of the Bank's risk profile. In our expert role, we provide independent risk assessments, actionable risk insights, standards, and tools to help businesses manage risks. And, in our advisor role, we develop viable ideas and practical options to improve processes, controls, and business outcomes.\n\nSo, as the facilities were created, staff in my group joined the facilities teams to connect with the real-time information flow and decision making. That's because we knew that the traditional cadence of monthly meetings wouldn't work when decisions were being made by the hour or minute. And to be relevant, we had to accelerate to the pace of our advice to the speed of this environment. Through this close engagement, from Day One, we could see where controls needed further development, and we helped prioritize what was most essential.\n\nWe also redesigned our risk management toolkit to see and address risks in real time. We started by working with the facilities teams to identify and triage the most significant risks. We partnered with experts across the Bank to cover the spectrum of financial and non-financial risks.\n\nOnce the facilities were operating, we created facility risk registers to further identify risks, prioritize responses, and track mitigation. We also looked for thematic risks across facilities that we could address in common ways. For several facilities, we more deeply analyzed end-to-end processes to further strengthen controls.\n\nBecause of our experiences during the Global Financial Crisis, we knew that facilities themselves and their risks had a lifecycle from design, to standup, to steady state operation, and finally to wind down and closure. So, this helped us better anticipate and manage the risks of the pandemic crisis facilities.\n\nVendor risk was a key area of focus for us, because vendors had critical roles in the operation of the crisis facilities including investment management and securities settlement. We had to create a fast and rigorous vendor onboarding and monitoring process, while at the same time recognizing new risks the vendors themselves faced across continuity, people, process, and technology. We made significant changes to our vendor management approach, many of which are serving us well today.\n\nDuring the pandemic, we've adapted to a fast-changing, uncertain environment. We've seen how risk management has helped us respond effectively, used lessons learned to improve our approaches, and identified areas where we want to further develop our capabilities.\n\nBuilding and Strengthening Organizational Resilience\n\nA foundational component of resilience is that an organization can operate as a coordinated system in order to successfully adapt to changes in the environment. What does that take? Let's reframe the core components of operational risk – people, process, and technology – using a resilience lens.15\n\nPeople are resilient when they are ready and able to adapt to change by adjusting priorities, replanning, and refocusing activities and resources. Resilient staff work with shared purpose across organizational siloes, operate effectively in environments of uncertainty and ambiguity, and are empowered to develop creative and innovative solutions.\n\nProcesses are resilient when they are robust to changing internal and external conditions, including issues with suppliers, inputs, processing, outputs, and customers. Resilient processes provide clear signals of their operating state, have the right level of automation, and continue to function under stress.\n\nTechnology systems are resilient when they are flexible, robust, and able to be recovered rapidly.\n\nAnd then the overall organization is resilient when these three components – people, process, and technology – work together effectively. Resilient processes and technology should support the ability of the staff to successfully manage in normal times and during disruptions.\n\nWhat are some concrete steps to strengthen resilience? In terms of processes, an important first step is to identify the processes that are critical to achieving organizational objectives. Gains are often found through simplification and automation of manual processes, especially when combined with performance metrics and risk metrics that provide real-time measures of process health.16\n\nFor technology, modernizing technology and software development processes can be a key area of focus. One goal is to create a fast, robust, and secure software development lifecycle that stays current by design (perhaps enabled through the agile development methodology and cloud platforms). And, approaches like red-teaming, threat hunting, and external benchmarking can provide insight into cyber resilience strengths and areas to improve.17\n\nOn the people side, does the current organizational culture help people successfully adapt to rapidly changing environment? Do staff have the skills that are needed to achieve organizational objectives today and in the future? These are important questions to explore and potential priority areas to address if there are mismatches.\n\nFinal Thoughts"

        "content": "Thank you for that kind introduction. I'm so pleased to be here—especially at this time of year, when the autumn colors light up the region. In fact, my wife and I have fallen in love with this area—so much so, that we are now splitting our time between Columbia County and New York City.\n\nOf course, I'm not just here as your neighbor. Part of my job as president of the New York Fed—one of the best parts—is to meet with business and community leaders from across the Federal Reserve's Second District. This gives me the opportunity to see and hear the challenges they face.\n\nAnd throughout the Second District—which includes New York State, Northern New Jersey, Southwestern Connecticut, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands—the issues I hear about consistently have to do with labor shortages and the skills gap. Employers can't find enough skilled workers—and workers can't obtain the skills they need to move up the economic ladder.\n\nBefore I go any further, I will give the standard Fed disclaimer that the views I express today are mine alone, and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Open Market Committee or others in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nThe Struggle to Fill Jobs\n\nIn the current environment, filling jobs can be a challenge. Employers—including those here in Columbia and Greene Counties—are facing significant worker shortages.  Many are struggling to hire people, especially at the entry level—in construction, nursing, and manufacturing.\n\nThe skills gap is a big obstacle. In 2020, more than half of available job seekers in Columbia and Greene Counties had a high school diploma or less, and only a quarter had an associate degree or higher.1 Employers, especially those in trucking and the trades, grapple with developing a pipeline of skilled workers.\n\nAn aging population is another issue. Over the past 20 years, the size of the workforce here has declined as the population has stagnated.  Residents here are older—the median age is late 40s, as opposed to late 30s for all of New York State.  In some cases, residents don't need more training—they need retraining so they can obtain new jobs.\n\nThe Jenga Tower\n\nWhenever I talk about economic prosperity, I like to use the analogy of a Jenga tower: Each piece is critical to the stability of the whole. Take one piece out, and the tower becomes unstable. Take the wrong piece out, and the whole tower can collapse.\n\nOur Jenga tower encompasses a whole host of important pieces. Job training is one. Workers need skills that employers are looking for, and job training needs to be accessible.\n\nTransportation is another. Employees need dependable transportation to get to training programs—and to their jobs.\n\nAnd broadband is sorely needed in many households. I can't tell you how many people said, \"Good luck getting broadband,\" when I told them I was buying a home in Columbia County. It's a problem that plagues rural communities throughout the Second District.2\n\nInvesting in businesses and innovation is also an important piece of our tower. Businesses need resources to innovate so they can grow and prosper—and that, in turn, benefits entire communities.\n\nAll of you here today—representing employers, schools, nonprofits, funders, and community organizations—are key to our tower's foundation. You are what makes our tower strong.\n\nWorkforce Development Components\n\nHow do we reinforce our tower? There have been a number of initiatives—and quite a bit of research—regarding workforce development throughout the Federal Reserve System. This includes a three-volume book called Investing in America's Workforce,3 which highlights the ways investments can overcome systemic barriers to employment. While there is no one-size-fits-all approach, there are many promising efforts to learn from.\n\nThe role of community colleges cannot be overstated. A report released shortly after I came to the New York Fed showed that the typical New York State community college engages with more than 100 local employers, spanning every industry sector.4\n\nMore recently, the New York Fed hosted an event that explored ways to advance economic prosperity in rural areas.5 Many great insights were shared, including a framework for workforce development programs that contained four principles:\n\n1) fashioning a strategy around a community's assets;\n\n2) designing programs that are adaptable;\n\n3) including traditionally marginalized groups in decision-making; and\n\n4) bringing together community, business, and government leaders—like you are doing today.\n\nConclusion\n\nDeveloping career-building programs that meet the needs of local employers and are accessible to job seekers is critical to bridging the skills gap. Collaboration is a key component of any successful program. By joining together, we can advance the economic resilience of rural areas like Columbia and Greene Counties—and strengthen our Jenga tower."

        "speaker": "John C. Williams",
        "url": "https://www.newyorkfed.org/newsevents/speeches/2022/wil221003",
        "content": "Thank you for that kind introduction. I'm so pleased to join you today. As business leaders and business owners, you are integral to the U.S. economy. So, it's fitting for me to have this opportunity to talk to you about the state of our economy, as well as a topic that's on everyone's mind: inflation.\n\nFrom Main Street to Wall Street—and to Liberty Street, where the New York Fed is headquartered—inflation is the No. 1 concern. Clearly, inflation is far too high, and persistently high inflation undermines the ability of our economy to perform at its full potential. The Federal Reserve has two goals: maximum employment and price stability. History teaches us that price stability is essential to achieving maximum employment over the longer term. We at the Federal Reserve are therefore taking strong actions to restore price stability as a foundation for sustained economic prosperity.\n\nToday I will talk about why high inflation broke out last year, how it has evolved, and why I am confident that we are taking the necessary actions to bring inflation down.\n\nBut before I do, I will give the standard Fed disclaimer that the views I express today are mine alone, and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) or others in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nInflation's Disparate Impact\n\nThe FOMC's price stability objective is for inflation to average 2 percent over the longer run, as measured by the personal consumption expenditures price index.1 In the three decades before the pandemic, this inflation rate averaged almost exactly 2 percent. But that changed dramatically last year, when inflation suddenly soared. It has reached four-decade highs in recent months, and now stands at over 6 percent.\n\nHigh inflation spares no one. It makes it more expensive to feed families, heat homes, and pay rents. While everyone feels the pain, not everyone is affected equally. Those who can least afford the essentials—like food, gas, and housing—suffer the most.\n\nInflation also has a disparate impact across ethnic groups. Economists at the New York Fed found that since 2021, Black and Hispanic households have faced higher inflation than the national average—and Hispanic families have been affected the most.2 This is largely because on average, Hispanic households spend a larger share of their budgets on items most affected by the recent high inflation.\n\nThe Inflation Onion\n\nThe sources of high inflation are many and complex, and they stretch across the globe. Nearly all economies are experiencing unusually high rates of inflation. To better understand how that happened and what it portends, it is useful to think of inflation in terms of three distinct layers of an onion.\n\nIn this analogy, the onion's outer layer consists of prices of globally traded commodities—such as lumber, steel, grains, and oil. They have experienced a surge in demand as the global economy has rebounded from the pandemic downturn. In addition, Russia's war on Ukraine and the resulting actions have caused energy prices to soar. These higher costs get passed on as higher prices for consumers. I am sure everyone in this room has been forced to manage skyrocketing costs on important supplies over the past two years.\n\nThe middle layer of the inflation onion is made up of products—especially durable goods like appliances, furniture, and autos—that have been affected by severe supply-chain disruptions. Many of you have also had first-hand experience with the impact of shutdowns and supply-chain bottlenecks. There haven't been enough inputs to produce products, and not enough products to sell—all at a time when demand has been sky-high. Many of you have also had customers lining up at your doors—but not enough products in stock.\n\nThis imbalance between supply and demand has contributed to large price increases. To give some examples, prices for furniture rose over 13 percent last year, new cars were up nearly 12 percent, and used vehicles skyrocketed an astounding 50 percent.\n\nThe innermost layer of the onion consists of underlying inflation, which reflects the overall balance between supply and demand in the economy. Therein lies our biggest challenge. Prices for services have been rising at a fast rate as the economy has recovered from the recession. In particular, rents for new leases have climbed rapidly. And labor shortages are everywhere, leading to higher labor costs. Indeed, inflation pressures have become broad-based across a wide range of goods and services.\n\nGood News and Bad News\n\nWhat does the future hold? I will start with some good news. First, prices of many commodities, such as lumber, are in retreat. Absent further supply disruptions, I expect slowing global growth, in part reflecting tighter monetary policy here and abroad, will continue to reduce demand for these products. This should put downward pressure on commodity prices and help ease inflationary pressures, especially for goods and services that are heavily reliant on commodity inputs.\n\nSecond, we have seen significant improvement in global supply chains, and I expect this to continue. At the New York Fed, economists have developed the Global Supply Chain Pressure Index, which measures the extent of global supply-chain disruptions by summarizing a variety of data, including reported delivery lags and the costs of transporting goods. The Index soared to unprecedented levels late last year but has now reversed about two thirds of its rise. Although significant supply-chain problems are still affecting some industries, such as autos, improvements in supply should help ease supply-demand imbalances and result in lower prices for affected products. 3\n\nUnfortunately, that's it for the good news on inflation. The fact is, lower commodity prices and receding supply-chain issues will not be enough by themselves to bring inflation back to our 2 percent objective. The demand for durable goods remains very high—beyond what can be produced and brought to market, even with improved supply chains. And the demand for labor and services is far outstripping available supply. This is resulting in broad-based inflation, which will take longer to bring down.\n\nTaking Strong Actions\n\nTo help rein in demand to levels consistent with supply—and therefore bring inflation down—monetary policy needs to do its job. The FOMC is taking strong actions toward that end.\n\nAt its most recent meeting, in September, the FOMC raised the target range of the federal funds rate to 3 to 3-1/4 percent, its fifth consecutive increase.4 And the Committee said it anticipates that ongoing increases will be appropriate. According to the median view from the FOMC's Summary of Economic Projections, the projected appropriate level of the federal funds rate at the end of next year is 4.6 percent.5 In addition, the FOMC continues to reduce its holdings of Treasury securities and agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities.6\n\nImportantly, the Fed is not alone. Many other central banks are also taking steps to reduce inflation. Since many sources of inflation are global, these actions should speed the process of restoring balance to global supply and demand, alleviate supply-chain issues, and reduce inflationary pressures.\n\nThere are other factors in our favor. First, the Fed's commitment to achieve and sustain 2 percent inflation is a now bedrock principle. This was not always the case. It's only been 10 years since the FOMC defined 2 percent inflation as its longer-run goal.7 This transparency about our objectives provides a \"North Star\" for policy decisions and communications. It likewise improves the public's understanding of our goals and actions.\n\nIt has also served us well in keeping longer-term inflation expectations well anchored. For example, the most recent Survey of Consumer Expectations shows that consumers expect inflation to decline over the next three years.8 And market-based measures of inflation expectations have also remained well anchored. This anchoring of longer-term expectations is critical to keeping high inflation from becoming embedded in the psychology of consumers and businesses, which we know from the past is costly to undo.\n\nEconomic Outlook\n\nSo, what does tighter monetary policy mean for the economy? We are already seeing some of the effects. Broad measures of financial conditions, including borrowing and mortgage rates and equity prices, have become significantly less supportive of spending. This has led to a decline in activity in the housing market and signs of slowing in consumer and business investment spending. As this continues, I expect real GDP to be close to flat this year and to grow modestly in 2023.\n\nAs a result of slowing growth, I anticipate the unemployment rate will rise from its current level of 3.7 percent to around 4-1/2 percent by the end of 2023.\n\nAnd with regard to inflation, I expect the combination of cooling global demand and steady improvements in supply to result in falling rates of inflation for goods that rely heavily on commodities, as well as for those that have been most affected by supply-chain bottlenecks. These factors should contribute to inflation declining to about 3 percent next year.\n\nBringing down underlying inflation—the inner layer of the inflation onion—will take longer, but with monetary policy helping to restore balance between demand and supply, I see inflation moving close to our 2 percent goal in the next few years.\n\nConclusion\n\nTighter monetary policy has begun to cool demand and reduce inflationary pressures, but our job is not yet done. It will take time, but I am fully confident we will return to a sustained period of price stability."

        "title": "The Ample Reserves Framework and Balance Sheet Reduction: Perspective from the Open Market Desk",
        "date": "Sep 8, 2022",
        "speaker": "Patricia Zobel",
        "url": "https://www.newyorkfed.org/newsevents/speeches/2022/zob220908",
        "content": "Thank you, Neil, for the kind introduction, and to the Cato Institute for the opportunity to share some thoughts on the Federal Reserve's operating system.  In 2019, the Federal Open Market Committee (Committee) formally adopted an ample reserves framework to implement monetary policy.  In this system, an ample supply of reserves ensures that administered rates exert control over short-term interest rates.1  The Federal Reserve had been effectively implementing policy with administered rates since reserves first became abundant during the Global Financial Crisis.  As such, the Committee's decision reflected not only significant study and deliberation, but also years of practical experience.  In the short time since the formal adoption of this framework, there have been extraordinary changes in the operating environment, providing an even wider range of economic and financial conditions in which to view its performance.  Now is a good time to reflect on those experiences and outline some key issues ahead.\n\nToday, I would like to share my perspective on how the ample reserves framework's flexibility has helped provide effective interest rate control.  I will also discuss how it should facilitate adjustments in money markets as the Committee reduces the size of the Federal Reserve's balance sheet.  These reflections are based on my experience working on the Open Market Desk (the Desk) at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York for many years, most recently serving as Deputy Manager of the System Open Market Account (SOMA) and now as SOMA Manager pro tem.\n\nI hope this will provide helpful context for the discussion that the other speakers will have after their remarks.  While I expect they will cover a broader range of issues in their discussion, my focus today is on monetary policy implementation.\n\nBefore going further, I would like to note that these remarks reflect my views and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York or the Federal Reserve System.\n\nImplementing monetary policy with ample reserves\n\nThe Committee's Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy affirms that the Committee's primary means of adjusting the stance of monetary policy is through changes in its target range for the federal funds rate.2  In January 2019, the Committee communicated its intention to implement monetary policy in a regime in which an ample supply of reserves ensures that control over the level of the federal funds rate and other short-term interest rates is exercised primarily through the setting of the Federal Reserve's administered rates. \n\nThe Federal Reserve's two main administered rates—the interest on reserve balances (IORB) rate and the offering rate on the overnight repurchase agreement (ON RRP) facility—provide strong incentives in money markets.  IORB sets a benchmark against which banks evaluate their lending and borrowing opportunities.  The ON RRP facility provides a soft floor for the overnight money market activity of a broader set of market participants.  It supports control of the federal funds rate, in particular when the supply of reserves is abundant and the availability of alternative investments, like Treasury bills, is relatively limited.  The ON RRP facility increases bargaining power for its counterparties and, when needed, broadens the holders of Federal Reserve liabilities beyond banks, easing pressures on bank balance sheets that may result from elevated reserve levels.\n\nIn 2021, the Committee made an important addition to the ample reserves framework by establishing a new backstop tool—the standing repo facility (SRF)—to support effective policy implementation.  The SRF was established to complement the discount window and serve as a liquidity backstop to make the framework more resilient to occasional disturbances that can occur in money markets.3  The SRF is available as a backstop to address upward pressures in the repo market that can spill over to the federal funds market and, when needed, to flexibly add reserves.4\n\nThe ample reserves framework adjusts to changing environments\n\nThe success of any implementation framework depends on its ability to work within the money market ecosystem to achieve interest rate control.  For many years, the federal funds rate has remained within the Committee's target range on almost all occasions and has been responsive to changes in the Federal Reserve's administered rates, including when the Committee raised its target range at each of its last four meetings.5  The federal funds rate has also remained highly correlated with other overnight interest rates—a hallmark of effective interest rate control.  I would like to highlight three areas where the framework's flexibility helps it adapt through different environments and meet the Committee's interest rate control objectives.\n\nFirst, the framework aims to supply reserves in amounts demanded by banks to meet their liquidity needs.  Following the Global Financial Crisis, banks fundamentally altered their liquidity management practices.  The largest banks, in particular, now hold much larger liquidity buffers to meet not only daily payment flows, but also potential outflows in stressed market environments.  Although these banks can hold a range of high-quality liquid assets to meet their liquidity needs, reserves are the safest and most liquid asset and are immediately available to meet outflows.  The evolution of liquidity management practices in the U.S. banking system was evident during the COVID-19 pandemic, when banks, having stronger liquidity positions and less reliance on fragile funding, were able to meet the extraordinary liquidity demands of U.S. households and businesses.6\n\nSupplying reserve balances in quantities demanded promotes interest rate control by ensuring that administered rates continue to provide strong incentives in money markets.  A feature of banks' new liquidity management practices is that the demand for reserves can vary over time with shifts in their balance sheets and in different market environments.  Additionally, mechanisms, such as direct trading between banks, that can quickly redistribute reserves through the banking system in response to payment shocks have become less favored by many institutions. These dynamics suggest that maintaining ample conditions requires supplying reserves somewhat in excess of the aggregate amount that individual banks would want to hold on a typical day.\n\nSecond, the ample reserves framework allows for more variability in the Federal Reserve's other liabilities, which helps maintain interest rate control even when shifts in these liabilities change the supply of reserves.7  The Federal Reserve offers accounts to certain official sector institutions.  Balances in these accounts, and the ability to change them quickly, provide important liquidity management benefits to these institutions.  In particular, the U.S. Treasury seeks to maintain a balance in its Treasury General Account (TGA) sufficient to cover at least one week of cash needs.8  The size of the TGA can also vary significantly due to changes in tax payments and fiscal flows, and the ample reserves framework can accommodate such swings without active management of the supply of reserves.9\n\nThird, and importantly, the ample reserves framework maintains interest rate control while accommodating policies that meaningfully expand the Federal Reserve's balance sheet.  Asset purchases employed to foster accommodative financial conditions are now a standard tool in the Committee's toolkit and support attainment of its dual mandate objectives when the federal funds rate is constrained by its effective lower bound.  In exceptional circumstances, asset purchases can also be used to address severe strains in market functioning that may disrupt the flow of credit to the U.S. economy, as was the case at the onset of the pandemic in 2020.10  And, in stressed market environments, liquidity provision through the discount window, dollar liquidity swap lines, or other facilities may also expand the Federal Reserve's balance sheet.\n\nThe Committee's ample reserves framework has been resilient during the extraordinary period associated with the pandemic—providing effective interest rate control during a time when the size of the Federal Reserve's balance sheet grew from $4 trillion to nearly $9 trillion.  In the early part of the pandemic, repo operations and asset purchases, in concert with liquidity providing operations, helped meet the unprecedented demand for funding and market liquidity across the financial system, and IORB and the ON RRP facility worked together to support interest rate control. The framework also facilitated an expansion of the TGA, so the U.S. Treasury could prepare for large outflows related to the pandemic response.  Over time, as the balance sheet continued to grow and the supply of Treasury bills fell, the ON RRP facility's expansion also broadened the base of Federal Reserve liability holders beyond the banking system.\n\nNonetheless, this substantial expansion in Federal Reserve liabilities since the onset of the pandemic is not a permanent feature of the framework, but a result of balance sheet policies employed to support the economy during a time of exceptional stress in financial markets and a deep economic downturn.  It is the path to a smaller balance sheet that I would like to discuss next, and how the ample reserves framework can flexibly support interest rate control during this transition.\n\nIncentives provided by the framework as the balance sheet declines\n\nEarly this year, the Committee issued principles for significantly reducing the size of the Federal Reserve's balance sheet as part of its plans to tighten the stance of monetary policy.11  In June, the Committee commenced runoff, directing the Desk to begin allowing securities in the SOMA to mature without reinvestment up to monthly redemption caps.  An increase in the pace of balance sheet reduction is underway, with monthly redemptions of up to $60 billion of Treasury securities and $35 billion of agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS).12  The decline in SOMA securities holdings can be tracked through public data sources, as described in a post published this morning by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.13\n\nThe Federal Reserve has prior experience reducing the size of its balance sheet.  Between 2017 and 2019, the balance sheet shrank by $700 billion, and this runoff proceeded smoothly, during the period when reserves were ample.  Nonetheless, there are several differences between the current environment and our prior experience.  Compared with the prior period, the size of the Federal Reserve's balance sheet is considerably larger, and the pace of runoff will be faster.14  The composition of liabilities is also different.  ON RRP balances of around $2.2 trillion currently comprise about a quarter of the Federal Reserve's liabilities.  In contrast, when the prior period of balance sheet reduction began, ON RRP balances averaged less than $125 billion, accounting for only 3 percent of liabilities.15\n\nThis different composition of liabilities will necessitate a more complex set of adjustments in private-sector balance sheets than during the last episode.  However, just as use of the ON RRP facility expanded as the balance sheet grew, shifts in money markets that accompany balance sheet runoff, along with incentives provided by administered rates, should result in ON RRP balances declining from currently elevated levels over time.\n\nThe relative pace at which reserves and ON RRP balances decline will depend on the actions of a broad range of money market participants.  These adjustments are likely to take time to play out given the size of the ON RRP facility.  While ON RRP balances may remain elevated in the near term, we are already observing modest shifts in money markets that should lead to smaller ON RRP balances over time.\n\nFirst, as a repo market investment, the ON RRP facility's balances are influenced by the relative yields on alternative short-term money market instruments.  Over the first half of the year, a declining supply of Treasury bills and uncertainty about the path of policy put downward pressure on short-term interest rates relative to the ON RRP rate, increasing demand for the facility. \n\nIn the coming months, the supply of safe, short-term investments may grow.  Net Treasury bill issuance has risen by about $250 billion from its trough in mid-July and is projected to rise modestly through the end of the year.  This has lifted Treasury bill yields relative to other money market interest rates from the very low levels observed this summer.  Over time, the faster pace of SOMA runoff may further expand the supply of alternative money market investments by increasing the amounts of Treasuries and agency MBS funded in private repo markets.\n\nIn addition, over time, greater certainty about the economic outlook and the path of policy may also moderate demand for the shortest tenor money market instruments.  The weighted-average maturity of government money market fund portfolios has fallen notably, from 31 days in March to 21 days in August, as many funds limited the interest rate risk associated with longer-term money market investments.  As the outlook becomes more clear, demand for very short-term investments like the ON RRP facility may decline.\n\nSecond, banks have an important role to play in the relative pace of decline in reserves and ON RRP balances, as they respond to the changing environment by shifting their liability management.  Year to date, reserves have declined by a little more than $900 billion, as many banks felt comfortable allowing their balances to fall from elevated levels.  And, with $3.1 trillion in reserves still in the system, most banks continue to maintain significant amounts of liquidity.  However, in the current environment of rapidly rising short-term interest rates and expanding loan demand, there are signs of greater competition for deposits and an increase in wholesale borrowing by some banks.16  For example, there has been fairly notable growth in demand for advances from Federal Home Loan Banks (FHLBs), and we have also seen a modest increase in borrowing by domestic banks in the federal funds market.17\n\nChanges in behavior by banks have broad influence across money markets.  Greater advance demand lifts FHLB borrowing in money markets and expands the supply of money market instruments.  So far this year, FHLB discount notes outstanding have increased by around $230 billion.18  Higher deposit rates can also make bank deposits more attractive relative to other money market investments, such as money market funds.  Over time, the increase in banks' wholesale borrowing, along with more competitive deposit rates, should help draw funds out of the ON RRP facility.\n\nOverall, as the Federal Reserve's balance sheet declines, I expect money market interest rates to rise relative to the ON RRP rate and for market participants to shift investments away from the facility over time, moderating the decline in reserves.  This will necessitate significant adjustments across a wide range of private-sector balance sheets.  The pace of these adjustments may occur at different rates across different institutions, depending on their responsiveness to changing conditions.  Staff at the Federal Reserve will closely monitor money markets to help assess whether these adjustments are proceeding smoothly.\n\nUltimately, the Committee has stated its intention to slow and then stop the decline in the Federal Reserve's balance sheet when reserve balances are somewhat above the level it judges to be consistent with ample reserves.  As I noted before, the level of reserves needed to maintain ample conditions is uncertain and varies over time.  Bank balance sheets have grown markedly since the beginning of the pandemic.  It is unclear the degree to which banks' reserve demand has also shifted—in the most recent Senior Financial Officer Survey, around 40 percent of banks suggested that the lowest level of reserves they would seek to maintain at rates near the IORB rate has increased since 2019, but nearly all of the remainder suggested that it stayed roughly the same.19  The Committee has indicated that money market conditions will be an important gauge of when reserves are approaching the level needed to maintain ample conditions, and will stop balance sheet runoff when reserves are somewhat above that level.  The experience of 2019 provides a useful guide to inform this assessment, and staff will monitor a broad range of money market indicators.  In addition, the SRF is now available, along with the discount window, to address shocks that could unexpectedly arise.  Ultimately, the Committee will manage securities holdings as needed to maintain ample conditions over time.20\n\nConclusion\n\nI appreciate the opportunity to share some reflections on the Federal Reserve's operating system and how it works within the money market ecosystem to achieve interest rate control through a broad range of money market environments.  In recent years, the ample reserves framework supported the Committee's ability to address the extraordinary shock from the pandemic.  I expect that it will support effective policy implementation as the balance sheet declines and continue to do so going forward."

        "content": "It's a pleasure to be here this morning at the University of Puerto Rico's beautiful Mayagüez campus. Thank you for that kind introduction.\n\nThis visit is part of the New York Fed's broader commitment to serving the diverse economies in the Federal Reserve's Second District, which—in addition to Puerto Rico—includes the U.S. Virgin Islands, New York State, northern New Jersey, and parts of Connecticut.\n\nHere in Puerto Rico, we supervise four commercial banking organizations that account for a large part of the deposit and lending activities on the island. We also provide cash services to depository institutions located in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. To take one example, the New York Fed coordinated an extensive effort to keep cash operations on the island functional following Hurricane Maria, ensuring adequate supply and meeting the demand for much-needed currency. We also study issues that affect the communities here, and our economists monitor economic conditions that inform our work.1\n\nI'll start by saying that I am so pleased that in many respects the Puerto Rican economy has recovered strongly from the hurricanes and the pandemic. Over the course of my visit, I've had the opportunity to hear firsthand from business, government, and community leaders about what is happening on the island. I met with government officials to discuss the Commonwealth’s economic plan and pandemic recovery. I also heard from executives about how the banking sector is faring. And I met with leaders of cooperativas to hear about what they're doing to help residents improve their access to credit and financial services. I took a short flight here from San Juan after a full day of engagements yesterday, and I spent the earlier part of this morning at the Aeronautical and Aerospace Institute of Puerto Rico, where I learned about this growing industry. Needless to say, the views from the ground and the air have been delightful.\n\nThe U.S. economy has experienced a tremendous rebound since the darkest days at the onset of the pandemic. But now, inflation is sky-high, and it is the number one danger to the overall health and stability of a well-functioning economy. The war in Ukraine and the recent lockdowns in China, on top of the ongoing supply challenges and demand shifts, have led to inflation rates we have not seen in four decades.\n\nThe priority for monetary policy is clear. The Federal Reserve is strongly committed to bringing inflation back down to our 2 percent longer-run goal. Price stability is absolutely essential for the economy to achieve its potential and sustain maximum employment over the medium term. I want to be clear: this is not an easy task. We must be resolute, and we cannot fall short.\n\nThis morning I'm going to talk about the uncertainty that high inflation poses to the economic outlook. I'll also share more about the labor market, both here in Puerto Rico and in the country more broadly. Then, I'll describe how the Federal Reserve's monetary policy actions are aimed at bringing down high inflation and restoring balance to the economy.\n\nBefore I continue, I should give the standard Fed disclaimer that the views I express today are mine alone, and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) or others in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nDual Mandate\n\nI know many of you here are studying economics, so you may be familiar with the Fed's dual mandate, or the two goals Congress has set for us: to promote both maximum employment and price stability.\n\nTo better understand what affects our mandate, we look at data—lots of it. We study everything from food and gas prices to retail sales and inventories, from labor costs and employment figures to semiconductor inventories and shipping expenses, and from the demand for goods and services to readings on public health.\n\nSlowing Growth\n\nSo, I'll start with the data that we are seeing as it relates to one half of our dual mandate: maximum employment. Although there are some signs that job growth has slowed in recent months, the labor market remains incredibly tight.\n\nDuring the first six months of this year, the economy added 2-3/4 million jobs, as businesses added staff to keep up with demand. The unemployment rate has been steady in the past few months near its historical low and was 3.6 percent in June. There are now far more job openings than people looking for work, and employers are still struggling to fill roles.\n\nThe economy experienced a rapid recovery from the pandemic last year, but I expect growth to slow considerably this year as the waning effects of fiscal stimulus, less favorable financial conditions, and slower growth abroad all weigh on our economy. Specifically, I currently expect real GDP growth in the United States to be below one percent this year, and then to rebound slightly to around 1-1/2 percent next year. With overall growth slowing to below its trend level, I expect the unemployment rate to move up from its very low current level, reaching somewhat above 4 percent next year.\n\nEconomic Conditions in Puerto Rico\n\nSimilar to the mainland, employment in Puerto Rico has rebounded quickly and strongly. Before the pandemic, the economy was just showing signs of emerging from a decade-and-a-half-long economic slump, during which both the population and employment had fallen by about 16 percent. Then, in the spring of 2020, employment tumbled another 14 percent, a far steeper decline than after Hurricane Maria in 2017. The subsequent turnaround has been astounding. Today, total employment is up 5 percent from pre-pandemic levels and is at a nine-year high, and the unemployment rate is at a record low.\n\nThe recovery has been broad-based, but we've seen particular strength in certain industries like professional business services, transportation and warehousing, and manufacturing. Tourism rebounded significantly too, with hotel occupancy rates reaching above 75 percent.\n\nSoaring Inflation\n\nAll in all, maximum employment has been achieved. But inflation remains unacceptably high, and we are far from the Fed's longer-run inflation goal of 2 percent.\n\nSince early last year, inflation has increased rapidly to levels many of you have not seen in your lifetimes. This experience is not unique to the United States; nearly all countries around the world are seeing rising costs, and central banks everywhere are working to contain them.\n\nThe rise in inflation has been extraordinary. In December 2020, overall inflation, as measured by the 12-month percent change in the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index, was 1.3 percent. In May of this year, it was 6.3 percent. A significant portion of this sharp rise reflects global increases in food and energy prices. But, even excluding those costs, the \"core\" inflation rate has increased from 1.5 percent a year and a half ago to 4.7 percent today.\n\nIt's more than just numbers. High inflation is incredibly harmful, especially to those that can least afford to shoulder the escalating costs of necessities like food, fuel, and housing. A recent study by New York Fed economists shows that high inflation hits Black and Hispanic Americans particularly hard.2 I am resolutely focused on restoring price stability, which is the foundation for a vibrant and healthy economy.\n\nThe Federal Reserve's Policy Actions\n\nWhile monetary policy actions won't directly reduce fuel or food costs, they will reduce overall inflationary pressures that arise in an economy where demand exceeds the available supply, like we are experiencing today. Higher interest rates reduce demand for goods and services. This is especially true for those sectors that are most sensitive to interest rates, such as durable goods and housing, where we have seen the greatest imbalances between demand and supply.\n\nTherefore, in support of our goals of achieving maximum employment and inflation at a rate of 2 percent over the longer run, the FOMC last month decided to raise the target range for the federal funds rate to 1‑1/2 to 1-3/4 percent and said it anticipates that ongoing increases in the target range will be appropriate.3 In addition, the Committee will continue reducing its holdings of Treasury securities and agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities, as described in the Plans for Reducing the Size of the Federal Reserve's Balance Sheet that were issued in May.4\n\nRaising the federal funds rate by 75 basis points was the largest single increase that the Federal Reserve has put forth since 1994. This decision was a critical step in moving monetary policy expeditiously away from the very accommodative stance that we put in place early in the pandemic.\n\nThe Committee is strongly committed to returning inflation to its 2 percent objective. In determining how quickly and how high to raise the rates in the future, we'll watch closely to see how the economy responds to tightening financial conditions and how inflation, inflation expectations, and the economic outlook evolve. As always, we will be data-dependent and nimble in our approach.\n\nWith tighter monetary policy in place, supply and demand will be brought back into balance, and inflation will return to our 2 percent longer-run goal. This may take some time and may well be a bumpy road.\n\nClosing\n\nI'll close with this: Inflation is far too high, and price stability is absolutely essential for a strong economy. We have the tools to get the job done and are one hundred percent committed to achieving our goals.\n\nThank you."

        "content": "Good afternoon. It is a pleasure to speak with you today at the New York Fed and Columbia SIPA workshop on monetary policy implementation. Many of you have attended these workshops in the past, and it is great to be together again to talk about issues of essential importance to policy implementation. It is also nice to see so many new participants, reflecting the broad interest and engagement in the topic of digital innovation.\n\nOver the past two days, we heard about faster forms of payments and new, digital forms of money—both private and public—and the effects they might have on money markets, policy implementation frameworks, and the international landscape.\n\nDigital innovation in money and payments is occurring for a reason—consumers, businesses, and financial market participants can benefit from around-the-clock, faster, and possibly programmable payments, both to reduce risk and to simplify financial transactions. Increased competition that results from new forms of money and payments could lower costs, increase service availability, and stimulate further innovation.\n\nHarnessing the benefits of innovation to consumers and businesses, while maintaining a safe and effective monetary system, may require new legislation, changes to regulations and to supervisory approaches, and modernization of traditional payment systems. The specifics of the appropriate initiatives will vary by country. These developments could have significant implications, including for financial stability, national security interests, and international cooperation.\n\nIn my role as manager of the Federal Reserve’s System Open Market Account, I am looking at these issues from the vantage point of monetary policy implementation. And in my remarks today, I will discuss some key issues that digital innovation in money and payments raises for policy implementation. In particular, I will examine how digital currencies might impact interest rate control and central bank balance sheets. In the spirit of this workshop, I won’t speak to the U.S. context specifically, but rather intend to discuss conceptual issues for policy implementation across jurisdictions. And, I won’t take a position on regulation, design choices, or a preference for a private or public solution.\n\nAs always, the views I express today are my own, and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York or the Federal Reserve System.1\n\nPrivate and Public Innovation\n\nI would like to start by describing two types of monetary instruments that could, in the future, be significant for policy implementation. In the private sector, a broad range of digital assets are emerging. A subset of those digital assets, known as stablecoins, could over time be used by consumers and businesses as money, if they serve as a safe means of payment, a store of value, and a unit of account.2 Some jurisdictions are considering bringing these kinds of instruments into the regulatory framework by requiring their issuers to become banks or other licensed entities.3 This could enhance the ability to safely integrate them into the payments system. It could also expand access to central bank accounts and services to new entrants, allowing the stablecoins to be backed by the most liquid and stable of assets: central bank reserves.\n\nTraditional commercial banks are also forming consortiums and partnering with digital innovation firms to increase their offerings of liabilities associated with digital activities, which might entail offering deposits to stablecoin issuers or even direct issuance of stablecoins.\n\nMany are also investing in distributed ledger activities that could transform their businesses. Preliminary analysis of the May 2022 Senior Financial Officer Survey suggests that most U.S. Global Systemically Important Banks (GSIBs) expect growth and development in these areas to be a medium or high priority over the next couple of years, and banks continue to explore these areas to see how they fit into their business strategies.4\n\nCentral banks are also innovating. Many are implementing new forms of payments or experimenting with central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) to prepare for the future. Currently, over 60 jurisdictions have launched faster payment services.5 In addition, central banks are building expertise and investing in technology to examine the potential applicability of CBDCs.6\n\nMonetary Policy Implementation in An Evolving Monetary System\n\nAs we consider the potential impact of this array of innovations, it is useful to start with a view into the current monetary system.\n\nFor decades, central bank reserve balances have been the safest and most liquid asset, at the core of a smoothly operating financial system. Most economies operate with two-tier monetary systems, in which households and businesses hold and make payments with cash and private money such as bank deposits, while only banks can hold and make payments with central bank reserves. Regulation, supervision, and deposit insurance help keep commercial bank money safe. In turn, deposits fund growth in the economy through loans to households and businesses. And central banks provide liquidity backstops to ensure that the banking system can meet its liquidity obligations to the public.\n\nMost policy implementation frameworks around the world are designed based on this two-tiered system. In these frameworks, central banks control the aggregate supply of their liabilities and the rates at which these liabilities are remunerated, which in turn influences the market interest rates that are transmitted to the economy.7\n\nIn considering the impact on implementation frameworks of an environment including private and public digital currencies, I would like to raise two key questions that central banks might consider. First, what are the implications for the tools of interest rate control? And second, how might the central bank balance sheet adapt?\n\nWhat are the implications for the central bank’s tools of interest rate control?\nMost central banks adjust and communicate their monetary policy stance through an interest rate target, and successful implementation entails supplying central bank liabilities in a manner that promotes conditions in money markets consistent with this stance. Central banks often rely on three pillars to control interest rates: the rates of remuneration on liabilities; the amount of liquidity supplied; and the provision of liquidity backstops.\n\nCertain design choices for the adoption and integration of digital currencies could alter how central banks use these pillars to control short-term interest rates.\n\nPillar 1: Rates of remuneration\nMany advanced economy central banks currently operate in some type of a floor system, in which the administered rate or rates paid on certain central bank liabilities are a core component of interest rate control.8 The development of new digital forms of currency raises questions about how to fit new liabilities into these remuneration frameworks.\n\nIn the case of a CBDC, a central bank can directly determine the instrument’s design and the return that its holder receives. If a CBDC is designed as a substitute for cash, for example, with relatively low maximum holding limits and zero interest, it may have a relatively limited impact on monetary policy implementation.\n\nOn the other hand, a zero-interest CBDC that could be easily employed for large-scale payments may have greater impact. For example, in higher-interest-rate environments, the opportunity cost of holding a CBDC with these design features could be high, resulting in it being used only for modest transactional purposes. Conversely, in lower-interest-rate environments, a zero-interest CBDC without holding limits could compete more strongly with existing money market instruments, and demand for a zero-interest CBDC in lower-interest-rate environments could be hard to predict.\n\nA zero-interest CBDC could also interact with policy rate setting. For central banks that seek to maintain a zero lower bound on interest rates, a zero-interest CBDC could benefit monetary policy implementation, as a widely available zero-interest instrument could help reinforce the lower bound. For other central banks, a zero-interest CBDC could constrain their ability to achieve negative rates.\n\nThe alternative that central banks might consider is an interest-bearing CBDC, for which the natural question is: what rate of interest should be paid? If a central bank decided to remunerate a CBDC, the incentives created within the monetary policy implementation framework would need to be considered. As a broad principle, research suggests that a CBDC should be structured with rates of remuneration at or below rates on central bank reserve balances, as a higher rate could create direct competition for deposits, risking disintermediation of the banking system.9 How much lower would need to be considered in the context of a specific central bank’s policy implementation framework, its policy rate target, and the incentives that an interest-bearing CBDC could create in money markets. Some have suggested tiered remuneration for different holding amounts in order to influence incentives and ensure appropriate integration into the monetary system.10\n\nIn the case of stablecoins, central banks don’t directly control interest that might be paid on these instruments. However, incentives created by remuneration policies could have important influences on the structure and relative demand for private and public digital currencies. Depending on how the regulatory and policy environment for financial innovation evolves, stablecoins could be issued by banks or other regulated entities that could have access to interest-bearing accounts at central banks. In this case, the rate of remuneration stablecoin issuers earn on their accounts might influence the rate paid to stablecoin holders, and the role of the instruments in the broader monetary ecosystem.11\n\nOf course, implementation issues are not the only important consideration for remuneration of digital currencies, but it should be one consideration. Choices about the remuneration of new central bank liabilities, like CBDC, and of the accounts of private stablecoin issuers, could have an important influence on the incentives created by monetary policy implementation frameworks. Given this, central banks should take a holistic approach to considering the impact of their remuneration policies on the ecosystem of both private and public currencies.\n\nPillar 2: Liquidity supply\nThis brings me to the second pillar of interest rate control: liquidity supply. In order for central banks’ remuneration rates to effectively achieve interest rate control, central banks supply reserves in appropriate quantities to achieve the interest rate target. In some environments, this requires central banks to forecast demand for liabilities and execute open market operations to supply needed reserves.\n\nIn recent years, the demand for many central bank liabilities has become higher and less predictable. However, most central banks have been operating with abundant liquidity surpluses, which has limited the impact of this reduced predictability on implementation.12 As central banks embark on balance sheet reduction, however, understanding demand for liabilities may become more important.\n\nThe demand for digital currencies is not well understood, as these are instruments for which there is no precedent or experience. For a CBDC, central banks would have to understand the behavior of the demand for this new liability. If stablecoins were to be issued by commercial banks, it would also be important to understand drivers of growth in these coins and how that growth might affect banks’ demand for reserves. Trend growth in these central bank liabilities could be quite different than it is for other liabilities, such as cash or reserve holdings of traditional banks. And, the variability in demand could potentially be high, driven by shifts in the market environment or in response to geopolitical developments or other exogenous events. This variability could be amplified if digital currencies were available internationally, potentially leading to larger flows. The variability could create new challenges for supplying the appropriate amount of reserves to the banking system to ensure that administered rates continue to control rates, and could lead to a need for larger liquidity surpluses to ensure interest rate control.\n\nOne way to manage growth or variability in demand, and the associated impact on demand for reserves in the banking system, could be to impose limits on how much of a CBDC individuals or institutions could hold. Some central banks are actively considering such limits.13 However, these could also diminish the use cases for CBDC and reduce the potential for consumers and businesses to take advantage of the payment benefits.\n\nStablecoins may not have the same types of holding limitations, which could lead to faster growth or more variability in demand. At least one jurisdiction is considering the potential use of holding limits or transaction limits on stablecoins on a temporary basis, to manage the possible shift from commercial bank deposits during a transition to new forms of digital money.14 Central banks could also contemplate putting some limits on balances at the central bank associated with stablecoin issuance to manage the unpredictability associated with these flows.\n\nI have spent some time discussing the potential need for greater supply of liquidity; however, the direction is not all one-way. As payments become faster, the demand for some central bank liabilities may decline. For example, in some jurisdictions, payment innovations have led to a substantial decline in the amount of currency in circulation.15 Banks may also find that more efficient payment systems bring about liquidity efficiencies, and could reduce their own demand for reserves in response.\n\nFrom my vantage point, the key takeaway for liquidity provision is to consider how, in the context of the remuneration paid on these instruments and other features, demand for central bank liabilities might evolve and how it could shift in different environments. Again, this requires holistic thinking about the ecosystem in which both private and public digital currencies operate.\n\nPillar 3: Liquidity facilities and backstops\nThe third pillar of interest rate control is liquidity backstops. In most frameworks the supply of central bank liabilities and their rates of remuneration are the primary means of interest rate control. However, occasional shocks occur in money markets, and central banks provide liquidity backstops that promote interest rate control and smooth market functioning.\n\nIn an environment with new public and private digital currencies, liquidity backstops for traditional banks may become even more important. As I noted, digital currencies could create competition for commercial bank deposits. This could enhance market efficiency and improve transmission of monetary policy, but it may also lead to swings in deposit flows that could unexpectedly shift a commercial bank’s liquidity position. This could in turn increase the potential for occasional variability in overnight rates and the need for central bank liquidity facilities.\n\nHowever, liquidity risk will also be an important consideration for new entrants, such as stablecoin issuers. Stablecoins backed entirely by central bank reserves would be less susceptible to liquidity risk than those backed with other assets. But this design may not ultimately be the most efficient use of central bank liabilities for the financial system, because an important role for commercial banks in the two-tier monetary system is their ability to support the provision of credit in the economy.16\n\nStablecoins backed by other instruments, such as high-quality liquid assets, could moderate growth in the central bank’s balance sheet relative to a stablecoin backed entirely by central bank reserves. However, this structure would also give rise to liquidity risk for stablecoin issuers, which might in turn give rise to a need for a backstop source of funding.\n\nThese considerations raise important questions for how best to integrate digital currencies and ensure smooth market functioning and interest rate control in times of stress.\n\nHow might the central bank’s balance sheet adapt?\nPossibly the biggest question over time for monetary policy implementation is how much of the central bank balance sheet should be used to support innovation in currencies.\n\nThe current two-tier system of money and payments has central bank balances at its center, but also features an expansive set of private money offered through bank deposit balances. Innovation in payment systems may have clear benefits for consumers and businesses, and private currencies backed by safe central bank balances or other highly liquid safe assets are certainly better than alternatives created by less regulated firms and backed by lower quality or illiquid assets. However, to the extent that stablecoins or CBDCs supplant private bank money or expand overall demand for central bank liabilities, they could also increase the size and potentially change the nature of central bank assets.\n\nA larger balance sheet could cause some central banks to adapt approaches to asset composition to manage the influence of a larger balance sheet on the policy stance. For example, a central bank could buy short-duration assets to support the new demand for central bank liabilities and differentiate these asset purchases from those intended to foster accommodative financial conditions.\n\nThese issues may also require new operational approaches for central banks. In some circumstances, the balance sheet could need to adjust rapidly because of unexpected large shifts in liability demand. This could require new thinking by central banks on the appropriate approaches to implementation with potentially a different mix of assets or tools to add liquidity to the system. Short-duration assets or temporary liquidity providing operations would also allow flexibility if an increase in liability demand is expected to be short term.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe innovation occurring in money and payments has the potential to alter the existing two-tier monetary system upon which current monetary policy implementation frameworks are designed. How things evolve from here is uncertain, and the impact of these innovations could be revolutionary, or more evolutionary. But imagining an environment in which new forms of private and public money and payments could coexist is helpful in adapting implementation frameworks that will enable central banks to continue to achieve their desired policy stance in the future.\n\nExpanding central bank liabilities in an incremental way to support new forms of money could create a safer payment system—one that promotes innovation, mitigates potential risks, and ensures money continues to function well in an increasingly digital economy. Adapting the implementation framework to incorporate new private forms of money and potentially central bank digital currencies is complex and will require substantial further study of key issues, some of which I have raised today.\n\nThis calls for an integrated approach, one that considers each instrument and its role in the monetary ecosystem. Central banks must draw on broad expertise within their institutions so that payments experts, monetary policy practitioners, financial stability and supervision colleagues explore and understand important intersections. We will also need to continue to engage a broad range of market participants, academics, and colleagues across the international central banking community as we adapt to be prepared for the road ahead. Workshops like this one help us learn from one another. Thank you all for your participation in such a rich and important set of discussions."

        "content": "Good morning, everyone. I'd like to give my thanks to Columbia University's School of International and Public Affairs for partnering with the New York Fed once again and for hosting us today. It's wonderful to be here and to see so many colleagues who have traveled from near and far to attend this workshop.\n\nWe'll have many important conversations over the next two days. To kick us off, I'm going to share some observations on the digital transformation of money and payments. I'll also discuss the potential implications for monetary policy implementation and for central banks more broadly.\n\nBefore I begin, I must give the standard Fed disclaimer that the views I express here are my own and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) or anyone else in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nI will get to payments technology in a minute. But first allow me to take you back to the year 1877. You're amazed at the sound of music coming out of a new invention—the phonograph. Fast-forward a century, and you're listening to your favorite band on a cassette tape. In the 1980s, it's a CD. In the 2000s, you're scrolling through the greatest hits on your iPod. And today, perhaps even on your way here, you listened to a streaming service on your phone or watch using voice commands.\n\nThere's been much innovation over the years, and many improvements in terms of convenience and costs, but at the most basic level we are still doing the same thing: enjoying music. It's how we're doing it that's changed.\n\nThe same is true with money and payments. Both are fundamentally changing through technological transformations. As happened with the delivery of music, the pace of technological advancement is accelerating, and it's clearing the way to do things faster or more efficiently. On top of that, the development of digital currencies has boomed. This includes cryptocurrencies that are not fully backed by other assets. It also includes stablecoins that are fully backed by safe and liquid assets, and central bank digital currencies (CBDC). Both stablecoins and CBDC that are fully backed by safe assets have the potential to be a new way to hold money and make payments. While all of this innovation opens up possibilities to do things differently than the past, it also carries risks.\n\nJust like listening to music, the \"how\" may change, but the \"what\" will remain the same. As we look ahead, it's important to remember that even as the technology changes, the role of the central bank has not. It is and will always be to supply money and liquidity to bring stability to the economy and financial system.\n\nTherefore, it's critical that we understand how these transformations could affect the economy and the financial system, as well as monetary policy implementation and central bank balance sheets. In addition, we must think carefully about proper regulation to protect consumers and investors and ensure the stability and safety of the financial system.1\n\nSo, what are some of the things that the New York Fed should be thinking about? To start, digital transformation could have implications for markets and for our interactions with counterparties, as well as how we carry out monetary policy.\n\nLike in the example of music, change is already underway. Take the Fed's overnight reverse repo (ON RRP) facility, for example2. The ON RRP facility has broadened the set of our counterparties and diversified the type of instruments on the liability side of our balance sheet. This facility has supported the control of short-term interest rates according to the FOMC's policy direction.\n\nThis has had profound effects on the composition of liabilities on our balance sheet. Traditionally, the Fed's liabilities have primarily been paper currency and reserves held by banks at the Fed. For example, a decade ago, paper currency totaled $1.1 trillion and bank reserves $1.5 trillion. But since then, we've seen a dramatic change in the makeup of the liability side of our balance sheet. Today, in addition to $2.3 trillion of currency and $3.3 trillion of bank reserves, there are $2 trillion in overnight reverse repos, representing funding from nonbank sources such as money market funds.\n\nTurning to the future, the big question is what a world of digital currencies like stablecoins and CBDCs would mean for the implementation of monetary policy. How will central banks anticipate and adapt to the changing landscape brought on by the possibility of digital currencies?\n\nThere is much more to discuss about these important considerations in a fast-changing world. As central bankers, it's critical that we remain focused on carrying out our responsibilities, while keeping pace with the world around us.\n\nAnd that's what brings us here today. This workshop is an important part of learning and understanding the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead so that we can be prepared for and successful in the future.\n\nThank you all for participating in what will surely be thought-provoking and constructive discussions."

        "content": "Good afternoon. I'm so pleased to be here with you today. We've waited a long time to gather in person. And I think we can all agree that meeting in this charming location was worth the wait. For most visitors, Eltville is renowned for its wine and roses. But for economists, it's a place to convene for weighty discussions on monetary policy. Given the events happening around the world today, there is much to discuss.\n\nWe are meeting at a time of significant economic challenges and uncertainties. Inflation has reached levels not seen in decades, both in the United States and in many other countries. And recent events—including the war in Ukraine, lockdowns in China, and other supply disruptions related to the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic—are exacerbating near-term inflationary pressures and uncertainty about the global economic outlook.\n\nThe challenge for monetary policy today is clear: to bring inflation down while maintaining a strong economy. This, of course, is at the heart of the Federal Reserve's dual mandate of price stability and maximum employment. Although the task is difficult, it is not insurmountable. We have the tools to return balance to the economy and restore price stability, and we are committed to using them.\n\nBefore I go any further, I will give the standard Fed disclaimer that the views I express here are my own and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) or anyone else in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nOverheating\n\nWhenever I talk about monetary policy, I start with the Federal Reserve's dual mandate: price stability and maximum employment. With the unemployment rate back to very low pre-pandemic levels, and a variety of indicators showing the labor market is very strong, maximum employment has been achieved. But, with inflation rising to unacceptably high levels, we are far from our longer-run goal of 2 percent inflation. High inflation harms those who are most in need. Too many families are now struggling to meet the increasing cost of necessities. I am resolutely focused on restoring price stability, which is the foundation for a vibrant and healthy economy.\n\nOver the past year, inflation has increased rapidly and dramatically to levels last seen in the early 1980s. A year ago, overall inflation, as measured by the percent change in the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index, was 2.5 percent. In March, it was 6.6 percent. A portion of this sharp rise reflects global increases in food and energy prices. But, even excluding energy and food costs, the \"core\" inflation rate has increased from 2 percent a year ago to 5.2 percent today.\n\nThree major imbalances are contributing to an overheating economy and high inflation. First, the effects of the pandemic have significantly increased demand for certain categories of spending, especially for durable goods and housing. This increase in demand is occurring while supply in these sectors is being adversely affected by the pandemic.\n\nThe case study for this dynamic is the automobile sector. The combination of high demand and supply shortages has led to historically low inventories. Customers are lining up to buy cars but are finding the dealer lots empty. It's a seller's market, and prices have soared. New car prices are up nearly 15 percent since the start of the pandemic, and used car prices have skyrocketed, rising more than 50 percent.\n\nAnother prominent example is housing. With remote work policies in place, many people have relocated—buying larger homes in the South, in the suburbs, and in more affordable cities. This shift has caused demand for housing in some regions to far outstrip supply, while new housing construction has been held back by shortages in labor and materials. The imbalance between demand and supply has led to bidding wars. Homes have sailed off the market at record prices, with many purchased sight unseen. This combination of high demand and crimped supply has also resulted in rapid increases in rents, especially for apartments coming onto the market.\n\nThe second major imbalance is in the labor market, where overall demand far exceeds existing supply. The ratio of job vacancies to the unemployed is near its all-time high, workers are quitting jobs at a record rate, and employers are bidding up wages. This sizzling hot labor market is also related to the imbalance between demand and supply for goods and housing, as businesses seek to hire more workers to help meet the high demand. And labor supply shortages and rising labor costs are contributing to price pressures across a wide range of goods and services.\n\nFinally, global imbalances in supply and demand have also contributed to supply-chain problems that have affected the availability and costs of shipping, as well as a variety of inputs into production—including semiconductor chips used in making cars. The war in Ukraine and recent lockdowns in China have further constrained the global supply of goods and commodities, including food and energy.\n\nTurning Down the Heat\n\nWith clear signs of demand exceeding supply and an economy running too hot, the primary focus of monetary policy is to turn down the heat and restore price stability.\n\nAlthough we are facing highly unusual and challenging circumstances, I am confident we have the right tools to achieve our goals. In fact, we have an advantage over previous inflationary episodes: Our monetary policy tools are especially powerful in the very sectors where we see the greatest imbalances and signs of overheating—such as durable goods and housing. Higher interest rates will cool demand in these rate-sensitive sectors to levels better aligned with supply. This will also turn down the heat in the labor market, reducing the imbalance between job openings and available labor supply.\n\nWhile the Federal Reserve on its own cannot address the global nature of inflation, we are not acting alone. Many other central banks are also taking steps to curb inflation. Taken together, these actions should help restore balance to supply and demand globally. That, in turn, should help diminish supply-chain bottlenecks and reduce inflationary pressures.\n\nTaking Action\n\nIn the United States, the FOMC is taking strong actions to restore balance and bring inflation down. So far this year, the FOMC has raised the target range for the federal funds rate by 75 basis points, including a 50-basis-point increase announced after our meeting last week.1 In addition, the FOMC has indicated that it anticipates that ongoing increases in the target range will be appropriate. I expect the FOMC will move expeditiously in bringing the federal funds rate back to more normal levels this year.\n\nThe FOMC also announced last week that starting June 1st, it will begin reducing the size of its holdings of U.S. Treasury securities and agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities, as described in the Plans for Reducing the Size of the Federal Reserve's Balance Sheet.2 The reduction of the balance sheet will play out over the next few years, eventually bringing the Federal Reserve's securities holdings to a level consistent with the ample reserves framework that the FOMC reaffirmed in January when it released its principles for balance sheet reduction.3\n\nEconomic Outlook\n\nEven before it took these actions, the FOMC communicated a path of raising the target federal funds rate and reducing the balance sheet. Those communications and subsequent actions are having a meaningful effect on broad financial conditions. For example, since the beginning of the year, both two-year Treasury yields and 30-year fixed mortgage rates have risen more than 2 percentage points. We have seen a significant tightening of financial conditions abroad as well.\n\nOur monetary policy actions will cool the demand side of the equation. I also expect that over time, the factors contributing to supply shortages will be resolved, so that some of the rebalancing will be accomplished through increases in supply, both in the United States and around the world. For 2022, I expect core PCE inflation to be nearly 4 percent, before falling to about 2 ½ percent next year. I expect inflation to further decline to close to our 2 percent longer-run goal in 2024.\n\nI expect the labor market and economy to continue to show strength and resilience. For 2022, I expect GDP growth to be around 2 percent and the unemployment rate to remain around its current low level.\n\nConclusion\n\nReducing inflation to our longer-run goal while keeping the labor market strong is the challenge of our time. The ongoing pandemic and war in Ukraine bring a tremendous amount of complexity and uncertainty. We will need to be data dependent and adjust our policy actions as circumstances warrant. We have the right tools, and we will use them to meet this challenge."

        "content": "Good afternoon, everyone. I'm so pleased to be here at Princeton University. It's great to be able to attend an event like this in person, and to see so many of my esteemed colleagues here today.\n\nWhenever I visit a college campus, I am reminded that some of the concepts I learned as a student can become more meaningful over time, often in surprising ways. I've thought of that as I've reflected on the significant challenges we face today—the ongoing pandemic and the Russian invasion of Ukraine.\n\nIn addition to staggering human suffering, these events are imposing considerable economic and financial hardships around the world. If we think back on what many of us learned in statistics about factor analysis, the pandemic and the Russian invasion can be seen as factors that have common effects across countries. But there are also idiosyncratic components that have distinct effects for the U.S. economy.\n\nI'll talk more about that today, as well as give you my views on inflation and the economic outlook. But I want to say at the outset that we at the Federal Reserve are committed to fulfilling our dual mandate of price stability and maximum employment. With inflation too high, we are focused on restoring price stability, while maintaining a strong labor market.\n\nBefore I go any further, I should give the standard Fed disclaimer that the views I express here are my own and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) or anyone else in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nShared Impacts\n\nIt's striking to think that just two years ago, the U.S. economy was reaching the trough of the COVID-19 recession. Back then, we were living through unprecedented lockdowns. And we had no way of knowing that this would be the shortest recession on record, or that the rebound would be so dramatic.\n\nIf we think about the global pandemic as a common factor, shutdowns, contractions, and rapid rebounds were the shared impacts across countries around the world. But so were supply-chain bottlenecks, shortages in semiconductors, and backlogs at ports—issues we grapple with today.\n\nAnd just like the United States, other countries have experienced imbalances in demand. Since the initial lockdowns, people have spent more of their money on electronics, cars, and furniture—and less on entertainment, travel, and restaurants.\n\nMany nations also showed considerable resilience of economic activity through the Omicron wave. But global risks remain. The BA.2 variant is now fueling a rise in cases in some countries, including China, Hong Kong, and the United Kingdom. Their experiences bear close monitoring. In addition, the war in Ukraine poses significant risks to food and energy prices, as well as to global economic growth.\n\nUniquely American\n\nGoing back to my analogy of factor analysis, there are idiosyncratic components to the pandemic. And I think it's important to note areas where we have had a uniquely American experience in the COVID-19 recovery.\n\nFirst, the amount of direct fiscal support in the United States was larger than what most other countries provided.1 This created a sizable cushion for many households, giving them the ability to maintain spending through the pandemic and as inflation started to rise.\n\nIn addition, the U.S. labor market has recovered strongly since the recession trough, and labor shortages here have become more acute than in many other countries.\n\nPart of the reason for a shortage of labor is that the U.S. labor force participation rate is still about a percentage point below its level prior to the pandemic, in what has become known as the Great Resignation. A portion of this decline reflects longer-term trends related to the aging of the population. But some left the labor market because they needed to be home to care for young children or elderly relatives. Others didn't want to risk exposure to COVID at the workplace. And many simply chose early retirement.\n\nDespite the challenges presented by the Omicron wave early this year, the unemployment rate fell to 3.6 percent in March, bringing it in line with the very low levels seen before the pandemic. With low unemployment, solid wage growth, and ample job openings, all indicators show that the strength of the labor market is at a level consistent with my view of maximum employment.\n\nInflationary Pressures\n\nThe other side of our mandate is price stability, and this is where our greatest challenge now lies. Inflation is far too high. In February, inflation—as measured by the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index—was nearly 6½ percent. And high inflation is a key concern in many countries around the world.\n\nEven before Russia's invasion of Ukraine, the rapid global economic rebound had driven up prices for oil and many other commodities. Higher inflation is especially detrimental for those who are least able to meet the growing cost of essentials like food, housing, and transportation.\n\nThe war in Ukraine and the global response present even greater challenges and uncertainty. For example, Russia and Ukraine are large exporters of key materials, including neon, palladium, and platinum. Those materials are used in the production of a wide array of products, from auto parts to computer chips. Even before the war, manufacturers were confronting shortages of important inputs. Further disruptions to these key products could create spillovers to economies across the globe.\n\nBut there are differences in the ways in which countries are experiencing inflation. In the United States, we are now seeing elevated inflation across many categories of goods and services. Meanwhile, in Europe, which is heavily dependent on Russia for energy, rising prices of oil and natural gas are the biggest concern. And in the Middle East, there are fears of a wheat shortage, given the region's reliance on wheat from Russia and Ukraine.\n\nThe one bright spot regarding inflation is that longer-run inflation expectations remain well anchored. This anchoring is seen in both market-based measures of expected inflation and in surveys of households and economists. For example, the New York Fed's Survey of Consumer Expectations has fielded special survey questions on five-year-ahead inflation expectations since 2019, and these expectations have hardly budged since the start of the pandemic.2 In addition, the pass-through of inflation surprises to revisions in three-year-ahead inflation expectations is about half as large as it was before 2020.3 That is, medium-term inflation expectations in this survey are less responsive to inflation shocks than they were before the pandemic.\n\nEconomic Outlook\n\nFaced with rising inflation but otherwise strong economies, the Federal Reserve and other central banks have been moving away from the extraordinarily accommodative stances they took in early 2020. Last year, many emerging market central banks raised their policy rates. In December, the Bank of England followed suit, followed by the Bank of Canada this March.\n\nCloser to home, the FOMC decided a little over two weeks ago to raise the target range for the federal funds rate by a quarter of a percentage point. The FOMC's decision to start the process of reducing monetary support for the economy reflected the strength and resilience the economy has displayed early this year, as well as the very high inflation readings of the past several months. In addition to the decision to raise the target range for the federal funds rate, the FOMC communicated two important messages about the likely future course of monetary policy.\n\nFirst, the FOMC indicated that it expects that ongoing increases in the target range will be appropriate.4 Although the FOMC did not make any decisions about future policy actions, its Summary of Economic Projections is informative regarding the thinking on the Committee at the time of the March meeting. The median assessment of the appropriate level of the federal funds rate at the end of next year is expected to be somewhat above the median assessment of its longer-run level.5\n\nOf course, these are only forecasts. Uncertainty about the economic outlook remains extraordinarily high, and risks to the inflation outlook are particularly acute. One of the things we've learned from the pandemic is to expect the unexpected. The actual path for policy will depend on the evolution of economic conditions, the outlook, and risks to the achievement of our price stability and maximum employment goals.\n\nSecond, the FOMC indicated that it expects to decide at a coming meeting when to begin reducing its holdings of securities. This process will be based on the FOMC's \"Principles for Reducing the Size of the Federal Reserve's Balance Sheet\" released in January.6 A key principle is to reduce the balance sheet in a predictable manner primarily by adjusting the amounts reinvested of principal payments received from securities held in the System Open Market Account. I expect that this process of reducing the size of the balance sheet can begin as soon as the May FOMC meeting.\n\nOur monetary policy actions, combined with those of other countries, will help bring demand for labor and products in closer alignment with available supply. As this reduction in demand-induced price pressures takes effect and supply constraints gradually ease, I anticipate inflation readings will begin to decline later this year, although this process will take time to fully play out. For 2022 as a whole, I expect PCE inflation to be around 4 percent, then decline to about 2½ percent in 2023, before returning close to our 2 percent longer-run goal in 2024.\n\nThese actions should enable us to manage the proverbial soft landing in a way that maintains a sustained strong economy and labor market. Both are well positioned to withstand tighter monetary policy. In fact, I expect the economy to continue to grow this year and for the unemployment rate to remain close to its current level.\n\nConclusion\n\nThese are uncertain times, and the policy questions we face are challenging. But we have learned the lessons of high inflation from the past. Price stability is essential for sustained economic prosperity, and we are strongly committed to using our tools as needed to achieve our price stability and maximum employment goals."

        "content": "Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.\n\nI am excited to see many of you joining us here—live—at our building on Liberty Street in downtown Manhattan. It means so much to us to be able to bring people together to discuss the future of New York City in our first-ever hybrid public event. I'd also like to welcome all the guests and panelists who are joining us virtually.\n\nThis is more than a conference. It's a moment that marks a new era for how we think about living and working in this city.\n\nIn fact, if you were to wander down these halls, you'd see my colleagues bringing that idea to life. We reopened our doors to all employees last month, and we're so glad to be back and working together in person. For us, this is part of a flexible model that allows for a mix of days in the office with remote work.\n\nWe believe that being here in this way is best for our employees, best for this city, and best for the Federal Reserve's Second District, which is the region we serve.\n\nOur physical presence gives us the opportunity to better engage with and learn from our communities. Our mission is to make the U.S. economy stronger and the financial system more stable for all segments of society, and supporting local economies is a key part of that. The New York Fed is proud to be an anchor institution of New York City, and we want the city—and all of its people—to thrive.\n\nI'd like to share a bit more about why having these discussions is so important for the future of this city and for us here at the New York Fed. And with that, I must give the standard Fed disclaimer that the views I express are my own and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Open Market Committee or anyone else in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nThe City's Present and Future\n\nNative New Yorker John Jay Chapman once said, \"The present in New York is so powerful that the past is lost.\"\n\nYou can feel that powerful reality when you walk the streets today. Indeed, this city was once an epicenter of the pandemic: we were hit early, and we were hit hard. The virus spread rapidly, leading to widespread hospitalizations and a devastating death toll.\n\nDuring the initial months of the pandemic, one out of five jobs in the city disappeared. In the restaurant industry in particular, 70 percent of jobs were lost. Other industries, such as retail and even health care, experienced outsized losses as well.\n\nTwo years later, we've seen great progress toward a recovery. The most recent data show that well over two-thirds of New York City's job losses have been reversed. Still, areas of the New York City economy, especially those dependent on visitors and office workers, continue to struggle and are lagging the nation in recovery. Despite the challenges, there is palpable energy and momentum propelling us into the future.\n\nNow that our focus is on the recovery, we must create an equitable future for all residents of this city. We must make sure that all of the people who live, work, or own a business here have a chance to succeed. It is essential that we build a stronger foundation so that everyone can fulfill their economic potential, both here in New York and around the nation.\n\nThat's why it's critical that we prioritize tackling some of the city's biggest problems, including poverty and inequality, and issues in areas such as infrastructure and transportation.\n\nThese issues are not new; they existed long before the pandemic. And there is no simple or single solution to solve them. But as we plan for a better future, we must understand how New York's challenges have evolved since March 2020 and how they are playing out in the current environment. With that knowledge and awareness in mind, we can chart the path forward.\n\nThe New York Fed's Role\n\nThis brings me to our conference today. The New York Fed is proud to play a role in connecting and convening leading policy influencers, stakeholders, and thinkers from across the city and around the country. Our goal in hosting events like these is to be a catalyst for collaboration and creative solutions. The panelists we'll hear from today will help us accomplish just that. They each have a deep understanding of the issues, a familiarity with the communities, and many innovative ideas to share.\n\nThe topics on the agenda complement the work that many people do in this very building every day. Our outreach and community development team is actively engaged with people and leaders around the Second District through regional visits, advisory councils, and frequent events. And our researchers study economic conditions and trends in the region and make their findings widely available.\n\nThis is a pivotal time for our city. We are excited to be back here, and we will continue this important work in forums similar to this one. I hope you'll partner and engage with us, because our collective efforts will make a difference.\n\nLet's take advantage of this opportunity—this New York moment— and together shape a bright future for this great city."

        "content": "It’s a great honor for me to participate in this event commemorating the centenary of the Central Reserve Bank of Peru. I want to start by congratulating Julio and everyone at the Bank on this special and significant anniversary. I am looking forward to a time, hopefully soon, when we can come together, enjoy some ceviche, and celebrate in person.\n\nAnd while it’s not nearly as enticing as a gathering over fine Peruvian food, I need to give the standard Fed disclaimer that the views I express here are my own and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) or anyone else in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nGiven this special occasion, let me begin with some reflections on the importance of communication and engagement in central banking.\n\nShared Concerns\n\nAs central bankers, we have long understood the value of engaging with colleagues around the world on the challenges we face in our own countries. We all operate in a highly interconnected global economy and financial system. And we have many of the same goals, including price stability, vibrant economies, and financial stability. Many of the issues we face are not unique to any one of us, but rather are shared across the region and the globe.\n\nRecent events, from the COVID-19 pandemic to the war in Ukraine, have only underscored the importance of active dialogue and transparency among central banks. Beyond the global economic impact of these events, it’s important to emphasize that the pandemic is first and foremost a public health crisis, and that the Russian invasion is inflicting tremendous hardship and suffering on the Ukrainian people.\n\nIn terms of economic impacts, all of us in the Americas were affected by lockdowns and shutdowns at the start of the pandemic. All of us have faced supply-chain bottlenecks and imbalances, as people around the world shifted their spending habits—buying more goods and spending less on services. And many of us are now confronting a sharp rise in inflation, especially for food and energy, which is hardest on our most vulnerable populations.\n\nOf course, each country is facing its own set of circumstances, and each has its own domestic mandates. But it’s important to remember that the policies we implement can affect our neighbors, just as developments that take place outside our borders can impact our ability to achieve our domestic goals. The actions we take can also affect the flow of capital across countries.\n\nAs central bankers, it is vitally important that we clearly communicate our policy strategies and reasoning for our actions as we carry out our mandates. Clear communication reduces the risk of confusion, volatility, and spillovers, and helps others prepare for challenges that may lie ahead. Experience has demonstrated that transparency in monetary policy can both increase its effectiveness and reduce unintended consequences.\n\nShared Insights and Analyses\n\nThat is why the perspectives we gain through ongoing dialogue with our counterparts are so valuable. Across the globe, many central banks—including the Federal Reserve—are moving to unwind the highly accommodative policies they put in place at the start of the pandemic. And we are doing this at a time when the economic implications of COVID-19 and the war in Ukraine remain highly uncertain.\n\nAs we all take these steps, the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) has provided an indispensable venue for sharing insights, analyses, and concerns. By engaging with each other, we are able to stay ahead of the trends and issues that affect other economies and their financial markets. And that is true not only when it comes to policy development and execution, but also in understanding economic and financial developments across the globe.\n\nA particularly apt example of the value of dialogue is the BIS’s Consultative Council for the Americas, which I’ve had the pleasure of chairing since 2020. Agustín, Julio, Roberto, and our colleagues from Argentina, Canada, Chile, Colombia, and Mexico are participants in meetings of the Council. Suffice to say, we’ve had a great deal to discuss over the past two years. And to do so, we have significantly increased the frequency of our meetings.\n\nThese meetings provide us with opportunities to communicate the reasoning and implications of our policy strategies, goals, and actions, and to hear how these affect other economies in the region. We exchange perspectives on shifting policy imperatives, and we share experiences and insights related to managing risks.\n\nThrough the BIS, we also jointly meet with members of the private sector, including bank CEOs and chief economists from the region, to hear their views about the economy. This is another valuable aspect of our work as central bank governors, and it’s insightful for all of us to hear from leaders beyond our own organizations and the borders of our countries.\n\nGlobal Issues\n\nI touched on many topics—the pandemic, the war, and inflation. These are global issues with domestic implications, and when we address them to fulfill our own mandates, we affect the economies of other countries in the region as well. In this regard, the work of the BIS in bringing central banks together has never been more important. I look forward to continuing our dialogue and engagement in the future.\n\nAgain, congratulations to the Central Reserve Bank of Peru, and best wishes for your second century."

        "speaker": "James Hennessy",
        "url": "https://www.newyorkfed.org/newsevents/speeches/2022/hen220322",
        "content": "Thank you, John, for your kind introduction. And welcome to everyone who is participating today from different parts of the world. Before I begin my remarks, I would like to state that the views I express today are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York or the Federal Reserve System.1\n\nI lead the New York Fed's Governance & Culture Reform initiative, which aims to focus the financial services industry's attention on the issue of organizational culture. Our initiative has three specific goals:\n\nThree Emerging Factors\n\nOver the past decade, my colleagues and I have seen a range of approaches to culture develop across the sector. In those firms that are most engaged on the issue, there has been an evolution in their understanding of how to assess and influence the norms and behaviors that drive decisions in their organizations.\n\nLet me highlight three emerging factors that have deepened the study and analysis of culture. I am sure all of them will be explored during your discussions today.\n\nFirst, we see the increasing use of behavioral science to better understand ordinary human behavior. Such science begins with the insight that humans are not simply rational actors – at least not if by \"rational\" we mean something narrow, economic, and mechanistic. Rather, our thinking and decisions are driven by a multitude of inputs and motivations, some \"rational,\" some \"irrational,\" through both conscious and unconscious mental processes. Another important insight of behavioral science is that humans are fundamentally social animals. That is, our individual identity and actions are strongly influenced by our need to be a member of a group. We look to our group – usually those most immediate to us – for approval. This has important implications for the creation of norms within an organization and expectations around conduct.\n\nSecond, it is notable how culture \"data\" seem to be ever-expanding and becoming more reliable. In addition to traditional surveys, rapid changes in technology, including the use of artificial intelligence, big data, and network analysis hold out the promise of accurate, real-time information about the state of an organization's culture and the possible identification of future trouble spots in a firm.\n\nThese two factors – the use of behavioral science and more voluminous and reliable data – are helping to support a third development, which is the growing maturity of culture assessments or audits. In my own view, the most useful kinds of assessments require a few key elements. Most importantly, along with information gleaned from culture surveys and the new sources of data I just mentioned, I am a strong advocate for the \"human touch\" in cultural diagnosis. For example, through direct behavioral observation of groups, culture auditors are able to gather evidence, using all their senses, about how decisions are made and work gets done in an organization. Likewise, conducting interviews with individuals about their experiences can yield insights into the norms, unspoken rules, subcultures, and underlying mindsets in an organization. There is, as you'll no doubt hear through the course of the day, a great deal more to be said about culture assessments. But I believe these methods involving careful, human listening can play a crucial role in helping to reveal the root causes of conduct and culture problems.\n\nGiven these advances in our understanding of human behaviour, the availability of new forms of data, and the maturing of culture audits, I do wonder why firms haven't started to govern culture more systematically. Most firms have departments to address all kinds of other risks, but very few (with some notable exceptions) have central teams to comprehensively assess, intervene, monitor and report on behavioural risk. If this approach became more widespread, maybe it could help the industry prevent issues from arising, rather than trying to fix them afterwards.\n\nUpdate on Culture Initiative Activities\n\nLet me turn now to describe the work of the New York Fed's Culture Initiative, its areas of particular focus in the coming year, and suggest some issues for your consideration along the way.\n\nOur work is organized into three broad categories. These include \"Awareness & Dialogue,\" which refers to our public events, such as webinars and podcasts, that continue to shine a spotlight on the culture issue and provide fresh insights from academics, the industry, and other experts; \"Education & Research\" through our Education and Industry Forum, which brings together representatives from business schools and firms to integrate ethics into educational resources and training of the next generation of the banking workforce; and \"Governance & Supervision,\" which involves periodic meetings with regulatory agencies from around the world to share information on evolving practices. Across these categories of work, we have settled on three related themes that will underlie much of our efforts in 2022.\n\nFirst, we are examining the meaning and importance of trust – in the financial sector broadly and within organizations. In fact, trust will be the topic for our first culture webinar of the year, on March 29th (register here). It's often stated that banks are in the business of trust, and yet we know that trust in the financial industry has remained low for many years now. But how central is trust to banking in the 21st century? We want to understand how it has evolved over time, how perceptions of financial sector culture contribute to trust in banks, and how trust matters – or does not – in our highly networked world.\n\nSecond, we are focusing on the impact of digitization on financial sector culture, including the influence of a greater share of technologists in banks. We are interested in the seeming contradiction between acting as a stable financial intermediary or fiduciary and the Silicon Valley mantra of \"moving fast and breaking things.\" We also wonder whether cultural norms valuing demonstrations of intellect – the need to be \"the smartest person in the room\" – could hinder the understanding and governance of new digital products. Are firm leaders willing to ask questions that might reveal some misunderstanding of technology-enabled instruments, such as those offered on decentralized platforms? We all saw during the financial crisis what can happen when the risks and unintended consequences of complicated financial products are not fully explored because someone is afraid to ask \"the dumb question.\"\n\nFinally – and probably like all of you – we are trying to absorb and understand the cultural transformations driven by pandemic-induced changes to the way we work and interact with others. We're particularly interested in their impact on psychological safety and speaking up within firms. On the positive side, we have heard that, for some teams, working remotely or in hybrid fashion has helped de-emphasize hierarchy and power dynamics that can often loom large in person. Those same-sized Zoom boxes may be empowering some employees, creating space for different voices to be heard. Nonetheless, when interactions occur solely via a computer screen, it can be difficult to pick up on culture cues and the norms of an organization. This can leave people feeling lost, demoralized, and invisible within their group. It will likely take more time and experimentation to find the optimal conditions to support a culture of speaking up in the new work environment.\n\nConclusion\nBy focusing on developments in trust, digitization, and hybrid work over the next year, we hope to shed light on what is in flux, as well as what is foundational, in financial services culture. Gatherings like this conference, representing a growing community of interest and practice, sustain my belief that we are all becoming better equipped to understand and drive change for the better. Thank you for giving me the opportunity to share my thoughts; I wish you a very productive conference."

        "content": "Thanks very much for that kind introduction.  I would like to thank Dick Berner and Venky Venkateswaran for organizing this event.1 As Dick would likely recall, I was supposed to give a talk about implementing policy here at NYU Stern two years ago, almost to the day. We had to cancel that speech as it became clear that the emerging pandemic and the efforts to contain it would disrupt the global economy and lead to unprecedented strains in financial markets. Today, the world faces an extraordinary new challenge.  I would like to acknowledge the tragic events in Ukraine and the terrible hardship this places on the Ukrainian people. The economic and financial impact of these events will take time to become clear.  On the Desk, we are monitoring global developments carefully.\n\nMy remarks today will begin by looking back at the pandemic crisis and the historic policy response.  Starting in March 2020, the Federal Reserve took a set of extraordinary measures in response to the extreme economic stresses and dislocations in the global financial system that were triggered by the pandemic.  These actions—many taken in close coordination with the U.S. Treasury, and alongside a forceful fiscal response from the U.S. government—were successful in providing accommodation to the U.S. economy during a very vulnerable and uncertain period.2\n\nIn light of recent strength in the labor market and elevated inflation, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) has decided to end net purchases of Treasuries and agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS) in early March.  The Committee also stated that it expects it will soon be appropriate to raise the target range for the federal funds rate, and released principles for significantly reducing the size of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet.3\n\nWith net asset purchases coming to an end, it is an opportune time for reflection.  In my remarks today, I’ll first review the asset purchases the Fed conducted over the past two years, exploring how the Committee’s evolving objectives for these purchases influenced the Desk’s implementation approach. I’ll then highlight how these purchases shaped the SOMA portfolio today and discuss some considerations ahead for policy implementation, in the context of the FOMC’s recently issued Principles for Reducing the Size of the Federal Reserve’s Balance Sheet.\n\nAs always, the views I express today are my own, and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York or the Federal Reserve System.\n\nThe Fed’s Asset Purchases: Objectives and Implementation\n\nNext week, the FOMC’s net purchases of Treasury securities and agency MBS will come to an end, marking the conclusion of this historic program, in which net purchases totaled roughly $4.6 trillion, as shown in Figure 1. These purchases were instrumental in supporting the flow of credit to the U.S. economy and fostering accommodative financial conditions—and, along with other significant policy measures, prevented a much deeper economic downturn.\n\nThe onset of the pandemic resulted in an unprecedented “dash for cash” as heightened uncertainty in the outlook and shifts to a remote trading posture prompted extreme price volatility, sudden portfolio de-risking, and strains in market functioning.  In this environment, even the most liquid securities, like Treasuries, were being sold broadly and in large quantities, overwhelming the market’s intermediation capacity.4 \n\nBy mid-March 2020, Treasury and agency MBS market functioning had deteriorated to levels not seen since the Global Financial Crisis.  In this truly exceptional environment, the Fed stepped in to buy securities at an unprecedented scale and speed to restore market functioning and maintain the vital flow of credit to the U.S. economy.  This entailed purchasing record amounts of securities to address one-way selling flows and meet the immediate demand for liquidity.\n\nThe flow of these purchases helped to alleviate private sector balance sheet constraints and meet this demand for market liquidity.  Over time, purchases restored two-way trading and more normal market functioning. The FOMC’s full commitment to purchase Treasuries and agency MBS “in the amounts needed” to support smooth market functioning also had the effect of stabilizing precautionary sales and forestalling a spiral in liquidity demand.5\n\nDuring this period, flexibility was a hallmark of our implementation approach.  The Desk adjusted purchases in response to shifting market conditions and sized them to address dysfunction.  We closely monitored and assessed market functioning metrics and targeted sectors in which conditions were especially strained.  In the MBS market, operational adjustments included purchasing a broad range of securities that came under intense selling pressure and purchasing for near-term settlement, which helped ease pressures on dealer balance sheets. This differed from the Desk’s typical practice of purchasing recently produced coupons in the to-be-announced (TBA) market for forward settlement.\n\nGiven the depth of the strains, market functioning improved only gradually at first.  However, with the Committee’s full commitment to supporting market functioning and the Desk’s continuous operational adjustments, market functioning metrics improved considerably over the course of several weeks, and the Desk reduced purchase amounts commensurately.6  In the Treasury market, bid-ask spreads narrowed and market depth rebounded, as shown in Figure 2.  Similarly, agency MBS market liquidity conditions, as represented by the effective bid-ask spread shown in Figure 3, improved markedly.\n\nAs market functioning improved and conditions stabilized, the Committee shifted its focus to fostering accommodative financial conditions to support the economy as it recovered from the pandemic shock, and to sustaining the gains made in market functioning. While asset purchases conducted to support market functioning were used during the pandemic to address extraordinary and acute stresses, asset purchases aimed at fostering accommodative financial conditions are a standard part of the Committee’s monetary policy toolkit, employed when the federal funds rate is constrained by its effective lower bound (ELB). \n\nBy reducing the stock of securities and duration risk held by private investors, Fed asset purchases lower term premiums and longer-term interest rates, easing financial conditions broadly.  In addition, purchases of agency MBS reduce the amount of prepayment risk held by investors, leading MBS spreads to fall and resulting in lower mortgage interest rates for homeowners.  Asset purchases can also convey information about the FOMC’s policy intentions, as market participants believe the Committee would be unlikely to raise its policy rate while conducting asset purchases. \n\nAs the FOMC’s objectives for asset purchases evolved, so too did the operational approach.  Purchase amounts were quickly scaled back as conditions improved, dropping from a daily average of over $100 billion in late March 2020 to around $10 billion by the summer, as shown in Figure 4.  Without the need for high-frequency adjustments to address market strains, the Desk extended the horizon for purchase calendars to provide more predictability in planned operations.  Purchase allocations also became more standard and were distributed relatively neutrally to the universe of securities outstanding. In this case, Treasury purchases were allocated proportionally to the amounts outstanding across the nominal Treasury coupon and TIPS coupon curves.7 In the MBS market, the composition of purchases was adjusted to be roughly in line with recently produced coupons in the TBA market.\n\nOverall, the asset purchases, and the operational approach used to implement them, were effective at achieving the Committee’s objectives. The flow of purchases substantially improved market functioning by meeting immediate demands for market liquidity in strained conditions.  The total stock of Fed asset holdings—resulting from both purchases initiated to address market functioning and those conducted with a focus on providing accommodation—worked to put downward pressure on longer-term yields and ease financial conditions.  And, the Committee’s communications about asset purchases had important signaling effects about its commitment to supporting the economy.   \n\nWhat I take away from this experience is that the FOMC’s toolkit for addressing both severe market functioning disruptions and economic downturns is comprehensive and effective.  Nonetheless, while asset purchases used to support market functioning and those employed to foster accommodative financial conditions may be broadly similar in nature, I do not view them as equal parts of the monetary policy toolkit.  I expect circumstances warranting sizable intervention to support market functioning to be extraordinarily rare.  In this respect, the ongoing work to better understand vulnerabilities in the U.S. Treasury market and to develop potential reforms to further enhance its resiliency is critical.8 In contrast, the Committee has indicated that asset purchases to provide accommodation are a standard tool when the federal funds rate is constrained by the ELB.9\n\nConsiderations for Policy Implementation Ahead\n\nLooking ahead, as I noted, with a strong labor market and elevated inflation, the FOMC has stated that it expects it will soon be appropriate to raise its target range for the federal funds rate, and has indicated that it intends to significantly reduce the size of the balance sheet.10 \n\nFor now, the FOMC has directed the Desk to continue to reinvest all principal payments from the Fed’s Treasury and agency MBS holdings following the conclusion of net purchases, which will maintain the size and broad composition of the SOMA portfolio.11 However, in recent meetings, the FOMC began deliberations on its approach to reducing the balance sheet, and following its January meeting the Committee issued principles to provide information on its planned approach.12 These principles are high-level tenets, and not specific plans. They build on the experience gained from reducing monetary policy accommodation over 2014 to 2019, and, importantly, also reflect the Committee’s assessment of the current environment.\n\nThe principles start by affirming that the FOMC sees changes in the target range for the federal funds rate as its primary means of adjusting the stance of monetary policy, and that reducing the balance sheet will occur after the process of raising the target range has begun.  The principles further state that when the Committee decides to begin reducing its securities holdings, it intends to do so over time in a predictable manner, primarily through adjustments to reinvestments, so that securities holdings decline with principal payments.  In addition, the principles affirm the FOMC’s choice of an ample reserves operating regime, and an intention, in the longer run, to hold primarily Treasury securities.\n\nLet me turn to a couple of considerations ahead for policy implementation, in the context of these principles and the current contours of the SOMA portfolio. \n\nSOMA Portfolio Contours\n\nFirst, the SOMA portfolio is substantially larger than it was at the end of the last round of large-scale asset purchases (LSAPs), reflecting the extraordinary pandemic shock and the purchases needed to support market functioning and the economic recovery.  As shown in Figure 5, at about $8.5 trillion and 35 percent of nominal GDP, the SOMA portfolio is roughly double the size in dollar terms and about 10 percentage points higher as a share of GDP than in late 2014.  Given the large size of the SOMA, the Committee has suggested that a significant reduction in the balance sheet would likely be appropriate.13  This assessment reflects the view that, with the overall elevated size of the balance sheet, SOMA securities holdings have more room to decline than during the prior period of runoff before reaching levels consistent with efficient and effective implementation in an ample reserves regime.\n\nIn addition to the much larger size of the SOMA, the weighted average maturity (WAM) of Treasury holdings is about two years shorter than in late 2014.  This is because asset purchases over the past two years have been conducted across the Treasury curve, whereas purchases under previous LSAP programs and the maturity extension program (MEP) targeted longer-dated Treasuries.  It also reflects the effect of sales of shorter-dated securities conducted during the MEP.14\n\nAs shown in Figure 6, the portfolio will have sizable principal payments from Treasury holdings over the next few years, ranging from $40 billion to $150 billion per month, and averaging around $80 billion.  These could be rolled over or allowed to mature, depending on the Committee’s decisions.  During the prior period of balance sheet reduction, shown in Figure 6b, the Committee directed the Desk to phase in a cap for monthly Treasury redemptions of $30 billion per month, to limit the pace and variability of redemption amounts, particularly around the middle month of each quarter when maturities are greater.15  Often, principal payments were below the caps, and the average pace of Treasury redemptions was less than $20 billion per month.    \n\nAgency MBS principal payments, shown in Figure 7a, are also expected to be modestly larger than those experienced during the prior runoff period and could average nearly $25 billion per month over the next few years. However, there is considerable uncertainty around mortgage prepayments; a downward shift in mortgage interest rates could increase prepayments substantially, as indicated by the gray bars.16  During the prior reduction period, shown in Figure 7b, the Committee phased in a monthly redemption cap of $20 billion for MBS.  This made the decrease in agency MBS holdings more predictable, and also limited the possibility of procyclical reductions in SOMA holdings during periods when interest rates fell in response to a worsening economic outlook.  In 2019, as the Committee eased policy, the cap did limit the pace of agency MBS redemptions.\n\nIn summary, Treasury principal payments in coming years will be much larger and more variable than they were following the LSAP programs.  MBS principal payments will likely be modestly larger and are subject to considerable uncertainty.  The FOMC has not decided on its plans for reducing the size of the balance sheet.  However, the minutes from the December FOMC meeting noted that many Committee participants judged that monthly caps on redemption amounts could help ensure that the pace of reduction in the SOMA portfolio would be predictable over time.17\n\nAmple Reserves Regime\n\nA second observation is that the Committee’s affirmation of its ample reserves operating framework provides broad insight into the longer-run supply of reserves, a key determinant of the longer-run size of the balance sheet. \n\nDuring the prior period of balance sheet reduction after the LSAPs, the Committee had not yet decided on its operating framework.  Even after the Committee announced the ample reserves regime, heightened uncertainty existed about the underlying demand for reserves given the substantial changes in banks’ liquidity management practices since the Global Financial Crisis.\n\nToday, the operating framework is well established, and we can draw on the prior experience with balance sheet reduction in assessing the demand for reserves.  That said, the underlying demand for reserves is still uncertain and varies over time.  Most large reserve holders assess their need for reserve balances based on intraday payment flows and projected outflows under stressed market conditions, and each bank has a different profile based on the composition of its liabilities and the outflow assumptions it makes.18  Moreover, the supply of reserves needed to maintain ample conditions is not just the sum of individual banks’ demand, due to frictions that limit the rapid redistribution of reserves.\n\nAs the Committee reduces the balance sheet, staff will carefully monitor developments in money markets to understand changes in reserve conditions and inform the Committee's assessment of the appropriate path for the balance sheet in the longer run.  Importantly, the prior experience with balance sheet reduction offers a useful guide to money market conditions that reflect ample reserves.  The FOMC is committed to maintaining sufficient reserves to ensure that administered rates—the interest on reserve balances (IORB) and overnight reverse repo facility (ON RRP) rates—exercise control over the federal funds rate.  However, should pressures in overnight markets unexpectedly emerge, the new Standing Repo Facility (SRF) that the Committee established last year is also available, providing an important backstop to support effective policy implementation and smooth market functioning.\n\nFlexibility in Implementation\n\nAs the Committee turns toward reducing the high level of accommodation provided during the pandemic, the Desk will focus on implementing the Committee’s plans as they develop.  Overall, the FOMC’s principles provide helpful guidance on the approach to reducing the balance sheet; similar principles communicated in advance of decisions or actions during the prior episode enhanced understanding of the Committee’s approach, supporting effective policy implementation.19 This time around, FOMC participants generally noted that current conditions likely warrant a faster pace of balance sheet runoff than during the previous period.20  \n\nGiven the experience implementing the last balance sheet reduction, it seems likely that redemptions could proceed smoothly at a somewhat faster pace than before.  However, a significant reduction in SOMA holdings will require meaningful adjustments to private-sector balance sheets—as investors absorb the net increase in Treasury and agency MBS issuance and money markets transition to lower levels of liquidity—and these adjustments could take time.  And while the Fed has some experience shrinking its balance sheet, this process is still relatively novel.  So, the Desk will continue to monitor markets closely to inform the FOMC’s policy deliberations.  The Committee is prepared to adjust its approach to reducing the size of the balance sheet, should economic and financial developments warrant.\n\nPotential for Liftoff is Near-Term Focus\n\nFinally, as the principles note, the FOMC will first increase the target range for the federal funds rate before it begins reducing the size of the balance sheet.  And, at its January meeting, the Committee stated that it expects it will soon be appropriate to increase the target range.  So, I am also focused on liftoff and adjustments in money markets that might occur.  Let me offer some concluding thoughts on that.\n\nThe Committee last lifted the target range off of the zero lower bound in 2015.  At that time, the Fed had no experience lifting short-term interest rates in an environment with abundant reserves, and there was significant uncertainty about the dynamics we’d see in money markets.  Ultimately, the policy implementation framework—including the administered rates and associated operations—was very successful in managing the federal funds rate within the target range and lifting the constellation of overnight rates.  And as we’ve seen over the past several years, the framework has continued to support effective policy implementation across a range of environments.\n\nEven as the current environment is characterized by higher levels of liquidity than in 2015, I am confident that administered rates will again be effective at lifting the federal funds rate when the Committee increases the target range.  Administered rates create strong incentives in overnight markets, and the ON RRP provides a broad range of money market investors an alternative investment to support the federal funds rate and other overnight rates.  My sense is that the current setting of administered rates relative to the target range has been working well and that it could continue to support effective policy implementation following any increase in the target range in coming months, although adjustments could be warranted over time.\n\nWith the high levels of liquidity in money markets, take-up at the ON RRP facility could increase as rates rise.  Flows between bank reserves and ON RRP balances depend, in part, on relative levels of interest rates on bank deposits versus other money market investments, such as money market mutual funds (money funds).  Some banks may use rising rates as an opportunity to reduce reserve holdings by shedding deposits.21  If, when the FOMC increases the target range, banks raise deposit rates by less than money funds increase net yields to investors, funds could flow from banks into money funds, which could in turn increase take-up at the ON RRP.\n\nThat said, while many expected an increase in the ON RRP in 2015, this did not come to pass, and it could be that ON RRP balances remain relatively steady following liftoff or even decline.  Regardless of what happens following liftoff, over time, as the Committee reduces the size of the balance sheet, I expect usage in the ON RRP to decline.\n\nIn sum, the administered rates working together should maintain the federal funds rate within the FOMC’s target range.  I am confident our tools will promote smooth implementation of the Committee’s policy stance.  But as always, we will monitor conditions closely and consider adjustments to our approach as appropriate.\n\nFigures\nData for Figures 6 and 7"

        "content": "Chair Sanders, Ranking Member Borrello, Chair Krueger, Ranking Member O’Mara, Chair Kaminsky, Ranking Member Stec, and members of the Committees, thank you for this opportunity to testify about how the Federal Reserve Bank of New York (“New York Fed”) is addressing potential climate-related financial risks to the banking industry.  It is a privilege to testify alongside Nina Chen from the New York State Department of Financial Services.  Nina is an outstanding partner in prudential supervision.  Please permit me to thank Nina and her colleagues publicly for their collaboration.\n\nBefore continuing, I am required to state that any opinions I express are my own, not necessarily those of the New York Fed, where I work, or any part of the Federal Reserve System (“Federal Reserve”).1 \n\nThe focus of my testimony today will be how climate-related financial risks factor into the supervision of financial institutions, which the New York Fed performs under authority delegated by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (“Board”).  I would like to emphasize that any policy decisions regarding supervision, including about how the Federal Reserve will address-climate related risks, ultimately would be made by policymakers at the Board.\n\nThe Federal Reserve “supervises financial institutions to ensure that they operate safely. In addition, the Federal Reserve monitors the financial system as a whole by identifying and analyzing potential risks to financial institutions, the broader financial system, and the economy.”2  And, once material risks and vulnerabilities are identified, the Federal Reserve works to ensure that supervised financial institutions and the financial system are resilient to those risks.\n\nClimate-related financial risks generally fall into two categories: physical risks and transition risks.\n\nPhysical risks are the direct consequences of more frequent instances of severe weather and other climate shifts.  For example, the losses from the physical manifestations of climate change could impact homeowners’ ability or willingness to continue making mortgage payments to their lenders and tax payments to state and local municipal governments, which then could result in losses for bank lenders and municipal bond holders.\n\nTransition risks are the consequences—both direct and indirect—of changes necessary to limit climate change.  Transition risks can arise from changes in consumer and investor preferences, new technology, or changes to governing law.  For example, if consumers develop preferences for “green” products and a company fails to foresee this change in demand, the company may suffer financially.  This, in turn, could create financial or market risk for supervised financial institutions that lend to that company or hold or underwrite its securities.\n\nEvaluating how these physical and transition risks translate into what we consider “traditional” banking risks—such as credit, market, liquidity, and operational risks—is not an easy task.  Climate change occurs over a long time horizon.  We lack historical data on which to build analytical models.  And we work in a global economy, which amplifies these complexities many times over.\n\nThat said, both physical risks and transition risks have the potential to affect communities and industries across New York State, including the financial sector. A recent review of literature by New York Fed economists informs us that the impact of physical and transition risks may be uneven across location, income, race, and age.  Moreover, measures that individuals and governments take to adapt to climate change could increase inequality.3  These risks to local industries and communities—in short, to New York’s economy—can also translate into risks for banks.  The Board has organized several committees, in coordination with colleagues across the Federal Reserve System, to assess and monitor the financial risks around climate change.\n\nBefore concluding, I would like to offer two observations.  First, the Federal Reserve’s work on climate change is important, but limited to our existing mandates—particularly those related to the supervision and regulation of financial institutions and the stability of the broader financial system.\n\nSecond, while economic changes as a result of changing consumer and investor preferences, technological developments, and governmental policies present potential risks for the financial sector, they also present opportunities.  For example, financial institutions are responding to investor demand for financial products that encompass environmental, social, and governance considerations—more commonly known as ESG investments.  There are also opportunities for collaboration between the private and official sectors, which will promote a better-informed response to climate change.  Today’s hearing is a good example of that.\n\nAgain, thank you for the invitation to testify. I would be happy to answer any questions."

        "content": "Good morning, everyone. I want to thank Sue Henderson for that kind introduction, and New Jersey City University for hosting today's discussion. I always enjoy speaking with students, and I look forward to the time—hopefully soon—when we can have these types of events in person.\n\nToday, our virtual setting is Jersey City, one of the most diverse cities in the world—and one known for terrific pizza. Now, it's not my place to get into the debate over who has the best pizza, and I know that people have strong views on that subject. As president of the New York Fed, I proudly represent both sides of the Hudson River, and my job is to make the economy stronger and the financial system more stable for all.\n\nBefore I move on from the topic of pizza to economics, I should give the standard Fed disclaimer that the views I express today are mine alone. They do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Open Market Committee—what we call the \"FOMC\"—or others in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nAs you well know, the economy—like many facets of our lives—continues to be shaped by the unpredictable nature of the coronavirus. As I've said before, the pandemic is first and foremost a health crisis. While omicron was milder for many—and thankfully the wave subsided relatively quickly—it still caused terrible hardship for countless families.\n\nYou can see the economic effects of the pandemic right here in New Jersey. What struck me this week as I met with New Jersey business, community, and political leaders was the different ways that COVID-19 affects local economies. Just a few miles from Jersey City, Port Newark and Port Elizabeth are humming with activity. But across the Turnpike, Newark Liberty International Airport has seen a big reduction in the number of flights and passengers relative to pre-pandemic trends. Likewise, the pandemic has led to empty office buildings and fewer travelers in New York City, which affects businesses here in New Jersey as well.\n\nToday I'm going to talk about how the economy has continued to recover despite the many disruptions and imbalances that COVID-19 has caused. I'll also discuss the labor market and the rise in inflation. Then, I'll describe how the Federal Reserve's monetary policy is working to help restore balance and stability to the economy during these uncertain times.\n\nEconomic Outlook\n\nSince it's the Friday before a holiday weekend, I won't test any of you on the functions of the Federal Reserve System. But I do want to take a moment to discuss the Fed's dual mandate of promoting maximum employment and price stability. U.S. monetary policy is set by the FOMC, which is made up of the Board of Governors and five of the 12 presidents of the Federal Reserve Banks.\n\nWe make our decisions after studying the data—lots of data. We look at everything from food and gas prices to retail sales and inventories, from labor costs and employment figures to semiconductor inventories and shipping expenses, and from the demand for goods and services to readings on public health.\n\nAnd we consider more than just numbers on spreadsheets and charts. We also regularly hear from business and community leaders who tell us firsthand what is happening in the economy. This occurs both through regular meetings with our Boards of Directors and advisory groups, as well as in ongoing discussions with local leaders. That is why it's so important for me to make trips like this one—even virtually—so I can meet with leaders to hear their perspectives. For example, earlier today I spoke with officials at the Port Newark–Elizabeth Marine Terminal about supply chains and logistics. And yesterday, I met with groups in North Jersey who are working to bridge the gap in health outcomes and housing—two critically important issues that can affect economic mobility.\n\nDespite the disruptions from COVID-19, the overall economy has shown remarkable strength and resilience over the past year. To put this in perspective, the onset of the pandemic in 2020 caused the sharpest U.S. economic contraction since World War II. Since then, we have seen a remarkable turnaround. The economy, measured by real gross domestic product, or GDP, grew about 5-1/2 percent over the course of last year, the fastest pace of growth since 1984. To get an idea how long ago that was, 1984 was the year I finished college.\n\nThe labor market has also improved dramatically and is now very strong. Over the past 12 months through January, the economy added over 6-1/2 million jobs. The unemployment rate has fallen from the pandemic peak of 14.7 percent to just 4 percent today. In fact, there are many more job openings now than there are people looking for work. Another clear sign of the hot labor market is that wages rose sharply last year, especially for lower-paid jobs.\n\nInflation\n\nI mentioned earlier that the Federal Reserve has two goals: maximum employment and price stability. The very strong labor market is great news in terms of achieving maximum employment. However, we have seen inflation rise to a level that's far too high. Ten years ago, the FOMC set a longer-run goal of 2 percent inflation—that is, prices rising 2 percent per year on average.1 From 2012 through 2020, inflation averaged below this 2 percent goal. But the inflation rate started rising sharply in 2021. The Fed's preferred price measure, the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index, rose 5-3/4 percent last year, its highest reading since the early 1980s.\n\nThis sudden, sharp rise in prices reflects a unique set of circumstances that has driven supply and demand out of balance. For those of you who have studied economics, you will not be surprised that I ascribe this rise in inflation to demand outpacing supply. But, the rapidly changing situation of the past two years has been extraordinary, and it is worth discussing in some detail.\n\nAfter the onset of the pandemic, Americans shifted their spending from services to goods, spending less on restaurants, vacations, and entertainment, and more on things like cars, appliances, and furniture. As businesses tried to meet the surge in demand for goods, distribution channels backed up. Supply-chain bottlenecks and shortages emerged, both here and abroad. Too many ships arrived at the ports—particularly those in California. When the ships were finally able to dock, there weren't enough workers and drivers to unload and transport goods to stores—or to people's homes.\n\nIn addition, we have seen a large pullback in the number of people willing and able to work, in part reflecting the challenges and risks of working during the pandemic. Some businesses can't hire people fast enough to help meet the strong demand. This has contributed to an acceleration in wages and higher prices for a variety of goods and services, including food and housing. High inflation is hardest on those already struggling to make ends meet.\n\nThe Fed's Response\n\nThis brings me to the outlook for the economy and monetary policy. As I said earlier, demand for goods and some services is now far outstripping supply, resulting in elevated inflation. With the labor market already very strong, it's important to restore the balance between supply and demand and bring inflation down. A number of factors should help accomplish this rebalancing, and monetary policy has an important role to play.\n\nFirst, with the omicron wave now ebbing and COVID vaccines and treatments much more widely available across the globe, we should see a gradual restoration of supply and a resolution of associated bottlenecks and shortages. Over time, consumers should also start to cut back on buying goods that are in short supply and switch back to in-person activities like travel, dining, and entertainment, where supply is less constrained overall. Together, these developments should contribute to more balance between supply and demand in the economy.\n\nThe second factor is fiscal policy, which provided a huge boost to the economy during the past two years but is unlikely to be as significant a source of demand this year. This is true not only for the United States, but also for many other economies.\n\nLast—but definitely not least—is monetary policy. After providing maximum support to the economy for the first year and half of the pandemic, the FOMC is adjusting the stance of monetary policy with the aim of bringing demand in balance with supply and thereby bringing down inflationary pressures. The same is true for many other central banks, which either already have moved in this direction or are expected to this year.\n\nThe initial step in that process was the FOMC's decisions to first reduce, and then end, its net purchases of Treasury and mortgage-backed securities.2 These purchases pushed longer-term interest rates lower, making it less costly for consumers and businesses to borrow, and contributed to favorable overall financial conditions that supported spending.\n\nThe next step will be to raise the FOMC's target range for the federal funds rate the short-term interest rate at which banks lend to each other. In March 2020, the FOMC reduced the target range for the federal funds rate by 1-1/2 percentage points to near zero. This very low interest rate contributed to the sharp rebound in demand, which propelled the strong labor market recovery over the past year.\n\nBut with today's strong economy and inflation that is well above our 2 percent longer-run goal, it is time to start the process of steadily moving the target range back to more normal levels. In particular, I expect it will be appropriate to raise the target range at our upcoming meeting in March.\n\nOnce the interest rate increases are underway, the next step will be to start the process of steadily and predictably reducing our holdings of Treasury and mortgage-based securities, which had grown significantly as a result of the purchases that began in March 2020. Last month, the FOMC released a set of principles that will guide that process.3 Assuming the economy develops roughly as I expect, I foresee this process getting started later this year.\n\nTaken together, these two sets of actions steadily raising the target range for the federal funds rate and steadily bringing down our securities holdings—should help bring demand closer to supply. In fact, even though we haven't done either of these things yet, financial conditions have already responded based on the expectation of Fed action. For example, medium- and longer-term Treasury yields and fixed-rate mortgage rates have risen close to their December 2019 levels. Of course, our actions will be driven by the data and a determination to achieve our maximum employment and price stability goals.\n\nWith these three factors working together to restore balance between supply and demand, I am confident we will achieve a sustained, strong economy and inflation at our 2 percent longer-run goal. For this year, I look forward to continued growth and receding inflation, both for the nation and North Jersey. Specifically, my forecast for the U.S. economy is for real GDP to grow a bit below 3 percent this year, for the unemployment rate to end the year around 3-1/2 percent, and for PCE price inflationto drop back to around 3 percent, before falling further next year as supply issues continue to recede.\n\nConclusion\n\nSince the onset of the pandemic two years ago, this has an extraordinary time for the economy and monetary policy. As we work to help restore balance to the economy and bring down inflation, our actions will always be driven by the data, and we will remain focused on achieving maximum employment and price stability."

        "content": "It is a pleasure to be with you virtually for this important Conference.  I am thrilled to be able to share a digital stage with my distinguished colleagues - Liz Rosenberg, the Assistant Secretary for Terrorist Financing and Financial Crimes at the U.S. Treasury Department, and Dr. Fahad Ibrahim Alshathri, the Deputy Governor for Supervision at the Saudi Central Bank.  I also want to thank my friend Wissam Fattouh and the Union of Arab Banks for the invitation to be part of this timely event.\n\nBefore I start my remarks, I want you to know that the comments are my own and may not necessarily represent the views of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York or the Federal Reserve System.\n\nLike my colleagues and our respective institutions, I have serious concerns about corruption, kleptocracy and international bribery schemes.  The Federal Reserve System supports the U.S. government’s actions to limit those activities through prosecutions and sanctions.\n\nThe Federal Reserve regulates many of the large financial institutions that process cross border transactions; and our examiners spend significant resources on making sure that these banks have effective internal monitoring systems to identify, detect and report suspicious activities via Suspicious Activity Reports to the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), the Financial Intelligence Unit of the United States.\n\nThe rule of law is necessary for the operation of a safe and effective international financial system.  That is why countries around the globe are following Financial Action Task Force (FATF) guidelines and expect their financial institutions to use a risk-based approach to monitor financial transactions for illicit conduct and financial crimes.\n\nBribery involving government officials is particularly troubling because it directly hurts the very people the officials should be protecting.  Around the globe, governments are constantly seeking to procure goods and services to sustain and improve their physical infrastructure in order to help their citizens and their countries.  Governments often rely on a competitive bidding process to ensure that their expenditure of public funds is well-controlled and cost-effective.\n\nUnfortunately, corrupt officials and complicit companies have found ways to subvert the bidding process and squander limited public funds – funds which could have otherwise been used to help citizens lead better and more productive lives.  Complicit companies overbid and then overcharge the government to fund bribes or kickbacks to government officials in order to obtain necessary approvals for infrastructure projects or contracts.  The result is that scarce resources are stolen in these schemes and the general population pays the price. \n\nSadly, we have seen too many examples of this type of behavior.  But banks in the United States are on notice.  They are aware of their obligation to look for transactions that support corruption schemes, often involving agents and consultants receiving payments on large infrastructure projects.  All too often these intermediaries are the conduit for kickbacks. \n\nThe schemes to provide the bribes can be simple or complicated: cash payments; free family vacations; payments for personal credit card bills; payments to friends, spouses or significant others for non-existent services; payments to shell companies controlled by the government official; free cars or housing, or the rental or sales of these assets at below market values.  The list goes on.\n\nSome clear examples of this type of egregious behavior include:\n\nOne common theme in cases like these is that they tend to occur in countries where the powerful can easily take advantage of limited or immature internal controls.  As is typical with most classic fraud triangle schemes, these people had the motivation (greed or perceived financial pressure), opportunity (powerful positions with weak internal controls), and rationalization (they deserved the kickback for years of hard work).  And undoubtedly, they thought the chances of getting caught were slim.\n\nHowever, when the scheme to inflate contracts and pay the associated bribes are made in U.S. dollars, the settlement of those transactions will usually be routed through the United States.  This means that U.S. prosecutors will be able to take action against those involved - even if their local governments will not or cannot pursue criminal or civil cases in their home country.\n\nMany of the schemes I just mentioned were identified by banks around the globe and reported to authorities via Suspicious Activity Reports (SARs).  Those banks helped root out international corruption schemes. \n\nThe United States has robust anti-money laundering laws that date back to 1970.  But every so often the U.S. makes major changes to its laws and regulations in response to a significant event or risks.  The most prominent was the PATRIOT ACT after the 9-11 attacks in 2001.\n\nOne year ago, the U.S. passed another significant piece of legislation - the Anti-Money Laundering Act of 2020, which has strengthened the position of the U.S. government to act against many financial crimes.  Some of the measures include:\n\nIt is encouraging to see how the United States and its global partners have worked together to stem the tide of financial crimes.  The Federal Reserve is happy to partner with the U.S. Treasury to collaborate with the Union of Arab Banks and your organizations in the effort to enhance detection methodologies and to unravel crime syndicates.  I thank you for engaging in this valuable conference and I hope that we can learn from each other to continue fighting international financial crime."

        "content": "Good morning, everyone, and Happy New Year. Thank you, Charles, for that introduction. And thanks to Richard Haass for the opportunity to speak with the members of the Council on Foreign Relations once again.\n\nFor the past two years, I’ve begun my remarks by saying how much I wish we could meet together in person. This time, I really was hoping for a chance to rewrite the script. After seeing so much progress on vaccinations over the past year and a moderation in COVID-19 infections during the fall, just a short time ago many of us had expected that we’d soon be turning the page.\n\nThe story of the pandemic is a complicated one. It is writing itself as we live it, and the storyline has been far from predictable. This is, first and foremost, a health crisis. The unusual and extraordinary nature of the situation means that circumstances are constantly evolving.\n\nFor the economy, this has meant that what we’ve experienced is unlike any recession or recovery we’ve seen—or read about—in the past. While there have been significant improvements in the overall economy, setbacks persist in some areas, and new challenges have appeared.\n\nI’ll always take an opportunity to quote something from the Lord of the Rings canon, so I’ll continue with the story analogy and say that for many people, these past few weeks have felt like we’ve been “There and Back Again.”\n\nWe again find ourselves in a period of extraordinary difficulty. The emergence and rapid spread of the Omicron variant in the United States and around the world are resulting in new peaks of COVID infections and hospitalizations, as well as severe strains on the healthcare and essential services workforce. This is a reminder that the path of economic recovery continues to be driven by the course of the virus.\n\nIn my remarks this morning, I’ll share more about what we’re seeing in the incoming data and how it relates to the economic picture in the United States and the world more broadly. I’ll also highlight the significant progress we’ve seen in the labor market and my outlook for inflation. Finally, I’ll discuss the Federal Reserve’s recent policy actions and what they mean for the future.\n\nBefore I proceed, I need to give the standard Fed disclaimer that the views I express today are mine alone and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) or others in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nEconomic Outlook\n\nWhen I look at the economy, it is through the lens of the Federal Reserve’s “dual mandate.” These are two goals set by Congress: maximum employment and price stability. Given these goals, my focus is to study and understand the wide range of developments that affect employment, unemployment, and inflation as they play out in real time.\n\nAs we start a new year, it’s worth highlighting the key economic developments of last year, which were defined by a very strong recovery, both here and abroad. Although we don’t have all the data yet, I expect that U.S. inflation-adjusted, or real, gross domestic product (GDP) increased by about 5-1/2 percent last year, which would be the strongest growth rate between fourth quarters in over 35 years.\n\nThe economic snap-back here and abroad has led to global supply-chain bottlenecks and imbalances between supply and demand that have contributed to a sharp rise in inflation. Inflation in the United States, based on the personal consumption expenditures price index, will likely exceed 5 percent in 2021, and inflation rates are elevated in many other countries, too.\n\nLooking ahead, I expect the current Omicron wave to slow growth in the next few months as people once again pull back from contact-intensive activities. I also expect that the Omicron wave will temporarily prolong and intensify labor supply challenges and supply-chain bottlenecks that we have been experiencing. Current staffing challenges for essential service workers in the healthcare, transportation, and education sectors will likely have a ripple effect too. But, once the Omicron wave subsides, the economy should return to a solid growth trajectory and these supply constraints on the economy should ebb over time.\n\nConsidering the effects of Omicron on the economy in the first part of the year, I expect real GDP to increase around 3-½ percent this year. While this is not quite the blockbuster growth we saw in 2021, it is still well above its long-run trend and supportive of continued improvement in the labor market. Of course, experience has taught us not to be overly confident in predictions about COVID and its effects on the economy, and uncertainty around the economic outlook remains high.\n\nThe Labor Market\n\nNow I’ll turn to the employment side of our mandate, where the picture improved dramatically over the past year. About 6-1/2 million jobs were added last year, and the unemployment rate plummeted by 2.8 percentage points. In fact, with the unemployment rate now at 3.9 percent, we have retraced 96 percent of the COVID recession rise in less than two years. This is lightyears faster than the more than seven years it took for unemployment to retrace to the same degree after the global financial crisis. With the economy registering solid growth, I expect the unemployment rate will continue to come down further to 3-½ percent this year.\n\nThe strength in the labor market is seen in a wide variety of indicators, including job openings, quits, and wage growth. The labor market has been especially robust in recent months for workers at the bottom of the wage distribution. And female labor force participation and employment have improved, especially for women with young children.\n\nInflation and Supply-Chain Challenges\n\nOne of the foremost concerns surrounding the outlook is inflation, which rose considerably last year.\n\nThere are two main contributors to the current high inflation: very strong demand, especially for goods, and supply bottlenecks. Both have been prevalent throughout the pandemic. The shutdown of factories—particularly those in Asia—and widespread lockdowns led to disruptions to logistics networks, elevated shipping costs, and prolonged delivery times. A new index created by New York Fed research staff shows that global supply-chain pressures shot up last year, reaching historically high levels.1\n\nThese challenges are not just top of mind for companies selling their goods or consumers waiting for their purchases to be delivered. Elevated prices have real life consequences for so many, particularly for people who are struggling to cover the rising costs of food, housing, and transportation.\n\nThe circumstances we are facing today are unlike anything we’ve experienced in the past. Typical historical episodes cannot be used as reference points for current conditions. As an example, the very large increases in prices that we see today are primarily for durable goods. This is a striking turnaround from the past 25 years when those prices had been trending lower. In contrast, even with the recent increases, prices on services and non-durable goods are now fairly close to their longer-run trends. And, even though the Omicron wave is posing new obstacles, some supply issues are starting to work themselves out as the economy adjusts to the changing circumstances.\n\nJust as the pandemic has followed its own script, I anticipate that the dynamics of inflation will also be different than previous cycles. With growth slowing and supply constraints gradually being resolved, I expect inflation to drop to around 2-1/2 percent this year, much closer to the FOMC’s 2 percent longer-run goal. And looking further ahead, I expect inflation to get close to 2 percent in 2023.\n\nPolicy Actions\n\nThese developments in the labor market and for inflation inform the Federal Reserve’s policy response and recent actions. In its December 2021 statement, the FOMC said that it would keep the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to ¼ percent.2 With inflation having exceeded 2 percent for some time, the FOMC said it expects it will be appropriate to maintain this target range until labor market conditions have reached levels consistent with the FOMC’s assessments of maximum employment.\n\nBecause of inflation developments and the notable improvement in the labor market, the FOMC also decided to reduce the monthly pace of its net asset purchases.\n\nWith our actions, we have started the process of adjusting the stance of monetary policy away from one of providing maximum support for the economy. This movement in policy reflects the gains the economy has made since the beginning of the pandemic and the evolution of the risks to the achievement of our goals.\n\nThe next step in reducing monetary accommodation to the economy will be to gradually bring the target range for the federal funds rate from its current very-low level back to more normal levels. Given the clear signs of a very strong labor market, we are approaching a decision to get that process underway. The timing of such decisions will be based on a careful consideration of a wide range of data and information, with a clear eye on our maximum employment and price stability goals.\n\nConclusion\n\nAs we turn a page on the new year, it’s clear that we have not yet reached the end of this pandemic story. But despite the challenges, I am hopeful of a continued strong recovery this year."

        "content": "The below transcript has been republished from Macro Musings, a podcast hosted by David Beckworth of the Mercatus Center. Listen to the podcast episode.\n\nDavid Beckworth: Lorie, welcome to the show.\n\nLorie Logan: David, thanks for having me. It's a pleasure to be here.\n\nBeckworth: Well, it's a real treat for me, and I know my listeners will also really enjoy having you on the program today. We are recording this January 5th, and as it turns out, Lorie, the minutes from the December FOMC meeting just came out, and I was reading them before I got on the show here with you.  And I read a paragraph that was all about you. I'm reading a paragraph that says, \"In discussing recently established backstop facilities, the manager noted continued progress.\" And it goes on to talk about the standard repo facility and the FEMA repo facility. I'm like, \"Hey, that's Lorie. I'm going to be speaking to Lorie today.\"\n\nBeckworth: So, it's a real honor for me, and I know many of my listeners as well, to get you on this show. Because we talk about this stuff a lot, but to get someone who's actually on the front lines, who's actually doing it. Wow. What a real treat for us. So, thank you for coming on the show. Okay. Lorie, maybe you can tell us a little bit about yourself. How did you get to where you are? What is your career journey like? Any lessons learned along the way?\n\nLogan: Well, thanks. And again, David, it's great to be here. I've had a strong interest in public service and public policy from a young age, which I think was inspired by my family's involvement in local politics, growing up in a small town in Kentucky. And then later fostered by experiences studying political science at Davidson College and later at Columbia University's School of International and Public Affairs.  And it was at Columbia that I was first introduced to global economic policy issues and opportunities at the Fed. And since then, I spent over 20 years, nearly my entire career, in the Markets Group at the New York Fed, deepening my own understanding of the financial system and working to make monetary policy implementation more effective.\n\nLogan: I started off in 2000 as a trader analyst, reporting on financial market developments and executing domestic operations on the government securities desk. And it was this real-time interaction of analysis and trading that provided an incredible opportunity to learn and to work at the intersection of public policy and financial markets. And I still love those aspects of what I do today. My time in the Markets Group has been marked with periods of accelerated learning. I was on the desk and involved with the historic lending in the securities lending program on September 11th. I crafted plans for liquidity facilities and the large scale asset purchases during the global financial crisis, and led development of the overnight RRP facility to support interest rate control after the GFC. And these experiences deepened my perspective, and over time I grew into increasing leadership positions.\n\nLogan: Two years ago, I was appointed to the SOMA manager role, where I'm now responsible for implementing the FOMCs policy directives and managing the system's $8 trillion securities portfolio. And this involves overseeing open market operations and reporting on financial markets at each of the FOMC meeting minutes. And you heard about that in the minutes that were released today. And working at the Fed has just been an incredible experience. I've had the privilege of serving in a mission-driven organization, one that's focused on making the economy stronger and the financial system more stable for all. And to me, that's especially grounding each day. And I get to do it with an amazing group of people.\n\nBeckworth: Yeah. I want to talk about that group of people in a minute, but just going back to your experience, you were there from 2000 to the present. So, you've seen a lot, as you mentioned. You have a lot of institutional knowledge inside of yourself, a lot of human capital for the New York Fed, and you were there for 9/11. And I'm just wondering, what was it like to go through that? Did you have to shut down the office? Were you there working through it? What was it like at that time? Because you're pretty close to the location of the Twin Towers.\n\nLogan: That was just an incredibly difficult experience, and very early on in my tenure at the New York Fed. We were very close to the towers and it was both a difficult time personally and professionally for me and for all those that I was working with. I was there that day, and it was a difficult day to participate in the operations that we did to support market function, and was difficult in the days after. But at that time, I really learned what it means to be a part of the central bank and the role and responsibility of the central bank to be open and available to provide liquidity when the financial market needs it most.\n\nBeckworth: Yeah. Very harrowing experience for sure. Well, let's talk about your group at the New York Fed. You oversee a lot, and I'm just looking off your bio here. I see four different roles and this may understate what you actually do, but let me list them off and you can correct me if I'm wrong or add to the list.  But one of your roles is, and you mentioned this already, but the execution of monetary policy for the FOMC. Number two, provision of fiscal agent services to the US Treasury Department and support of its debt issuance and foreign exchange operations. Three, analysis of global financial market developments. And four, production of the New York Fed's reference rates, including the SOFR. So, you do a lot. And in each of those, I guess bullet points, you have a lot of things you could unpack underneath that. Is that list a comprehensive list or is there more you would add to that?\n\nDay-to-Day Operations at the New York Fed\n\nLogan: Well, those are all the things that we do on the trading desk, which is a part of the Markets Group at the New York Fed. In addition to those activities, the Markets Group also, like each of the reserve banks, executes the discount window and also provides financial services for other or central banks. But as the SOMA manager, I'm responsible for overseeing policy implementation analysis. And to do that, I lead a large team of traders and analysts and policy advisors with a real range of backgrounds in finance, economics and policy. So, maybe I'd to share a little bit about my day-to-day and how that looks, most days, and also how that changes over time.\n\nLogan: In terms of my day-to-day, I think my kids, who've had just a really unique and front row seat as we've been working remotely during the pandemic, describe it best. They say my day starts very early and is jam-packed with meetings. And I think that's pretty accurate. My day does begin early. Often starting on an international call before 7:00 AM, but some staff come in even earlier around 4:00 to begin monitoring overseas markets. And then we all come together each morning at 9:05 to discuss our operations and how we're interpreting markets.\n\nLogan: It's an important meeting for me, and it's a meeting that's been held at that time for decades. At that meeting, I typically have my eye on how effectively our operations are working. And I'm also thinking broadly about markets, trying to put what the team is seeing in the context of the FOMCs goals. And then the rest of my day is typically spent in meetings geared toward helping the group achieve on its mission. We run a big operation to manage the portfolio. There's a lot of deliberation and planning to ensure the operations run smoothly and that we communicate about them clearly. And I also spend a significant amount of time with our board colleagues in DC, and then with policymakers, about bigger picture implementation strategy decisions.\n\nLogan: We also to maintain a broad range of external relationships. And a lot of my time is focused on those relationships, and with other central bank colleagues, to share implementation experiences and to really learn from each other.  The most important part of my time though is spent on our people and what they need to be successful. I manage a large team, as I said, and work to ensure that we understand our evolving priorities and that the team's working well. We certainly faced some tough challenges recently, as we've shifted to a remote virtual environment, and that's going to be a continued focus as we develop new ways of doing our work after the pandemic.\n\nBeckworth: Well, let's say there's a crisis emerging, let's say for example, repo panic 2019. You see things unfolding, do you have the power to go ahead and do something, or do you have to call the FOMC first and get authority from them? Are you empowered at some level to respond to market developments?\n\nLogan: As you noted, there are definitely periods when we have to organize our time to be more responsive to these evolving developments. And in those times, the structure of the day is quite similar, but we're in this crisis management mode, and the pace accelerates. The decisions that we're making are more complex and made with less information, but we do make them with an eye to flexibility so we can learn and adapt quickly. And really depends on the environment that we're in at the time, which decisions we make directly on the desk and which we are making at the direction of the FOMC. In each FOMC meeting, the committee issues a directive to the desk, which gives us instructions on how to implement monetary policy, so some of those decisions are ones that we make be at the direction from that particular directive for the intermediate period. And then there's others that might be unusual that we may want to recommend. And those may require a change in the directive or an actual committee vote in between meetings. So it really depends on the environment we're in.\n\nBeckworth: Okay. I want to move on to actual developments and what you have done over the past few years, particularly what happened in March, 2020. Before we do that, go one last question about the New York Fed. And this is a less serious question. But I'm sure you've seen Die Hard with a Vengeance, the movie where the Die Hard character ends up at the New York Fed. And these people try to steal gold from the New York Fed. Is the gold still there? Have you visited the gold down in the basement of the New York Fed?\n\nLogan: Well, I'm certain the gold's still there. I haven't actually been in the building in a bit of time, David.\n\nBeckworth: Okay.\n\nLogan: Given the pandemic, but I know it's still there and it is a really interesting tour to do. My middle son actually is the one who's been able to do that tour with me. And it's been a real highlight for him. And hopefully we'll be back in the building and my other kids will get the chance to do the tour, too.\n\nBeckworth: Very nice. All right. So you've given a lot of talks on what happened in March 2020. The “Dash For Cash” as it's called. A number of talks. You were a part of the Fed's response to it. And I was hoping you could summarize for us your view of what happened during that period.\n\nThe \"Dash for Cash\" and Subsequent Policy Response\n\nLogan: So perhaps I'll take a step back and first talk about what we observed at the time. And then turn to how we responded. So in first, in terms of what we observed, we first saw changes in financial markets early in 2020. Equity markets globally were volatile, responding to the virus that was spreading quickly. By late February, as more cases were confirmed in the US, conditions began to decline quite rapidly. I think it's really important to first emphasize the magnitude of the shock that financial markets were absorbing in early 2020. At the time, the economy had been experiencing relatively steady economic growth. And over the course of just a few weeks, market participants became concerned that large parts of the economy could completely shut down, potentially creating a historic recession. And additionally, market participants were also highly concerned that the financial system itself might not function properly in a remote environment.\n\nLogan: The infrastructure of the global financial system is complex. It's interconnected. There are dependencies all over along the chain of the transactions. So while the financial system itself ultimately made that transition relatively smoothly, that was not an outcome, I think, many thought possible at the time. So the result was just extreme volatility as financial assets repriced to reflect these developments. And there was also a broad base dash for cash as investors sought the safety of cash. Even Treasury securities, which are usually seen as the most liquid of financial assets, were being sold broadly to raise dollars. And so this shift was really unprecedented. Unprecedented in its scale and in its scope, and resulted in severe disruptions across financial markets and had the potential to make economic conditions even worse by cutting off the flow of credit to households and businesses that were most vulnerable.\n\nLogan: So how did we respond? Well, over the first few weeks in March, our operations transitioned from business as usual to managing an unprecedented pandemic. By early March, we had already put the staff in a heightened monitoring stance, and had taken steps to increase the size and lengthen the tenor of repo operations. And you'd asked earlier, are there decisions that you can make directly on the desk? And those are two examples of ones that we can make directly. However, the conditions continue to worsen and to broaden. And so, to me, the turning point was March 12th. And it was on that day where we took more aggressive action. First, we offered almost unlimited amounts of funding through the repos. And then later that day, to help alleviate the strains in Treasury cash markets, we announced a shift in our purchases of Treasury bills to purchase across the Treasury coupon curve.\n\nLogan: And that's an example where we actually needed approval from the chair to make that type of decision. So right there, just that one day, you can see the different types of decisions that we make and the authorities that we have. My own sense was that these moves would help stem the dysfunction. But by the end of the day, we were already seeing significant one way flows and conditions continue to worsen. And we could see that in just a broad set of metrics that we were monitoring. So very late that night, we conferenced again with the team to assess whether more aggressive actions were needed, what options we could put on the table, and then whether we could make those options operationally feasible within such a short window of time because we needed to implement whatever recommendation we'd be putting forward that next morning.\n\nLogan: So after a very lengthy call, we decided to recommend that we pull forward an entire month's worth of Treasury purchases into a single day. Such an aggressive option we hoped would signal that we were prepared to take the actions needed to maintain functioning. And so that discussion was really when I realized we were in an unprecedented environment. Just the extraordinary demand for cash was creating conditions that required us to respond with unmatched size and speed. And ultimately, the FOMC announced an unbounded commitment to support market function. And we met daily from that point on about how many and which Treasury and agency mortgage-backed securities to buy. And of course, the Fed also took a broad range of other actions to stem dysfunction across markets, including the FX swap lines with foreign central banks, and also a broad range of liquidity and credit facilities. And it was the combination of these actions, I think, that were successful at supporting the flow of credit in such an uncertain time. And I just want to emphasize that all of this was done by staff working from home.\n\nLogan: Many of them amazing working at home for the first time. And the conditions were quite challenging. And we're always investing in operational readiness, and we'd had virtual capabilities. But we had never operated from home to this extent. So this was a new experience for us and for all of our counterparties. And I'm still in awe of what the team was really able to achieve in those early days.\n\nBeckworth: Yeah. A very amazing story there. And I think it's important for us to do the counterfactual. What if the New York Fed hadn't stepped in? I mean the global dollar funding markets are so large, they're global, as you mentioned. And if you hadn't stepped in, it could have been a really horrible outcome, another financial crisis like we saw in 2008, or worse. And so the demands on your staff, I imagine, just are going to grow over time as global dollar funding markets grow as well. I also want to come back to this, maybe an idea of what was this crisis? And from my perspective, and correct me if I'm wrong, the dash for cash was more of a plumbing issue than a fundamental fiscal solvency issue of the US government. It was just people trying to liquidate positions or get into some of their asset and they couldn't. The plumbing was constrained, maybe even cracked or broken. Is that a fair way to analogize what happened?\n\nLogan: I think the experience really underscored the fact that, while the Treasury market is the deepest and most liquid in the world, there are some underlying fragilities. So I think that's what you're referring to. Of course, the pandemic represented as shock of such magnitude that I think even the most resilient market likely would've experienced disruptions. But we've also seen disruptions to Treasury market functioning in more benign environments. And here I'm thinking back to October, 2014 or September, 2019. And sometimes, with those, there was a seemingly little trigger. So I do think, given the importance of this [Treasury] market, financing the government and in supporting the implementation of monetary policy, that it's critical that we take steps to enhance the plumbing and resiliency of the market. So I do think that is a big focus of the work that we're doing on the desk and the inner agency working group on Treasury markets is really focused on.\n\nBeckworth: Yeah. I read that report preparing for the show. The inner agency working group for market surveillance from, I guess, November last year. And also, there's been the Brookings Task Force on Financial Stability, Group of Thirty. A lot of great pieces coming out explaining what's going on. And a lot of them have common suggestions for improving. And let me just throw them out there and let me know what you think. So one of them is increased central clearing in the Treasury market. Another is a standing repo facility. And we can kind of check that one off, that's already been adopted. And then several others tweak the supplemental leverage ratio and then better data. But let me just start with the first one, then maybe go one by one. Central clearing, do you see an important role for that moving forward?\n\nThe Role of Central Clearing Moving Forward\n\nLogan: I do. And maybe just before jumping into those potential changes to improve their resiliency. Maybe I could highlight just a couple of themes from my own experience. And I think that we've seen across studies that you mentioned, because I think it's those vulnerabilities that these different proposals will need to be addressing. And I think that'll help us evaluate them as we talk about it. I really think there are four themes that have resonated with my own experience from the studies that we've seen come out. One common theme is that the US Treasury market has grown so much and it's really outpaced the growth in dealer intermediation capacity. Another change in the Treasury market is the growth of electronic trading and non-dealer intermediaries.\n\nLogan: Some electronic markets have high frequency trading and very limited customer interaction. And as a result, participants are less likely to continue engaging in this market when volatility increases. And the third is the proliferation of trading venues and settlement mechanisms that have also created some fragmentation in the market structure. And I think, and result in more frictions across markets, particularly in times of stress. And we saw this play out in March and in April of 2020. And then finally, even as the market becomes more complex and interconnected, real-time data on positions and flows in the US treasuries is still pretty limited. And that reduces visibility for both market participants and for the official sector. So I think as we look at these different proposals, it's important to keep in mind these vulnerabilities because I think we want to be addressing these directly.\n\nLogan: And as you noted, several have put forward some recommendations and the IAWG in particular has said that they would focus on five. Those are improving resilience of market intermediation, improving data quality, evaluating expanded central clearing, enhancing trading venue transparency and oversight, and then finally assessing effects of fund leverage and liquidity risk management practices. And I think the key point I'd make in listing these work streams is that it's very unlikely that there's a standalone solution. I think these are all complimentary efforts. And I think the goal is to ensure that the US Treasury market is as resilient as possible using the combination of these changes that have been proposed. So some of the ones you noted central clearing, the SLR, the standing repo facility are all complimentary in that regard. But I do think we need to stay focused on a package of changes and not get too focused on any one proposal in particular.\n\nBeckworth: Well, one of those proposals has come through, come to fruition and that's the standing repo facility. I guess it was last year that the FOMC made that one official as well as making the FIMA repo facility permanent. Tell us a little bit about the standing repo facility. I've been a fan of this idea for some time. I've had some people on the show to talk about it, but what do you see it doing moving forward?\n\nThe Future of the Standing Repo Facility\n\nLogan: Well, I do think the decision on the standing repo facility and also the FIMA repo facility, which the committee voted on at the same time was a very historic decision with respect to the framework, and one that the committee deliberated on for some time. These facilities were implemented to support effective policy implementation by limiting the potential for pressures in repo or in global dollar funding markets to spill back to the Fed funds market. In recent years, we've observed that pressures in money markets can emerge rapidly and with little warning. And we saw that in September 2019, and again in March 2020. And since pressures in these overnight markets can be difficult to predict and are harder to tamp down once they emerge, I too do think that a key benefit is their ability to help mitigate rate pressures before they develop into these larger disruptions.\n\nLogan: And this should enhance market confidence and help to limit those pressures from building, even if the facilities end up being little used. So while not the primary objective of the facilities, I think having these backstops in financing markets can also have important positive effects for the treasury market functioning more generally. Certainly, the SRF reduces the potential for disruptions in Treasury repo markets to then hinder the dealer's ability to make markets in the Treasury cash market. And the FIMA repo facility can help reduce sales of Treasury securities by the FIMA accounts by providing them with this temporary liquidity against their holdings.\n\nLogan: Now, of course, these repo facilities alone won't prevent all types of pressures on the Treasury market to the extent that limits on intermediation capacity or sales of Treasury securities are happening for factors other than the need for temporary liquidity. Repo won't fully substitute for outright sales of securities, but they can meaningfully I think limit the potential for disruptions. It is a very important development, not only for our monetary policy implementation framework, but also for the Treasury market resiliency efforts that we're working on.\n\nBeckworth: Yeah, it was interesting to read today in the FOMC minutes from the December 2021 meeting that several participants said, hey, this standing repo facility will make tapering easier. It may even affect the final destination, the final size of the balance sheet if people can easily substitute between treasuries and reserves. If they know that's there, that confidence will make the transition to whatever your final target may be an easier path. So interesting to see that happen. And again, great timing for the minutes to come out as we are recording this show. And that's a nice segue to the next thing I want to talk about, and that's the Fed's balance sheet. You mentioned already, it's 8 trillion plus, and the FOMC has announced… or it is already tapering. And I know you can't speak to policy, but I'll just say from my side, it appears from the minutes today that there's going to be some QT or actual runoff occurring this year. And I'm just curious from your perspective, how does that work? How would we see your office, the Federal Reserve in general, do balance sheet reduction?\n\nAsset Purchases and the Process of Balance Sheet Reduction\n\nLogan: Well, maybe it's useful just to take a step back and talk about the asset purchases themselves as a standard tool in the Fed’s tool kit and how those work mechanically, and then come back to mechanically how they work as we begin to slow that process and ultimately decrease the size of the balance sheet. As I said, the asset purchases have become a standard tool in the toolkit to provide accommodation when short term interest rates are near zero. And in terms of the mechanics, I think about them working in a couple of ways. First, they work through the portfolio balance channel. When the Fed or the desk purchases securities from our counterparties, it raises the price of these securities and then lowers their yields. And those counterparties who sold securities to us may then rebalance their own portfolios to invest in other assets, lowering yields broadly, and then easing financial conditions.\n\nLogan: So that's the first channel we tend to think about these working. And the second one is a signaling channel. Asset purchases can signal that the Fed's committed to maintaining accommodated conditions and is unlikely to thereby raise the Fed funds rate for some length of time, and this also reduces yields by lowering the expected path of policy rates. And in periods of stress, such as that we saw in the pandemic, asset purchases can also restore market functioning and reduce risk premia that could otherwise increase yields. And this was a key benefit of the purchases early in the pandemic. So the overall goal again is to lower long term interest rates and keep credit flowing to the economy. And since the onset of the pandemic, the desk has been directed by the committee to purchase significant amounts of treasuries and agency MBS.\n\nLogan: And our assessment is that they've been very effective at easing financial conditions and generally supporting the recovery. And as you noted at the December meeting, the committee decided to accelerate the taper of these asset purchases. And this action was prompted by a rapidly strengthening labor market and currently elevated inflationary pressures and Chair Powell noted that a quicker conclusion of asset purchases would better position policy to address the full range of plausible economic outcomes. So our focus on the desk is on executing this reduction in the pace of asset purchases and to do so smoothly for the FOMC. And so far, I think this has gone well, and we haven't observed any challenges associated with the decline and purchase amounts. But of course, whereas I said always monitoring developments and keeping an eye towards effects there.\n\nLogan: Now, at some point when the current level of accommodation is no longer necessary to achieve the committee's goals, the committee's going to want to reduce the size of the Fed's balance sheet and unwinding these measures demonstrates that this important tool is used when needed. But importantly, it can be withdrawn once the committee's goals are achieved. And we do have some experience with the mechanics of reducing the balance sheet. At the conclusion of the large scale asset purchase programs after the global financial crisis, the committee did undertake balance sheet normalization that lasted about two years. So in terms of the mechanics of that process, balance sheet normalization was conducted in a gradual manner and a predictable manner. I think those are the two key themes there. And there were two implementation elements to that. First, principle payments from our maturing securities were no longer reinvested and that reduces the balance sheet size. And in other words, it was an organic process. We didn't sell assets. And then the second mechanical feature was that caps were set on these monthly redemption amounts to ensure a steady decline.\n\nLogan: And I think overall this process, that process of natural maturities rather than sales and caps to ensure a steady pace seemed to work quite well. And at the December meeting, the committee did review this previous experience that it had with balance sheet normalization. And there were several aspects of that previous approach that the committee felt remained applicable. Maybe I'll just highlight a couple of those themes from the discussion and these were highlighted in the minutes. The first one I think is clear communications, you know, clear communications provided in advance of the policy decisions were viewed as helpful in setting expectations and enhancing understanding of the overall policy approach and the second was consistent with the previous normalization episode. Changes in the target range for the Fed funds rate were still seen to be the primary means of adjusting the stance of policy.\n\nLogan: Then third, using caps on these redemption amounts, the mechanical process I talked about, can ensure balance sheet reduction occurs in a measured and predictable manner. I think that was recognized as being a very useful approach. Then fourth, retaining flexibility to make adjustments to the approach was viewed as helpful in nimbly responding to economic and market conditions. Those were some of the common themes, I think, that were recognized in looking back at the previous experience. But there were also some differences, and the committee noted that the economic outlook is much stronger now than in the previous episode and that the balance sheet is much larger and that these differences would be taken to account when making decisions about the balance sheet. As the minutes and the chair noted, no decisions have been made. The FOMC is going to be discussing these balance sheet issues in coming meetings, and our focus on the desk will be working to support those deliberations.\n\nBeckworth: Yeah. You've had the experience already of doing QT, or quantitative tightening, but still, this is not a trivial task, right? I mean, there's a lot of things you got to consider, as you mentioned. You got to do only so much or you allow the principal to run off. You got to control that. You got to gauge the stance of the economy. That's the conditional forecast. You got to worry about the TGA balance, right? What's the Treasury doing? You have all these moving parts that you have to control for. So you do have your work cut out for you when it comes to actually implementing this. It's not just  press a button on a keyboard, and then it's done. There's a lot of judgment, I guess, involved in this exercise.\n\nLogan: Well, I think there are a whole host of considerations that you outlined that the committee will be thinking about and exploring in the upcoming meetings. At some point, the desk will get a very clear directive from the committee about how to implement this policy normalization and balance sheet normalization process. That directive, I think, will be very transparent and clear in terms of the mechanics of what we'll need to do to deliver on that directive.\n\nBeckworth: Now, don't you have some blog posts coming out at the New York Fed related to this discussion of the Fed's balance sheet?\n\nLogan: We do. Next week, we'll be releasing a series of blog posts about the Federal Reserve's monetary policy implementation framework. The purpose of the series is to help talk about how the Federal Reserve implements policy today. We'll be looking at the implementation framework, the tools, interest on reserve balances in the overnight RRP facility in supporting that framework. We're going to talk a little bit about technical adjustments to interest on reserve balances and overnight RRP and how we've used technical adjustments to support policy implementation. Then a little bit more about this new backstop facility, the standing repo facility that we talked about earlier. So I'm excited about the series and hope the audience takes the opportunity to review them.\n\nBeckworth: We look forward to seeing it. So speaking of the Fed's balance sheet, there's this runoff that's likely to occur. The balance sheet will get smaller. There's some destination. Is it too soon to start thinking about where that destination is? Is that going to be determined by the FOMC? Let me rephrase the question this way. Will the FOMC come up with a dollar size for the Fed's balance sheet, or more general, we'll know we're there when we're there kind of framing for that journey?\n\nIs There an End Goal for the Fed’s Balance Sheet?\n\nLogan: Well, in terms of the future of the balance sheet, the committee has stated that it plans to continue to implement policy in an ample reserves regime or a floor system. So we'll talk more about that in the post that'll be released. This implies that the balance sheet will need to be maintained at a level that supplies ample reserves to the banking system. Reserves right now are very large. They're highly abundant or super abundant, so I expect the balance sheet could decline some way from here and still maintain an ample level of reserves. But I think the key point is that the long run size of the balance sheet is uncertain because banks' demand for reserves varies over time.\n\nLogan: At the December FOMC meeting, participants suggested that it will be important that we monitor money market conditions as reserves fall in order to assess the appropriate level of reserves to maintain ample conditions. Indeed, we do have a lot of money market data, which allows us to observe those conditions in money markets at a granular level. And we do have our experience from the prior normalization to help serve as a guide when assessing those reserve conditions. And we have the new standing repo facility in place as a backstop now, which wasn't the case during the prior normalization period. So I expect that the long run portfolio size will again be driven by demand for Federal Reserve liabilities consistent with maintaining an ample reserves regime. The exact level is something that's unknown and will be something that we'll be monitoring to determine as the balance sheet declines.\n\nBeckworth: Well, I'm looking forward to this journey, and I'm especially looking forward to the role that the standing repo facility will play in this journey. Because as you said, it could affect how many reserves are demanded by the banks. In the few minutes we have left, Lorie, I want to ask about the framework you mentioned, ample reserves framework, or a floor operating system. We haven't touched on this. The overnight reverse repo facility, does that set the floor effectively for the rates and you could think of standing repo and discount rate being the ceiling, and you want the Fed funds rate somewhere between that? What role would the interest on reserves play in that system?\n\nThe Floor System and the Role of Interest on Reserves\n\nLogan: Well, just going back to 2019 when the FOMC adopted this framework for implementing policy, where they supply an ample supply of reserves that ensures the Fed's administered rates influence the Fed funds rate and other overnight rates. In a floor system, our job is to ensure that reserves are supplied to meet banks' needs for liquid balances and that the IORB and the overnight RRP are important features.\n\nLogan: Now in most economies, the interest on reserve balances would be enough to control interest rates. However in the US, banks are a smaller share of the financial system. So when the FOMC pursues policies such as asset purchases or lending like we've been doing since March 2020, expands the Fed's balance sheet, and banks can end up with more reserves than they're comfortable holding. So during these times, they lower the rates at which they take deposits, and the rates trade below IORB. So in order to enhance rate control, the overnight reverse repo facility was established, and this does place a floor under overnight rates by providing a range of money market participants, this other option.\n\nLogan: This really does two things. It improves investors' bargaining power in overnight markets, and it creates an alternative investment that can spread Federal Reserve liabilities beyond reserves that reduces the pressure on banks' balance sheets. The FOMC's been essentially operating with this floor system for many years now and using both IORB and the overnight RRP as key tools. That's turned out to be quite effective at controlling rates through a variety of environments.\n\nLogan: Recently, the overnight RRP has become a more important component of that framework, along with the growth in the Fed's balance sheet. Overnight RRP usage tends to grow when there are downward pressures on rates relative to IORB. This can happen when reserves are elevated and banks try to shed deposits or when the supply of short-term investments such as Treasury bills declines. In the current environment, we're seeing both of those elements. So the overnight RRP facility is particularly important now and a particularly attractive investment for money market participants. So we've seen the facility increase to record high levels. I think my main observation would just be that both IORB and overnight RRP are important components to the floor.\n\nBeckworth: Well with that, our time is up. Our guest today's been Lorie Logan. Lorie, thank you so much for coming on the show.\n\nLogan: David, thanks for having me. It's been a real pleasure and hope to be able to return some time soon.\n\nBeckworth: Okay. Thank you. Thank you so much."
