        "content": "These are economically trying times. In my remarks, I would like to discuss the factors I see affecting the outlook for the U.S. economy and monetary policy. As always, I speak only for myself, and not for my Federal Reserve System colleagues.1\n\n\n\nFinancial market conditions loom large in any discussion of the economy these days. The heart of the problem, of course, is the home mortgages made from late 2005 through early 2007, near the end of the long U.S. housing boom that began in 1995. Since the peak in activity in 2005, housing investment has fallen by more than 40 percent. Average housing prices, as measured by the FHFA repeat sales index, have fallen 6 ½ percent since their peak in April 2007. Some markets have experienced more dramatic declines; the home price index for California fell 18 percent, for example. The resulting erosion in home equity for many borrowers has meant that mortgages made near the peak of the boom, especially the subprime and non-traditional categories, are experiencing much larger losses than expected.\n\nIt will take years of research to untangle the quantitative contribution of various causal factors to the rise in subprime mortgage lending and the increase in subprime losses, so I won’t attempt such an analysis here. Let me simply offer a list of plausible suspects. One candidate is the wave of technological innovation in retail credit delivery, which contributed to an expansion of consumer credit, including unsecured and mortgage credit. As in any industry in the midst of innovation, this expansion may have involved overshooting and retrenchment.\n\nA second suspect is the regulatory and supervisory framework surrounding U.S. housing finance, which may have been insufficiently prepared for the possibility of a swing in housing demand of the magnitude and geographic extent that we have seen. Private sector incentives to foresee and protect against such shocks were to some extent dampened by the presence of the federal financial safety net, and perhaps by official policies aimed at increasing homeownership. In addition, the unscrupulous and fraudulent practices of some mortgage brokers outside of the banking sector may have contributed to the problem.\n\nI would also cite relatively low interest rates after the recession earlier this decade, especially in 2003 and 2004. Some economists have argued, with the benefit of hindsight, that tighter monetary policy during that period would have led to better outcomes by preventing core inflation from rising, thus limiting the housing boom and mitigating the subsequent bust.2\nWhile I find this view plausible, again, further research will be required to substantiate this hypothesis.\n\n\n\nThat's all prologue, however, to the turmoil that has plagued financial markets since the middle of last year, when the potential scale of the home mortgage problem became more widely appreciated. The turmoil intensified in mid-September this year, and volatility has been elevated since. Financial market participants have faced three major categories of uncertainty. The first concerns the aggregate amount of losses on mortgage lending. For mortgages made in 2006 and early 2007 — the vintages in which losses are concentrated — significant uncertainty still remains regarding total losses.\n\nSecond, financial market participants face uncertainty about where the losses will turn up. Mortgage risks were split up and spread widely, both within the United States and in Europe, through securitization and use of the insurance capabilities provided by credit derivative contracts. As a result, financial market participants are understandably apprehensive about whether a particular counterparty’s mortgage-related losses will erode their capital buffer enough to threaten their viability. This has led to elevated risk premia in interbank credit markets for institutions with at least some presumed mortgage-related exposure.\n\nThird, market participants have at times faced uncertainty about prospective public sector intervention.3\nThe disparate responses to potential failures at several high-profile organizations this year may have made it difficult for market participants to forecast whether and in what form official support would be forthcoming for a given counterparty. Shifts in expectations regarding official intervention may have added volatility to financial asset markets that already were roiled by an increasingly uncertain growth outlook.\n\n\n\nThe striking feature of central bank lending during the recent turmoil is the extent to which it has extended well beyond the boundaries that previously were understood to constrain such lending, both in the range of institutions and the contractual terms on which credit has been provided. Intervention has been driven by a desire to prevent damaging disruptions to financial markets, and thus reduce the overall costs of the turmoil. While this objective is clearly understandable, central bank lending can create the expectation that similar support will be forthcoming when market disruptions occur in the future. Such expectations can themselves be very costly, because they can distort the incentives faced by, and as a result, the choices made by private-sector participants.\n\nThe critical policy question of our time is where to establish the boundaries around the public-sector safety net provided to financial market participants, now that the old boundaries are gone. In doing so, the prime directive should be that the extent of regulatory and supervisory oversight should be commensurate with the extent of access to central bank credit in order to contain moral hazard effectively. The dramatic recent expansion in Federal Reserve lending, and government support more broadly, has extended public sector support beyond existing supervisory reach, and thus could destabilize the financial system, if no corrective action is taken. Restoring consistency between the scope of government support and the scope of government supervision is essential to a healthy and sustainable financial system. One option is simply to adapt our regulatory and supervisory regime to the new wider implied reach of government lending support. This strikes me as an unattractive option, if for no other reason than the current uncertainty about the outer bounds of that support. Constraining moral hazard in such a regime would be an immense and daunting task. I take it as given, therefore, that the scope of financial safety net ultimately must be rolled back.\n\nNote that it will not be sufficient simply to roll back the current lending programs when the economy recovers. The precedents that have been set during this episode will influence how market participants expect policymakers to react during the next episode of financial market turmoil. Establishing a coherent and stable financial regulatory regime will require rolling back expectations about how the policymakers will respond to the next financial market disturbance. Rolling back those expectations will be impossible if moral hazard concerns are always set aside in the exigencies of a crisis.4\n\n\n\nAssessing the effects of financial market turmoil on real economic spending is not as straightforward as it might seem. One popular notion is that the credit market disruptions we’ve seen over the last year or so impede the financial sector’s ability and willingness to extend credit to households and business firms, thereby creating an additional drag on spending. But causation can flow in the opposite direction as well. When overall economic activity seems poised to contract, the outlook for household income and business revenues deteriorates as well, and such borrowers become less creditworthy, all else constant. My reading of current conditions is that bank lending is constrained more now by the supply of creditworthy borrowers than by the supply of bank capital.\n\nThe decline in U.S. housing activity since early 2006 has affected not only credit markets — it has had a significant impact on broader economic activity as well. For a time, the weakness was isolated in the housing market, as the rest of the economy continued to expand at a relatively healthy rate. But late last year, consumer spending began to slow. Household net worth has declined as home prices have fallen virtually nationwide over the last year-and-a-half, and, more recently, equity prices have slumped. Increases in energy prices up through the middle of this year took a substantial bite out of real incomes. Moreover, payroll employment peaked last December, and has since shed 1.2 million jobs. As the labor market has weakened, wage growth has tapered off. Except for the temporary bulge due to the stimulus payments earlier this year, real personal income has steadily decelerated, and is now below where it was a year ago. Given this catalog of adverse developments for U.S. households, it should be no surprise that consumer spending was sluggish in the first half of the year and has fallen significantly in recent months.\n\nWhen household spending slows substantially, business capital investment is usually not far behind. Business spending on equipment and software fell in the first half of 2008, and the near-term outlook is not favorable. Many firms are facing dimmer sales prospects, higher funding costs, and more restrictive borrowing terms. The other segment of business fixed investment, spending on new structures, has been booming recently. In 2007 and the first half of 2008, real nonresidential fixed investment — a segment that includes office buildings, hotels, malls and the like — grew at a 14 percent annual rate. That category seems to have topped out over the summer, and is certain to decline in coming months.\n\nForeign trade has added significantly to GDP growth last year and the first half of this year. Unfortunately, the trade contribution to U.S. growth is likely to decline in the near term in response to diminishing world growth prospects and the recent strength in the dollar.\n\nTwo days ago, the National Bureau of Economic Research officially confirmed what virtually all economists already knew — namely, that a recession began last December when payroll employment peaked. For a time, the decline was fairly mild — in fact milder than the last two recessions, both of which were themselves mild by historic standards. But conditions downshifted dramatically sometime in September, just as financial market turmoil was accelerating. Since then, according to reports, many households and firms are taking a \"wait and see\" attitude, reducing or postponing nonessential outlays in response to a general sense of uncertainty about the potential meaning of these dramatic events for their own economic circumstances. A wide array of economic indicators has deteriorated markedly since then as well.\n\nLooking ahead, uncertainty about the outlook is greater than usual, though probably not greater than is typical for this phase of a business slowdown. It strikes me as reasonable to expect the U.S. economy to regain positive momentum sometime in 2009, for several reasons. First, monetary policy is now quite stimulative. Second, the energy and commodity price shocks that dampened economic activity earlier this year have subsided already or are in the process of doing so. And as I’ve mentioned, the drag from housing seems likely to lessen in the next year, and in fact, I would be surprised if we don’t see a bottom in housing construction sometime in 2009. This is the third straight year, however, that I’ve been expecting a bottom in the housing market in the middle of next year, so my outlook is tempered by more than the usual amount of humility.\n\nWhile the downturn in real economic activity is going to pose challenges for monetary policy in the period ahead, it’s essential that we not let inflation drift from view. Since 2004, overall inflation has trended upward, and has been higher than I would like, over the last few years. Much of the acceleration we saw earlier this year reflected energy prices, however, and with oil prices down we have seen overall inflation subside in recent months.\n\nMany economists are forecasting relatively low inflation in the months ahead, on the grounds that widening economic slack is generally associated with declining price pressures. While this correlation is detectable in many datasets, I would be cautious about relying on it as a causal relationship.5\nAnd while it may seem premature to be worrying about how inflation behaves after the recession is over, we need to be sure our policy remains consistent with a strategy that does not allow inflation to ratchet up over the business cycle.\n\n\n\nAs I said at the outset, these are not the best of economic times. We have weathered economic downturns before, however, both nationally and globally. And there is no sign that the fundamental creative process that drives innovation and improves well-being over time has been mortally wounded. What sets this episode apart is the nature of the turmoil plaguing the financial sector, and the array of unprecedented government lending programs. While navigating the slowdown in real economic growth is a challenge, the larger and more significant challenge will be to re-establish the boundaries around central bank lending and public sector support and reconstruct the relationship between the public sector and financial markets. How well we meet this challenge will determine the extent to which innovation, despite the associated volatility, will continue to contribute to the effectiveness of our financial system and to overall economic growth.",

But the list of plausible suspects is clear. First, technological innovation in retail credit delivery allowed lenders to make finer distinctions between borrowers and profitably expand lending to borrowers formerly unworthy of credit. As in any industry in the midst of undergoing innovation, such as credit cards in the 1990s for example, natural evolution can involve overshooting and retrenchment. Related, subprime lending with high loan-to-value ratios was profitable while home prices were rapidly rising, but profitability fell sharply when price trends reversed. Lenders who found past subprime mortgage lending profitable in 2004, 2005 and 2006, may have underestimated the probability of a broad and sustained decline in home prices and how that would affect their lending returns.\n\nSecond, the regulatory and supervisory framework surrounding U.S. housing finance may have been insufficiently prepared for the possibility of an adverse housing demand shift of the magnitude and geographic extent that we have seen. Private sector incentives to foresee and protect against such shocks was to some extent dampened by the presence of the federal financial safety net, including the inferred prospect of support for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Official policies aimed at increasing home-ownership also provided at least some positive inducement to risk-taking in housing finance. In addition, the unscrupulous and fraudulent practices of some mortgage brokers outside of the banking sector may have contributed to the problem.\n\nThird, monetary policy kept interest rates relatively low after the recession earlier this decade. Some economists have argued, with the benefit of hindsight, that tighter monetary policy during that period would have led to better outcomes by preventing core inflation from rising, which would have had the auxiliary effect of limiting the housing boom and thus mitigating the subsequent bust.2\nWhile I find this view plausible, again, further research will be required to substantiate this hypothesis.\n\n\n\nAlthough this episode will, as I said, inspire a great deal of research in the years ahead, some lessons have emerged already and have motivated corrective action, both by market participants and policymakers. The appetite of banks and investors for nontraditional and subprime mortgages and for the services of independent mortgage brokers has been substantially reduced, and many mortgage companies have gone out of business. Banks and mortgage originators have tightened home mortgage underwriting standards significantly, reflecting both revised assessments of the profitability of more innovative lending approaches and a generally weakening economic outlook. Financial market investors holding complex mortgage-related securitizations have been suitably chastened. The Federal Reserve has tightened standards over unfair and deceptive mortgage lending practices. Supervisory staff have intensified their scrutiny of risk management practices related to structured finance and off-balance-sheet activities, and have worked to strengthen institutions' capital and liquidity planning. And the U.S. banking agencies have worked together with nonprofits and mortgage servicers to prevent unnecessary foreclosures.\n\nThat's all prologue, however, to the turmoil that has plagued financial markets since the middle of last year, when the potential scale of the home mortgage problem became more widely appreciated. The turmoil intensified the week of September 15, and volatility has been elevated since. Financial market participants have faced three major categories of uncertainty. The first concerns the aggregate amount of losses on mortgage lending. For a given mortgage cohort, it typically takes four years or longer to realize a substantial portion of their ultimate cumulative losses. For mortgages made in 2006 and early 2007, we are, at most, two years into that process, and thus significant uncertainty remains regarding total losses on those vintages.\n\nSecond, financial market participants face uncertainty about where the losses will turn up. Mortgage risks were split up and spread widely, both within the United States and in Europe, through securitization and use of the insurance capabilities provided by credit derivative contracts. Moreover, the performance of different mortgage pools can depend critically on subtle differences in the practices of the originating institution and the servicer. As a result, assessing the value of any given mortgage portfolio is a costly enterprise right now. Financial market participants are thus understandably apprehensive about whether a particular counterparty's mortgage-related losses will erode their capital buffer enough to threaten their viability. This has led to elevated risk premia in interbank credit markets for institutions with at least some presumed mortgage-related exposure. These premia appear to vary significantly across institutions, however, suggesting a fair amount of public knowledge of institutions' relative exposures and capital positions.\n\nThird, market participants have at times faced uncertainty about prospective public sector intervention.3\nThe disparate responses to potential failures at several high-profile organizations this year may have made it difficult for market participants to forecast whether and in what form official support would be forthcoming for a given counterparty. Shifts in expectations regarding official intervention may have added volatility to financial asset markets that already were roiled by an increasingly uncertain growth outlook.\n\n\n\nThe striking feature of central bank lending during the recent turmoil is the extent to which it has extended well beyond the boundaries that previously were understood to constrain such lending, both in the range of institutions and the contractual terms on which credit has been provided. Intervention has been driven by a desire to prevent damaging disruptions to financial markets, and thus reduce the overall costs of the turmoil. While this objective is clearly understandable, central bank lending can create the expectation that similar support will be forthcoming when market disruptions occur in the future. Such expectations can themselves be very costly, because they can distort the incentives faced by, and as a result, the choices made by private-sector participants.\n\nThe critical policy question of our time is where to establish the boundaries around the public sector safety net provided to financial market participants, now that the old boundaries are gone. In doing so, the prime directive should be that the extent of regulatory and supervisory oversight should be commensurate with the extent of access to central bank credit in order to contain moral hazard effectively. The dramatic recent expansion in Federal Reserve lending, and government support more broadly, has extended public sector support beyond existing supervisory reach, and thus could destabilize the financial system, absent corrective action. Restoring consistency between the scope of government support and the scope of government supervision is essential to a healthy and sustainable financial system. One option is simply to adapt our regulatory and supervisory regime to the new wider implied reach of government lending support. This strikes me as an unattractive option, if for no other reason than the current uncertainty about the outer bounds of that support. Constraining moral hazard in such a regime would be an immense and daunting task. I take it as given, therefore, that the scope of financial safety net ultimately must be rolled back.\n\nAssessing the effects of financial market turmoil on real economic spending is not as straightforward as it might seem. One popular notion is that the credit market disruptions we've seen over the last year or so impede the financial sector's ability and willingness to extend credit to households and business firms, thereby creating an additional drag on spending. The widely observed correlations between economic activity and measures of bank credit extension lend support to this theory. But causation can flow in the opposite direction as well. When overall economic activity seems poised to contract, the outlook for household income and business revenues deteriorates as well, and such borrowers become less creditworthy, all else constant. My reading of the history of U.S. business cycles is that the direct effect of credit markets on real activity — the so-called \"credit channel\" — accounts for only a small part of the variation in output over the typical cycle. And my reading of current conditions is that bank lending is constrained more now by the supply of creditworthy borrowers than by the supply of bank capital.\n\nThe decline in U.S. housing activity since early 2006 has affected not only credit markets — it has had a significant impact on broader economic activity as well. Residential fixed investment subtracted nearly a percentage point from GDP growth in 2006 and 2007. For a time, the weakness was isolated in the housing market, as the rest of the economy continued to expand at a relatively healthy rate. But late last year, consumer spending began to slow. Household net worth has declined as home prices have fallen virtually nationwide over the last year-and-a-half, and, more recently, equity prices have slumped. Increases in energy prices up through the middle of this year took a substantial bite out of real incomes. Moreover, payroll employment peaked last December, and has since shed 1.2 million jobs. As the labor market has weakened, wage growth has tapered off a bit. Except for the temporary bulge due to the stimulus payments earlier this year, real personal income has steadily decelerated, and is now below where it was a year ago. Given this catalog of adverse developments for U.S. households, it should be no surprise that consumer spending was sluggish in the first half of the year and has fallen significantly in recent months.\n\nThis adjustment in consumer behavior has been most pronounced in the auto market. One expects slowing real income growth to lead many households to postpone large durable good commitments, but on top of that, the oil price shock led consumers to shun less fuel-efficient vehicles. As a result, light truck sales have been particularly hard hit, falling 40 percent this year. The recent tumble in oil prices is bringing retail gasoline prices down rapidly, however, and normally one might expect this to reverse the shift toward vehicles with lower fuel consumption. But the heightened volatility in energy prices and the adverse near-term outlook for household income may be making buyers quite cautious right now. And, as if that weren't enough, the adverse economic environment has made lenders less willing to supply credit to auto dealers and consumers on the same terms as before.\n\nBecause households tend to base their consumption plans on their income prospects, any improvement in consumer spending growth likely will depend on a shift to a more optimistic assessment of those prospects. Once households are convinced that an end to the deterioration in labor market conditions and the fall in equity and home prices is in view, however, consumer spending growth will be based on improving longer-run income prospects and is likely to pickup substantially. It's too soon to tell just when that shift will occur, however.\n\nThe evolution of housing market conditions also will be critical to the resolution of uncertainty in financial markets. Housing starts have fallen by two-thirds since 2006 and are now running below the rate needed to keep up with population growth. Thus, from here the market is capable of coming into balance over time even without a significant further decline in starts. And my sense is that we are beginning to see indications that the drag from housing may lessen some time next year. Existing home sales have risen, on balance, over the last two months, and the inventory of unsold new homes has fallen 31 percent since its peak in mid-2006. I should emphasize that such signs are as yet quite tentative; inventories of unsold, vacant homes are still large in many areas of the country, and, as a result, average home prices still are declining at a steady pace. Having said that, I find it hard to believe new home construction has too much farther to fall. That would imply that residential investment will be falling on a much more gentle trajectory next year and thus will exert less of a drag on GDP.\n\nAnother major question for the economic outlook is business capital investment. Business spending on equipment and software fell at an annual rate of 2-3/4 percent in the first half of 2008, and the near-term outlook is not favorable. Many firms are facing dimmer sales prospects, higher funding costs, and more restrictive borrowing terms. Enterprises that are reducing their labor inputs are likely to want to reduce their capital inputs as well. Thus, further softening in this segment of business investment appears quite likely.\n\nThe other segment of business fixed investment, spending on new structures, has been booming recently. In 2007 and the first half of 2008, real nonresidential fixed investment grew at a 14 percent annual rate. That category seems to have topped out over the summer, and is certain to decline in coming months. These structures often take a long time to build, and many projects that were boosting spending early this year were initiated well before the turmoil in financial markets began last year. The flow of new projects has diminished considerably, however, and it is clear that nonresidential investment will slow considerably over the next year, with only the magnitude of slowing remaining uncertain.\n\nForeign trade has been an important contributor to U.S. growth recently. Net exports added over a half percentage point to real GDP growth last year, and 1.8 percentage points for the first half of 2008. Unfortunately, the trade contribution to U.S. growth is likely to decline in the near term in response to diminishing world growth prospects and the recent strength in the dollar. Accordingly, we can't count on the foreign sector to offset weak domestic demand for goods and services.\n\nLooking ahead, many analysts expect the U.S. economy to regain positive momentum sometime in 2009. That strikes me as a reasonable expectation, for several reasons. First, monetary policy is now quite stimulative. The federal funds target rate is 1 percent, below the expected rate of inflation. Second, the major shocks that dampened economic activity this past year have subsided already or are in the process of doing so. Energy prices, thankfully, have reversed most of the earlier run-up; that will free up a portion of consumer budgets for spending on other goods and services. And as I've mentioned, the drag from housing seems likely to lessen in the next year, and in fact, I would be surprised if we don't see a bottom in housing construction around the middle of 2009. This is the third straight year, however, that I've been expecting a bottom in the housing market in the middle of next year, so my outlook is tempered by more than the usual amount of humility.\n\nWhile the downturn in real economic activity is going to pose challenges for monetary policy in the period ahead, it's essential that we not let inflation drift from view. In 2006, the price index for personal consumption expenditure (in short, the PCE price index) rose an unwelcome 2.3 percent, above the 1.5 percent rate I would like to see over time. Last year inflation was much worse, with the PCE price index rising 3.5 percent. And so far this year, that index has risen at a 4.0 percent annual rate. Much of that acceleration reflects energy prices, and with oil prices down it would be reasonable to expect overall inflation to subside with a lag. And indeed we have seen more contained inflation numbers for August, September and October.\n\nMany economists are forecasting a decline in core inflation as well in the months ahead, on the grounds that widening economic slack is generally associated with declining price pressures. While this correlation is detectable in many datasets, I would be cautious about relying on it as a causal relationship.4\nIn particular, this relationship can shift over time as expectations about the conduct of monetary policy evolve. Those expectations will be influenced importantly by the measure of monetary stimulus provided during the downturn and how long that stimulus remains in place. It may seem premature to be worrying about how inflation behaves after the recession is over, but we need to be sure our policy remains consistent with a strategy that does not allow inflation to ratchet up over the business cycle. As the recovery begins, the path of least resistance is often to hold the policy rate at a low level until it is completely clear that recuperation is complete. The risk associated with that path is that inflation may not moderate obediently during the downturn, and may firm with the ensuing recovery. It is crucial that we not allow expectations of future inflation to creep higher during this recession.\n\n\n\nAs I said at the outset, these are not the best of economic times. We have weathered economic downturns before, however, both nationally and globally. And there is no sign that the fundamental creative process that drives innovation and improves well-being over time has been mortally wounded. What sets this episode apart is the nature of the turmoil plaguing the financial sector, and the array of unprecedented government lending programs. While navigating the slowdown in real economic growth is a challenge, the larger and more significant challenge will be to re-establish the boundaries around central bank lending and public sector support and accordingly reconstruct the relationship between the public sector and financial markets. How well this challenge is met will determine the extent to which innovation, despite the associated volatility, will continue to contribute to the effectiveness of our financial system and to overall economic growth.",

        "highlights": "",
        "content": "The theme of this conference — “Lessons Learned from the Subprime Crisis” — appears to be a timely one, but there have been several times during the past year when I thought it was a good time to initiate projects to identify “lessons learned,” only to discover that the “crisis” was not yet over.1\nI sincerely hope that this conference does turn out to be timely, in the sense that we truly are past the peak of the current turmoil.\n\n\n\nThis episode undoubtedly will inspire a great deal of research in the years ahead, and it may take some time before anything like a professional consensus emerges on causes and consequences. After all, it took several decades to document the causes of the Great Depression, and recent research continues to provide new perspectives.2\nNonetheless, I believe the central questions that are likely to occupy researchers are plainly in view, and some tentative lessons have emerged already. And in any event, legislators are not likely to await the fruits of future scholarship.\n\n\n\nI will divide my discussion into two parts, reflecting two distinct time periods — the boom in housing and housing finance and the subsequent turmoil in financial markets — and then conclude with some thoughts about what lies ahead. As always, the views I will express are my own assessments, and are not necessarily shared by others in the Federal Reserve.\n\nThe expansion in mortgage lending that preceded the recent turmoil in financial markets is best viewed as a component of the long boom in housing activity that began in the mid-1990s and peaked in late 2005 and early 2006. Hard work will be required to estimate the quantitative contribution of various causal factors to the rise in subprime mortgage lending and the increase in subprime losses. In the meantime, the list of plausible suspects is reasonably clear. First, real per capita income grew more rapidly in the decade after 1995 than in the decade before. Second, real interest rates were relatively low over this period, especially after the recession earlier this decade. Low real interest rates in part reflected large capital inflows, but the Federal Open Market Committee kept the federal funds target rate low in 2003, and raised rates only gradually starting in mid-2004. Some economists have argued that tighter monetary policy during that period would have led to better outcomes by preventing core inflation from rising. While I find this view plausible, I believe further research will be required to substantiate this hypothesis.\n\nThe third contributing factor was the technologically-driven wave of innovation in retail credit delivery that allowed lenders to make finer distinctions between borrowers. This lowered borrowing costs for many borrowers and expanded the availability of credit to borrowers formerly viewed as unworthy of credit.3\nAs in any industry undergoing significant innovation — credit cards in the 1990s are a good example — natural evolution can involve overshooting and retrenchment.\n\n\n\nFourth, the regulatory and supervisory regime surrounding U.S. housing finance probably contributed to the boom in housing and housing finance. Here, several factors deserve mention. Supervisory agencies, like borrowers, lenders and investors, assigned a low probability to the possibility of an adverse housing demand shift of the magnitude and geographic extent that we have seen. Private sector incentives to foresee and protect against such shocks were to some extent dampened by the presence of the federal financial safety net, including the inferred prospect of support for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. The safety net probably also played a role in banks’ involvement in the securitization process. Banks’ use of off-balance sheet arrangements and provision of back-up lines of credit created state-contingent exposures for the banking system that by design were most likely to be realized in generally bad states of the world, when the safety-net protection of the formal banking sector would be most valuable. Official policies aimed at increasing home-ownership also provided at least some positive inducement to risk-taking in housing finance. In addition, the unscrupulous and fraudulent practices of some mortgage brokers outside of the banking sector may have contributed to the problem.\n\nAlthough the housing boom will, as I said, inspire a great deal of research in the years ahead, some lessons have emerged already and have motivated corrective action, both by market participants and policymakers. The appetite of banks and investors for nontraditional and subprime mortgages and for the services of independent mortgage brokers has been reduced substantially, and many mortgage companies have gone out of business. Banks and mortgage originators have tightened home mortgage underwriting standards significantly, reflecting both revised assessments of the profitability of more innovative lending approaches and a generally weakening economic outlook. Financial market investors that held mortgage-backed securities have been penalized heavily, and have reassessed a range of complex securitization products. The Federal Reserve has tightened standards over unfair and deceptive mortgage lending practices. Supervisory staff have intensified their scrutiny of risk management practices related to structured finance and off-balance-sheet activities, and have worked to strengthen institutions’ capital and liquidity planning. And the U.S. banking agencies have worked together with nonprofits and mortgage servicers to prevent unnecessary foreclosures.4\n\n\n\nApart from these relatively focused responses, broader questions have been raised about the extent to which policy should attempt to dampen broad swings in credit or asset prices. When a boom in an industry or sector occurs, there is typically uncertainty about how large and how long that expansion will be. Market participants act on the information and signals provided to them, and this process generally leads to a reasonably efficient allocation of goods and services — and capital. But people can make mistakes in judging market trends, and sometimes similar mistakes are made by many people at once. This can lead to decisions that many later regret, and, arguably, is what happened during the housing boom. One might argue that it should have been obvious that prices had become unsustainably high. But borrowers and lenders — and regulators for that matter – could not have been perfectly certain when the market peak was about to be reached. I am wary, therefore, of attempting to use regulation to dampen swings in credit or asset prices. Such swings are often associated with surges in innovation, so countervailing intervention would inevitably risk suppressing the technological progress that has been so valuable over the years in improving consumer well-being.\n\nIn the middle of 2007, the potential scale of the home mortgage losses became more widely appreciated, and financial markets have been displaying the effects ever since. Financial market participants have faced three major categories of uncertainty. The first concerns the aggregate amount of losses on mortgage lending. The housing market has yet to bottom and cumulative loss rates still are rising for mortgages made in 2006 and early 2007, so it may be some time before total mortgage lending losses are known.\n\nSecond, financial market participants face uncertainty about where the losses will turn up. Mortgage risks were split up and spread widely, both within the United States and Europe, and around the world, through securitization and use of the insurance capabilities provided by credit derivative contracts. Financial market participants thus have been understandably apprehensive about whether a particular counterparty’s mortgage-related losses will erode their capital buffer enough to threaten their viability.\n\nThird, market participants have at times faced uncertainty about prospective public sector intervention. The disparate responses to potential failures at several high-profile organizations this year probably made it more difficult for market participants to forecast whether and in what form official support would be forthcoming for a given counterparty. Shifts in expectations regarding official intervention may have added volatility to financial markets that already were roiled by an increasingly uncertain growth outlook. In the absence of clearly understood policy principles governing such actions, markets were left to draw inferences from each successive initiative. Until boundaries around such government actions are delineated, markets will be forced to cope with these additional uncertainties.\n\nDiscussions of the role of the central bank as a lender of last resort often appeal to Walter Bagehot’s classic prescription: “Lend freely at a high rate, on good collateral.”6 But Bagehot’s teachings are not directly relevant to modern central bank lending. Lending by modern interest-rate-targeting central banks is by necessity sterilized. By itself, a central bank loan increases both the liabilities and assets of the central bank. The additional reserves would tend to drive the interest rate below the target, so central banks generally sterilize their lending operations via offsetting asset sales.7 In Bagehot’s time, however, unsterilized lending was the only way for the central bank to prevent a spike in interest rates by elastically increasing the supply of central bank money when the demand for it rose in a crisis. In other words, Bagehot’s dictum was about monetary policy — that is, the size of the central bank’s balance sheet — not credit policy, which alters just the composition of a central bank’s asset holdings.\n\nInterest rate spikes were a common feature of the many U.S. financial panics in the late 19th century, up through the Panic of 1907. The Federal Reserve was founded in 1913 in order to respond to panic-induced increases in the demand for money by expanding the supply of money through unsterilized discount window lending, not the sterilized lending that is common today. Today, central banks respond to increases in money demand through open market purchases, in order to prevent interest rates from rising.\n\nThe initial phase of the Great Depression, from 1930 through 1933, saw another financial crisis in which large numbers of banks failed. One popular reading of the history of that time is that aggressive lending by the Fed to prevent those failures could have forestalled or reduced the severity of the downturn in economic activity. The implied lesson is that central banks should lend aggressively in a crisis. The Great Depression continues to be the subject of debate, but I think it is important to note that Federal Reserve policy also brought about a sharp sustained contraction in the price level and quite elevated real interest rates.9 One could argue, therefore, that the correct lesson to draw from 1930-33 is that the Fed failed to follow the Bagehot prescription for (unsterilized) lending — that is, the Fed did not prevent deflation by lowering interest rates and maintaining an adequate supply of money. In other words, the onset of Great Depression was a failure of Federal Reserve monetary policy — that is, interest rate policy — not a failure of Fed credit policy. This, of course, is the argument of Milton Friedman and Anna Schwartz in their Monetary History of the United States.10\n\nThe striking feature of central bank lending during the recent turmoil is the extent to which it has extended well beyond the boundaries that previously were understood to constrain such lending, both in the range of institutions and the contractual terms on which credit has been provided. Intervention has been driven by a desire to prevent damaging disruptions to financial markets, and thus reduce the overall costs of the turmoil. While this objective is clearly understandable, central bank lending can create the expectation that similar support will be forthcoming when market disruptions occur in the future. Such expectations can themselves be very costly, because they can distort the incentives faced by, and as a result, the choices made by private-sector participants. For example, in the past year, expectation of official support may have induced some firms to take the risk of turning down capital infusions or merger offers in hopes of finding better terms in the future. Prospective equity investors may have demanded stiffer terms to compensate for the possibility of dilutive government intervention. Clearly, these contemporary examples of the moral hazard effects are detrimental to public policy objectives.\n\nThe critical policy question of our time is where to establish the boundaries around the public sector safety net provided to financial market participants, now that the old boundaries are gone. Such support inevitably distorts the choices of beneficiaries, and costly regulatory and supervisory efforts are required to contain those distortions. A key design consideration, therefore, concerns the offsetting benefits of official intervention in credit markets. Such intervention typically is justified by a desire to prevent or lessen a severe disruption of the market that might result from the unassisted failure of a large financial institution. Such disruptions often are described in vivid metaphors, using terms like “frozen,” “clogged,” or “dried up.” But these are just ways of saying that quantities are lower, and, by themselves, such adjectives are devoid of analytical content. To evaluate the benefits of intervention, we ultimately need to move beyond metaphors and look for clear and coherent descriptions — theories, in other words — of market function and market dysfunction. Future research on the current turmoil and future assessments of current policy will turn on which theories accord best with the observational evidence.\n\nThe standard theory of financial markets is based on the notion that markets are a reasonably effective mechanism for aggregating dispersed information about asset fundamentals, so that changes in observed prices correspond to changes in markets participants’ beliefs about future payment streams. Under this view, of course, central bank or government intervention that raises the price of an asset represents a subsidy to those holding the asset and drives the price away from the asset’s true economic value. The limitations of the standard approach to asset pricing have led to the development of theories built on frictions that cause market prices to deviate from the standard results. Some of these theories have the implication that market performance might be improved by central bank lending or other official intervention.\n\nOne commonly cited market malfunction is based on coordination failures that take the form of bank runs, especially runs that have the self-fulfilling property that market participants pull their funds simply because they think that others are doing so.11 The potential for run-like behavior is thought to extend to short-term debt markets as well. The existence of a lender of last resort or other elements of the financial safety net can prevent such market breakdowns. But I think future researchers are likely to be critical of bank run theories as a motivation for sterilized central bank lending in this particular episode. Runs can also occur as a rational, and sometimes even necessary, response to fundamental deterioration in an institution or the assets it holds. My sense of the accumulated evidence is that it is hard to find examples of purely self-fulfilling runs — that is, runs not plausibly warranted by changing fundamentals.12 Not all rapid portfolio shifts represent runs that necessitate official intervention. Moreover, financial entities often can protect themselves from runs by structuring their borrowing arrangements appropriately.\n\nAnother type of market imperfection is the notion that asset prices can deviate from their fundamental values when some participants are forced to sell their holdings rapidly (to meet a margin call for example) and are forced to take whatever price is offered, even a price that commonly is known to be much less than the asset’s true economic value.13 The logic of such “fire sale” prices relies on market segmentation, that is, some impediment that prevents the sale to another investor with both the resources to make a purchase and knowledge of the asset’s fundamental value. Throughout this turmoil, however, it has been widely known that large amounts of money were “sitting on the sidelines.” In this age of integrated global financial markets, I find it hard to envision something — other than those investors’ doubts about the value of these assets — that has been artificially impeding investors’ entry into the markets for depressed assets.\n\nA broader motivation for public sector support at times like these is the notion that credit market disruptions that reduce the banking sector’s capital can impede banks’ ability and willingness to extend credit to households and business firms, thereby creating an additional drag on spending and growth. The widely observed correlations between economic activity and measures of bank credit extension lend support to this theory. But causation can flow in the opposite direction as well. When overall economic activity seems poised to contract, the outlook for household income and business revenues deteriorates as well, and such borrowers become less creditworthy, all else constant. My reading of the history of U.S. business cycles is that the direct effect of credit markets on real activity — the so-called “credit channel” — accounts for only a small part of the variation in output over the typical cycle. And my reading of current conditions is that bank lending is constrained more now by the supply of creditworthy borrowers than by the supply of bank capital.\n\nAs I said earlier, the critical policy challenge for our time is to re-establish the boundaries of central bank lending and public support. In doing so, the prime directive should be that the extent of regulatory and supervisory oversight should be commensurate with the extent of access to central bank credit in order to contain moral hazard effectively. The dramatic recent expansion in Federal Reserve lending, and government support more broadly, has extended public sector support beyond existing supervisory reach, and thus could destabilize the financial system, absent corrective action. Restoring consistency between the scope of government support and the scope of government supervision is essential to a healthy and sustainable financial system. One option is simply to adapt our regulatory and supervisory regime to the new wider implied reach of government lending support.14 This strikes me as an unattractive option, if for no other reason than the current uncertainty about the outer bounds of that support. Constraining moral hazard in such a regime would be an immense and daunting task. I take it as given, therefore, that the scope of the financial safety net ultimately must be rolled back.\n\nThe question then becomes where to establish the boundaries of a combined safety net and supervisory regime. The appropriate answer to that question depends in turn on fundamental questions surrounding the functioning of financial markets. As my remarks suggest, my reading of the research on financial arrangements has left me generally skeptical regarding conjectures of broad financial market dysfunction. This is not because I am sanguine about the inherent stability of less-constrained financial markets, but because it seems reasonable to expect a measure of instability even in reasonably well-functioning markets. Accordingly, I would favor narrower rather than broader public sector support for the financial system.\n\nHowever the critical scope question is answered, a crucial constraint on the new regime is that it be time consistent — that is, a commitment not to provide support beyond the new policy boundaries should be credible. My former colleague Marvin Goodfriend and I wrote about this problem 10 years ago.15 We noted that central banks’ implied responsibility for financial stability “can create pressure to expand the scope of central bank lending to nonbank financial institutions.” We predicted “a tendency for central banks to overextend lending,” and an increase in the rate of financial distress over time “as market participants come to understand the range of the central bank’s actual (implicit) commitment to lend.”\n\nProfessor Goodfriend and I considered several methods by which the central bank might credibly commit to limit lending, and we concluded that there were no effective substitutes for building a reputation for doing so. We noted that the experience by which central banks around the world built reputations for maintaining low inflation provided a road map for how to credibly limit lending. Essential to that process is for the central bank to, at times, disappoint expectations and refuse to lend, even at the cost of short run financial market disruption.\n\nSo perhaps the central lesson from recent events is that establishing new safety-net boundaries that are credible and sustainable will be a very difficult task. But finding a way of establishing credible boundaries is essential if we wish to maintain a financial system that includes both institutions that are protected and regulated by the public sector and institutions that are regulated primarily through market discipline. I believe this mix is important to achieving a balance between the safety that comes from government involvement and the innovation that, despite the associated volatility, has added much to the effectiveness of our financial system and to overall economic growth.",

        "content": "We gather during economically trying times, both in the United States and increasingly around the globe. In my remarks this morning, I would like to discuss the factors I see affecting the outlook for the U.S. economy and monetary policy. As always, I speak only for myself, and not for my Federal Reserve System colleagues.1\n\n\n\nFinancial market conditions loom large in any discussion of the economy these days. The heart of the problem of course is the home mortgages made from late 2005 through early 2007, near the end of long U.S. housing boom that began in 1995. Since the peak in activity in 2005, housing investment has fallen 39 percent. Average housing prices, as measured by the FHFA repeat sales index, have fallen 6.5 percent since their peak in April 2007. Some markets have experienced more dramatic declines; the home price index for California fell 18 percent, for example. The resulting erosion in home equity for many borrowers has meant that mortgages made near the peak of the boom, especially the subprime and non-traditional categories, are experiencing much larger losses than expected.\n\nIt will take years of research to untangle the quantitative contribution of various causal factors to the rise in subprime mortgage lending and the increase in subprime losses, so I won't attempt such an analysis here. But the list of plausible suspects is clear. First, technological innovation in retail credit delivery allowed lenders to make finer distinctions between borrowers and profitably expand lending to borrowers formerly unworthy of credit. As in any industry in the midst of undergoing innovation, such as credit cards in the 1990s for example, natural evolution can involve overshooting and retrenchment. Related, subprime lending with high loan-to-value ratios was profitable while home prices were rapidly rising, but profitability fell sharply when price trends reversed. Lenders who found past subprime mortgage lending profitable in 2004, 2005 and 2006, may have underestimated the probability of a broad and sustained decline in home prices and how that would affect their lending returns.\n\nSecond, the regulatory and supervisory framework surrounding U.S. housing finance may have been insufficiently prepared for the possibility of an adverse housing demand shift of the magnitude and geographic extent that we have seen. Private sector incentives to foresee and protect against such shocks was to some extent dampened by the presence of the federal financial safety net, including the inferred prospect of support for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Official policies aimed at increasing home-ownership also provided at least some positive inducement to risk-taking in housing finance. In addition, the unscrupulous and fraudulent practices of some mortgage brokers outside of the banking sector may have contributed to the problem. While anecdotes of such incidents abound, this has been a particularly difficult factor to quantify.\n\nThird, monetary policy kept interest rates relatively low after the recession earlier this decade. The federal funds rate was 1 percent from mid-2003 through mid-2004, and then increased at just ½ percentage point per quarter. Some economists have argued that tighter monetary policy during that period would have led to better outcomes by limiting the housing boom and thus mitigating the subsequent bust.2\nWhile I find this view plausible, again, further research will be required to substantiate this hypothesis.\n\n\n\nAlthough this episode will, as I said, inspire a great deal of research in the years ahead, some lessons have emerged already and have motivated corrective action, both by market participants and policymakers. The appetite of banks and investors for nontraditional and subprime mortgages and for the services of independent mortgage brokers has been substantially reduced, and many mortgage companies have gone out of business. Banks and mortgage originators have tightened home mortgage underwriting standards significantly, reflecting both revised assessments of the profitability of more innovative lending approaches and a generally weakening economic outlook. Financial market investors holding complex mortgage-related securitizations have been suitably chastened. The Federal Reserve has tightened standards over unfair and deceptive mortgage lending practices. Supervisory staff have intensified their scrutiny of risk management practices related to structured finance and off-balance-sheet activities, and have worked to strengthen institutions' capital and liquidity planning. And the U.S. banking agencies have worked together with nonprofits and mortgage servicers to prevent unnecessary foreclosures.\n\nThat's all prologue, however, to the turmoil that has plagued financial markets since the middle of last year when the potential scale of the home mortgage problem became more widely appreciated. The turmoil intensified the week of September 15th, and volatility has been elevated since. Financial market participants have faced three major categories of uncertainty. The first concerns the aggregate amount of losses on mortgage lending. For a given mortgage cohort, it typically takes four years or longer to realize a substantial portion of their ultimate cumulative losses. For mortgages made in 2006 and early 2007, we are, at most, two years into that process, and thus significant uncertainty remains regarding total losses on those vintages.\n\nSecond, financial market participants face uncertainty about where the losses will turn up. Mortgage risks were split up and spread widely both within the United States and in Europe through securitization and use of the insurance capabilities provided by credit derivative contracts. Moreover, the performance of different mortgage pools can depend critically on subtle differences in the practices of the originating institution and the servicer. As a result, assessing the value of any given mortgage portfolio is a costly enterprise right now. Financial market participants are thus understandably apprehensive about whether a particular counterparty's mortgage-related losses will erode their capital buffer enough to threaten their viability. This has led to elevated risk premia in interbank credit markets for institutions with at least some presumed mortgage-related exposure. These premia appear to vary significantly across institutions, however, suggesting a fair amount of public knowledge of institutions' relative exposures and capital positions.\n\nThird, market participants have at times faced uncertainty about prospective public sector intervention.3\nThe disparate responses to potential failures at several high-profile organizations this year may have made it difficult for market participants to forecast whether and in what form official support would be forthcoming for a given counterparty. Shifts in expectations regarding official intervention may have added volatility to financial asset markets that were already roiled by an increasingly uncertain growth outlook.\n\n\n\nAssessing the effects of financial market turmoil on real economic spending is not as straightforward as it might seem. The conventional wisdom is that the credit market disruptions we've seen over the last year or so impede the financial sector's ability and willingness to extend credit to households and business firms, thereby creating an additional drag on spending. But causation can flow in the opposite direction as well. When overall economic activity seems poised to contract, the outlook for household income and business revenues deteriorates as well. This implies that individual households and businesses will become less creditworthy, all else constant. So it's hard to disentangle the effect of lenders' increased cost of capital from the deterioration in the economic environment facing their borrowers. More broadly, my reading of the history of U.S. business cycles is that the direct effect of credit markets on real activity – the so-called \"credit channel\" – accounts for only a small part of the variation in output over the typical cycle. This judgment may be of limited help in thinking about the rather atypical events we have been experiencing recently, but I think it means we have to give serious consideration to the idea that this episode of credit and financial market turmoil is part of the economy's natural response to the sharp decline in the underlying fundamentals in housing finance. My sense is that the deterioration of economic conditions is playing a more prominent role in the tightening of credit terms right now than the direct effects of financial market turbulence.\n\nThe decline in U.S. housing activity since early 2006 has affected not only credit markets – it has had a significant impact on broader economic activity as well. Residential fixed investment subtracted nearly a percentage point from GDP growth in 2006 and 2007. For a time, the weakness was isolated in the housing market, as the rest of the economy continued to expand at a relatively healthy rate. But late last year, consumer spending began to slow. Household net worth has declined as home prices have fallen virtually nationwide over the last year-and-a-half, and, more recently, equity prices have slumped. Increases in energy prices up through the middle of this year took a substantial bite out of real incomes. Moreover, payroll employment peaked last December, and has since shed 760,000 jobs. As the labor market has weakened, wage growth has tapered off a bit. Except for the temporary bulge due to the stimulus payments earlier this year, real personal income has steadily decelerated, and in August stood barely one-tenth of a percent above where it was last September. Given this catalog of adverse developments for U.S. households, it should be no surprise that consumer spending was sluggish in the first half of the year and has fallen significantly in recent months.\n\nThis adjustment in consumer behavior has been most pronounced in the auto market. One expects slowing real income growth to lead many households to postpone large durable good commitments, but on top of that, the oil price shock led consumers to shun less fuel-efficient vehicles. Manufacturers, however, have capital investments in place to produce these less-fuel-efficient vehicles, and changing the product mix is a lengthy and expensive process. As a result, light truck sales have been particularly hard hit, falling almost 24 percent this year. The recent tumble in oil prices is bringing retail gasoline prices down rapidly, however, and normally one might expect this to reverse the shift toward vehicles with lower fuel consumption. But the heightened volatility in energy prices and the adverse longer-term outlook for supply and demand may be making buyers quite cautious about choosing among automotive technologies right now. And, as if that weren't enough, the adverse economic environment has made lenders less willing to supply credit to auto dealers and consumers on the same terms as before.\n\nBecause households tend to base their consumption plans on their income prospects, any improvement in consumer spending growth likely will depend on a shift to a more optimistic assessment of those prospects. Once households are convinced that an end to the deterioration in labor market conditions and the fall in equity and home prices is in view, however, consumer spending growth will be based on improving longer-run income prospects and is likely to pickup substantially.\n\nThe evolution of housing market conditions also will be critical to the resolution of uncertainty in financial markets. Housing starts have fallen 64 percent from their peak in early 2006 to an 817,000 unit annual rate. That's below the rate needed to keep up with population growth, and, thus, from here the market is capable of coming into balance over time even without a significant further decline in starts. And my sense is that we are beginning to see indications that the drag from housing may lessen some time next year. Existing home sales have risen, on balance, over the last two months, and the inventory of unsold new homes has fallen 30 percent since its peak in mid-2006. I should emphasize that such signs are as yet quite tentative; inventories of unsold, vacant homes are still large in many areas of the country, and, as a result, average home prices still are declining at a steady pace. Having said that, I find it hard to believe new home construction has too much farther to fall. That would imply that residential investment will be falling on a much more gentle trajectory next year and thus will exert less of a drag on GDP.\n\nAnother major question for the economic outlook is business capital investment. Business spending on equipment and software fell at an annual rate of 2-3/4 percent in the first half of 2008, and the near-term outlook is not favorable. Many firms are facing dimmer sales prospects, higher funding costs, and more restrictive borrowing terms. Enterprises that are reducing their labor inputs are likely to want to reduce their capital inputs as well. Thus, further softening in this segment of business investment appears quite likely.\n\nThe other segment of business fixed investment, spending on new structures, has been booming recently. In 2007 and the first half of 2008, real nonresidential fixed investment grew at a 19 percent annual rate. That category seems to have topped out over the summer, and is certain to decline in coming months. These structures often take a long time to build, and many projects that were boosting spending early this year were initiated well before the turmoil in financial markets began last year. The flow of new projects has diminished considerably, however, and it is clear that nonresidential investment will slow considerably over the next year, with only the magnitude of slowing remaining uncertain.\n\nForeign trade has been an important contributor to U.S. growth recently. Net exports added over a half percentage point to real GDP growth last year, and 1.8 percentage points for the first half of 2008. Unfortunately, the trade contribution to U.S. growth is likely to decline in the near term in response to diminishing world growth prospects and the recent strength in the dollar. Accordingly, we can't count on the foreign sector to offset weak domestic demand for goods and services.\n\nLooking ahead, many analysts expect the U.S. economy to regain positive momentum sometime in 2009. That strikes me as a reasonable expectation, for several reasons. First, monetary policy is now quite stimulative. The federal funds target rate is 1 percent, below the expected rate of inflation. Second, the major shocks that dampened economic activity this past year have already subsided or are in the process of doing so. Energy prices, thankfully, have reversed most of the earlier run-up; that will free up a portion of consumer budgets for spending on other goods and services. And as I've mentioned, the drag from housing seems likely to lessen in the next year, and in fact, I would be surprised if we don't see a bottom in housing construction around the middle of 2009. This is the third straight year, however, that I've been expecting a bottom in the housing market in the middle of next year, so my outlook is tempered by more than the usual amount of humility.\n\nWhile the downturn in real economic activity is going to pose challenges for monetary policy in the period ahead, it's essential that we not let inflation drift from view. In 2006, the price index for personal consumption expenditure (in short, the PCE price index) rose an unwelcome 2.3 percent, above the 1.5 percent rate I would like to see over time. Last year inflation was much worse, with the PCE price index rising 3.5 percent. And so far this year, that index has risen at a 4.4 percent annual rate. Much of that acceleration reflects energy prices, and with oil prices down it would be reasonable to expect overall inflation to subside with a lag. So let's consider the core PCE price index, which omits the volatile food and energy categories. That index rose 2.2 percent in 2006, 2.3 percent in 2007, and has risen at a 2.6 percent annual rate so far this year.\n\nThe sharp decline in oil prices since they peaked this summer has flattened the overall inflation rate in August and September. Many economists are forecasting a decline in core inflation as well in the months ahead, on the grounds that widening economic slack is generally associated with declining price pressures. While this correlation is detectable in many datasets, I would be cautious about relying on it as a causal relationship.4\nIn particular, this relationship can shift over time as expectations about the conduct of monetary policy evolve. Those expectations will be influenced importantly by the measure of monetary stimulus provided during the downturn and how long that stimulus remains in place. As a recovery begins, the path of least resistance is often to hold the policy rate at a low level until it is completely clear that recuperation is complete. The risk associated with that path is that inflation may not moderate obediently during the downturn, and may firm with the ensuing recovery. It is crucial that we not allow expectations of future inflation to ratchet higher during this recession.\n\n\n\nWith growth falling and inflation elevated, these would seem to qualify as trying times by any reasonable standards, even without consideration of the challenges posed by the banking sector. We have weathered economic downturns, inflation pressures, and banking distress before, however, both nationally and globally. And there is no sign that the fundamental creative process that drives innovation and improves well-being over time has been mortally wounded. This episode, however, has given us the opportunity to deepen our understanding of the relationship between financial instability and real economic activity and about the effects of an array of policy responses. What is learned, both by policymakers and the public, can strengthen us by improving our policy, our institutions, and our financial system. For me, that's the silver lining.",

        "content": "It's a pleasure to speak to you today. My topic is the current economic situation and the outlook for the period ahead. Before we begin, though, let me remind you that the usual disclaimer applies: The views I express are my own and are not necessarily shared by any of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee.1\n\n\n\nThe background for today's economic situation is the remarkable boom in housing that ended a couple of years ago. From 1995 to 2005, new housing starts increased by more than 50 percent, and existing home prices increased by more than 150 percent (as measured by the Case-Shiller repeat sales index), and the homeownership rate increased significantly, from around 64 percent to 69 percent. Favorable fundamentals contributed to the boom; per capita real income grew much more rapidly in the decade after 1995 than in the decade before, and real mortgage interest rates were low relative to prior periods, especially after 2002. The inelasticity of the supply of buildable lots generated significant price increases in many parts of our country. Elsewhere, price appreciation was more modest. Housing demand ultimately became satiated in many major markets, however, and housing activity peaked in early 2006 in several regions. Since then, new housing starts have fallen by 55 percent, and since mid-2006, home prices have fallen by 18 percent.\n\nDevelopments in housing finance arguably have played a substantial role in the behavior of housing markets in recent years. Here, I believe the central story is the technology-driven wave of innovation in retail credit delivery that dramatically expanded access to mortgage credit over the last decade, just as it expanded access to unsecured consumer credit earlier on. Technology also has contributed to innovation in securitization and other forms of intermediation of credit flows, which also helped lower borrowing costs. As with any new product or service innovation, however, some experimentation and risk were involved. In hindsight, it seems clear that the success of new methods of lending to riskier borrowers was to some extent dependent on sustained home price appreciation, which provided strained borrowers with the ability to refinance, thus masking the effects of more inclusive underwriting. When housing prices began to fall in many regions, delinquencies and defaults began to rise, particularly among mortgages that were made in 2006 and 2007. It takes some time, however, for the likely ultimate loss experience of a mortgage portfolio to become evident, so it wasn't until the middle of last year, well after home prices peaked in some major markets, that more quantitative evidence emerged regarding the substantial extent to which mortgage loans made in 2006 would underperform previous vintages. The ensuing adjustment in underwriting standards further contributed to the decline in housing demand.\n\nThe resulting large number of mortgage foreclosures is an urgent problem and it is one that we at the Fed are responding to with direct actions. The Federal Reserve System's Homeownership and Mortgage Initiatives is a multi-pronged effort to understand and respond to this recent rise in foreclosures. First, we are using our extensive expertise in economic research and analysis to increase our understanding of the events. We are tracking conditions in mortgage and housing markets and conducting ongoing research to fill important gaps in our knowledge. What we learn we are communicating to the public through a variety of audiences. For example, we are providing community groups with analysis that identifies neighborhoods with high rates of foreclosures, so that they can better target their home-counseling efforts. We have organized foreclosure forums across the country with the theme, \"Recovery, Renewal, and Rebuilding.\" We just held the first one in Atlanta and four more are scheduled through the fall. Furthermore, we also have posted interactive maps on the New York Fed's Web site showing the incidence and performance of subprime mortgages across the country.\n\nSecond, we are using our extensive footprint across the nation to engage and collaborate with relevant parties, such as community groups, government officials and lenders, to help them take practical steps to address this problem. We are partnering with Neighborworks America by providing analysis and developing tools and training programs for their efforts at stabilizing neighborhoods and dealing with the problem of vacant properties. Furthermore, we have hosted and continue to host many meetings and workshops designed to bring together stakeholders who are interested in reducing the incidence and effects of foreclosures. In sum, the array of efforts under the Fed's Homeownership and Mortgage Initiatives aims to leverage the Fed's comparative advantages in research and geographic reach to assist local responses to the mortgage foreclosure problem.\n\nThe story behind the drama in credit markets since last August has been the continuing re-assessment of the fundamental value of nonprime mortgages. I think it's fair to say that a deterioration in the housing market of the magnitude we've seen was not assigned much probability by most borrowers, lenders and investors, even if many observers argue, in retrospect, that it should have been foreseen. As losses have accumulated, demand has fallen for financial securities exposed to those assets, as well as a range of related securities. Many of these securities were the liabilities of entities with explicit or implicit bank lending guarantees. Many banks that provided such guarantees have had to either meet large funding demands or bring the impaired assets onto their balance sheets. Uncertainty about the scale of such adjustments has generally meant higher funding and capital costs, although risk premia have increased far more for some institutions than for others.\n\nAfter the housing market peaked, the steady fall in home construction became a sizable drag on growth. Last year, the decline in residential investment subtracted about a percentage point from real GDP growth, and in the first quarter of this year, it lowered growth by more than 1 percentage point. Moreover, swollen inventories of unsold homes continue to depress prices and new construction. For example, the vacancy rate for owner-occupied housing was 2.9 percent in the first quarter, which is the highest value recorded in the 52-year history of that particular data series. Most lenders have eliminated many riskier innovative mortgage products from their line-ups, which makes sense given what has been learned from the recent performance of such products. But that makes homeownership more costly than it was during the boom and will slow down the housing market recovery. Thus, most observers are very hesitant about calling a bottom in housing construction, sales or prices, a hesitancy that I share. And even if housing market activity does manage to bottom out later this year, it is likely that any recovery would be exceedingly slow.\n\nUntil early this year, the bad news has been limited to housing, but that's no longer the case. Last year, more than 16 million cars and trucks were sold in this country; in the first quarter of 2008, the sales rate fell to 15.3 million units; and in the second quarter, the sales rate fell to 14.1 million units. Not surprisingly, motor vehicle assemblies have fallen 21 percent this year.\n\nThat's a stringent dose of bad news. But a couple of other demand components have provided somewhat brighter news of late. First, the demand for exports has been strong due to robust economic activity abroad and the weakness of the dollar in foreign exchange markets. Exports added a full percentage point to real GDP growth in 2006 and 2007 and are likely to make a healthy contribution to growth this year as well.\n\nWe also have seen surprising indicators of firmness in business investment. At the turn of the year, we began hearing anecdotal reports, both in our District and elsewhere in the country, of commercial development projects being deferred or cancelled outright. Many of us had expected to see a contraction in commercial construction by now, but since the beginning of the year private nonresidential construction has increased by more than 5 ½ percent. Still, I think it is reasonable to expect at least some slowing later this year. Commercial construction projects tend to have a fairly long lead time, and architectural billings have fallen off notably in recent months. Thus, it would not surprise me to see the pace of commercial construction soften in coming months.\n\nBusiness spending on equipment and software this year has also been firmer than I had anticipated. For example, shipments of non-defense capital goods, excluding aircraft, have increased for three straight months, and are now higher than at any point since December 2000. This category covers a large part of business equipment investment and recent reports indicate that business capital spending is holding up relatively well.\n\nReal consumer spending slowed at the very end of last year and was sluggish for the first few months of 2008, rising by an annual rate of only 1.1 percent from November through April. The slow growth in consumer spending is understandable, given the restrained growth we've seen in household income. For example, real disposable personal income increased by only 0.5 percent during the first four months of this year. Personal consumption expenditures picked up noticeably in May, but this could well be attributable to the disbursement of federal stimulus payments, so it's difficult to tell whether it represents a fundamental improvement on household spending trends.\n\nA major reason for the slow growth in household income is the weak state of labor markets. Job growth was robust in 2006, with payrolls expanding by about 175,000 jobs per month. Job growth tailed off in 2007, as the residential construction industry began shedding workers. And payrolls have fallen every month so far this year, with an average loss of 73,000 jobs per month. Consistent with this picture of a worsening labor market, the unemployment rate has risen from a cyclical low of 4.4 percent in March 2007, to 5.5 percent this June.\n\nAnother factor that has dampened real income growth is the large increases we've seen in food and energy prices. While forecasting such prices is a challenging endeavor, if they follow the relatively flat trajectory implied by futures prices, then they would no longer restrain the growth in (as opposed to the level of) real income.\n\nPutting the bad news together with the good, the story that emerges is of an economy that is growing at only a tepid pace overall. Over the last two quarters for which we have data (that is, the fourth quarter 2007 and the first quarter 2008), real GDP has grown at an annual rate of only three-quarters of a percent, which is about one-fourth of our long-run potential. Earlier this year, many observers extrapolated this slowdown into an outright decline in economic activity and concluded that the economy was in or about to enter a recession. But the data we've seen since then have not yet shown the sharp, widespread reversals that define a recession. While the risk of an acute near-term downturn has not entirely disappeared, it has diminished substantially.\n\nLooking ahead, consumer spending is likely to continue to be bolstered by the government's stimulus checks over the next few months, although the extent of the spending effect will be hard to gauge. Beyond that, there are legitimate concerns about the outlook for real growth. The timing and size of any decline in commercial construction activity is uncertain, and could hamper growth in the second half. In addition, if we see a pick-up in the pace of the labor market contraction, which so far has been relatively mild, then consumer incomes and spending are likely to slow and restrain overall economic activity going forward. Moreover, the bulk of the stimulus checks will have been distributed soon, and the effects on consumer spending could start wearing off in the fourth quarter.\n\nAt the same time, it pays to not underestimate consumer resilience. People tend to look forward and will often take transitory income shocks in stride, even severe ones. This well-grounded principle suggests the possibility that consumers will save most of their stimulus checks, as appears to have happened in May, and spread out their spending increase smoothly over time. It also suggests the possibility of renewed consumer spending growth if energy prices flatten out, as futures markets predict.\n\nIt also pays not to underestimate the power of monetary policy. The Federal Open Market Committee has lowered the federal funds rate from 5 ¼ to 2 percent in less than eight months. Adjusting for expected inflation brings the current funds rate to well below zero in real terms. Thus, we have quite generous monetary stimulus in the pipeline to support economic activity in the months ahead.\n\nOn the whole, then, I expect growth to be positive, but quite modest for the rest of this year, and to gradually pick up over the course of next year. Although the downside risks to growth are by no means negligible, they have diminished significantly to my mind since the beginning of the year.\n\nWhile the growth outlook has improved since the beginning of the year, the inflation outlook has deteriorated. The latest figures confirm that inflation is unacceptably high. The price index for personal consumption expenditure increased 3.1 percent over the 12 months that ended in May, and is up at a 3.9 percent annual rate for the last 3 months. To put that in perspective, for several years, I have suggested an inflation target of 1.5 percent.\n\nOf course, price increases have been concentrated in the food and energy categories, and taking those out, the conventional PCE core inflation rate has run slightly above 2 percent over the last year. Because core inflation has traditionally exhibited a fair amount of persistence, last year's core inflation is often a good forecast of the coming year's core inflation. The conventional approach to forecasting overall inflation is to combine that rule-of-thumb for core prices with projections for food and energy price derived from futures prices. Since futures markets have generally implied flat price paths, the result is an expectation that overall inflation will decline until it converges with core inflation.\n\nOne shouldn't ignore the information embodied in market prices, and I don't; competitive trading markets are impressively effective mechanisms for weighing and amalgamating widely divergent views. However, the deviations of actual prices from the forecasts implied by energy futures prices have been predominantly on the high side in recent years. While it is entirely possible, as a statistical matter, for this to happen due to chance alone, the risk is that elevated rates of increase in overall prices become embedded in expectations.\n\nWe seem to have dodged this risk so far. Despite several years of elevated inflation, the public's expectations for future inflation have not become completely untethered as they were in the 1970s. We have several ways of gauging expectations, none of them perfect, but they agree that inflation expectations are higher than I would like but are relatively stable. That sense of relatively stable expectations is consistent with the behavior of wages. There are no signs yet of a wage-price spiral, in which wages accelerate in a futile attempt to stay ahead of accelerating prices. In fact, gains in overall compensation have been remarkably stable over the last couple of years.\n\nThe apparent stability of inflation expectations does not justify complacency, however. Those expectations depend critically on confidence in how the Fed will tend to react to incoming data. Maintaining credibility depends on continuing to conduct policy in a way that is consistent with the stability of inflation expectations, and acting forcefully should those expectations erode.\n\nPart of the rationale for the speed with which the FOMC brought down the funds rate was the risk that the slowdown we are experiencing would prove to be more severe. While that uncertainty has not entirely disappeared, my sense is that such downside risks have diminished appreciably. And just as easing policy aggressively in response to emerging downside risks made sense, withdrawing some of that stimulus as those risks diminish makes eminent sense as well. Moreover, our attention to risks needs to be two-sided, I believe. As we move through this period of low growth, we need to be attuned to the risk that we emerge from the slowdown with inflation following a higher trend than when we went in. This danger associated with the persistence of elevated inflation warrants an additional measure of vigilance.",

        "content": "It's a pleasure to speak to you today. My topic today is the current economic situation and the outlook for the period ahead. Motivating an interest in this topic has been somewhat easier than usual in recent months. And the appearance of the word \"recession\" on a popular weekly news magazine only helps. Before we begin, though, let me remind you that the usual disclaimer applies: The views I express are my own and are not necessarily shared by any of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee.1\n\n\n\nThe background for today's economic situation is the remarkable boom in housing that ended a couple of years ago. From 1995 to 2005, new housing starts increased by over 50 percent, and existing home prices increased by over 150 percent (as measured by the Case-Shiller repeat sales index). Over that interval, the homeownership rate increased significantly, from around 64 percent to 69 percent. Eventually, however, prices grew more rapidly than incomes in many major markets, and housing activity peaked in early 2006 across a range of markets. Since then, new housing starts have fallen by 55 percent, and since mid-2006, home prices have fallen by 18 percent.\n\nA deterioration in the housing market of this magnitude was not assigned much probability by many borrowers, lenders or investors, even if, in retrospect, it appears to many observers that it should have been foreseen. The decline in homeowners' equity in many regions has led to an increase in delinquencies and defaults, particularly among mortgages that were made in 2006 and 2007. As a result, we've seen precipitous drops in the prices of many securities backed directly or indirectly by residential mortgage cash flows. The ramifications of those falling asset prices led to dramatic events in wholesale financial markets since last August.\n\nAfter the housing market peaked, the steady fall in home construction became a sizable drag on growth. Last year, the decline in residential investment subtracted about a percentage point from real GDP growth, and in the first quarter of this year, it lowered growth by 1.2 percentage points. Moreover, swollen inventories of unsold homes continue to depress prices and new construction. The vacancy rate for owner-occupied housing was 2.9 percent in the first quarter, which is the highest value recorded in the 52-year history of that particular data series. Most lenders have eliminated many riskier innovative mortgage products from their line-ups, which makes sense given the recent performance of such products, but which makes homeownership more costly than it was during the boom. Thus, most observers are very hesitant about calling a bottom in housing construction, sales or prices. And even if housing market activity does manage to bottom out later this year, it is likely that any recovery would be exceedingly slow.\n\nThe bad news has not been limited to housing. Last year, over 16 million cars and trucks were sold in this country; in the first quarter of 2008, the sales rate fell to 15.3 million units; and in April and May, the sales rate fell to 14.4 million units. Not surprisingly, motor vehicle assemblies have fallen 21 percent this year.\n\nThat's a stiff dose of bad news. But a couple of other demand components have provided somewhat brighter news of late. First, the demand for exports has been strong due to robust economic activity abroad and the weakness of the dollar in foreign exchange markets. Exports added 0.9 percent to real GDP growth in 2006 and 2007 and are likely to make a healthy contribution to growth this year as well.\n\nWe also have seen surprising indicators of firmness in business investment. At the turn of the year, we began hearing anecdotal reports, both in our District and elsewhere in the country, of commercial development projects being deferred or cancelled outright. Many of us had expected to see a contraction in commercial construction by now, but over the last three months, private nonresidential construction has increased by 4 percent. Still, I think it is reasonable to expect some slowing later this year. Much of the reported activity in recent months reflects projects that were initiated well before the tightening in commercial real estate lending terms that took place at the end of last year. As these projects move through the pipeline, it is likely that fewer new projects will take their place; indeed, we are seeing some good evidence of this in the recent falloff in architectural billings. Thus, it would not surprise me to see the pace of commercial construction soften in coming months.\n\nBusiness spending on equipment and software has also been firmer than I expected. For example, new orders for non-defense capital goods, excluding aircraft, rose 4 percent in April to their highest level since 2006. This covers a large part of business equipment investment and is a sign that business capital spending is holding up relatively well. The sense I get from our contacts is that most organizations have a large menu of options to improve and rationalize their information technology infrastructure and business processes in valuable ways, and they foresee a continual stream of spending on such projects.\n\nReal consumer spending, the largest component of demand, has been sluggish – for the first four months this year, spending rose by only 0.2 percent. The reason for the slow consumer spending growth is no mystery, since income growth has also been restrained. For example, real disposable personal income increased by only 0.5 percent for the first four months of this year. The retail sales report for May did show a noticeable pick-up in spending, but this could well be attributable to the disbursement of federal stimulus payments, so it's difficult to tell whether it represents a fundamental improvement on household spending trends.\n\nI mentioned how slowly real household income has grown, and a major reason for that is the weak state of labor markets. Job growth was robust in 2006, with payrolls expanding by about 175,000 jobs per month. Job growth tailed off in 2007, as the residential construction industry began shedding workers. And payrolls have fallen every month so far this year, with an average loss of 65,000 jobs per month. Consistent with this picture of a worsening labor market, the unemployment rate has risen from a cyclical low of 4.4 percent in March, 2007, to 5.5 percent this May.\n\nAnother factor that has dampened real income growth is the large increases we've seen in food and energy prices. While forecasting such prices is a challenging endeavor, should they follow the relatively flat trajectory implied by futures prices, then they would no longer restrain the growth in (as opposed to the level of) real income.\n\nTaking the bad news together with the good, the story that emerges is of an economy that is growing at only a tepid pace overall. Over the last two quarters, real GDP has grown at an annual rate of only three -quarters of a percent, which is about one-fourth of our long-run potential growth rate. Earlier this year, many observers extrapolated this slowdown into an outright decline in economic activity and concluded that the economy was in or about to enter a recession. But the data we've seen since then have not yet shown the sharp, widespread reversals that define a recession, and thus the odds of a severe downturn appear to have diminished. Nevertheless, growth in output and income while positive, clearly has slowed; employment clearly is declining.\n\nLooking ahead, consumer spending is likely to be bolstered by the government's stimulus checks over the next few months. Indeed, as I noted earlier, the May retail sales report suggested as much. But beyond that, there are legitimate concerns on the growth outlook. Most importantly, if the labor market continue to contract, consumer incomes and spending are likely to suffer and restrain overall economic activity going forward. The timing and size of any decline in commercial construction activity is uncertain as well, and it could well hamper growth in the second half.\n\nAt the same time, I have followed the economy closely for much of my professional career and have learned two important lessons that are relevant today. First, don't underestimate consumer resilience. People tend to look forward and will often take a temporary shock in stride, even a severe one. And second, don't underestimate the power of monetary policy. The Federal Open Market Committee has lowered the federal funds rate from 5 ¼ to 2 percent in less than eight months, which, in real, inflation-adjusted terms, bring it below zero. There is currently a good deal of monetary stimulus in the pipeline to support activity in the months ahead.\n\nWhile the growth outlook has improved a bit since the beginning of the year, the same cannot be said for the inflation outlook. The latest figures confirm that inflation is unacceptably high. The price index for personal consumption expenditure, increased 3.2 percent over the 12 months that ended in April, and that figure is likely to rise given Friday's CPI report for May. To put that in perspective, for several years, I have suggested an inflation target of 1.5 percent.\n\nOf course, price increases have been concentrated in the food and energy categories, and taking those out, the conventional PCE core inflation rate has been slightly above 2 percent.

The implied forecast misses have been predominantly on the high side in recent years, however. The risk for inflation dynamics is that elevated rates of increase in overall price level become embedded in expectations.\n\nWe seem to have dodged this risk so far. Despite several years of elevated inflation, the public's expectation of future inflation has not become completely adrift as it was in the 1970s. We have several ways of gauging expectations, none of them perfect, but they agree that inflation expectations are higher than I would like but are relatively stable.

        "speech_title": "Financial Stability and Central Banks",
        "highlights": "",
        "content": "The financial market events of the last nine months have raised a number of questions about our financial markets and institutions, about financial regulation, and about the central bank's role in credit markets.1\n\n Some analyses have focused on the drying up of trading activity in certain structured finance products where the key observation is how abruptly liquidity conditions in a financial market can change. Others have focused on the underlying fundamentals of credit quality in these financial products, with a key observation being that, after the fact, it looks as though many decisions regarding the extension of credit yielded quite disappointing results.\n\n\n\nThese two perspectives are clearly interrelated, since the loss of liquidity in asset-backed and related markets appears to have come about largely because of significant shifts in people's assessments of the underlying credit quality. Despite this intimate connection, emphasis on one or the other tends to lead to very different interpretations of recent events. An emphasis on liquidity is often associated with a view that financial market instability represents a breakdown in the functioning of markets, while an emphasis on credit quality suggests the view that such disruptions are simply the natural way that markets (even well-functioning markets) adjust to large changes in peoples' beliefs about fundamentals.\n\nIn my remarks here today, I would like to discuss financial stability and central banking. I realize that a great deal of ink has been spilled on this topic, some of the earliest and most influential of which was spilled in this very city. But more recently, specifically the last 30 years, there has been an outpouring of economic research on the stability of banking institutions. What I have to offer is a discussion of recent financial market turmoil and policy responses from the viewpoint of this body of work.\n\nIn this line of research, economists have developed detailed, coherent accounts of both of the views I described. These represent competing theories of financial instability, and these different theories have distinct implications for the appropriate responses of government and central bank policy to market disruptions. A breakdown of the process by which the market distributes liquidity among its participants is often cited as a justification for a relatively active approach to central bank lending. On the other hand, a market adjusting, even quite awkwardly, to a shift in participants' understanding of the underlying risks might imply that such lending, by interfering with the price discovery process, is potentially counterproductive.\n\nIn some ways the research has been inconclusive — it remains very difficult to determine the underlying causes or nature of financial disruptions in real-time, when policy responses need to be formulated. But this research has improved our ability to think about costs and benefits of policy choices, I think. I will emphasize in particular the importance of paying attention to the long-term consequences of central bank actions in financial markets. As always, the views I express are my own, and not necessarily shared by my colleagues in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nMaturity transformation is a basic function of financial institutions, instruments and markets\n\nThe traditional description of banks and the economic role they play is that they engage in \"maturity transformation.\" Their lending is tailored to meet the needs of their borrowers for longer maturity debt to finance purchases or large investment projects and to shield them against the risk of losing funding. Their liabilities are tailored to the desires of the ultimate providers of funds for short-term assets to be prepared to meet unexpected expenditure needs or investment opportunities.\n\nIn principle, one could imagine a financial intermediary whose assets and liabilities are well matched in maturity and liquidity. But the nature of the preferences and needs of households and businesses that provide and use funds is such that a deliberate mismatch — that is, a maturity transformation — has historically been more socially useful and thus profitable. Such a mismatch exposes the financial intermediary to obvious risks, however, and thus requires compensation in the form of a spread between the returns earned on lending and the returns paid to savers. Savers accept a lower return in exchange for flexibility in accessing their funds, and borrowers pay more in exchange for the certainty of their funding source.\n\nThis, then, is the traditional view of banking — funding long-term financing needs in a way that satisfies savers' desire for short-term, liquid assets. But this same sort of transformation takes place in a variety of ways today outside of the traditional (commercial) banking system. For example, asset-backed commercial paper, which grew very rapidly between 2003 and the first half of 2007, allowed money funds and other investors to place short-term, liquid funds in securities backed by mortgages and other longer term instruments. More broadly, many structured finance arrangements involve maturity transformation. Repurchase agreements also provide a means for investors to make very short term (overnight) investments backed by longer term securities, as does such specialized instruments as Auction Rate Securities.\n\nMaturity transformation raises the possibility that a surge in demands by liability holders to \"get their money back\" could overwhelm an institution's ability to liquefy the assets in its portfolio.2\n\n This is the traditional story of bank runs, and it motivates, in part, the view I cited earlier that financial markets are inherently unstable. Since banks' assets are less liquid than their liabilities (their deposits), they could have trouble meeting the demands of a large number of depositors to \"cash-in\" all at once. Knowing this makes depositors likely to run if they think such a large cash-in event is looming. So a run, in this view, can become a self-fulfilling prophecy. This means that a run can occur even if the bank's assets are fundamentally sound, in the sense that if held over a longer horizon the return would be sufficient to repay liability holders in full. The reduction in realized value associated with early and perhaps disorderly liquidation of an intermediary's assets in response to such a run is a deadweight cost that presumably could be avoided if the run could be prevented.\n\n\n\nFundamental runs versus self-fulfilling prophecies\n\nEconomists have made great progress in recent years in formalizing the reasoning I just sketched, and in understanding precisely what circumstances are required for this reasoning to make coherent sense. Researchers have found it useful to distinguish between what I'll call \"fundamental\" and \"non-fundamental\" runs. Non-fundamental runs are of the self-fulfilling variety; if all depositors who do not need their money right away believe that other such depositors will not withdraw their money, then no run occurs. In another potential equilibrium, the belief that other patient depositors will withdraw nonetheless induces all patient depositors to withdraw, thus confirming their beliefs. Fundamental runs occur when people seek to remove their money from an intermediary because they have information that makes them mark-down their valuation of the intermediary's assets; waiting is not a reasonable option (that is, not an equilibrium). This distinction is important because the two types of runs have very different policy implications. Preventing a non-fundamental run avoids the cost of unnecessarily early asset liquidation, and in some models can rationalize government or central bank intervention. In contrast, in the case of runs driven by fundamentals, the liquidation inefficiencies are largely unavoidable and government support interferes with market discipline and distorts market prices.\n\nThe ability of theoretical models to predict non-fundamental runs appears to be very sensitive to the assumptions used in constructing the model. So economic theory does not provide a clear prediction about if and when such runs would be likely to occur. However, in most instances of runs that we have observed — for example, the wave of U.S. bank runs in the Great Depression — careful analysis has shown that banks that experienced runs tended to be in observably worse condition than those that did not.3\n That is, there usually appears to be some fundamental impetus behind a run.\n\n\n\nRecent events in money markets have been compared to bank runs, even though they occurred outside the traditional commercial banking sector. Examples include the flight from asset-backed commercial paper last summer, the failure of auction rate security refinancings, and the problems faced by Bear Stearns in the week leading up to its agreement to be acquired. Can these be characterized as non-fundamental runs? Certainly, some ABCP was backed by subprime mortgage debt, for which there was good evidence of reduced fundamental value, and there was uncertainty for a time about how much of any given issue was backed by such debt. Moreover, many ABCP holders were contractually constrained to hold only investment-grade paper, and thus would have had to sell if it was downgraded. This, together with the availability to issuers of other funding sources outside of the CP market (albeit at higher rates), seems to offer a plausible explanation, based on fundamentals, of the rapid fall in issuance volume that began last August. Similarly, significant concerns were circulating publicly regarding mortgage-related assets on Bear Stearns' balance sheet, making money market counterparties (short-term investors) reluctant to continue dealing with the firm.\n\nThe case of auction rate securities appears to be peculiar because the underlying credit quality of most issuers — municipalities, for instance — was not called into question. Interest rates on auction rate securities are set at periodic auctions, in which security holders choose whether to keep their investment in the security by participating in the refinancing auction or to withdraw their funds instead. Auction rate securities thus represent a maturity transformation in which less liquid assets are funded by more liquid liabilities. But ARS contracts also explicitly provide that if there is insufficient interest in an auction by either new or existing investors, then the security converts into a long-term instrument, such as a more conventional bond, typically paying a substantially higher rate of interest. As a result, the underlying assets need not be liquidated. The consequences of a run-like departure of investors are thus different than in the case of a bank run or a flight from some other money market instruments. This is an important distinction, because it highlights that the extent to which maturity transformation creates the possibility of fragility or instability in financial institutions or markets depends critically on the contractual terms adopted by the intermediary.\n\nFinancial fragility is endogenous\n\nThe intuition behind the classic bank run story is that banks are susceptible to runs because depositors are free, at any time, to claim all of their money on demand. This is a contractual choice, and one that makes some sense given depositors' demand for short duration, liquid savings instruments. But if a bank can restrict its depositors' ability to demand their funds on the spot in certain circumstances — in the event of heavy demands for withdrawals, for example — then the bank will be less susceptible to a run. And there is ample precedent for deposit contracts with such characteristics. In 19th century U.S. banking panics, banks preserved their liquidity, individually, by suspending the convertibility of their deposits into currency.4\n\n They also had recourse to collective actions through the issuance of loan certificates by clearinghouses in the major cities, which allowed the clearinghouse members to meet their interbank obligations and customers to make interbank transfers without drawing on banks' scarce supplies of currency.5\n\n\n\n\n\nThe auction failures in auction rate securities bear a resemblance to 19th century suspensions of convertibility in that liability holders were converted into less liquid claims. One result from the research literature is that such contractual provisions are capable of preventing or limiting self-fulfilling, or non-fundamental runs.6\n\n The prospect of suspension discourages liability holders from attempting to withdraw funds unless their need is genuine, and helps convince them that other liability holders will be similarly discouraged. Institutions that engage in maturity transformation can also limit their susceptibility to runs by holding a greater share of their balance sheets in liquid assets, or by financing themselves with less liquid liabilities — for instance, by limiting their leverage or issuing longer-maturity debt. Note that bankruptcy itself constitutes an enforced suspension of convertibility.\n\n\n\nThe general principle here is that while maturity transformation can be socially useful, it is not inevitable; the extent of maturity transformation and of vulnerability to run-like behavior is a function of the contractual arrangements a financial intermediary voluntarily assumes.\n\nAny form of self-protection against run-like outcomes is likely to be costly, though. Holding more liquid assets limits the gains from the fundamental asset transformation that the institution is engaged in. A policy of suspending convertibility, while making a bank less susceptible to non-fundamental runs, could also limit the ability of depositors to access their funds in episodes of fundamentally-driven financial strain, and perhaps at times when they genuinely need liquidity themselves, thus reducing the inherent value of the deposit contract.\n\nCentral bank lending\n\nThe usual presumption is that institutions and their counterparties implicitly weigh the expected costs and benefits of alternative contractual arrangements in designing financial structures that best suit their financial needs.7\n\n The incentives of financial intermediaries and their counterparties to construct resilient arrangements are also influenced by the policy regime under which their transactions take place. If people anticipate that in situations of financial stress the government or central bank will intervene in a way that limits private losses, then there is likely to be less interest in taking costly steps to avoid those situations.\n\n\n\nBanks have historically benefited from access to support in the form of central bank credit. Discussions of the role of the central bank as a lender of last resort, particularly in times of financial stress, often cite Walter Bagehot's account of the Bank of England's practices in the 19th century.8\n Bagehot's advice is often summarized by the simple prescription, \"lend freely at a high rate, on good collateral.\"\n\n\n\nThe relevance of Bagehot's dictum for recent central bank lending is not at all clear, however. There is an important distinction to be made between monetary policy operations, which vary the total quantity of central bank liabilities, and credit policy, which alters the composition of the central bank's assets.9\n Modern central banks target an interest rate, which requires that they adjust the quantity of their liabilities — generally bank reserves — in response to fluctuations in the demand for those liabilities. By itself, a central bank loan increases both the liabilities and assets of the central bank. Absent offsetting asset sales, the additional reserves would tend to drive the interest rate below target. Therefore, central bank lending operations are generally \"sterilized\" via offsetting asset sales.10\n\n The lending programs introduced by the Federal Reserve since December have all been sterilized.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe lending about which Bagehot wrote was unsterilized; that is, it represented net increases in the liabilities of the Bank of England. Bagehot's advice was essentially to increase the supply of central bank money when the demand for it rises in a crisis.11\n \"Lend freely at a penalty rate\" meant to supply reserves elastically to prevent interest rates from spiking above the penalty rate in a crisis. In short, Bagehot's dictum was about the size of the central bank's balance sheet, not the composition of its asset holdings. The credit risk thereby taken on by the central bank was a byproduct of the lending required to expand the supply of reserves, not the objective. (Incidentally, interest rate spikes were a common feature of many U.S. financial panics in the late 19th century, to which the formation of the Federal Reserve in 1913 was in part a response. Unsterilized discount window lending was the method by which the founders envisioned the Fed would conduct monetary policy and prevent panics.)\n\n\n\nThere are economic models in which central bank credit policy is capable of ameliorating or even preventing non-fundamental runs when they can occur. By lending when other market participants are unwilling to lend, the central bank can provide the intermediary with resources to forestall costly closure or liquidation of assets. As I argued earlier, however, instances of run-like behavior since last summer appear to be attributable to real fundamental causes, as do the broader financial market stresses. As the likely severity of the slow-down in housing markets and the associated decline in home prices became apparent, it also became clear that the securities backed by mortgages originated in 2006 and early 2007 were going to perform significantly worse than had been anticipated. This realization affected any institution or instrument with mortgage-related exposures. When the resulting flight from asset-backed commercial paper caused exposures to come back on to the balance sheets of banks that had sponsored such programs, uncertainty about some banks' exposures raised their funding costs, most notably in the term interbank market, as evidenced by widening LIBOR spreads. Prices of mortgage-backed securities were depressed by the heightened uncertainty about returns, and also by the likelihood that low returns would be correlated with adverse economic outcomes. This uncertainty impeded the use of such securities as collateral for short-term financing. Investment banks that were prominently involved in mortgage-related securities activities were particularly affected.\n\nThe ideal central bank lending policy would require making clear distinctions between different possible sources of bank or financial distress. If an episode of financial disruption is a true liquidity crisis, like a non-fundamental run on the banking system, then aggressive central bank lending can, in theory, stem the crisis and prevent unnecessary insolvencies that impose real losses on the economy. Lending when in fact the financial sector is just coping with deteriorating fundamentals, however, distorts economic allocations by artificially supporting the prices of some assets and the liabilities of some market participants. Moreover, it is likely to affect the perceptions of market participants regarding future intervention, and thus alter their incentives and future choices.\n\nMoral hazard\n\nMoral hazard is the central problem that the financial safety net necessarily brings with it. And this problem exists even if central bank lending ensures that the resolution of a problem institution leaves its shareholders with nothing. Market discipline on risk-taking by financial firms comes more from the cost of debt finance than from equity holders (given the limited liability nature of equity). So it is the potential consequences of central bank lending for creditors that raises moral hazard concerns by reducing the cost of debt and potentially leading to greater leverage than would otherwise be chosen.\n\nPeople often think of the moral hazard problem associated with a financial safety net as a \"due diligence\" problem. That is, investors in protected securities or lenders to protected institutions feel less of a need to assess and monitor the creditworthiness of their counterparties. This is a valid concern, but I think it construes moral hazard too narrowly in this setting. My discussion of the choice of leverage points to broader implications of central bank lending for the contractual structure of financial arrangements, not just on the monitoring of investment portfolios. In particular, the expectation of safety net support can weaken the incentive of counterparties to build provisions in to their financial contracts that reduce their susceptibility to (non-fundamental) runs. More broadly, an intermediary with access to the financial safety net has less incentive to manage their liquidity in a way that suitably minimizes the possibility of disorderly resolution of solvency problems.\n\nRecent work by one of our Richmond Fed economists makes this point very clearly, using the standard model of banking theory.12\n\n He and his New York Fed coauthor consider a setting in which if there is certainty that no government (or central bank) assistance will be forthcoming, then the banking contracts developed will include provisions that allow for suspensions of payment and these will prevent non-fundamental runs from occurring. On the other hand, if such central bank assistance is possible and a non-fundamental run actually does start, the government will choose to intervene in order to alleviate the ex post inefficiency associated with a run. But, knowing that this intervention is forthcoming, banks do not self-protect, and thus leave themselves more susceptible to runs. So peoples' expectations regarding central bank policy choices in times of stress can affect the very robustness of the system.\n\n\n\nThis strikes me as a deeper form of moral hazard than what people usually have in mind. In times of financial crisis, the understandable central bank imperative is to alleviate the stress. But the expectations such actions engender could very well make future crises more likely. The classic time consistency problem is as relevant to central bank credit policy as it is to monetary policy.\n\nSupervisory authority\n\nThe economics of central bank lending closely parallel the economics of private line of credit lending.13\n\n Both provide funding on very short notice to entities that need liquidity. Both create moral hazard because they can shift potential losses from short-term to long-term claimants. To contain moral hazard, private line of credit agreements employ an array of contractual provisions, such as giving the lender the right to monitor the borrower and rescind the commitment if specified loan covenants are no longer satisfied. The contracting parties presumably calibrate loan covenants in a way that balances the costs of intrusiveness against the benefits of improved incentive alignment.\n\n\n\nIn the case of central bank lending, the same purpose can be served by government supervision and regulation of the institutions that are eligible to borrow from the central bank. Clearly, the extent of supervisory oversight should be at least commensurate with the extent of access to central bank credit in order to appropriately contain moral hazard. The dramatic recent expansion in Federal Reserve lending raises the possibility that market participants view future access to Fed credit as having been substantially broadened. For evidence, market participants could point to the fact that entities formerly viewed as unlikely to have access to the discount window, such as the primary dealer subsidiaries of investment banks, have now been granted access.\n\nActions and statement in the period ahead are likely to shape the evolution of market participants' perceptions about the extent of the safety net. And these perceptions will shape their choices about contractual arrangements and exposure to risk. In my view, there is value in communicating policy intentions clearly. Deliberate imprecision — the so-called \"constructive ambiguity\" approach — leaves it to market participants to draw inferences for future policy from our past actions. Without an articulated statement of intention regarding lending policy, the time consistency problem is likely to be a difficult challenge because it will be hard to resist the future temptation to mitigate financial market stresses when they arise.14\n\n\n\nIn establishing new boundaries of central bank lending and adjusting the supervisory regime accordingly, a number of considerations are relevant. More expansive boundaries could conceivably prevent more avoidable liquidation costs in the case of non-fundamental runs, but in the case of fundamental runs more distortions would result. In addition, supervision itself is a costly endeavor, both in direct resource use and in the fallout effects on economic allocations. More broadly, expansion of the government financial safety net could substantively alter the balance between financial entities that are closely regulated and those that are regulated primarily by market discipline.15\n\n\n\nThe crucial constraint, however, is that the articulated policy be time consistent — that is, a commitment not to lend beyond the new policy boundaries should be credible. Financial market participants are likely to retain some doubt about the exact limits of the safety net; after all, the previous, smaller version of the safety net had fairly well-articulated limits. The danger is that the effect of recent credit extension on the incentives of financial market participants might induce greater risk taking, which in turn could give rise to more frequent crises, in which case it might be difficult to resist further expanding the scope of central bank lending.\n\nMy former colleague Marvin Goodfriend and I wrote about this problem 10 years ago.16\n We drew the parallel to the building of monetary policy credibility after the inflationary experience of the 1970s. We noted that central banks, the Fed included, made many statements about their desire to see inflation come down during the 1970s, but it was not until strong and costly actions were taken, with broad (though not universal) public understanding and support, that inflation was broken in the 1980s. If actions speak louder than words in the case of central bank credit policy as well, then the only credible way to limit expectations of future lending is to \"incur the risk of short-run disruptions in financial markets by disappointing expectations and by not lending as freely as before.\"17\n\n\n\n\n\nConclusion\n\nTo summarize my brief review of the economics of financial stability; there are models in which runs are self-fulfilling prophesies, are costly, and could be avoided, perhaps through central bank intervention. Other runs arise from fundamental developments, and for these, central bank intervention interferes with market discipline and distorts market prices. My reading of recent financial market events suggests to me that fundamentals have been at work — given the large shortfall in mortgage returns confronting the financial sector, the resulting strains should not be surprising. But it is almost always impossible to know precisely how much of a market disruption is justified by any observed shift in fundamentals, so determining whether a run is fundamental or self-fulfilling is very difficult. With either type of run, though, central bank support can weaken the incentive of financial intermediaries to structure their contractual arrangements to protect against run-like behavior. In the short-term, governments and central banks may be able to alleviate financial market strains, but such intervention may affect financial intermediaries' choices in a way that makes instances of financial distress more likely. So policymakers face an excruciating dilemma when the potential and more immediate cost of inaction appears greater than the longer term costs of lending aggressively.\n\nMuch has been written in recent years about what role central banks play in assuring financial stability. This is understandable, and appropriate. Certainly, a central bank's macroeconomic policy can have a large impact on the stability of financial markets, through the control of inflation and inflation expectations. This is perhaps the greatest contribution central banks can make to the overall performance of financial markets. Beyond that, the central bank's historical role as a lender of last resort places it squarely in the center of financial disruptions as they unfold. We are perhaps not as close to a consensus on the proper conduct of this role as we are with regard to price stability. But as we continue to learn about the causes and nature of financial instability, I believe we should strive for policy that is informed by the lessons learned in the achievement of price stability. Chief among those is that a central bank can achieve better outcomes if it can establish credibility for a pattern of behavior consistent with achieving its long-term goals.",

        "content": "It's a pleasure to be with you. While the economy is seldom far from many people's minds, I think it's fair to say that economic conditions are garnering a bit more attention than usual right now. Housing markets have deteriorated over the last two years and the resulting losses on mortgage-related securities contributed to financial market turmoil last summer. The associated decline in employment in the construction and financial industries has contributed to a slowdown in aggregate job growth. Moreover, inflation — both overall and excluding food and energy prices — has picked up of late. As you might imagine, these developments have kept us busy at the Federal Reserve. So today, I'd like to spend some time talking about the economy. I'll begin by reviewing current economic conditions, and then go on to discuss the outlook for the coming year. Before we begin though, let me note that the usual disclaimer applies: the views I express are my own and are not necessarily shared by any of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee.1\nClearly, economic activity has been softening. At the end of last year, real GDP grew at a meager 0.6 percent annual rate, and most forecasters are not looking for much better growth — if any — in the current quarter. Much of this sluggishness has been due to a severe housing market downturn, along with the attendant financial market fallout. After a 10-year expansion, residential investment peaked in late 2005. Since then, construction and sales have fallen fairly sharply, first in large metropolitan areas that had seen the strongest booms, and then spreading to other markets where housing price increases were less pronounced. Despite the falloff in construction, inventories of unsold homes rose sharply. While inventory levels have actually retreated somewhat in recent months, they have not come down as rapidly as sales, and they are currently a depressing influence on home prices and new construction.\n\n\n\nHome prices increased significantly during the long boom, particularly in local markets with restricted supply. Existing home prices increased about 90 percent between 1995 and 2005 for the nation as a whole. In the Washington, D.C., market, prices increased 148 percent from 1995 to 2005 and rose another 11 percent in 2006. And in Charleston, W.Va., prices climbed by 39 percent over the same 10-year period and increased by another 2 percent in 2006. Of course, rapid increases in real quality-adjusted prices are not indefinitely sustainable for any asset, and in the case of housing, potential buyers eventually get priced out of the market. In many markets, prices changed course quickly, but in others, prices have continued to increase. Average prices for the nation as a whole fell in the third quarter of 2007 by 0.4 percent, which is the first national price decline since 1994. And in formerly hot markets, the declines have been larger, with prices falling over 5 percent in San Diego, for example. Prices have also fallen significantly in areas with weak regional economies, like Michigan and northern Ohio. Charleston has avoided an outright decline in prices, although appreciation has remained modest, with third-quarter growth at a 2 percent annual rate.\n\nDevelopments in housing finance arguably have played a substantial role in the evolving conditions in housing markets. Here the long-term story is the technology-driven wave of innovation in retail credit delivery that enhanced the ability of lenders to assess the creditworthiness of individual borrowers. This increased the pool of qualified borrowers and the range of feasible financial products, and dramatically expanded access to mortgage credit over the last decade, just as it expanded access to unsecured consumer credit earlier on. Technology also has contributed to innovation in securitization and other forms of intermediation of credit flows. This spreads risks more widely and leads to lower borrowing costs. As with any new product or service innovation, however, some experimentation and risk was involved, and in this case, some of those risks were realized. Looking back, there undoubtedly are many loans that both the borrower and the lender wish had not been made. But it is important to keep in mind that many borrowers remain better off as a result of recent lending innovations.\n\nFuture research may quantify the extent to which credit market innovations contributed to the boom in housing market activity by expanding the pool of potential homeowners. In any event, when the growth in housing demand came to an end, home prices peaked and began falling in many markets. In hindsight, it seems clear that the success of new methods of lending to riskier borrowers was to some extent dependent on sustained home price appreciation. This provided strained borrowers with the ability to refinance, thus masking the effects of more inclusive underwriting. It takes some time, however, for the ultimate loss experience of a mortgage portfolio to become evident. While observers were raising concerns early on — the late Federal Reserve Governor Ned Gramlich, for example 2\n — it wasn't until last year, after home prices had peaked in some major markets, that more quantitative evidence began to emerge regarding the substantial extent to which mortgage loans made in 2006 and later would underperform previous vintages. The ensuing adjustment in underwriting standards has further contributed to the decline in housing activity.\n\n\n\nThe story behind last year's unfolding drama in credit markets was the continuing re-assessment of the fundamental value of nonprime mortgages in light of incoming data implying significantly higher ultimate losses on recent vintages of subprime mortgages. Securitization was an important part of the expansion of credit in recent years, and securities backed by pools of sub-prime or other nontraditional mortgages served as the backing for other obligations, usually issued off the balance sheets of the sponsoring institutions. As housing slowed over the summer, it became clear that some mortgage-related securities previously judged as relatively safe would suffer substantial losses. Many of these securities were the liabilities of entities with explicit or implicit bank lending guarantees. Many banks that provided such guarantees have had to either meet large funding demands or bring the impaired assets onto their balance sheets. Uncertainty about the scale of such adjustments has at times meant higher funding and capital costs, although risk premia increased far more for some institutions than for others. Since then, such institutions have taken large write-offs, and many have replenished their capital. Many affected banks have dramatically increased their advances from the Federal Home Loan Banks, where lending increased by 29 percent or about $180 billion in the third quarter.\n\nCredit markets were hit particularly hard in August, as many participants found it difficult to refinance the asset-backed commercial paper they had issued. Banks began holding larger precautionary reserve balances then, putting upward pressure on interbank lending rates. The New York Fed injected significantly more reserves than usual via open market operations in order to relieve the pressure and keep the overnight federal funds rate near the target. In addition, the Board of Governors accepted Reserve Bank requests to lower the discount rate by a half a percentage point, reducing the spread above the federal funds rate from the traditional 100 basis points down to 50 basis points. With concern mounting that housing investment was declining more rapidly than had been expected and that the growth outlook was deteriorating as a consequence, the FOMC reduced the federal funds target rate in September and October, bringing it down 75 basis points to 4.5 percent. Financial market conditions showed some improvement in September and October, but turned problematic again in late November, a month that also saw a further deterioration in the real outlook, as measures of housing market activity continued to come in below expectations.\n\nIn December, wholesale funding markets increasingly showed the effects of heightened uncertainty surrounding financial institutions' adjustment requirements. Term funding spreads relative to expected overnight rates became quite elevated for some banks, differentiation in rates across institutions became more pronounced, and the volume of term funding contracted. Increases in interbank interest rates associated with year-end, balance-sheet considerations have occurred in the past, but market participants appeared to expect low overnight rates over the year-end this time. Rates at the Federal Home Loan Banks are closer to the expected overnight funds rate than to term LIBOR, which may explain the relatively small amount of discount window borrowing even since the August reduction in the discount rate spread over the target. All this suggests that term funding premia reflected assessments of counterparty risk rather than expectations that the funds rate would spike at year end.\n\nAgainst this back-drop, the Federal Reserve introduced a new mechanism for providing term funding to financial institutions. The Term Auction Facility, or TAF, makes 28-day loans of a predetermined total amount at a rate set by auction. These loans are otherwise similar to discount window loans made by a bank's regional Reserve Bank against collateral posted with that Reserve Bank. Since these auctions began, near the end of December, spreads on interbank term loans have fallen significantly and have returned to where they were last November before the year-end funding difficulties emerged. It will be difficult to determine the extent to which the TAF contributed to this easing of rates in the term funding market, since the counterfactual will never be observed. An earlier instance of elevation in term spreads, peaking in early September, abated without such action by the Fed.\n\nAs one would expect, revised assessments of mortgage lending risk have resulted in a tightening of credit standards for businesses and consumers. Many lenders are requiring larger down payments, and mortgage rate spreads have increased significantly for riskier borrowers and riskier products. Mortgage rates have come down since December, however — the rate on conventional 30-year fixed-rate mortgages has fallen about 45 basis points. And even though the spread between jumbo and conforming mortgages has widened a bit, jumbo rates have also eased in recent weeks, coming down about 20 basis points. Spreads on investment-grade corporate bonds have widened over the last month, but still, the level of yields on such debt has fallen. On the other hand, interest rates on high-yield debt and commercial mortgage-backed securities moved up in the last half of 2007, and have increased further since the beginning of the year. The strong differentiation in the response of lending spreads across borrower classes suggests that increasing spreads have been driven mainly by changing risk assessments rather than bank funding pressures per se. Higher risk spreads and generally tighter lending terms will tend to restrict spending in the near term. But the fall in short- and long-term Treasury rates over the last few months has offset the upward movement in higher spreads for a wide range of borrowers. The net effect has been lower rates for all but the highest-risk borrowers. In fact, lower reference rates have meant that more adjustable-rate mortgage borrowers will see their interest rate go down rather than up.\n\nThe economic outlook for 2008 has worsened in response to the developments of the last six months, and the recent flow of data has heightened the downside risks. The housing sector has been and will continue to be affected by the tightening we've seen in lending standards. New home sales have fallen 64 percent from their peak in October, 2005. Home construction is unlikely to bottom out this year, and I expect housing investment to continue to be a drag on growth through at least year-end.\n\nBusiness investment has contributed positively to growth over the last year, but I expect it to grow less robustly than in 2007, since some firms are experiencing a higher cost of capital and most firms face an uncertain demand for their products. A particularly dramatic change is likely to occur in commercial construction, which is a key segment of business investment. Construction spending for new stores and offices grew by a healthy 10 percent after inflation last year, but we have heard reports from our District contacts of a significant softening of conditions lately, with major projects being deferred or cancelled outright. In addition, vacancy rates for retail space have increased over the last year, which should lead to less construction going forward. The most recent investment data we have are for December, and those reports indicate continued growth in construction activity and new orders for business equipment.\n\nExports are likely to remain a source of strength next year, however, as a weaker dollar and continuing growth abroad support demand for U.S. goods and services. Accordingly, I expect the trade deficit to continue to narrow, providing modest support to real GDP growth. On the other hand, we are hearing reports of unexpectedly low tax revenues in the state government sector, which will likely mean some pruning of expenditures in coming months.\n\nThe main story in the forecast, though, remains household spending, which accounts for 70 percent of GDP. Consumer spending held up well until the end of last year, having grown at a solid 2.2 percent rate in real terms during the three months ending in November. In December, however, real spending was flat. Higher energy prices and falling home prices are cited often as factors that could dampen consumer spending, and these are legitimate concerns.\n\nIn addition, we will see more moderate growth in household income in the year ahead due to a weaker labor market. Job growth slowed over the course of 2007, and in January employment was reported to have fallen by 17,000 jobs. The unemployment rate has risen by a half percentage point since March and now stands at 4.9 percent. More industries now show declines, rather than increases, in employment. Fewer small businesses plan to increase hiring. And in our own surveys of economic activity in the Fifth District, we are hearing that an increasing number of firms have cut back on hiring plans recently. Other indicators are flashing less discouraging signals, however. Layoff announcements have continued to fall through December, and the U.S. Department of Labor's measure of job openings has remained at a relatively high level for over a year. My own expectation is that job growth will be lethargic, at best, for much of this year.\n\nPutting it all together, we have obviously experienced a significant decline in the growth of overall economic activity since August, with much of the decline occurring in the last two months. My sense is that we will see sluggish growth for at least half a year before a gradual firming begins. A legitimate question is whether conditions will weaken further — in other words, whether the economy will enter a recession. There are two keys to answering that question. The first is business investment; as I mentioned, there are some early signs are that investment is slowing, but the most recent monthly indicators still suggest some forward momentum. The other key is the jobs market. There is a fair amount of month-to-month volatility in the employment numbers, so it is quite possible that the underlying trend is stronger than the January reading by itself would suggest. If job growth is positive in the months ahead, and if wages can stay ahead of inflation, then income growth should be sufficient to support consumer spending gains and allow us to skirt the boundary of recession.\n\nAs I said, my sense is that the most likely path is sluggish growth in the near term. But I can also see the possibility of a mild recession, similar to the last two we have experienced — in other words, shallow and with a slow recovery. What I don't expect is a more severe recession, like those we saw in 1982 or 1974. Keep in mind that monetary policy has moved aggressively in recent months, and that inflation-adjusted interest rates are now very low by historical standards. That by itself won't solve all our problems, but it will help support activity enough to at least avoid the worst outcomes, and possibly avoid a recession altogether.\n\nI would emphasize that this outlook does not incorporate an overly sanguine view of either the housing market or financial markets. The swollen inventories of unsold homes that we see in most major markets is a clear reason to project further weakness in new home construction. Until home inventories fall to sustainable levels, I would expect further declines in home prices and soft demand, and so my overall growth outlook incorporates a continued drag from housing this year. Declining home prices will further increase the number of borrowers with negative equity in their home. Since this is a key driver of mortgage defaults and foreclosures, especially for less creditworthy borrowers, I expect continued increases in subprime loss rates.\n\nSound valuations of mortgage-backed securities already account for higher ultimate loss rates as various mortgage vintages age. Those are just projections at this point, and actual experience could come in either better or worse than expected. Unexpected reductions in the values of mortgage-related securities could spark new episodes of financial market turmoil. But I believe that financial market participants will find ways to work through problems as the year progresses. Financial intermediaries will continue to re-adjust balance sheets and replenish capital as needed, and will strengthen risk management practices as they take on board the lessons of the last year. Investors will continue to reallocate portfolios and their heightened desire for transparency will help shape the next generation of financial innovations.\n\nRisks are not limited to the outlook for real economic growth. Inflation has stepped up recently. As measured by the 12-month change in the PCE price index, inflation was 3.5 percent in June 2006. That measure of inflation fell to 1.8 percent in August 2007. Similarly, core inflation, which omits volatile food and energy prices, was 2.5 percent in August 2006, and then declined to 1.8 percent in August 2007. Those declines were heartening, and when the financial market turmoil intensified in August, the improving inflation picture allowed even an inflation hawk to endorse an easier monetary policy stance. Since then, however, the inflation picture has deteriorated. From August through December, the overall PCE price index rose at a 4.3 percent annual rate, and the core index rose at a 2.8 percent rate. These numbers do display transitory swings, so I wouldn't extrapolate them forward indefinitely. Still, I have to say that I am uncomfortable with the inflation picture, and disappointed that the improvement we saw earlier this year was not more lasting.\n\nI am also troubled by the lengthy divergence we've seen between overall and core inflation. Some of you may recall that core inflation was devised in the 1970s to filter out some of the more volatile consumer prices and get a better read on inflation trends. For several decades, core inflation seemed to work well due to the fact that food and energy prices had no clear trend relative to the overall price level. In the last few years, though, overall inflation has been persistently above core inflation, and few observers expect oil prices to go back below $20 per barrel. Because the job of a central banker is to protect the purchasing power of currency, it is overall inflation that we need to keep down, not just core inflation. Going forward, markets expect oil prices to back off slightly from their current level, and I hope they have the direction right this time.\n\nIn the last few weeks, the Fed has responded to signs of weakening economic growth with further cuts in the federal funds rate, bringing the cumulative reduction to 2 ¼ percentage points. A slowing economy requires a lower inflation-adjusted interest rate because it means softer relative demand for resources now compared to the future. In my view, the prominence of downside risks means that further easing ultimately may be warranted. My expectation that growth is likely to be sluggish this year figured prominently in my thinking about policy last month, however, so if incoming data is not weaker than expected over the next several months, it's not clear further rate cuts would be warranted.\n\nAnd let me end with one final thought: inflation also presents risks. Throughout the period since 2005, when inflation rose, eased off, then rose again, longer-term inflation expectations have remained fairly stable. This has been comforting, and makes it easier for me to support interest rate cuts when a weakening outlook calls for it. The longer we go experiencing only upside inflation misses, however, the more we risk losing the credibility we have fought so hard to maintain.",

        "content": "Thank you very much, BJ. It's a pleasure to be with you again to discuss the economic outlook.1\n I'll begin this morning by discussing current conditions, and then go on to discuss the outlook for the coming year. Before we begin though, let me note that the usual disclaimer applies — the views I express are my own and are not necessarily shared by any of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\n\n\nClearly, the severity of the housing market downturn, along with the attendant financial market fallout, has been the dominant macro-economic development of the past year. After a 10-year expansion, residential investment peaked in late 2005. Since then, construction and sales have fallen fairly sharply, first in large metropolitan areas that had seen the strongest booms, and then spreading this year to other markets where housing price increases were less pronounced. Despite the falloff in construction, inventories of unsold homes rose sharply. While inventory levels have actually retreated somewhat in recent months, they have not come down as rapidly as has the pace of sales, and they are currently depressing home prices and new construction.\n\nHome prices increased significantly during the long boom, particularly in local markets with restricted supply. Existing home prices increased about 90 percent between 1995 and 2005 for the nation as a whole. In the Washington, D.C., market, prices increased 148 percent from 1995 to 2005 and rose another 11 percent in 2006. Here in Richmond, prices climbed by 85 percent over the same 10-year period and increased by another 12 percent in 2006. Of course, rapid increases in real quality-adjusted prices are not indefinitely sustainable for any asset, and in the case of housing, potential buyers eventually get priced out of the market. In many markets, prices changed course quickly, but in others, prices have continued to increase. Average prices for the nation as a whole fell in the third quarter of 2007 by 0.4 percent, which is the first national price decline since 1994. And in formerly hot markets, the declines have been larger, with prices falling over 5 percent in San Diego, for example. Prices also have fallen significantly in areas with weak regional economies, like Michigan and northern Ohio. Richmond has avoided an outright decline in prices, although appreciation has slowed significantly, with third-quarter growth of just less than 1 percent.\n\nDevelopments in housing finance arguably have played a substantial role in the evolving conditions in housing markets. Here the long-term story is the technology-driven wave of innovation in retail credit delivery that dramatically expanded access to mortgage credit over the last decade, just as it expanded access to unsecured consumer credit earlier on. Technology also has contributed to innovation in securitization and other forms of intermediation of credit flows, which also helped lower borrowing costs. As with any new product or service innovation, however, some experimentation and risk was involved, and in this case some of those risks were realized.\n\nFuture research may quantify the extent to which credit market innovations contributed to a boom in housing market activity by expanding the pool of potential homeowners. In any event, when the growth in housing demand came to an end, home prices peaked and began falling in many markets. In hindsight, it seems clear that the success of new methods of lending to riskier borrowers was to some extent dependent on sustained home price appreciation, which provided strained borrowers with the ability to refinance, thus masking the effects of more inclusive underwriting. It takes some time, however, for the likely ultimate loss experience of a mortgage portfolio to become evident. While observers were raising concerns early on — the late Federal Reserve Governor Ned Gramlich, for example 2\n — it wasn't until last year, after home prices had peaked in some major markets, that more quantitative evidence began to emerge regarding the substantial extent to which mortgage loans made in 2006 would underperform previous vintages. The ensuing adjustment in underwriting standards further contributed to the decline in housing activity.\n\n\n\nThe story behind last year's unfolding drama in credit markets was the continuing re-assessment of the fundamental value of nonprime mortgages in light of incoming data implying significantly higher ultimate losses on recent vintages of subprime mortgages. Securitization was an important part of the expansion of credit in recent years, and securities backed by pools of sub-prime or other nontraditional mortgages served as the backing for other obligations, usually issued off the balance sheets of the sponsoring institutions. As housing slowed over the summer, it became clear that some mortgage-related securities previously judged as relatively safe would suffer substantial losses. Many of these securities were the liabilities of entities with explicit or implicit bank lending guarantees. Many banks that provided such guarantees have had to either meet large funding demands or bring the impaired assets onto their balance sheets. Uncertainty about the scale of such adjustments has at times meant higher funding and capital costs, although risk premia increased far more for some institutions than for others. Since then, such institutions have taken large write-offs, and many have replenished their capital. Many affected banks have dramatically increased their advances from the Federal Home Loan Banks, where lending increased by 29 percent or about $180 billion in the third quarter.\n\nCredit markets were hit particularly hard in August, as many participants found it difficult to refinance the asset-backed commercial paper they had issued. Banks began holding larger precautionary reserve balances then, putting upward pressure on interbank lending rates. The New York Fed injected significantly more reserves than usual via open market operations in order to relieve the pressure and keep the funds rate near the target. In addition, the Board of Governors accepted Reserve Bank requests to lower the discount rate by a half a percentage point, reducing the spread above the federal funds rate from the traditional 100 basis points down to 50 basis points. With concern mounting that housing investment was declining more rapidly than had been expected and that the growth outlook was deteriorating as a consequence, the FOMC reduced the federal funds target rate in September and October, bringing the rate down 75 basis points to 4.5 percent. Financial market conditions showed some improvement in September and October, but turned problematic again in November, a month that also saw a further deterioration in the real outlook, as measures of housing market activity continued to come in below expectations.\n\nIn December, wholesale funding markets increasingly showed the effects of heightened uncertainty surrounding financial institutions' adjustment requirements. Term funding spreads relative to expected overnight rates became quite elevated for some banks, differentiation in rates across institutions became more pronounced, and the volume of term funding contracted. Increases in interbank interest rates associated with year-end, balance-sheet considerations have occurred in the past, but market participants appeared to expect low overnight rates over the year-end this time. Rates at the Federal Home Loan Banks are closer to the expected overnight funds rate than to term LIBOR, which may explain the relatively small amount of discount window borrowing even since the August reduction in the discount rate spread over the target. All this suggests that term funding premia reflected assessments of counterparty risk rather than expectations that the funds rate would spike at year end.\n\nAgainst this back-drop, the Federal Reserve introduced a new mechanism for providing term funding to financial institutions. The Term Auction Facility, or TAF, makes 28-day loans of a predetermined total amount at a rate set by auction. These loans are otherwise similar to discount window loans made by a bank's regional Reserve Bank against collateral posted with that Reserve Bank. Since these auctions began, near the end of December, spreads on interbank term loans have fallen significantly, although they still remain elevated by historical standards. It will be difficult to determine the extent to which the TAF contributed to this easing of rates in the term funding market, since the counterfactual will never be observed. An earlier instance of elevation in term spreads, peaking in early September, abated without such action by the Fed.\n\nAs one would expect, revised assessments of mortgage lending risk have resulted in a tightening of credit standards. Many lenders are requiring larger down payments, and mortgage rate spreads have increased significantly for riskier borrowers and riskier products. Mortgage rates have come down since December the rate on conventional 30-year fixed-rate mortgages has fallen about 50 basis points. And even though the spread between jumbo and conforming mortgages has widened a bit, jumbo rates have also eased in recent weeks, coming down about 30 basis points. Spreads on investment-grade corporate bonds have widened over the last month, but still, the level of yields on such debt has fallen. On the other hand, interest rates on high-yield debt and commercial mortgage-backed securities moved up in the last half of 2007, and have increased further since the beginning of the year. The strong differentiation in the response of lending spreads across borrower classes suggests that increasing spreads have been driven mainly by changing risk assessments rather than bank funding pressures. Higher risk spreads and generally tighter lending terms will tend to restrict spending in the near term. But the fall in short- and long-term Treasury rates over the last few months has offset the upward movement in higher spreads for a wide range of borrowers. The net effect has been lower rates for all but the highest risk borrowers.\n\nThe economic outlook for 2008 has worsened in response to the developments of the last six months, and the recent flow of data has heightened the downside risks. The housing sector has been and will continue to be affected by the tightening we've seen in lending standards. Home construction is unlikely to bottom out this year, and I expect housing investment to continue to be a drag on growth through at least year-end. Business investment has contributed positively to growth over the last year, but I expect it to grow less robustly than in 2007, since some firms may see a higher cost of capital and some firms may face a decline in the demand for their products. Exports are likely to remain a source of strength next year, however, as a weaker dollar and relatively healthy economies overseas support demand for U.S. goods and services. Accordingly, I expect the trade deficit to continue to narrow, providing modest support to real GDP growth.\n\nThe main story in the forecast, though, remains household spending, which accounts for 70 percent of GDP. Consumer spending held up quite well up until the end of last year, having grown at over 3 percent in real terms during the three months ending in November. Higher energy prices and falling home prices are cited often as factors that could dampen consumer spending, and these are legitimate concerns. In addition, we could see more moderate growth in household income in the year ahead. Job growth slowed somewhat over the course of 2007, and in December employment was reported to have expanded by a meager 18,000 jobs, with the unemployment rate rising by three-tenths of a percentage point to 5 percent. Payroll employment is a fairly choppy series from month to month, however, and over the last three months payrolls grew by 97,000 jobs per month, on average. So while employment has certainly decelerated over the last 12 months, I continue to expect moderate job growth in 2008. With wage gains outpacing inflation now, and thus real incomes continuing to expand, I believe the most likely scenario is for reasonably solid income growth next year that will support some gains in consumer spending.\n\nPutting it all together, I expect growth to be very weak for several more months, but to improve toward the end of this year. Clearly, the most cogent risks to the growth outlook are on the downside. With the strains in housing persisting, a substantial slowdown in business spending could raise the odds of a recession. This risk would be heightened if December's job market weakness proved persistent, pulling down prospects for personal income and household spending. Nevertheless, I believe the most likely outcome is for growth to continue and to improve. I should note that my baseline outlook does not depend on an overly sanguine view of financial market conditions, which are, after all, a significant source of uncertainty right now. Much remains to be learned about the magnitude of ultimate losses in various mortgage market segments and on various related securities. Episodes of turmoil could recur in response to new information. But I believe that financial market participants will find ways to work through problems as the year progresses. Financial intermediaries will re-adjust balance sheets and continue to replenish capital as needed, and investors' desire for transparency will help shape the next generation of financial innovations.\n\nRisks are not limited to the outlook for real economic growth. Inflation has stepped up recently. As measured by the 12-month change in the PCE price index, inflation was 3.5 percent ending in June 2006. That measure of inflation fell to 1.8 percent in August 2007. Similarly, core inflation, which omits volatile food and energy prices, was 2.5 percent in August 2006, and then declined to 1.8 percent in August 2007. Those declines were heartening, and when the financial market turmoil intensified in August the improving inflation picture allowed even an inflation hawk to endorse an easier monetary policy stance. Since then, however, the inflation picture has deteriorated. From August through November, the overall PCE price index rose at a 4.8 percent annual rate, and the core index rose at a 2.9 percent rate. Judging by the closely related consumer price index, the numbers for December will not be any better. Now these numbers do display transitory swings, so I wouldn't extrapolate them forward indefinitely. Still, I have to say that I am uncomfortable with the inflation picture, and disappointed that the improvement we saw earlier this year was not more lasting.\n\nI am also troubled by the lengthy divergence we've seen between overall and core inflation. Some of you may recall that core inflation was devised in the 1970s to filter out some of the more volatile consumer prices to get a better read on inflation trends. For several decades, core inflation seemed to work well due to the fact that food and energy prices had no clear trend relative to the overall price level. In the last few years, though, overall inflation has been persistently above core inflation, and few observers expect oil prices to go back below $20 per barrel. Because the job of a central banker is to protect the purchasing power of currency, it is overall inflation that we need to keep down, not just core inflation. Going forward, markets expect oil prices to back off slightly from their current level, and I hope they are right this time.\n\nThe Fed has responded to the slowing economy with a cumulative reduction in the federal funds rate of 100 basis points. A slowing economy requires a lower real interest rate because it means softer relative demand for resources now compared to the future. And the current downside risks mean that further slowing, and thus further easing, is quite possible. But inflation also presents risks. Throughout the period since 2005, when inflation rose, eased off, then rose again, longer-term inflation expectations have remained fairly stable. If energy and food prices continue to push overall inflation above core inflation, then this higher overall trend could work its way into expectations, further complicating monetary policy in 2008.",
