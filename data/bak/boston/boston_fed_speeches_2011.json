Rosengren \nPresident & Chief Executive Officer \nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston \n \n \nJanuary 14, 2011 \n \n \nRemarks at the New England Mortgage Expo, \nhosted by the Connec ticut Mortgage Bankers \nAssociation and The Warren Group \n \n \n \n \n \nI’d like to thank the conference organizers fo r inviting me to speak with you today.  The \nbeginning of a new year is a good time to discuss the outlook for the economy.  I will also try to \nanswer a couple of the key questions that most everyone seems to be asking about, in relation to \nthis recovery.* \nAs I’m sure you know, over the past several we eks we have been getting economic data \nconsistent with a somewhat happier new year.  A r ecovery that has been an emic for the past year \n                                                             \n \n* Of course, the views I express today are my own, not  necessarily those of my colleagues on the Board of \nGovernors or the Federal Open Market Committee (the FOMC). \n\n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, January 14, 2011 at 1:15 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY * \n \n2 \n and a half looks to be increasingly supported by private spending as 2011 begins.  The Blue Chip \nforecast for 2011 has increased 4 tenths over the previous month, to 3.3 percent.   \nAnd I am slightly more optimistic than the Bl ue Chip; my own forecast is for growth of \n3.5 to 4.0 percent over 2011.  This is certainly an improvement, but – soberingly – would still \nleave the unemployment rate close to 9 percent at the end of this  year, a rate far above anyone’s \nestimate of full employment.   \nGiven the evidence of substantial excess capacity  and a quite low core inflation rate, it is \nabsolutely appropriate that monetary policy – and indeed fiscal policy – ha ve been deployed in a \nway that encourages a more robust recovery.  Go ing forward, it is my view that monetary policy \nmust continue to focus on addressing both elemen ts of the Fed’s mandate – price stability, and \ngrowth supporting a retu rn to full employment in the medium term.  \nToday I am going to focus on two questions that  seem to be at the forefront of most \ndiscussions of the recovery.   \nThe first question is, what role will housing play in the recovery ?  As the most interest-\nsensitive component of gross domestic product (GDP), housing has traditionally been an \nimportant sector of the economy for generating r ecovery.  I will be highl ighting the fact that, \ndespite some improvement in factors fundamental  to a housing recovery, I expect housing will \nnot provide as much support to th is recovery as it has in prev ious ones.  My sense is that \nresidential investment, consumer durables, and services related to hous ing will be less robust \nthan is usual in many recoveries, thus playing a role in what I think will be only a gradual \nimprovement in the economy and employment.   \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, January 14, 2011 at 1:15 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY * \n \n3 \n To put it plainly, these housing-related headwi nds are part of why I do not expect growth \ngreater than 4 percent this year.  And while 4 percen t is not terrible, at that rate it will still take a \nvery long time to get back to full employment.  \nThe second key question is, how concerned should we all be about a flare-up in inflation \n– and aren’t the measures the Fed has taken inflationary ?  Many have expressed concern that \nFederal Reserve policy actions that expanded our ba lance sheet dramatically  will cause inflation.  \nI firmly believe that in the short run inflation is likely to remain quite low – and that in the longer \nterm we have the tools, and the steadfast comm itment, to address inflationary pressures.   \nIndeed, while monetary policy works with lags , I would note that it has been more than \ntwo years since the Fed’s balance sheet expanded dramatically.  Si nce that time, core inflation \nhas fallen  and core inflation measures using the CP I or PCE indexes are at something like 50 \nyear lows.   \nToday I will briefly address the role of the low inflation rate for the economy and \npolicymaking.  In doing so, I will discuss why inflat ion concerns have not materialized to date, \nand why I expect core inflation to remain be low 2 percent over the next several years.   \n \nQuestion 1: Housing and the Economic Recovery \nThe economic recovery officially began in  the third quarter of 2009, according to the \norganization responsible for dati ng our recessions – the National Bureau of Economic Research \n(NBER).  Despite being a year and a half into the official recover y, the recovery period has been \nso tepid that there has been ve ry little improvement in the pe rcentage of the population employed \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, January 14, 2011 at 1:15 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY * \n \n4 \n (see Figure 1 ).  The percent of the population empl oyed in December was 58.3, close to the low \nof this cycle and below the 59.3 percent employed in July of 2009, when the recovery officially \nstarted.  For context, the numb er was around 63 percent when the recession began.  The recent \nstability of the employment-to-popul ation ratio reflects the poor la bor market performance of the \ncurrent recovery. We are simply not gene rating enough jobs to reduce the number of \nunemployed persons.  Nor are we, by the way, providing job opportunities for the so-called \n“discouraged workers” who have given up looking for work. \nWhat we call final sales – growth in GDP excluding inventory replenishment – has grown \nquite slowly over the past year and a half.  Figure 2  shows that the growth to date has been \nsubstantially slower than duri ng the 1982 recovery, and is trac king quite closely to the weak \nrecovery experienced in the early 2000s.  As many economists anticipated, the recovery has been \ntepid given the fact that it comes in the wake  of a collapse in a hous ing bubble with resulting \nfinancial market turmoil and disruption. \nThe largest GDP component is consumpti on, and consumption has not grown very \nquickly.  As Figure 3  shows, in the current recovery, gr owth in consumption has been much \nslower than in the 1982 recovery and has, unfortunately, tracked th e anemic initial recovery from \nthe 2001 recession.  While the 2001 recession damaged many a household’s finances, through an abrupt decline in stock-market wealth, the cu rrent recovery has been hampered by households \ntrying to rebuild their finan ces given sharply diminished housing  wealth in addition to declines in \nthe value of their ot her investments.  \nWhile there have been concerns about business fixed investment, Figure 4  shows that \nthis component of GDP has grown quite well relative to the last tw o recoveries – although \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, January 14, 2011 at 1:15 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY * \n \n5 \n somewhat slower than the 1982 recovery.  Despit e the concern over economi c uncertainty voiced \nby many businesses, investment has been growing.   \nThe real laggard in this recovery has been  housing.  While housing is a relatively small \ncomponent of GDP, it can be quite volatile – and often grows rapidly during an economic \nrecovery.  In addition, purchase s of appliances, home furnishi ngs, and housing-related services \nare impacted by slowed housing activity.  Given th e problems that flow from the bursting of the \nhousing bubble, Figure 5  shows that residential fixed invest ment is roughly where it was at the \ntrough of the recession – and thus not providing its more usual contribution to growth in the \nearly stages of a recovery.   \nJust how moribund the housing market has been is shown in Figure 6 .  Both housing \nstarts and building permits have leveled off, but  are showing no signs of a significant recovery \nyet.   \nInterest rates are quite low by historical standards, while  the equity component of \nhousehold net worth is improving, as shown in Figure 7 .  And we have seen some positive \nimprovement in real disposable  income.  Given all that, one would normally anticipate that \nhousing would be improving.   \nHowever, lower interest rates are only  helpful if credit is available.  Figure 8 shows that \nthe number of purchase loans to prime borrowers has been declining, while  the subprime market \nis dormant.1  The left side of Figure 9 shows the distribution of all home-purchase loans by \ncredit score in 2006 (before th e financial crisis) and in 2010.2  It is striking how the distribution \nof purchase mortgages has change d.  Credit standards have tighten ed, as evidenced by a shift to \nborrowers with higher credit scores.  Give n what has happened to housing prices, and \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, January 14, 2011 at 1:15 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY * \n \n6 \n unemployment, lenders are presum ably more cautious in lending.  Far fewer loans are going to \nborrowers with credit scores below 625, and ma ny more purchase loans are going to borrowers \nwith credit scores above 750.  In  2006, about 15 percent of the purch ase loans were to borrowers \nwith credit scores below 625, but by 2010, this fraction had fallen to only 3.5 percent.   \nThe decline in loans to borrowers with sub- 625 scores has not comple tely resulted from \nthe decline in subprime lending.  The right side of the fi gure shows the credit-score distributions \namong prime  loans, and a similar rightward shift in the distribution is apparent.  From 2006 to \n2010, the share of prime purchase lo ans going to borrowers with sub- 625 credit scores fell from \n8.5 to 3.5 percent.  At the same time, the share of prime purchase loans go ing to borrowers with \nscores above 750 rose from about 35 percent to about 41 percent. \nWhile I am certainly not advocating going b ack to the loose lending standards of, say, \n2006, I think we should be aware of how changes in  the distribution have implications for the \nhousing recovery.  In particular, I would sugge st that current lending standards are another \nreason the housing secto r’s role in the recovery is likel y to be weaker than usual.   \nIn addition to the challenge of availability of credit to borrowers with low credit ratings, \nhousing has another issue.  Both the homeowne r and rental vacancy rates are quite high, as \nshown in Figure 10 –  although there has been recent improvement in these rates, and hopefully \nthe trend is now downward.  High vacancy rate s, of course, place downward pressure on home \nprices and rental rates, and serve as another headwind to a housing recovery. \n So again, all in all and despite some impr ovement in factors fundamental to a housing \nrecovery, I expect that housing wi ll not provide as much  support to this recovery as it has in \nprevious ones.   \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, January 14, 2011 at 1:15 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY * \n \n7 \n But now I’d like to turn to the second que stion, and perhaps leave you feeling a bit less \ndiscouraged when we’re through. \n \nQuestion 2: Inflation, Policy, and the Economic Recovery \nA second key question involves the concerns about Fed actions stoki ng inflation.  This \nquestion is not a distinct and sepa rate issue from the one we just  discussed – the strength of the \nrecovery.  In fact they are crucially related.  If housing-related growth is not going to boost the \nrecovery this time around, we may need policy – particularly monetary policy – to continue \nplaying a stimulative role.   \nBut it is important to look at possible costs of  stimulative policy, as we ll as benefits.  If \ninflation were to become a problem that would cert ainly fall in the costs co lumn.  But if analysis \nsuggests that inflation is not likel y to be a problem, then we can more comfortably align policy to \ncontinue supporting the recovery. \nSome observers and analysts have voiced  great concern that the nascent economic \nrecovery, combined with the acti ons of the Federal Reserve that have expanded its balance sheet, \nwill lead to significant inflation.  However, Figure 11  provides a variety of different measures of \ncore inflation; core CPI, core PCE, trimmed core CPI and trimmed core PCE.  It is striking how \nmuch all four series have declined.  In fact many of these series are at th eir historical lows.   \nFigure 12  shows the different measures of core in flation in the top panel, and the Federal \nReserve’s balance sheet in the bottom panel.  In  the fall of 2008, the Federal Reserve’s balance \nsheet expanded significantly – but that period al so corresponds to the em ergence of disinflation \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, January 14, 2011 at 1:15 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY * \n \n8 \n (a reduction in the inflation rate) in the U.S.  While monetary policy wo rks with lags, why has \nthe unprecedented increase in the Federal Rese rve’s balance sheet corre sponded with continued \nsignificant disinflation?  The answer is that  both have been reacting to an unprecedented \nfinancial shock, which resulted in signi ficant excess capacity in the economy.   \nWhen the Federal Reserve purchases assets and expands its balance sheet, it necessarily \ninjects more reserves into the banking system . The key question is what banks do with those \nreserves. Reserves held by the ba nking system that are not used to provide credit to businesses \nwill have little bearing on either real  spending or inflation.  The 2009 line in Figure 13  shows \nthat the expansion of bank reserves has not generated increases in lending.  As with the 1991 \nrecovery, where a credit crunch impeded expans ion of bank lending, there has not been an \nexpansion of lending during this re covery.  This is particularly noticeable if we look at business \nlending, in Figure 14 .  Commercial and industr ial loans are substantia lly lower than at the \nrecession trough.   \nOf course, those who worry about the inflati onary consequences of our balance sheet may \nbe looking to the future.  As the economy impr oves, banks may use their reserves to rapidly \nexpand business lending – increasing economic activity and putting upward pressure on inflation.  But as Chairman Bernanke has emphasi zed, the Federal Reserve has at its disposal a \nvariety of tools that will allo w it to remove reserves from  the banking system once economic \nconditions get closer to normal. Thus the fear that our large balance sheet and the large stock of \nreserves in the banking system will cause inflation – either now or down the road – seems misplaced to me. \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, January 14, 2011 at 1:15 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY * \n \n9 \n While we have been experiencing disinflation ge nerally, it is not the case for all prices.  \nAs Figure 15  shows, some prices have risen rapidly.  Energy prices in pa rticular have been \nrising, in response to robust growth in emerging markets.  But outside of energy prices, most \nprices have shown little increase, and in fact a number of the major categories in the CPI index \nhave experienced declines in prices.  \nTo be clear, the Fed certainl y cares about increases in en ergy prices, for two reasons.  \nFirst, higher energy prices could potentially br ing about long-lasting in creases in the overall \ninflation rate. The Fed therefore monitors ener gy prices closely, given our mandate to keep \noverall inflation low and stable. Second, rising energy prices act as a tax on households and \nbusinesses, who often find it difficult to reduce their consumption of energy in the short run.3   \nWith regard to the first concern, our research suggests that the lasting effect of energy \nprices on overall inflation has been surprisingly sma ll in recent years.  For evidence, consider the \nenormous surges in oil prices in mid-2008, which were followed by significant declines  in core \ninflation, as I mentioned earlier.  \nThe second concern remains, however.  In su m, my primary concern about rising energy \nprices is not so much that they will lead to higher inflation, but that they will subtract from \nhousehold income and thus weaken the economy. \nFinancial markets are also not expecting sharply higher rates of inflation.  The difference \nbetween the 10 year Treasury rate and the 10 year inflation-protected Trea sury security (TIPS) \nrate provides a measure of the expected average in flation rate over the next decade.  As shown in \nFigure 16 , the average expected inflation rate by th is measure is still below what the markets \nexpected prior to the recession and the necessary expansion of the Fed’s balance sheet. \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, January 14, 2011 at 1:15 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY * \n \n10 \n Concluding Observations        \nThankfully, we are seeing signs that the ec onomy is experiencing a more self-sustaining \nrecovery.  However, it is important not to lose si ght of how much excess capacity remains.  It is \nlikely to take at least four years to return to full employment from the current unemployment rate \nof 9.4 percent.  It is also likely that measures of core inflation will remain well below 2 percent \nover the same period.  This suggests that the signs  of improvement we have seen so far are not \nworrisome, but are most welcome.  A sustaine d period of the economy growing well above its \npotential – not just for a few quarter s – is exactly what we need.   \nThe current level of accommodation from mone tary and fiscal policy is appropriate.  \nHowever, once the economy has significantly imp roved, both fiscal and monetary policy will \nneed to be much less accommodative.  Getting this  balance right will be one of the main policy \nchallenges over the next several years.  I am confident that the Fed’s Federal Open Market \nCommittee (FOMC) will meet the challenge. \nFinally, I’d like to note that even with some early signs of economic improvement, a \nnumber of risks remain.  As I have highlighted  today, the housing market remains fragile and is \nnot likely to contribute to economic recovery in its traditional way – and this is part of why I do \nnot expect growth to exceed 4 percent in 2011.  Furthermore, in many areas of the country the \nimpaired balance sheets of borrowers, high fo reclosures, and high vaca ncy rates imply a long \ntime before local housing markets normalize.  St ate and local governments remain significantly \nchallenged by the aftershocks of the financial crisis and recession.  And many state and local \ngovernments continue to have both short- run and long-run fiscal challenges.   \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, January 14, 2011 at 1:15 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY * \n \n11 \n Finally, the large fiscal deficits of many governments accrued during the recession will \nneed to be addressed.  And as Figure 17  shows, financial markets are concerned that many \ncountries will be forced to make very painfu l fiscal choices – in economies with already \nsignificant challenges – or risk default. \nYet while risks like these remain, the economy is  in a much better place than it was one \nor two years ago.  Fiscal and monetary po licy responded aggressive ly, and in my view \nappropriately, to avoid what would have been a much more severe outcome, absent action.   \nThere will be a time when these aggressive actions need to be reversed, but first we need \nto get the economy on a much more solid footing.   Even with a relativel y robust recovery, it will \ntake several years before we attain full employ ment and an inflation ra te close to a long-run \nexpectation of 2 percent.  Ta ken together there has been cl ear room for – and indeed an \nimperative for – policy actions like those the Federal Reserve has been pursuing.4  Going \nforward our focus must be on policies that re turn the economy to a place that meets both \nelements of the Fed’s mandate. \nThank you. \n \n                                                             \n \nNOTES: \n \n1 Figures 8 and 9 are based on data from McDash Analytics LLC, a subsidiary of Lender Processing Services, Inc.  \nThe McDash data contain loan-level data from mortgage servicers, and cover more than half of all outstanding \nmortgages in the United States.  The number of servicers contributing to the McDash dataset is growing over time, \nso the decline in purchase loans depicted in Figure 8 probably understates the true decline in lending to a small \nextent.  The 2010 distributions reflect data through November 2010. \n  \n2 The share of subprime loans in the McDash data is ge nerally smaller than the true subprime share of U.S. \nmortgages.  To create Figure 9, subprime loans in the McDash data were “upweighte d,” so that the adjusted \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, January 14, 2011 at 1:15 P.M.

The benchmark figure used for the \nweighting is based on the top panel of Figure 1B in Mayer and Pence (2008): “Subprime Mortgages: What, Where \nand to Whom?” Finance and Economics Discussion Series Paper No. 2008-29, Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System – available on th e Board of Governors website at \nhttp://www.federalreserv e.gov/PUBS/FEDS/2008/200829/200829pap.pdf \n  \n3 The first effect would lead Fed policy to be slightly le ss accommodative while the latter effect would lead it to be \nslightly more accommodative.  \n \n4 For additional perspective, see Vice Ch air Janet Yellen’s remarks of January 10, where she discusses the rationale, \ndesign, and effectiveness of the Federal Reserve’s asset-purchase program; and concerns about inflation or adverse \nimbalances resulting.

I’d like to thank Boston Univ ersity and all the conference organizers, \nparticularly Larry Kotlikoff, for the opportunity to  be here to discuss lessons learned from the \nglobal financial meltdown.* \n Everyone knows that the past three years have been a part icularly difficult period for \nglobal financial market stability and for the globa l economy.  The financial crisis clearly showed \n                                                             \n \n* Of course, the views I express today are my own, not  necessarily those of my colleagues on the Board of \nGovernors or the Federal Open Market Committee (the FOMC). \n\n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Monday, February 28, 2011 at 8:50 A.M.

And in spite of a fair \namount of focus on financial stabil ity prior to the crisis, events highlighted that the private and \npublic sectors both here and abroad  were not fully prepared for th e kinds of financial shocks we \nexperienced. \n Today I’d like to discuss the role of what I call “financial myths” in creating financial \ncrises.  By financial myths I mean the belief s, held by most market participants and by \nregulators, that certain outcomes  are so unlikely to occur that they can basically be ignored – \nessentially that low probability events, based on historical  experience, can be reclassified as zero \nprobability events.  When these sorts of widespread assumptions – these financial myths – turn out to be wrong, most financial-market particip ants find themselves poorly positioned for the \nresulting shocks.  The result is insolvency of  groups of firms and substantial uncertainty – \nuncertainty about the exposure of many firms to di rect losses, or to indirect losses created by \ntheir counterparty exposure to other firms that suffer direct losses. \n These so-called financial myths are not unique to this time period, or  to this country.  I \nwould like to briefly mention two among the numer ous examples from recent history – examples \nwhere financial myths were important in helping to create a potential crisis.  The first example involves the assumption of many in Japan that real estate prices could not fall in the late 1980s.  \nThe second involves the assumption, in the late 1 990s, that the Internet had completely changed \nhow we should think about  company valuation. \n I will then briefly mention four financial my ths that played critical roles in the recent \nfinancial crisis.  These incl ude the following assumptions:  \n• that a diversified portfolio of US real esta te had little risk of  falling in value;  \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Monday, February 28, 2011 at 8:50 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY * \n \n3 \n • that Triple-A rated securi ties based on mortgages were  so well protected by the \nstructure of the securitization that they posed  little risk even if real estate prices did \nfall;  \n• that the evolution of many financial institutio ns to an “originate to distribute” model \nof lending and securitization meant there wa s little risk exposure to declining real \nestate prices; and,   \n• that there was little risk of a “run” on or ganizations like investme nt banks that relied \non short-term, collateralized borrowing. \n Then to conclude I’d like to briefly menti on what we can and must do to reduce the risks \nresulting from these sorts of financial myths, going forward.  I believe that financial stability will, in the future, be better served as we im plement some of the protections afforded by the \nDodd-Frank Act; but I also suspect that doing better at protecting against various financial myths \nultimately requires a cultural change.  As a discip line, risk management has been too willing to \naccept that historical stat istical relationships will be stable.  Ideally, risk management practices \nwould lead us to ask things lik e “What will happen if the hist orical relationship breaks down?” \nand “What assumptions would need to change for them to break down?”  \nAlso, I will touch on the fact that challenging assumptions and understanding the risk \ninherent in relying solely on hist orical experience should not be the responsibility of the risk \nmanager alone.  These things also need to be be tter ingrained in CEOs, members of boards of \ndirectors, and regulators.  I believe we need to do a much better job of us ing so-called stress tests \nto challenge commonly held views, so that boa rds of directors and re gulators of firms better \nunderstand the fundamental drivers of risks in organizations and in the financial system. \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Monday, February 28, 2011 at 8:50 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY * \n \n4 \n Financial Myths in Recent History \n Let me look back to the time period before th e most recent crisis and share two examples \nof financial myths – and, unfortunately, their me ssy demise.  And I would emphasize that these \nare just two of many examples of the phenomenon. \nFirst, I’ll note that du ring the late 1980s, New England began to experience substantial \ndeclines in residential and commercial real estate prices.  My research at that time at the Boston \nFed was focused on how problems at financial institutions could disrupt credit availability.  Interestingly, in 1989 I was visited by a variety of  Japanese academics and government officials.  \nThey wanted to understand how we had missed the si gns of an overheating r eal estate market.   \nAs Figure 1  indicates, it was shall we say an inte resting time for researchers from Japan \nto ask such a question.  However, when I inquired about the rapid increase in real estate prices in \ntheir country, I always received the same answer – Japan is an island nation and had limited \nbuildable lots, and that prevented real estate pric es from declining.  This view was very widely \nheld.  However, as you can see in Figure 2 , that widely held financia l myth was soon shattered.  \nUnfortunately, the result of this be lief was eventually the crippling of some of the world’s largest \nfinancial institutions, a long period of subpar economic growth in Japan, and eventually a \nproblematic deflation that Japan struggles with to this day. \n A second example is provided by the growth of the Internet, and in pa rticular the growth \nin “dot-com” stock valuati ons, in the late 1990s.  As Figure 3  shows, there was a substantial run-\nup in stock valuations during this period.  At the time I had conversati ons with a variety of \nfinancial professionals in Boston who made the argument that traditional valuation measures no \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Monday, February 28, 2011 at 8:50 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY * \n \n5 \n longer applied.  The view assumed by many was that valuation of firms should be based on \nclicks of a computer mouse rather than earnings, either current or expected in the future.   \nAs Figure 4  shows, such enthusiasm for a new way of valuing companies was short-\nlived.  But importantly, the substantial decline in Internet-related stocks di d not create a financial \ncrisis.  Many of the positions were equity fi nanced – so, while significant wealth was lost, \nfinancial institutions and financial markets did not suffer severe repercussions.  That loss in \nwealth helped ignite the 2001 recession, but it was a much more mild downturn than the one we \nhave experienced of late.  With the financial in frastructure not significan tly damaged, the impact \nwas much less severe than if individuals a nd firms had taken highly leveraged positions. \n \nFinancial Myths in the Recent Crisis \n Now I’d like to describe, and present some char ts that illustrate, four financial myths that \nplayed a role in the recent crisis. \n \nMyth 1 – Diversification eliminated  the risk of declines in residential real estate holdings \n Despite the experience of Japan’s real estate in the 1990s, and substant ial declines in real \nestate prices in many regions of the United States throughout history, many  commentators argued \nthat a significant, widespread housin g-price decline in a country as large and varied as the United \nStates had not happened historically and was very unlikely to occur.   \nThat logic was based on what you see in Figure 5,  which highlights that there had been \nsignificant declines in some regions  of the country – but the dec lines were coincident with \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Monday, February 28, 2011 at 8:50 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY * \n \n6 \n increases elsewhere.  As Figure 6  shows, there had not been recent, sustained declines in \nnational  real estate prices.  This observation, combin ed with the increased securitization of real \nestate into diversified national portfolios, gave buyers – and t hose rating the securitizations – \nconfidence that the “real estate cycle risk” was substantially mitigated through diversification.   \nBut, as Figure 7  shows, the assumption that a geographi cally diversified por tfolio of real \nestate assets would avoid pr ice declines proved wrong.  While prices nationally had not \nexperienced a substantial decline in the past, for three years the U.S. has experienced substantial \nand sustained declines in prices.  \nSome of my colleagues point out, probably appropriately, that  given the historical data \nthe failure to anticipate nationw ide house prices falling is la rgely understandable.  It was \ncertainly very widespread.  What may be more surprising is that in the 2005 timeframe, when \nmany were expecting house prices  to slow down or flatten, ther e was not much by way of risk \nmitigation undertaken. \n \nMyth 2 – Triple-A mortgage secu rities carried little risk  \n The securitization market – that is, the mark et for securities based on various slices of \npooled mortgages – grew dramatically over the pa st decade.  One reason for the growth in \nsecuritization was investor interest  in, and demand for, securities with little credit risk but returns \nabove those of Treasuries.   \nMany buyers of such securities felt sure of tw o things.  First, that  national real estate \nprices were quite unlikely to fall – in other words, our Myth 1.  Second, that even in the highly \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Monday, February 28, 2011 at 8:50 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY * \n \n7 \n unlikely event that the price of a national portfolio did fall, they would be protected by the \nstructure of the securitization.  S ecuritizations were stru ctured so that any losses were first borne \nby lower-rated securities built from the pool of underlying mortgages.  Given the structure, the \nassumption was that lower-valued securities woul d take all potential losses if borrowers \ndefaulted.  Many – but not all, of course1 -- assumed that home-price declines and related \ndefaults would have to be very extreme before  the highest rated, Trip le-A securities were \nimpacted.  Under this assumption these securities  fully deserved the Triple-A rating given by the \nrating agencies.   \nI should note that making this assumption about Triple-A rated mortgage backed \nsecurities (MBSs) proved less problematic than  making this assumption about the recombined \nlower tranches of mortgage-backed  securities that were billed as Triple-A rated collateralized \ndebt obligations (CDOs). 2 But many investors focused not  on the security’s underlying \ncomponents, merely on the ratings. \n Figure 8  shows that Triple-A securities remained at par values as the securitization boom \ngathered steam.  However, Figure 9  shows that when the severity of the decline in house prices \nmanifested itself, even the Triple-A rated mo rtgage securities collapsed in value.  The \ncombination of illiquidity, growing concerns with the real estate market, and ebbing confidence \nin the ratings resulted in dramatic declines in th e pricing of Triple-A securities as the financial \ncrisis worsened.3 \n \n \n \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Monday, February 28, 2011 at 8:50 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY * \n \n8 \n Myth 3 - The “originate to distribute” mode l limited the balance- sheet risk of banks \n Over the decade preceding the crisis, large commercial and investment banks had become \nincreasingly involved in securiti zing mortgage assets.  They ar gued that this provided a steady \nstream of fee income but generated little risk fo r the bank.  While they packaged mortgages, they \nwere not retaining the risk in their own portfo lio – instead, the risk was taken by those that \npurchased the mortgage securities, particular ly the lower-rated mort gage securities.   \n What was frequently ignored by many was the rapid growth of Triple-A mortgage \nsecurities holdings elsewhere with in the banks, as well as in off balance sheet structures.  While \nthese off balance sheet structures were consid ered separate entities , banks found the potential \nreputational risk of not supporting their sponsored off balance sheet risk sufficiently great that \nmany ended up supporting these off balance sheet struct ures. In a sense, “ori ginate to distribute” \nwas, in practice, something more like “origina te to hold, loosely, some what off to the side.4” \nIn addition, risk managers, bank management, and regulators were su fficiently lulled by \nMyths 1 and 2 to develop their faith in Myth 3.  The unfortunate result was that these banks were \nnot as protected from falling hous ing prices as many had assumed, and this contributed to the \nsubstantial decline in stock pr ices and the need for government  support for many of these large \nfinancial intermediaries. \n \n \n \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Monday, February 28, 2011 at 8:50 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY * \n \n9 \n Myth 4 – Investment banks were not subject to runs, because their liabilities were \ncollateralized \n There has long been an unde rstanding, and indeed a regulatory presumption, that banks \ncould be subject to “runs,” resulting in a need  for both deposit insurance and a heavily regulated \nenvironment to reduce that risk.  At the same tim e, it had largely been presumed that investment \nbanks were better protected agains t such runs.  While the balance sheets of investment banks had \nsubstantial short-term lia bilities, many of them were collateralized.  I nvestment banks would buy \nlonger-term securities  but finance them with short- term borrowing (using repurchase \nagreements).  It was assumed that because ther e was collateral backing up the loans, borrowers \nwere protected and would not run. \n Financing securities with short-term borrowi ng allowed investment banks to substantially \nexpand their balance sheets, as shown in Figure 10 .  However, the lenders in this market were \nother banks, money-market funds, and hedge f unds.  As questions about the value of the \ncollateral became more prominent, and the solven cy and liquidity of investment banks became a \ngreater concern, many short-term lenders abandoned the market.  Figure 11  shows the dramatic \nchange that occurred.  The inability to finan ce large securities holdings  made the traditional \nmodel of investment banking unsustainable, and th is contributed to the failure of investment \nbanks and the merger under duress, or convers ion to bank holding companies, of others. \n \nWhat Can We Do about Financial Myths, Going Forward? \n We plumb this history to help us understa nd what we can do about financial myths, going \nforward, and how we can avoid their damaging impact.   \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Monday, February 28, 2011 at 8:50 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY * \n \n10 \n As the previous slides have shown, taking too much confidence in  historical data \nrepeating in the future can be dangerous – to the financial health of instit utions and the financial \nsystem.  That said, we are probably not likel y to see a sea-change  in the tendency for \noverconfidence in and reliance on recen t statistical regularities.   \nHowever, there are a variety of market par ticipants that could better protect their own \ninterests – and the financial syst em – if they spend more time understanding the key assumptions \nbeing made in financial modeling, and have a clearer understanding of what could happen if \nthose assumptions were invalid.  Properly done, stress testing should provide valuable \ninformation to organizations on key risk drivers.  This needs to be more than feeding a handful of \nmacroeconomic assumptions into a model.  It requi res an understanding of the events that could \nlead to that macroeconomic outcome , and what other indire ct effects might be likely to occur.   \n Who should be responsible for regular, thoughtful stress testing?  Risk managers, CEOs, \nand boards of directors should all understand key risk drivers – and should consider whether a \nstress scenario is sufficiently severe, and whethe r the direct and indirect  effects are reasonably \ncaptured.  Rating agencies and stock analysts sh ould be increasingly demanding better quality \nstress tests, and that the results be made available to them.  Finall y, regulators should be able to \ncompare and contrast the quality of stress te sts across organizations and hold accountable those \norganizations that are not keep ing up with their peers.  \nAs I mentioned at the outset, challenging assu mptions and understanding risks should not \nonly be the responsibility of the risk manager.  Th ese things also need to be better ingrained in \nCEOs, members of boards of di rectors, and regulators.   \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Monday, February 28, 2011 at 8:50 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY * \n \n11 \n Operationalizing this point is not going to be easy, but it is critical.  At a fundamental \nlevel, debunking a myth requires individuals to go  against strongly and widely held beliefs, to \nconvince decision-makers, and to build consensus. For this to happen we may need significant \nchanges in the governance of risk management at ba nks and other parties in the financial system.  \nPut more plainly, we need to think about an e nvironment where those in  the position of most \ninfluence have the incentive to “poke holes” in  myths via robust stress tests, and not the \nincentives to override their risk managers when th e stress-test implications  are not to their liking, \nor risk a near-term loss of clients or market share. \n \nConcluding Observations \n New financial myths are regularly created.  In closing, I will just speculate on where \nsome may exist that interested pa rties should be exploring, now.   \n \n• Potential Myth 1 – Sovereign debt problems will not be disruptive to the world \neconomy.  Not long ago, the sovereign debt prob lems were viewed as manageable \nand confined to one country.  However, as interest rate spread s have widened – as \nshown in Figure 12  – investors are highlighting that problems in many countries have \nyet to be resolved.   While I believe the most likely outcome is that there are no \nserious disruptions, interested parties shoul d diligently consider scenarios that could \nbe disruptive, involvi ng various countries. \n \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Monday, February 28, 2011 at 8:50 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY * \n \n12 \n • Potential Myth 2 – State and local financing problems will not be disruptive to the national \neconomy.   While much attention has been give n to problems in state and local \nfinances, it is generally assumed that the capacity exists to resolve these problems.  \nWhile I expect these issues will be resolved without widespread or cascading \nproblems, we should consider what scenarios could emerge if political impasses result \nin more disruptive outcomes. \n These are just two of many pot ential scenarios that are wo rth exploring.  However, I \nwould add that the recent financ ial crisis highlighted that unlikely  events can happen, and when \nthey do, the outcomes can be quite costly for ever yone.  So the need for better risk management \nis clear.  Fortunately, the oppor tunity is there as well. \nThank you. \n \n                                                             \n \nNOTES: \n \n1 Boston Fed researchers note some examples of contrary analysis of Subprime ABS structures written in \n2005 suggesting vulnerability to even a 5 percent fall in house prices.

Rosengren \nPresident & Chief Executive Officer \nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston \n \n \nRemarks to the Massachusetts Chapter of  \nNAIOP, the Commercial Real Estate  \nDevelopment Association \n \n \nMay 4, 2011  \n \n  \n  \nI would like to thank David Begelfer and his colleagues at NAIOP Massachusetts for \ninviting me to join you today to discu ss the economy and mo netary policy.   \nI am happy that financial markets and the economy have made significant progress since \nthe depths of the financial crisis, but I am far le ss happy that the recovery  to date has been so \nundesirably slow and anemic.  In my reading of economic history this is , unfortunately, typical \nof economic downturns that are accompanied by severe financial disruptions. \n\n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, Ma y 4, 2011 at 8:05 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY * \n \n2 \n The debate I’d like to focus on today is the on e over the likely impact of recent increases \nin the prices of food and energy, a nd how monetary policy should respond.*  The Fed’s policy \nstance, as you know, is currently very accommoda tive – a stance that I believe is appropriate \ngiven the tentative reco very and still-high unemployment.  But with food and energy prices \nrising, some observers think the Fed should sh ift its stance to less accommodation – slowing \neconomic growth now to ensure we don’t have un desirably high inflation in the future – even \nthough current measures of core inflation (tha t is, inflation omitting volatile food and energy \nprices) remain low by hist orical standards.    \nAs the recovery continues – albeit slowly – several events have occurred that further \ncomplicate the outlook for inflation and real economi c activity.   Political upheaval in the Middle \nEast has contributed to sharply higher oil prices.  Severe weat her has reduced harvests from \nRussia to Australia, causing higher prices for many agricultural pr oducts.  And Japan’s tragic \nearthquake and tsunami caused not on ly terrible loss of life, but also  disruption to a supply chain \nthat is increasingly global. \nSo today I would like to discuss how moneta ry policy should react when the economy is \nbuffeted by a series of these so-cal led “supply shocks.”  I’d like to  just highlight my major points \nbefore getting into the data and anal ysis that underpin my perspective. \nFirst, I want to explain that while I will be making distinctions in this talk between so-\ncalled “core” and overall or total measures of inflation, we at the Federal Reserve look at all \nprices, including food and energy prices, when developing U.S. monetary policy.  While we \n                                                             \n \n* Of course, the views I express today are my own, not  necessarily those of my colleagues on the Board of \nGovernors or the Federal Open Market Committee (the FOMC). \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, Ma y 4, 2011 at 8:05 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY * \n \n3 \n often use core measures as a gui de to where overall inflation is most likely to go, our goal is to \nstabilize overall inflation. \nAllow me to preview one of my conclusions.  Because my analysis suggests that recent \nfood and oil price increases have their roots in concerns  about wheat harvests in Russia and oil \nproduction in Libya and the like, I do not believe that monetary po licy is the appropriate tool to \nrespond to these disruptions.  While many observe rs see food and energy prices rising and \nassume the Fed should tighten polic y – raise the cost of money and credit – to head off inflation, \nI would suggest taking a step back and recogni zing that tighter U.S. monetary policy will do \nnothing to stabilize Libyan oil pr oduction, reduce uncertain ty about political st ability in the rest \nof the Middle East, or increase th e wheat harvest in Russia.   \nIn fact, tightening monetary policy solely in  response to contractionary supply shocks \nwould likely make the impact of the shocks worse  for households and businesses. To see why \nthis is so, it is important to keep in  mind how supply shocks affect the economy.1   \nFirst, supply shocks can lead  to increases in food and ener gy prices that slow economic \ngrowth.  For example, because a person’s need to drive may not be very flexible, spending on gas consumes a bigger portion of their budget.  So an oil shock tends to force consumers to \nreduce their spending on other goods and serv ices as they absorb higher oil costs.\n2     \nSecond, while the prices of goods directly a ffected by the supply disruption increase, \nother prices in the marketplace may be unaffect ed – at least initiall y.  If the supply shock \ninvolves food or energy, this dynamic causes measures of total inflation to rise, but does not \nhave a large impact on what economists call core inflation – which excludes the volatile food \nand energy sectors.  But in the longer-run, the impact of the supply shock on the prices of other  \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, Ma y 4, 2011 at 8:05 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY * \n \n4 \n goods will depend importantly on how inflation expectations  respond to the shock.  If people \nexpect that food and energy prices will stabilize – in other words, that the price shock will be \ntemporary – and do not believe that the central bank will allow any long-run effect on inflation, \nthen the disruption to total inflation will likely  be temporary and the total inflation rate will \neventually converge with the lowe r core inflation rate.  Since 1986, this has largely been what \nhappened when we experienced these types of supply shocks – as I’ll illustrate in a moment with some charts.   \nAlternatively, if expectations of inflation do rise in res ponse to the supply shock, then \n(nominal) wages and salaries across the economy w ill be pressured to increase over time to keep \npace.  If that happens, the supply shock could affect prices throughout the economy – not just \nthose that that were part of the initial supply shock.  In this case , the core rate of inflation rises to \nconverge with the higher measure of total inflat ion.  This was the U.S.  experience in the 1970s, \nfor reasons I’ll discuss in a moment. \nWe at the Fed need to very closely monitor th e data to make sure that inflation remains \ncontained.  And we will.  But as I believe I will  demonstrate this morning, the most likely result \nis that these supply shocks cause slower growth  in the near term while having only a modest \neffect on longer-term inflation rates – which has been the U.S. experience since 1986.   \nUnemployment remains quite elevated, at 8.8 pe rcent, and I anticipate a slower return to \nfull employment than we would have experience d absent these supply shocks.  With the core \ninflation rate over the prior year at a little above 1 percent, I antic ipate only a gradual return of \ncore and total inflation rates to something like our consensus “stable” ra te of about 2 percent, \nover the medium term.   \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, Ma y 4, 2011 at 8:05 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY * \n \n5 \n If the economic data continue to support this outlook then the current, accommodative \nstance of monetary policy is appropriate, and can remain in place and continue to support \neconomic growth – so that we continue to make  progress toward our goal s of returning to full \nemployment and a sustainable long -run inflation rate – the two elements of the Federal Reserve’s \ndual mandate from Congress. \n \nThe Impact of Recent Supply Shocks \nNow that you know my basic take on this ke y – and current – econom ic debate, allow me \nto flesh out my perspective with the supporting data  and analysis. The full impact of the recent \nshocks to supply that I mentioned at the outset will likely emerge over time.  But clearly there \nhave been significant increases in a va riety of food and energy prices.  As Figure 1  illustrates, \nthe recent turmoil in the Middle East has contribute d to a significant increase in oil prices, which \nhave risen to over $100 a barrel.  This is we ll above the average of nearly $80 a barrel \nexperienced over 2010, but at the same time stil l well below the peak of $146 a barrel that \noccurred in mid July, 2008.    \nThe recent volatility in oil prices, as the ch art shows, is quite striking.  Sharp increases \nhave been followed by sharp decreases.  This is one reason we may not want to overreact to price \nchanges – they could be transitory.   \nFigure 2  shows the movements in oil prices – their percent change from a year earlier, in \nthe top line – relative to the cha nge in compensation (the lower li ne), since 2000.  Oil prices have \nrisen recently, but based on the history captured in this chart, one would not expect much of a \nresponse in wages and salaries.  This, of course, is one reason why consumers feel worse off \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, Ma y 4, 2011 at 8:05 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY * \n \n6 \n after an oil supply shock.  Prices at gas st ations in Massachusetts  are now around $4.00 a gallon, \nyet most people’s need to drive cars has not chan ged much if at all.  So income available for \nbuying other goods and services has been s queezed by the increas e in oil prices.3 \nSome softness in measures of consumer c onfidence suggests that consumers tend to be \nless confident about the future when oil prices ri se.  If consumers pull back spending as a result \nof a supply shock, it has the potential to be a dr ag on the economy.  The Boston Fed’s statistical \nmodeling suggests that a $20 increase in the price of a barrel of oil will shave roughly four-tenths \nof a percentage point off the rate of ec onomic growth over two years, and cause the \nunemployment rate to be roughly two-tenths of a pe rcentage point higher th an it would be absent \nthe oil shock.  While this is cer tainly not enough to completely st op the recovery, it does imply a \nslowing down of its pace. \nOil is not the only commodity to experience price increases  of late.  A variety of \nagricultural prices have also increased.  For example, Figure 3  shows the movement of wheat \nprices over the last decade.  Droughts in Russia,  flooding in Australia, and increased demand in \nemerging markets have all placed upwa rd pressure on wheat prices.   \nAs with oil prices, higher food prices app ear to be responding to supply and demand \nfeatures of this market – and th ese types of price cha nges cannot be offset by monetary policy.  It \ngoes without saying that monetary  policy cannot alter the supply of  oil from volatile parts of the \nworld, nor weather conditions in countries that are major exporte rs of agricultural products.   \nMonetary policy can have a role in insuring that relativ e price changes do not alter inflation \nexpectations.  Rising inflation expectations could make it diffi cult to achieve a moderate and \nacceptable inflation rate over the medium term. \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, Ma y 4, 2011 at 8:05 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY * \n \n7 \n Historical Experience with Supply Shocks \n Supply shocks are not unique to this pe riod.  However, the evidence shows that the \neconomic impact of supply shocks on infla tion has changed over time – actually quite \ndramatically.  Figure 4  shows the inflation rate  (total inflation and co re, which again excludes \nfood and energy) since 1970.  What is striking is the way the behavior of the two series differed \nin the 1970 to 1985 period versus the period from 1986 to the present.  The interplay of core and \ntotal inflation is very, very different in the mo re recent period than it was in the former.   \nI realize that delving into topics like total a nd core inflation can seem a bit abstract.  So \nlet me bring in something a bit straight forward – energy prices and inflation.  Figure 5  shows the \nprofound effect that energy prices had in the 197 0s on core inflation.  In the 1970s the lines \nmove up and down together as co re inflation increased with en ergy prices.  That is why my \nearlier chart shows core and to tal inflation moving so closely in that era.  But since 1986, \ndramatic movements in energy prices have not affected core prices.   \nMy next two figures look at each period separately.  Figure 6  shows that for much of that \nearlier period, inflation rates were much higher than they are currently.  From 1970 to 1985, \ninflation was quite volatile – with total inflation (measured by the all-items Consumer Price Index or CPI) peaking at almost 15 percent, in 1980.  The key observation is that during this \nperiod, increases in core inflati on tended to follow increases in total inflation (which includes \nfood and energy).  The oil and food pri ce increases “pulled”  core inflation. \n In contrast, Figure 7  shows the total and core inflat ion rates since 1986.  During this \nperiod, inflation has been lower a nd less volatile.  And unlike in th e earlier period, core inflation \ndoes not follow or gravitate to the level of total inflation.  To tal inflation jumps up and down as \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, Ma y 4, 2011 at 8:05 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY * \n \n8 \n food and energy prices live up to their repu tation for volatility.  The spikes are tough on \nhouseholds, to be sure.  But importa ntly, total inflation ev entually gravitates to the core measure \nthat excludes food and energy.  Co re inflation stays “moored.” \nFigure 8  represents another way to use the availabl e data to explore th is relationship.  It \ntoo shows that the increases in to tal inflation in recent years have  generally been temporary.  For \neach quarter from 1998 to 2010, the figure plots the difference between total inflation and core \ninflation at the time, and the total inflation rate tw o years later.  What it shows is that when there \nis a supply shock such that total inflation ( including  food and energy) exceeds core inflation, two \nyears later total inflation tends to be lower – when  supply shocks such as oil prices drive up total \ninflation relative to core, the total tends to co me back down toward the core inflation rate. \nFigure 9 performs similar analysis but focuses on the future core inflation rate, instead of \nthe total.  It shows no strong rela tionship.  When total and core in flation diverge, core inflation \ntends to stay put.  In other words, in recent year s, when something like an oil shock causes total \ninflation to diverge from core, there was no consis tent implication for the future core inflation \nrate. The shock to total inflation did not become embedded in core inflation. \n Why is all this important?  If supply shocks tend to have a transito ry impact on headline \ninflation, and do not pass through to  any meaningful extent into core inflation, then monetary \npolicy need not respond to the pr ice increases caused by the supply shock.  Currently, we have \nexperienced sharply higher food and energy prices.  If the relationship we document over the last \n13 years continues, we should expect the impact on inflation to be transitory – and that total \ninflation will converge back to core infla tion, which remains well below 2 percent.   \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, Ma y 4, 2011 at 8:05 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY * \n \n9 \n To digress, it is likely the case that supply shocks have become transitory because of the \nway in which monetary policy has tended to re spond.  So, as long as monetary policy behaves \nabout as it has in recent years, then there is no reason to expect supply sh ocks to have lasting \neffects.   \nSo is Fed policy behaving as it has sin ce the mid 1980s?  Interestingly, although Fed \npolicy is perceived as exceptionally accommodati ve, because of hitting the zero lower bound the \nfederal funds rate is actually higher – has come down less – than would be expected if the Fed \nbehaved as it has over the last 25 years.  The current level of the funds rate suggest that we have \nbeen less accommodative in recent years given that in terest-rate reductions (policy easing) ran \ninto at the zero lower bound.4 \n \nWhy the Different Reaction to Supply Shocks Over Time? \nBut how confident should we be that the rela tionship we have experienced over the past \n25 years – little response in medium term infla tion rates to supply shocks – will continue?  The \nanswer is rooted in why we are seeing different  reactions to supply shoc ks – in other words a \ndifferent interplay of total and core inflation – now versus in the past. \nThere are a variety of reasons why medium -term inflation has not  been significantly \ninfluenced by short-run supply shocks in recent  years.  In my view the reasons include the \nincreased role of services in the economy, the im portance of labor costs in  such an economy, the \nreduced share of oil consump tion relative to GDP, and as I mentioned earlier the improved \nconduct of monetary policy versus the 1960s and 1970s.5   \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, Ma y 4, 2011 at 8:05 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY * \n \n10 \n Figure 10  shows that the service sector has grow n from a little over 60 percent of private \nsector employment in 1970 to a little over 80 percent in 2010.  As th e economy has come to \nemphasize services versus manufacturing, it ma y be that commodities (and thus their prices) \nhave become somewhat less important to the production of goods and services.  And goods \nprices are more volatile than services prices, and more likely to be pr iced like commodities. \n Figure 11  shows the per capita consumption of o il declining in the United States.   \nConservation measures by consumers and busine sses have made the economy less dependent on \noil than in the 1970s.  While oil remains a very  important commodity, th e trend towards reducing \ndependence on oil provides greater insu lation from oil-induced supply shocks. \n Figure 12 shows the U.S. share of world oil cons umption (in blue) ticking down, but also \nclearly shows (in red) the steady climb in the sh are consumed by three of the so-called emerging-\nmarket economies – China, India, and Brazil.  Figure 13 shows the growth in oil consumption in \nthose three countries, in the upper three lines.  Both charts depict  quite strikingly the heightened \ndemand for oil emanating from emerging markets.  \nReturning to the U.S. and inflation concerns, Figure 14  shows that the growth rate of \nemployee compensation has generally been d eclining over the past two decades.  With \ncompensation slowing and productivi ty increasing, many firms have been profitable and able to \nwithstand increases in commodity prices without passing su ch costs on to final prices.  This fits \nwith the observation that higher food and energy pr ices have not tended to  have much of an \nimpact on prices in situations where food and energy are not direct costs of doing business. \n Figure 15  shows two measures of inflation expectations, plotted alongside oil price \nmovements.  The red line shows what professiona l forecasters expected inflation to average over \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, Ma y 4, 2011 at 8:05 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY * \n \n11 \n the next 10 years, at various points in time.  Th eir expectations have declined somewhat over the \npast 20 years, but what is striking is the relative  stability of their inflation expectations.  In \naddition, there was no significant reaction to the oil price shock that we experienced in 2008.  \nThe chart also shows a second measure of inflati on expectations – the Un iversity of Michigan \nSurvey (the green line), which asks respondents about their expectations for inflation over the \nnext 5 to 10 years6.  Again these expectations are not very  responsive to movements in oil prices, \nand have remained quite stable over the past two decades. \nIt is worth noting that countries can be aff ected quite differently by supply shocks.  As \nFigure 16  shows, the importance of food in the “b asket” of goods purchased by consumers can \nvary greatly by country.  In le ss developed countries, food is a very significant component of \noverall purchases by consumers.  In a developed country such as the United States, food is a \nmuch smaller share of overall purchases.  Thus the impact of  a food-supply shock on the overall \ninflation rate and on other important economic va riables such as wages and total imports can \nvary widely by country.  Given th e different impacts of supply s hocks, it is not surprising that \nmonetary policy is likely to react differently to a supply shock such as food, depending on the \nunique characteristics of the particular country. \nFigure 17  shows that in the Unite d States, the importance of  food as a component of \ninflation measures has been declining over time.  And, despite improvements in energy \nconservation that have lowered the per capita c onsumption of oil, high er energy prices have \ncontributed to recent increases in the importance of  energy in the consumer price index.  The fact \nthat food and energy prices have been quite volat ile recently, but remain a relatively small part of \nthe entire basket of goods, helps to explain why core in flation rates have not  been particularly \nresponsive to food and energy shocks. \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, Ma y 4, 2011 at 8:05 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY * \n \n12 \n Concluding Observations \n In conclusion, I recognize that recent supply shocks have caused pressures on many \nhousehold budgets, and have led some analysts  and observers to become concerned about \npotential long-term inflationary im pacts.  However, I think the evid ence shows that over the past \n25 years most supply shocks have been transi tory – and have had no long-lasting imprint on \nlonger term inflation, or on inflation expectations.   \nNonetheless, recent historical trends do not al ways continue, so it is important to monitor \ninflation dynamics very closely to make sure that this pattern is continuing  in the incoming data.  \nIn particular, I will look intently  at whether there is any evid ence that the expectations of \nunderlying inflation have change d.  To date, expectations se em quite stable and show no \nevidence of diverging from the recent past.  I am committed to responding decisively, and as \nforcefully as necessary, to ensure  that long-term inflation expect ations remain stable and that \nfood and energy price increases are not passing through to other prices.7  \n Given the important role of labor costs in a developed, services-focused economy such as \nthe United States, it is important to closely mon itor trends in labor markets.  Currently, wages \nand salaries are reflecting he ightened unemployment, and show no evidence that potential \ninflation concerns are pl acing upward pressure on wages and salaries.   \n Core inflation rates tend to be a reasonable predictor of inflation in the intermediate term.  \nCore inflation remains well below my long-run target  for inflation.  This gi ves us flexibility to \nfocus on accommodative monetary policy doing what it can to promote more rapid growth in the \neconomy.  As Figure 18 illustrates, the percent of the adult population that is employed now is \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, Ma y 4, 2011 at 8:05 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY * \n \n13 \n quite low in relation to recent hi story, and has shown only a slight improvement over the course \nof the recovery.   \nSo with significant slack in labor markets, st able inflation expectati ons, and core inflation \nwell below our longer run target, there is currently no reason to  slow the economy down with \ntighter monetary policy.  Until we make more progress on both elements of the Federal \nReserve’s mandate – employment and inflation – the current, accommodative stance of monetary \npolicy is appropriate. \n Thank you.  \n \n                                                             \n \nNOTES: \n \n1 My colleague Geoffrey Tootell, Direct or of Research at the Boston Fed, ha s prepared an illuminating public policy \nbrief that investigates whether commodity price spikes cause  long-term inflation.  The brief, which will be available \nat http://www.bostonfed.org/eco nomic/ppb/2011/ppb111.htm , examines the relationship between trend inflation and \ncommodity price increases and finds that  evidence from recent decades sup ports the notion that commodity price \nchanges do not affect the lo ng-run inflation rate.  Evidence from earlier decades suggests that effects on inflation \nexpectations and wages played a key role in whether commodity price movements altered trend inflation.   \n \n2 Readers may be interested in “Oil and the Macroecono my in a Changing World,” the proceedings of a 2010 \nsymposium held at the Boston Fed to explore the interac tions between energy prices, growth, and inflation – the \ndeterminants of oil prices and about the effect that o il prices have on the world economy.  The proceedings are \navailable at http://www.bostonfed.org/economic/conf/oil2010/index.htm  \n3 Even future purchases can be affect ed, if saving for them is squeezed. \n \n4 The Fed’s Large-Scale Asset Purchases have partly, but not completely, substituted for the constraint imposed by \nthe zero lower bound on policy easing.  With all the excess capacity — a reflection of our inability to be as \naccommodative as we might have liked, given the zero bound — it seems unlikely that supp ly shocks will turn into \nincreased inflation expectations that will a ffect wages and non-oil, non-food prices.  \n \n5 Vice Chair Yellen notes that “a key lesson from the experi ence of the late 1960s and 1970s is that the stability of \nlonger-run inflation expectations cannot be taken for granted. At that time, the Federal Reserve's monetary policy \nframework was opaque, its measures of resource utilization were flawed, and its policy actions generally followed a \nstop-start pattern that undermined public confidence in the Federal Reserve's commitment to keep inflation under \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, Ma y 4, 2011 at 8:05 A.M.

Consequently, longer-term inflation expectations became unmoored, and nominal wages and prices spiraled \nupward as workers sought compensation for past price increases and as firm s responded to accelerating labor costs \nwith further increases in prices. That wage-price spiral  was eventually arrested by the Federal Reserve under \nChairman Paul Volcker, but only at the cost of a severe recession in the early 1980s. Since then the Federal Reserve \nhas remained determined to avoid these mistak es and to keep inflation low and stable.” \n[http://www.federalreserv e.gov/newsevents/speech /yellen20110411a.htm]  \n \n6 The average annual expected price change they expect over the next 5 to 10 years \n \n7 See for example the comments on commodity price pressures and monetary policy by my colleague William \nDudley, president of the New York Fe deral Reserve Bank and Vice Chair of the Federal Open Market Committee:  \n“Inflation expectations are well-anchored today and we intend to keep it that way. A sustained rise in medium-term \ninflation expectations would represent a threat to our price stability mandate and would not be tolerated.” \n[http://www.newyorkfed.org/newseven ts/speeches/2011/dud110228.html]   \n\nHow Should Monetary Policy \nRespond to Price Increases \nDriven by Supply Shocks?\nEric S.

I would like to thank Josef Tos ovsky and the Financial St ability Institute for \ninviting me to speak today on financial stability a nd on regulatory and supervis ory priorities in the \nUnited States.  I would also like to thank Serg ey Ignatiev and the Central Bank of the Russian \nFederation for hosting this  very important event.\n1   \nI think it is crucial that we continue to share perspectives on financial stability and related \nissues.*   Clearly the events of the past four years have heightened our awareness of how \ninterconnected our economies, our financial institu tions, and our financial markets have become.  \nWhen large global financial intermediari es become troubled, it impacts not just home  country \n                                                 \n* Of course, the views I express today are my own, not necessarily those of my colleagues on the \nFederal Reserve’s Board of Governors or the Federal Open Market Committee (the FOMC). \n\n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Tuesday, May 24, 2011, at 2:00 a.m. U.S. Eastern Ti me and 10:00 a.m. in St. Petersb urg, Russia – or Upon Delive ry * \n \n \n \n 2borrowers and, potentially, taxpayers; but increa singly can also have collateral impacts on host \ncountries and their financial markets.  Much has been learned in the United States over the past four y ears about gaps in our \nregulatory and supervisory framework.  One response to  the gaps revealed duri ng the financial crisis \nwas the adoption of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act.  It ushered in \nsignificant changes and also requir ed numerous studies to be undert aken, and new regulations to be \nconsidered and promulgated.  Much of this work is still in process.   \nSome of the most significant as pects of the Dodd-Frank legisl ation involve seeking greater \nclarity in the resolution procedures for comple x financial holding companies that experience \ndifficulties; creating a Financial Stability Oversight Council; esta blishing a Consumer Financial \nProtection Bureau intended to addr ess gaps in consumer protection;  and increasing regulatory powers \nover, and focus on, systemically im portant financial institutions. \n A second major change resulting from the fina ncial crisis has been a reappraisa l of the \nquantity and quality of capital needed to avoid a reo ccurrence.  This matter is clearly critical to the \nBasel III discussions taking place he re over the next two days; but, I would note, has already been the \nfocus of two supervisory exercises conducted in the United States.   \nAs I will describe in more detail in a moment, during a financial crisis investors focus on how \nmuch “core” or “pure” capital exists in an orga nization to absorb immediate and near-term losses.\n2  \nSome of the broader definitions of capital include elements that are not actually readily available to \nabsorb losses.  Capital meeting the broader defi nitions was largely ignore d by investors during the \nintense phases of the crisis, leading to significant financial runs and liquidity problems at institutions whose capital, using the broader definitions, actually  satisfied existing regulatory standards.  As \nconditions deteriorated, ma rket focus shifted from the relative strength implied by regulatory capital \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Tuesday, May 24, 2011, at 2:00 a.m. U.S. Eastern Ti me and 10:00 a.m. in St. Petersb urg, Russia – or Upon Delive ry * \n \n \n \n 3ratios to the vulnerabilities asso ciated with deteriorating measures  of “pure” capital.  This led to \ngreater uncertainty and ultimately to liquidity stresses. \nThe experience in the United States  during the crisis is instructiv e as we think about where we \nshould focus our attention in terms of bank capital, as well as in terms of supervision.  On the latter, I \nwould note that stress testing has prov ed to be an important supervisor y tool in the United States for \njudging the quality and quantity of capital. \n Before delving into the details, I’d like to give you a preview of my main points: \n \n• First, I would like to discuss capital and th e financial crisis, and will suggest that many \nU.S. financial institutions did not have the quality or quantity of capital needed to \nwithstand the shocks we recently experience d.  The focus in Basel III on improving the \nquantity and quality of capital at financial inst itutions – particularly systemically important \nfinancial institutions – is critically important. \n \n• Second, I will suggest that we should be part icularly focused on narrow definitions of \ncapital, which are what investors fo cused on during the financial crisis. \n \n• Third, I will suggest that stress tests are an important supervis ory tool that should be used \nfor prudential and macroprudential3 supervision as well as fo r management’s own capital \nplanning efforts.  The rapid re capitalization of many financia l institutions in the United \nStates greatly benefitted from the attention during supervisory exercises (including stress \ntests) on the quantity and quality of capital.   I will also discuss the evaluation of \ndiscretionary capital distributions (such as  increasing dividends,  and stock buybacks). \n \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Tuesday, May 24, 2011, at 2:00 a.m. U.S. Eastern Ti me and 10:00 a.m. in St. Petersb urg, Russia – or Upon Delive ry * \n \n \n \n 4Capital and the Financial Crisis \nI think it is instructiv e to look at the capital ratios of two of the very large banking \norganizations that encountered problems and we re acquired during the financial crisis.   \nWachovia was one of the four largest banking or ganizations in the Unite d States, with total \nassets in 2008 exceeding $700 billion.  As a result of  large exposure to subprime mortgages, partially \nas a result of an acquisition of a large Califor nia thrift, investors became concerned about the \nsolvency of Wachovia.  A loss of confidence in Wachovia led depositors, funders, and investors –  \nthose on the liability side of the bank’s balance sheet – to  withdraw, pressuring th e institution to sell \nitself.  After a short bidding war between Wells  Fargo and Citigroup, Wells Fargo prevailed and \nacquired Wachovia at the end of 2008. \nWashington Mutual or “WaMu” was the larges t savings and loan holding company in the \nUnited States, with assets over $300 billion.  WaMu  had grown rapidly, with a large exposure to \nresidential real estate and a larg e concentration of both variable ra te and subprime mortgages.  Large \ndepositors became concerned about the solvency of WaMu in September 2008 and began rapidly withdrawing funds.  The instituti on failed later that month (on Sept ember 25) and was acquired by JP \nMorgan Chase. \nFigure 1  provides the capital ratios reported in the last fina ncial filing for both Wachovia and \nWashington Mutual.  The most  narrow definition of capital,\n4 tangible common equity, is a measure of \ncapital widely used by investors (and increasingly so during the crisis) because it focuses on the \n“core” capital readily available to cushion the bank against losses.  The tangible capital measure – \nspecifically the ratio of tangible common equity to tangible assets – was a bit above 2 percent for \nWachovia and about 3 percent for WaMu,5 providing only a small cushion against the losses \naccumulating from their subprime exposures.   \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Tuesday, May 24, 2011, at 2:00 a.m. U.S. Eastern Ti me and 10:00 a.m. in St. Petersb urg, Russia – or Upon Delive ry * \n \n \n \n 5The regulatory capital ratios use broader definitions of capital, re lative to risk-weighted assets.  \nTo be considered adequately  capitalized, a bank needs to have at  least 4 percent Tier 1 risk-based \ncapital to risk-weighted assets, and at least 8 percent total risk-based capital to risk-weighted assets.  \nTo be well capitalized a bank needs to have at least 6 percent Tier 1 risk-b ased capital to risk-\nweighted assets and at least 10 percent total risk-based capi tal to risk-weighted assets.6  Figure 1 \nshows that under these definitions both banks were well capitalized in their final quarter – despite the fact that more narrow definitions of capita l indicated only a very small capital buffer. \nFigure 2  plots the capital ratios for the period leading up to the “run” on Wachovia.  The \nbroader definitions of capital – Tier 1 a nd total risk-based capital – were actually rising  in the period \nwhen holders of Wachovia’s liabili ties were becoming concerned, and thus the broader definitions of \ncapital were not particularly informative.  The more narrow definitions of capital – Tier 1 common \nand tangible common equity – were both declining fairly substantially.   \nIn retrospect, the quality and quantity of capita l was not sufficient for the kind of financial \nshocks experienced in the United States in the cr isis.  Under the Basel I II proposals there is much \nmore attention being given to the quality and quantity of capital.  My own view is that this heightened \nfocus is appropriate, and that the pa rticular capital that truly serves as a cushion against losses during \nperiods of stress should be regulators’ primary focus. \nFigure 3  highlights that since the worst phase  of the crisis, 15 large U.S. banking \norganizations that have reported continuously through the crisis have made significant progress in \nimproving both the quality and quantity of their cap ital.  The most narrow capital definition on the \nchart – the ratio of tangible common equity to tangi ble assets – has risen from a little over 2 percent to \nalmost 6 percent.  This reflects bo th significant raising of external cap ital as well as dramatic declines \nin dividends and stock buybacks dur ing the crisis and the early peri od of recovery.  Both of these \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Tuesday, May 24, 2011, at 2:00 a.m. U.S. Eastern Ti me and 10:00 a.m. in St. Petersb urg, Russia – or Upon Delive ry * \n \n \n \n 6dynamics have had a significant positive impact on the institutions’ ability to withstand potential \nfuture stresses. \nFigure 4  illustrates the amount and composition of  capital – the numerators of the various \ncapital ratios – at the 15 large ba nking organizations over a four-year period.  You can see that there \nhas been an appreciable amount of common equ ity raised by this group of large banks.   \nThe improvement in the quality and quantity of capital is quite striking.  An important aspect \nof this recapitalization has been the supervisory use of stress tests to determine the adequacy of capital, and also in evaluating disc retionary capital distributions (suc h as increased dividend payouts).  \nThe supervisory use of the stress test s is relatively new.  It is worth noting and discussing the fact that \nit is not just capital regulation , but also supervision , that has been a driver  of the recapitalization \nprocess. \n \nStress Tests and Improving the Qu antity and Quality of Capital \nNow I would like to delve a bit deeper into th e role that stress testing has played in \nencouraging more rapid recapitalizati on of U.S. banks, during the financial crisis and the early stages \nof the economic recovery.  The U.S. stress test exercise was conducted from February to April of \n2009 – a period of significant financial turmoil, wh en many private-sector analysts and academic \nobservers had raised concerns about the financ ial condition of the U.S. banking industry.  The \nSupervisory Capital Assessment Program (“SCAP”) was designed to provide a rigorous assessment \nand, in doing so, to ensure that banks had suffici ent capital to sustain additional losses and still \ncontinue providing critical cr edit intermediation should economic conditions deteriorate further. \nThe SCAP exercise was conducted with the 19 largest U.S. domiciled bank holding \ncompanies.  Each bank holding company was prov ided a baseline economic scenario and a more \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Tuesday, May 24, 2011, at 2:00 a.m. U.S. Eastern Ti me and 10:00 a.m. in St. Petersb urg, Russia – or Upon Delive ry * \n \n \n \n 7stressful scenario.  The scenarios were based on p ublicly available private forecasts and provided the \nassumed path for real GDP, unemployment, and house prices over the next two years.  Using these assumptions, the banks were asked to  provide detailed portfolio inform ation so that projections could \nbe made on losses in a variety of loan and security  categories, potential trading losses for firms with \nlarge trading operations, pre-provis ion net revenue, and the allowance for loan losses – allowing for \nestimates of capital posit ions under each scenario. \nThe stress tests were interactive, and were qui te resource intensive for both the banks and the \nsupervisors.  The banks’ submissions were compar ed to a detailed portfoli o analysis done by bank \nsupervisors, and to statistical mode ls intended to capture how key vari ables were likely to be affected \nby stressful conditions.   \nWhile individual business-lin e stress tests had been done by bank supervisors, a \ncomprehensive stress test of all th e largest banks at the same time using the same scenarios was new.  \nWhile conducting the tests simultaneously for all 19 banks was challenging and resource intensive, \nthe exercise provided supervisors the ability to ma ke comparisons across institutions using the same \nunderlying assumptions, and allowed the same core s upervisory staff to be involved in assessments \nacross institutions.  Where banks were outliers re lative to peers, supervisors could ask for more \ndetailed information to determine if these differen ces were justified, based on analysis of comparable \ndata.  In addition, the stress test s were forward looking, so that th e evolution of performance and \nresults over the next two years coul d be compared across institutions.   This provided a rigorous, data-\ndriven assessment.  It also highlighted where institutions needed to do additional work relative to peers to improve their ri sk management practices. \nThe banks were evaluated on whether, over the two-year period under stress assumptions, they \nwere likely to be able to maintain a Tier 1 capita l ratio of 6 percent and a Tier 1 common capital ratio \nof 4 percent.  It is worth noting that for most banks it was the Tier 1 common capital ratio that was \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Tuesday, May 24, 2011, at 2:00 a.m. U.S. Eastern Ti me and 10:00 a.m. in St. Petersb urg, Russia – or Upon Delive ry * \n \n \n \n 8most binding, and was the capital defi nition that best reflected the abil ity to absorb losses.  Of the 19 \nbanks, nine were sufficiently capitalized to meet  the minimum capital ratios under stress conditions, \nwhile ten had a combined capit al shortfall of $75 billion. \nThe banks with a capital shortfall were expected  to provide detailed cap ital plans that included \nraising additional capital – by measur es such as restricting payouts, ra ising new equity, selling assets, \nor utilizing capital available from the U.S. Tr easury.  Banks both with and without shortfalls \naggressively sold assets and raised additional capita l, resulting in a very si gnificant recapitalization of \nthe 19 banks over a relatively short period of time – as is apparent in the figures shown earlier. \n \nStress Testing and Discretionary Capital Distributions \nNow I would like to mention the role of othe r stress testing in decisions to pursue, and \napprove, the resumption of discreti onary capital distributi ons.  The SCAP was designed to estimate \nhow banks would perform under stress conditions.  However, the economic assumptions and the \nimpact of those economic assumptions on financial institutions were by definition educated estimates \nof potential outcomes.  By the end of 2010, many banks were noting that they had substantially \nrecapitalized and in some cases were now well above  regulatory minimums – and thus would like to \nresume or increase stock buybacks or dividend payments. \nTo evaluate the requests by banks to increa se dividend payments, U.S. bank supervisors \npursued an exercise known as the Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Re view (CCAR), and stress \ntesting was one component of that broader exercise.  While the stress testing element was only part of \nthe CCAR review, it was an important input into ev aluating banks’ capital pl anning.  The assessment \nwas conducted between November 2010 and March 2011.  Once again the larges t 19 U.S. domiciled \nbank holding companies were asked to participat e, using a baseline scenario, their own stress \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Tuesday, May 24, 2011, at 2:00 a.m. U.S. Eastern Ti me and 10:00 a.m. in St. Petersb urg, Russia – or Upon Delive ry * \n \n \n \n 9scenario, and a supervisor-provided stress scenario (a set of macroeconomic assumptions consistent \nwith an economic downturn).   \nA critical benchmark was whether banks could meet a 5 percent Tier 1 common capital ratio \nunder stress conditions over the next two years, assuming they paid di vidends or carried out the stock \nbuybacks as they proposed.  Additional capital measur es were examined, including the ability to \nsatisfy over time the new Basel III capital ratios and changes in capital required by the Dodd-Frank \nlegislation.  Bank holding companie s were required to provide info rmation on their capital adequacy \nprocesses and capital distribution polic ies, and supervisors assessed them. \nConducting the analysis for all of these inst itutions simultaneously gave supervisors a good \nbenchmark as to how the financial institutions were performing relative to a stress scenario.  In addition to providing a method fo r evaluating capital a ssessments, the stress test that was one \ncomponent of the broader CCAR provided an opportuni ty to determine how financial institutions had \nrefined their ability to conduct stre ss tests and incorporated lessons le arned from the SCAP.  In that \nvein, these types of capital assessm ents are likely to be an important  tool in understanding the capital \nplanning process in the future. \n \nConcluding Observations \nIn conclusion I would note that the financial cr isis highlighted that financial institutions did \nnot have the quality or quantity of  capital they needed.  In particul ar, the broader measures of capital \nwere largely ignored during the crisis by many inve stors as they worried about the “core” capital \nimmediately available to absorb losses.  Thus th e emphasis in Basel III on improving the quality and \nquantity of capital is an important re gulatory response to the financial cr isis.  Clearly we need to focus \non the narrow definitions of capital – that which can readily absorb losses. \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Tuesday, May 24, 2011, at 2:00 a.m. U.S. Eastern Ti me and 10:00 a.m. in St. Petersb urg, Russia – or Upon Delive ry * \n \n \n \n 10The United States has also improved its supe rvision framework based on lessons learned \nduring the crisis.  One of the major additions to the supervisory “toolk it” was the use of stress tests –  \nin the SCAP and then as an important co mponent of the broade r CCAR exercise.   \nThe supervisory and regulatory responses ha ve provided strong encouragement for U.S. \nfinancial institutions to improve their capital ratios,  particularly those ratios most appropriate for \nabsorbing losses during stressful ec onomic periods.  Through retenti on of earnings, asset sales, and \nnew equity issuances, U.S. banks have substantiall y improved their capital ratios since the crisis \nperiod. \nThe severe disruptions and economic dislocations  that occurred during the financial crisis – \naffecting not just institutions, but  individuals throughout the nationa l and global economy – highlight \nthe critical need to maintain a well-capitalized and resilient financial se ctor.  Bank regulation and \nbank supervision – not to mention management practices within financial institutions – all need to continue to evolve to ensure th at during periods of economic or financial distress, organizations \nremain well capitalized so their role in credit intermediation is not disrupted.   \nI hope the analysis and observations  I have shared today can assi st with a process of learning, \nevolving, and improving that will prevent future disruptions. \nThank you. \n                                                   \n \n \n1  These remarks were prepared for delivery at a gatherin g focused on “The New Framework to Strengthen Financial \nStability and Regulatory Priorities”, jointly organized by the Fi nancial Stability Institute and the banking supervisors from \nCentral and Eastern Europe, and hosted by the Central Bank of the Russian Federation.    \n2  Beyond concern over immediate losses, investors may also  focus on the possibility of future losses and the capital \nreadily available to offset them.  \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Tuesday, May 24, 2011, at 2:00 a.m. U.S. Eastern Ti me and 10:00 a.m. in St. Petersb urg, Russia – or Upon Delive ry * \n \n \n \n 11                                                                                                                                                                     \n \n3  Given time constraints, my remarks do not delve into the role of stress tests in macroprudential supervision.  In my \nview, stress tests benefit macroprudential supervision in that (a) they embed an explicit link to macroeconomic scenarios and (b) they focus on the ability of the financial system as a whole to provide intermediation services to the real economy \nrather than just on the solvency of individual institutions.  \n \n4  Four measures of capital are referenced in this speech, tota l risk-based capital, Tier 1 risk -based capital, Tier 1 common \ncapital, and tangible common equity:   \n Total risk-based capital  includes core capital elements (Tier 1 capita l) plus supplementary capital elements (Tier 2 \ncapital).   \n Tier 1 risk-based capital  is defined in the Capital Adequacy Guidelines for Bank Holding Companies:  Risk-Based \nMeasures (12 CFR part 225, Appendix A) as the sum of co re capital elements less any amounts of goodwill, other \nintangible assets, interest-only strips recei vables, deferred tax assets, nonfinancial equity investments, and other items that  \nare required to be deducted in accordance with section II.B. of this appendix.  Ti er 1 capital must represent at least 50 \npercent of qualifying total capital.” The sp ecific elements included in Tier 1 capita l and their various limits, restrictions, \nand deductions are discussed in detail in 12 CFR part 225, Appendix A.   \n Tier 2 capital includes supplementary items  such as qualifying subordinated debt and a portion of the allowance for loan \nand lease losses.  See 12 CFR part 225, Appendix A for a full discussion of the items included in Tier 2 capital and the \nassociated limits, restrictions and deductions.   \n Tier 1 common capital  as defined for the Supervisory Capital Assessment Program is the portion of Tier 1 capital that is \ncommon equity, or Tier 1 capital less perpetual preferred stoc k, minority interests and trust preferred securities that \nqualified as Tier 1 capital.   \n Tangible common equity  is defined as total equity capital less perpetua l preferred stock and related surplus (net of \nrelated treasury stock), goodwill an d other intangible assets.   \n Four capital ratios are also calculated.  The denominator for three ratios -- the Ti er 1 risk-based capital ratio, the total \nrisk-based capital ratio and the Tier 1 common capital ratio -- is risk-weighted assets.

Rosengren \nPresident & Chief Executive Officer \nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston \n \nKeynote Remarks at the Stanford Finance Forum \nGraduate School of Business \nStanford University \n \nJune 3, 2011 \n \n \n \nIt is a pleasure to be here with you today.  I would especially  like to thank Darrell Duffie for \ninviting me to Stanford to talk about financial stability.  I am glad to be  here to take part in this very \nconstructive forum. \nOf course, the views I express today are my ow n, not necessarily those of my colleagues on \nthe Federal Reserve’s Board of Governors or th e Federal Open Market Committee (the FOMC). \n The topic of financial stability is receivi ng increased attention in both academic and non-\nacademic settings, as we all try to incorporate less ons from the financial crisis.  The challenge of \nincorporating the lessons of the crisis is made mo re difficult, in part, beca use there is no one clear \ndefinition of financial stab ility (and instability).   \nInterestingly, while the Dodd-Frank Act focuse s on financial stability, the term is never \nactually defined in the legi slation.  Perhaps the absence of a defi nition in the legislation reflects the \n\n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL 12:30 PM Pacific time and 3:30 PM Eastern time, or upon delivery * \n \n \n \n 2reality that the concept is define d quite differently by different pe ople.  I should note that the new \nFinancial Services Oversight Committee (FSOC) created by the Dodd-Frank legislation has been \nexploring defining the term.1   \nThe Dodd-Frank legislation seems primarily focused on addressing the failure of large \nfinancial institutions and payments systems, whic h was certainly a gap that  warrants attention.  \nHowever, a large interconnected fa ilure is only one of several ways that a systemic problem can \nemerge.  I believe the examples I will discuss today highlight the importance of focusing on systemic issues and not just the potential for large bank failures being disruptive.  \nOthers – including some academics, politicians, a nd financial analysts – have argued that the \npursuit of financial stability should address a variety of things such as volatility in financial markets, \nclustered failures of financial institutions, or asset bubbl es (while at the ea rly stages of their \ndevelopment).  So it is important  to clarify the definition.   \nThe reason this is so important is that clar ity of definition will he lp us frame the policy \nresponse – and identify what problems we will seek  to solve and, equally importantly, what problems \nwe will not.  Knowing these parameters is in turn critical to identifying the needed supervisory and \nregulatory tools. \nSo, for the purposes of this talk I will provide  my own definition of financial stability – one \nthat I suspect can be helpful to the policy disc ussion – and then discuss how I would apply this \ndefinition, with some examples. \nFinancial stability\n reflects the ability of the financial system to consistently \nsupply the credit intermediation and payme nt services that are needed in the \nreal economy if it is to co ntinue on its growth path. \n Financial instability\n occurs when problems (or concerns about potential \nproblems) within institutions, markets,  payments systems, or the financial \nsystem in general significantly impai r the supply of credit intermediation \nservices – so as to substantially impa ct the expected path of real economic \nactivity. \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL 12:30 PM Pacific time and 3:30 PM Eastern time, or upon delivery * \n \n \n \n 3 \nTo summarize and perhaps simplify a bit further,  my definition of financial instability has \nthree key elements: problems in the financial system , impairment of intermed iation (or the supply of \nit), and a substantial im pact on the real economy. \nClearly the central theme is financial or cr edit intermediation servic es (and their supporting \nthe real economy).  So allow me to briefly define th e critical role of financial institutions in such \nintermediation – a topic that has be en central to much macroeconomic research over the course of the \nlast 25 years, my own included.2   \n \nFinancial intermediation’s critical role in stability  \n \nFinancial intermediaries like ba nks provide a critical function in the economy in that they \nessentially match borrowers and lenders – taking funds provided by deposito rs or investors, and \nlending those funds to in dividuals and firms that run busine sses and employ people in the real \neconomy, and thus have opportunities fo r higher potential returns.   \nDepositors generally need frequent access to th eir funds, while the individuals and firms who \nborrow often want to use the funds for significant peri ods of time.  So there is a so-called “maturity \ntransformation” at work, from short maturity for depositors to longer maturity for borrowers.  Also, \nwhile depositors want a nearly  risk-free repository for thei r funds, borrowers’ investment \nopportunities almost always entail cred it risk. In this way financial inte rmediaries also perform a “risk \ntransformation” – where firms w ith opportunities for higher potenti al returns obtain funds from \ninvestors and depositors looking for s horter-term, safer investments.  \nThe financial intermediary must have exper tise in identifying creditworthy investment \nopportunities, monitoring the investments, and obtai ning the benefits of di versification. In normal \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL 12:30 PM Pacific time and 3:30 PM Eastern time, or upon delivery * \n \n \n \n 4times, the financial intermediary can provide depositors  or investors access to their funds with little or \nno notice, because the intermediary draws its funds from a diversified set of  depositors (with varied \nfinancial needs) who are unlikely – again, in normal  economic times – to all demand their funds at the \nsame time. \nSo financial intermediation is a vital servic e for a well-functioning economy, allowing the \nfunds from many depositors to be pooled and channe led to riskier and longe r-term investment projects \nthat support real economic activity.   \nThe opposite is also true – disruption of inte rmediation can have significant macroeconomic \nconsequences.  In their widely read book This Time Is Different: Eight Centuries of Financial Folly , \nCarmen Reinhart and Ken Rogoff highlight that  recoveries from crises  in which financial \nintermediation has been badly disr upted can take much longer, and be more uneven, than recoveries \nfrom crises in which intermed iation has not been impacted.   \nImplicit in the definitions I have suggested is th e notion that if individual financial institutions \n– or even groups of institutions – fail, but interm ediation services are not si gnificantly impaired, then \nfinancial stability is not compromised.  This could happen, for example, if intermediation services \nwere highly substitutable so that borrowers could switch to  alternate intermediaries at little cost.   \nAlso important is what is not included in my definition.  For instance, there is no mention of \nasset bubbles.  While asset bubbles likely were invol ved in the recent crisis, we should recognize that \nnot all asset bubbles resu lt in a disruption of financial inte rmediation.  Asset bubbles would only \nimpact financial stability as I’m defining it if key intermediaries us e significant leve rage to purchase \nthe asset that’s experien cing a bubble, and as a result are seri ously compromised if the bubble bursts.3  \nIn such a situation they might face balance sheet  constraints that could significantly impair the \navailability of intermediation services a nd thus the future path of the economy. \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL 12:30 PM Pacific time and 3:30 PM Eastern time, or upon delivery * \n \n \n \n 5 So, not all asset bubbles reflect financial instability, but some do – if they affect institutions \ninvolved in vital financial intermed iation for the real economy.  In th is way the topic of asset bubbles \nhelps to illustrate how the definiti on of financial instability is impor tant as we seek to understand the \nproblems we are trying to mitigate, and the tools th at are most appropriate for doing so.  And another \nway the definition matters is that holding regulato rs and supervisors accountable only makes sense if \nthere is a clear understanding of their responsibilities.     \nThe rest of my remarks today provide some examples of how my definition of financial \nstability (and of instability) coul d be applied – and the implications. \n  \nSome significant events may not yield financial instability  \n \nI would first like to share a few examples that  would not meet my definition for affecting \nfinancial stability or creati ng financial instability.   \nMy first example involves silver prices.  As I’m  sure you know, the recent movement of silver \nprices has been quite dramatic.  Figure 1  shows silver prices and is characterized by two dramatic \nmovements.  The first reflects an attempt to corner the silver market some ye ars ago, when prices rose \nto nearly $45 per troy ounce before the popping of the bubble – followed by a nearly 75 percent \ndecline.  The second dramatic m ove is the rapid increase in silv er prices from $17.65 per troy ounce \nin July of last year to $44.90 in late April of this year.  Figure 2  focuses in on just this recent phase.  \nSince hitting that peak, silver pric es fell by just over 25 percent to  $33.42 on May 17.  As of last week \nsilver was trading up slightly, at $36.14 an ounce. \nWhile this dramatic movement in silver’s price highlights the risk and volatility to investing in \ncommodities, it does not meet my definition of financia l instability.  Price volatility is very different \nthan financial instability.  Silver is a relatively small market, and leveraged financial intermediaries do \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL 12:30 PM Pacific time and 3:30 PM Eastern time, or upon delivery * \n \n \n \n 6not have an especially significant ex posure to silver.  So despite the dramatic price decline, there has \nbeen no trace of impairment in fina ncial intermediation.  So I would not  view this as an instance of \nfinancial instability, as I define  it, and would see no need to a lter policy to respond to the price \nmovements. \nMy second example involves the large numbers of  failures of savings and loan institutions \nfrom the early 1980s to the early 1990s, as shown in Figure 3 .  A combination of poor supervision \nand poor management led savings and loans to be caught  first in an adverse in terest rate environment \n– they were borrowing short and lend ing long at a time of rapidly rising interest rates.  As a result \ntheir capital became depleted, and many savings and loans increased their risk by taking on \ncommercial real estate activities – resulting in widesp read failures, and in some cases, quite dramatic \nlosses.  These losses were a significant problem for the depos it insurance fund.   \nBut while this was a costly situation, did it constitute financial instability? \nUsing my definition, it did not.  Savings and loan  institutions were not the sole providers of \ncredit to housing market participants.  Many comm ercial banks were willing and able to lend to \npotential home buyers.  In additi on, securitization of  mortgages had made it easier for borrowers to \nget financing regardless of the intermediary  initiating the loan.  I would point to Figure 4 , which \nshows the spread between 10 year Treasury securities and 30 year mo rtgages with savings and loans \nfailures in the background.  There is  no sharp break in credit pricing dur ing that period, nor were there \nwidespread complaints at the tim e of inability to obtain home mo rtgages.  So, despite the large \nnumber of financial institutions that failed, there was not a severe disruption in the intermediation of \nmortgage credit, at least in the aggregate.   \nMy third example involves the dr amatic increase in “dot com” stock prices during the late \n1990s, as shown in Figure 5 .  Stock prices rose ra pidly for companies associated with the emerging \ncommercialization of the internet.  As you know, ma ny of the companies had no clearly established \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL 12:30 PM Pacific time and 3:30 PM Eastern time, or upon delivery * \n \n \n \n 7revenue stream, leading many analysts to become concerned about a bubble.  And in fact, the stock \nprices of many of those companies did fall dramatically. \nWhile the rapid decline of dot-com stock pri ces did result in a drop in wealth for those \ninvested in the stocks, it did not  have a significant impact on fi nancial intermediation services – \nbecause generally speaking, banks and other key sour ces of intermediation were not directly exposed \nto dot-com stocks in a significant way.  A shock to wealth can have a macroeconomic impact, but that \ncan be addressed with traditional monetary policy.   While there was a macroeconomic impact from \nthe decline in the stock prices, the episode would not meet my de finition of financial instability \nbecause it did not impair intermedia tion – in other words, it did not a ffect the ability of the financial \nsystem to provide credit. \n \nExamples of financial inst ability (and possible causes)  \n \nI have been arguing here that th ere are examples of serious fina ncial problems and dislocations \nthat I would not consider examples of financial instability, as I define it.  But th ere are, unfortunately, \nexamples of financial instability that occurred recently, during th e financial crisis and recession.   \nAs I mentioned in my introduction, the Dodd-Fr ank legislation seems primarily focused on \naddressing the failure of large financial institution s and payments systems – which certainly warrants \nattention.  But a large interconnected  failure is only one of several wa ys that a systemic problem can \nemerge.  The first example I would offer involve s the experience of money market mutual funds \n(MMMFs) during the financial crisis, and it demonstrat es that even a small financial intermediary can \ncreate financial instability.   \nAs of August 2008 MMMFs had $3.5 trillion of a ssets, and funds had been flowing into \nMMMFs, as a result of problems at a vari ety of banks and other factors.  But Figure 6 shows the daily \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL 12:30 PM Pacific time and 3:30 PM Eastern time, or upon delivery * \n \n \n \n 8change in money market fund assets in prime fu nds in the latter portion of 2008, and notes some of \nthe key events of that era.   \nIn the wake of the failure of Lehman Brot hers, a relatively small MMMF called the Reserve \nPrimary Fund experienced very substantial outflows due  to investor concerns about its credit exposure \nto Lehman.  While money market funds are highly  regulated by the SEC and are supposed to hold \nhigh-quality liquid assets, investors were concerned th at losses from Lehman would cause the Reserve \nFund to “break the buck” (t hat is, redeem shares for less than one dollar).   \nThe problems at the Reserve Fund not only caused funds to flow out of that fund, but also \ntriggered large withdrawals from other money market  mutual funds as well, as shown in the figure .  \nOver the course of the week, over $300 billion was withdrawn from  prime MMMFs, forcing the funds \nto try to quickly sell assets to  meet redemption requests.   \nNote that there are three major types of money market funds, as shown in Figure 7  – funds \nthat invest in tax-exempt securi ties, funds that invest in gover nment securities, and prime money \nmarket funds that purchase a wide variety of debt instruments.  It  was the prime money market funds \nthat posed the most severe problem during the crisis – and which still pose a problem today (as I will discuss in a moment).  While some of the assets in the prime funds, su ch as Treasury securities, could \nbe readily sold, others such as asset-backed commercial paper (ABCP ) were not easily sold given the \nprevailing harsh market conditions.   \nThe rapid withdrawal of funds fr om prime money market funds not  only represented a crisis of \nconfidence, but also began se riously disrupting credit market s where MMMFs were the major \nbuyers.\n4  Interest spreads on asset-backed commer cial paper, shown in the top panel of Figure 8 , rose \ndramatically.  The bottom panel shows that asset-b acked commercial paper coul d only be issued in \nvery short maturities.  The percen t of issued paper maturing in one  to four days leapt from roughly \nhalf to over 90 percent. \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL 12:30 PM Pacific time and 3:30 PM Eastern time, or upon delivery * \n \n \n \n 9In response to these short-term credit disrupt ions, the U.S. Treasury announced a plan to \ninsure MMMF shares,5 and the Federal Reserve System announ ced an asset-backed commercial paper \nMMMF liquidity facility.  The facility, operated for the System by the Boston Fed, allowed money \nmarket funds to sell asset-backed commercial paper to banks – the MMMFs could use the sale \nproceeds to meet redemption requests – and the a sset-backed commercial paper was pledged by the \nbanks to the Fed as part of a loan from the Fed, which was ultimately paid back with interest.  In \naddition, over time other facilities were created to address disruptions  in short-term credit markets. \nThe money market problems that disrupted short-te rm credit markets highlighted that financial \ninstability could be created by ev en a small money market fund if its problems created doubts about \nother funds’ ability to redeem invest ors’ funds at stable net asset valu e.  In a situati on like this, we \nshould note, the weakest link in the financial stability chain might be small , rather than large, \nfinancial intermediaries.  This problem with promis ing stable asset values despite some credit risk \nwas what in this example impaired financial inte rmediaries (the MMMFs), seriously disrupted short-\nterm credit markets, and had a large impact on th e ability of firms to acquire short-term debt \nfinancing.   \nThe Securities and Exchange Commission ha s tightened requirements on money market \nfunds.6  While this represents an important step forw ard, I will digress for a moment on this issue as it \nrelates to our topic today, financ ial stability.  Despite the regulato ry changes that have occurred, \nMMMFs still remain vulnerable to an unexpected cred it shock that could cause investors to doubt the \nability to redeem at a stable net asset value.  I am certainly not predicti ng such an outcome, but I \nbelieve we all do well to recognize and address this vulnerability.   \nI do think it would be particularly prudent to ad dress this issue now, as  money market mutual \nfunds have the potential to be impacted should th ere be unexpected interna tional financial problems \nemanating from Europe.  Consider that many (but  not all) MMMF’s have sizeable exposures to \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL 12:30 PM Pacific time and 3:30 PM Eastern time, or upon delivery * \n \n \n \n 10European banks, by virtue of hol ding the banks’ short-term debt.  This means some MMMFs are \npotentially sensitive to a disrupt ion in the European banking system , should one arise from the fiscal \nand sovereign-debt problems we are s eeing in some European countries.   \nConversely, I would note that European banks are reliant on the MMMFs – which are a major \nsource of their dollar-f unding needs.  This latter poi nt is worth noting as we carefully and responsibly \nexamine this set of issues – because it means, for instance, that a regulatory change that reduced the \ndebt holdings of European banks by prime money ma rket funds could (as an unintended consequence) \nnecessitate corresponding ch anges in European dolla r-funding strategies.   \nWhile there have been various proposals to addr ess this issue – for instance allowing the asset \nvalues of the funds to float, or requiring capital be  set aside in the event of  a credit shock, or requiring \na source of strength from a parent company or an in surance contract – no one so lution has been settled \non that would cure the type of problem that occurred with the Reserve Primary Fund in the last \nfinancial crisis.   \nSo in my view, any solution needs to address th e potential impact of unexpected credit losses, \nthe risk that investors might ra pidly withdraw their funds to a void any loss, and the operational \nconvenience that MMMFs provide as  a transactions account vehicle.7  Despite these challenges, the \nset of issues surrounding MMMFs is in  sum a vulnerability that needs to be addressed.  Forums like \nthis one serve an important role in allowing us to  underline issues like this that need focused and \nconstructive attention.   \n \nFinancial instability may occur without the failure  of a financial intermediary  \n \nReturning to my examples I would say that a nother vulnerability is the risk that common, \nwidely-held exposures could cause intermediation se rvices to be cut simulta neously, even without a \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL 12:30 PM Pacific time and 3:30 PM Eastern time, or upon delivery * \n \n \n \n 11failure of any large intermediary.  For example,  if banks experience a common shock to collateral \nvalues or experience similar credit losses, banks th at are capital-constrained may shrink their lending \nin an effort to satisfy binding capital-to-assets ratios. (As a reminder, loans are assets on a bank’s \nbalance sheet).   \nThis type of problem is illust rated by the difference in the lending behavior during the recent \ncrisis and downturn of banks w ith strong supervisory ratings, and those with weak supervisory \nratings.   Figure 9  shows that commercial and savings banks  with weak supervisory ratings shrank \nlending during the first year  of the recession.  Banks experiencing large losses are of ten reluctant to \nraise additional capital – either because it could si gnal financial problems or be perceived as an \nattempt to avoid diluting existing shareholders.  Instead, firms that  choose not to raise additional \ncapital often satisfy capital-to-assets requirements by shrinking their assets, and more importantly for \nthe real economy, reducing th eir willingness to lend.   \nIf this behavior is widesprea d, it can significantly reduce credit  intermediation.  Earlier in my \ncareer I studied this dyna mic with my colleague Joe Peek, an d our research found such behavior \nduring the credit crunch period in the United States during the 1990 recession8 and during the \nJapanese banking crisis.9  This dynamic forms one explanation for why recessions that are \naccompanied by problems at financial intermediaries tend to be deeper recessions, followed by slower \nrecoveries (again, the point that  Reinehart and Rogoff discuss).  \nIndeed, a look at the last thr ee recessions suggests significant  tightening of credit and slow \nrecoveries.  While I mentioned earlier that the mort gages issued by savings and loan institutions were \neasily substitutable, the same cannot  be said of commercial lending.  Figure 10  shows the declines in \ncommercial loans in relation to the last three r ecessions.  The headwinds in monetary policy that \nbecame a concern in the 1990s primarily reflecte d reduced business lending, as commercial banks \nbecame capital constrained as a result of large commercial real estate losses.

Higher capital requirement s (higher ratios of \ncapital to assets) can reduce the pr obability of an instit ution’s failure – but a lower risk of banks’ \ninsolvency does not necessari ly prevent a credit crunch.   \nA potential solution, being advocated in Basel III proposals, could be requiring banks to hold a \nbuffer above the minimum capital requirements, wh ich can be drawn down during times of credit \ncrunches – but with the expectati on that the capital would not be re built by shrinking the institution’s \nloan portfolio.  However, for credit crunches to be a voided this source of capit al needs to be set apart \nas something of a “shock absorber,” and not be view ed as just a higher capital ratio that incents \nreduced financial intermediation when the buffer is breached. \n \nFinancial instability when a large,  interconnected intermediary fails  \n \nMy third example of instability involves the fa ilure of Lehman Brothers, which in my view \nhighlighted the importance of understanding th e interconnection of financial firms.  \nInterconnectedness occurs in  a variety of ways:   \n• The most direct way involves those who have  an immediate credit exposure to the firm.  \nAs an example, the failure of a large financia l firm could create a credit loss that could \ngenerate runs on money market funds br oadly – a linkage that was probably not \nsufficiently appreciated prior to the financial crisis.    \n• A second form of interconnectedness involves the opaqueness of financial firms, which \nmakes it difficult to determine counterparty e xposure or whether simila r exposures exist at \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL 12:30 PM Pacific time and 3:30 PM Eastern time, or upon delivery * \n \n \n \n 13other financial firms.  During the crisis, inve stors started retreating from financial firms \ngenerally , as shown in the substantial wi dening of the LIBOR/OIS spread (Figure 12)  as \nbanks became suspicious of counterparty e xposure to even some of the largest global \nfinancial intermediaries.    \n• A third manifestation of interconnectedness i nvolves the criticality of firms that are \nsignificant market makers, because when they  experience troubles br oader intermediation \nservices can be impacted.    \n• A fourth form of interco nnectedness involves the increa sing global nature of large \nfinancial intermediaries, which greatly compli cates resolutions of such firms should they \nfail.  The incentive for host countries to “r ing fence” liquidity and capital, and the legal \nuncertainty surrounding global failures, together  provide incentives that might not be \ncompatible with orderly resolutions. \n \nWhile the role of interconnectedness is much bette r appreciated now than pr ior to the crisis, it \nis still very difficult to get good “measures” of it.  Academics and regulators need to spend more time \nunderstanding what data might be  useful, and how it can be read ily ascertained and updated.   \nAssuming interconnectedness can be measured, it is important to understand how that \ninformation will be used.  For example, should highly interconnected firms have higher capital requirements, to reduce the probability that they become insolvent?  Should banks be required to \ndisclose measures of interconnectedness to bank supe rvisors – or in public stat ements?  And what role \ncan stress tests play in unders tanding how a failure of a larg e firm impacts other firms? \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL 12:30 PM Pacific time and 3:30 PM Eastern time, or upon delivery * \n \n \n \n 14Concluding observations  \n \nIn conclusion I would just emphasize that financ ial stability was not clearly identified as the \nresponsibility of any particular re gulatory authority prio r to the financial crisis.  Under the Dodd-\nFrank legislation a group of regulat ors, the Financial Stability Oversi ght Council, is now tasked with \nproviding financial stability oversight.  However, as I noted at the outset, financial stability was never \ndefined in the legislation.  This  leaves some ambiguity on how broa dly or narrowly financial stability \nshould be defined.  \nIn this talk I have tried to provide a relatively simple defi nition of financia l stability and \ninstability, and have provided some examples of  how the definition could be used in various \ncircumstances.  The examples of potential financia l instability emanating fr om money market mutual \nfunds and commercial banks highlight, in my view, that  much work remains to be done if we want to \nsignificantly reduce the likelihood of impairment of critical financia l intermediation services – the \nsort of impairment that could subs tantially impact ec onomic activity.   \nI know we all want to work to make progress in  this area, and I hope my remarks today help \nadvance the cause.   \nThank you. \n                                                 \n \n \n1 Through an Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, FSOC asked the public whether it should define the term \n“financial stability” as well as “material financial distress. ''  In a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking the FSOC indicated that \nthere was a broad consensus from th e comments received that the FSOC should  define those two terms.  The FSOC is in \nthe process related to regulation writing on the \"Authority to Require Supervision and Regulation of Certain Nonbank \nFinancial Companies\" pursuant to Section 113 of DFA. (The Notice of Proposed Rulemaking actually explains that their \nproposed rule \"describes the criteria that will inform, and th e processes and procedures esta blished under the DFA for, the \nCouncil's designation of nonbank financial companies under the DFA.\") \n \n2 See for example “The Impact of Financial Institutions and Financial Markets on the Real Economy: Implications of a \n'Liquidity Lock'” – my talk at the University of Wisconsin – Madison in October 2008 (available at \nhttp://www.bostonfed.org/news/sp eeches/rosengren/2008/100908.htm ). \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL 12:30 PM Pacific time and 3:30 PM Eastern time, or upon delivery * \n \n \n \n 15                                                                                                                                                                     \n \n3 Financial institutions can use leverage to purchase assets (e .g. residential mortgage backed securities)  or can provide \nleverage to borrowers wishing to purchase  the asset.  Either way a bubble bursting impacts the financial intermediary’s \nbalance sheet. \n \n4 Since a major theme in my talk is that financial stability is not compromised if intermediation services are sustainable \nthrough alternative intermediaries, I would note that here th ere are no similar substitutes. Even product substitutes (like \nunregistered funds) have investors that behave in the same fashion. \n \n5 The U.S. Treasury Department on September 19, 2008 announced “the establishment of a temporary guaranty program \nfor the U.S. money market mutual fund industry. For the ne xt year, the U.S. Treasury will insure the holdings of any \npublicly offered eligible money market mutual fund – both re tail and institutional – that pays a fee to participate in the \nprogram.” Information on the program can be found in announ cements posted by the Treasury in late September and early \nNovember, archived at http://www.treas.gov/press/releases/archives/200809.html  \n \n6 As Chairman Bernanke said on May 5, “the stability of m oney market mutual funds – which suffered dramatic runs that \nworsened funding conditions at the height of the crisis – is cl early a systemic issue, not just an industry issue. The SEC, \nwhich has already issued rules to increase the stability of money market mutual funds, is appropriately taking the lead in \ninvestigating whether further steps are necessary. Under the aegis of the council, however, the SEC has consulted with \nother agencies, including the Federal Reserve, which have provided their own analyses and perspectives. In particular, interagency consultation has helped clarify the potential systemic implications of instability in the money market mutual \nfund industry. The Federal Reserve will be among the agenci es participating in a roundtable on money fund regulation \nsponsored by the SEC later this month.”  \n7 That is, in eliminating the need for extensive tracking of capital gains and losses. \n \n8 For a description of credit crunch problems in the early 1990s see Peek and Rosengren, “The Capital Crunch: Neither a \nBorrower nor a Lender Be,\" Journal of Money, Credit and Banking, vol. 27, no. 3 (August 1995): 625-638. \nAlso see the article I wrote with Joe Peek, “Bank Regula tion and the Credit Crunch,” in the Journal of Banking \n& Finance, Volume 19, Issues 3-4, June 1995, pages 679-692. \n \n9 See for example the following articles I wrote with Joe Peek : \"The International Transmission of Financial Shocks: The \nCase of Japan\" in the American Economic Review  vol. 87, no. 4 (September 1997), pages 495-505; \"Collateral Damage: \nEffects of the Japanese Bank Crisis on Real Activity in the United States\" in the American Economic Review , vol. 90, no. \n1 (March 2000), pages 30-45; and \"Unnatural Selection: Perver se Incentives and the Misallocation of Credit in Japan\" in \nthe American Economic Review , vol. 95(4), September 2005, pages 1144-1166. \n\nDefining Financial Stability, \nand Some Policy Implications \nof Applying the Definition\nEric S.

Rosengren \nPresident & Chief Executive Officer \nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston \n \nClark University \nWorcester, Massachusetts \n \nJuly 13, 2011 \n \n \n \n It is a pleasure to be with you today in Worcester as we discuss the opportunities and \nchallenges facing New England’s smaller industrial cities.\n1  At the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, \nwe are very pleased to be collaborating with  our co-sponsors in organizing this forum – \nthe Mosakowski Institute for Public Enterprise, MassINC, and the Rappapor t Institute for Greater \nBoston. \nI would like to briefly frame the economic context that prevails as  we gather today.  I think the \neconomic backdrop only underscores the importance of  a practical and constructive forum like this \none, and the need for collaboration and leadership – wh ich are themes of particular focus at this event. \n\n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL 9:10 AM Eastern time on Wednesday, July 13, 2011, or upon delivery * \n \n \n \n 2I should note, of course, that the views I expr ess today are my own, and not necessarily those \nof my colleagues on the Federal Reserve’s Boar d of Governors or the Federal Open Market \nCommittee (the FOMC). \nThe deep recession and slow recovery have had a significant impact on New England’s cities.  \nAt the same time, we should note that our experien ce of late in New England has been less severe \nthan that of the nation.  The unemployment rate fo r New England in May, the latest month we have a \nregional number for, was 7.9 percent – high, but we ll below the 9.1 percent ra te for the nation as a \nwhole in May (a number that climbed to 9.2 percent in  June).  Many of our citi es, particularly in the \nnorthern half of New England, ha ve unemployment rates well belo w the national average.  Also, \nmany cities in New England did not experience the extremes of boom and bust in residential real estate that plagued some cities  elsewhere in the country.   \n As the economy continues its slow recover y, there are significant opportunities but also \ndaunting challenges facing our cities.  But before discussing those opportunities and challenges, I \nwould like to briefly describe  the national economic outlook. \n  \nThe National Economic Outlook  \n As we consider the national outlook, I would note th at some have referred to the first half of \nthis year as a “slow patch” in th e recovery.  I am not sure that phrase is quite right, however – the \nnotion of a slow patch suggests strong growth that has been temporarily inte rrupted by some sort of \nheadwind or shock, like natural disa sters or extreme weather that cr imps economic activity.  I would \ninstead describe the past two years as a consis tently weak recovery, in terrupted by a period of \nstronger growth.  Let me add that a weak recovery  like we have seen is, unfortunately, typical of \nrecoveries after a financial crisis.\n2   \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL 9:10 AM Eastern time on Wednesday, July 13, 2011, or upon delivery * \n \n \n \n 3Figure 1  shows growth in what we call real fi nal sales, which represents the goods and \nservices produced in the economy, not including inve ntories.  If one assumes that the economy needs \nto grow faster than 2.5 percent – an estimate of what economists call its po tential – to yield much \nimprovement in the unemployment rate, you see that  we have had only one strong quarter in this \nrecovery (the fourth quarter of 2010).      Also, Figure 2  shows that consumers have been partic ularly tentative du ring the recovery.  \nThe only quarter in which we saw consumption grow th in excess of 2.5 percen t during this recovery \nwas that same fourth quarter of 2010.   \nIn short, the only quarter of st rong economic growth so far in this recovery has been the one \ncontaining the holiday season at th e end of last year.  With housi ng activity and government spending \nlikely to continue to be unusually weak for a recovery, we need to see consumer and business \nconfidence improve so that consumption and invest ment can offset the weaker growth in other \ncomponents of gross domestic product (GDP).   \nThe first half of this year saw the economic r ecovery impacted by the tragic destruction in \nJapan, which disrupted manufacturi ng supply chains, as well as weathe r issues ranging from severe \nwinter conditions to damaging floods.  The result is that growth in the fi rst half of this year is likely to \nbe roughly 2 percent.   \nAs the effects of these problems fade, we do expect a rebound in purchases of consumer \ndurables to yield stronger growth in the third quarter.  I expect economic growth over the second half \nof this year to average somewher e in the range of 3.0 to 3.5 percen t.  While this represents an \nimprovement from the first half, it is still quite slow given the amount of slack in the economy, and \nslower than I had expected at  the beginning of this year. \nWhile we are seeing some positive economic signs such as equipment and software spending, \nand growth in exports, the employment report is sued last Friday was dismal.  The national \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL 9:10 AM Eastern time on Wednesday, July 13, 2011, or upon delivery * \n \n \n \n 4unemployment rate rose sli ghtly (a tenth of a percent) to 9.2 per cent in June.  And net job growth was \nvery weak over the last two months – job grow th averaged only 21,500 over the two-month period of \nMay and June.3  The employment-to-population ratio fell to 58.2 percent, matching the 28 year low \nthat we have hit a few times in this recovery.4   \nNot surprisingly, with so much painful slack in the labor market we are not seeing any \nsignificant wage pressure – average hourly earnings fell slig htly this month and have increased only \n1.9 percent over the past year – whic h is consistent with a continued low inflation rate in the medium \nterm.  As Figures 3 highlights, wages are not likely to place mu ch upward pressure on inflation since \ncompensation is growing only slowly, give n weak job markets.  In addition, Figure 4  shows that \nmany commodity prices have stabiliz ed or retreated from their rece nt highs.  These factors give \nmonetary policy the leeway to remain accommodative,  so as to provide the monetary conditions for \nimproved economic growth. \nIn addition, there are significant downside risks a ssociated with an outlook that includes only \nvery slow improvement in the economy.  The headlin es from Europe continue to remind us of this. \nWith fiscal austerity slowing down economies both here  and abroad, it will in my view be important \nto maintain sufficiently accommodative U.S. monetary  policy so that national labor market conditions \ncan improve.   \n \nOpportunities and Challenges for New England’s Mid-Sized Cities \n \nSo the national outlook is for a continued slow  recovery, which of c ourse factors into the \nopportunities and challenges for New E ngland’s mid-sized cities we ha ve come together to discuss \ntoday.   \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL 9:10 AM Eastern time on Wednesday, July 13, 2011, or upon delivery * \n \n \n \n 5Also, with widespread pressure  for fiscal austerity not only impacting Federal budgets but also \nbudgets at the state and local leve l, I think we should acknowledge the acute challenges that cities \nface in prioritizing expenditures to ensure that program cuts do not impair the ability of their \ncommunities to prosper over the long term.    \nAs we think about their opportuni ties and challenges, I th ink it is useful to highlight some of \nthe trends in New England’s mid-si zed cities relative to New England as a whole, and the nation.  For \nexample, Figure 5  highlights the differences in the populations  of our mid-sized ci ties and the rest of \nthe region and the country with respect to age, at roughly decade intervals.  The most recent data \nsuggest that New England as a whole now has a greater portion of people over 65 and a smaller \nportion of people under 15, and age 15 to 24, than the U. S.  However, the residents of the region’s \nsmall and mid-sized cities are on av erage younger than the rest of New England – with a smaller share \nof people over 65 and a larger share of people 15 to 24 than both the region and the nation.  As for the \nportion of people under 15, these cities exceed the regi on and are basically on par with the nation.   \nIn exploring these trends and ch aracteristics, I would like to o ffer a few possibilities – in the \ninterest of generating discussion today.   \nFirst, it may be that younger workers “just startin g out” are especially r eceptive to training for \njobs in a growing sector.  So this  younger profile of our mid-sized cities, and the fact that they are \noften the site of medical facili ties serving the surrounding communities,  together highlight a potential \nopportunity.  Many of the mid-sized cities may be ab le to build on their medi cal-services base.  While \nmedical employers require highly sk illed doctors and nurses, they also hire a variety of other \nemployees in positions that often require only an associate’s or bachelor’s degree.  Indeed, our \nanalysis suggests that the number of  jobs in the healthcare industry as a percent of total jobs is much \nhigher for these mid-sized New Engla nd cities than it is for the regi on as a whole, or for the nation.5 \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL 9:10 AM Eastern time on Wednesday, July 13, 2011, or upon delivery * \n \n \n \n 6Worcester is a particularly good example of this, being home to hospitals, the University of \nMassachusetts medical school, and medical research firms.  Other cities in the region have major \nmedical facilities with spillover benefits to the broader community, including Providence (with \nBrown medical school and partner ho spitals), New Haven (with Yale school of medicine and Yale-\nNew Haven Hospital), greater Hartfo rd (with the University of Conn ecticut Health Center in the \nHartford suburb of Farmington), and Spri ngfield (with Baystate  Medical Center). \nTurning to educational  characteristics in these cities, Figure 6  shows the percent of the \npopulation with a bachelor’s degree  or higher, and with some colle ge education or an associate’s \ndegree – again at roughly decade intervals.  New E ngland has a much higher percentage of college \ngraduates than the nation as a whole, but a smaller percentage of people with  some college education \nor an associate’s degree.  In c ontrast, the mid-sized cities have  a smaller percentage than New \nEngland or the U.S of people with a bachelor’s de gree or higher, or some college education or an \nassociate’s degree. The trend is up in  these cities, however, over time.   \nThis is particularly significant when we not e that the unemployment experience over the past \ndecade has been quite different when segmen ted by educational attainment, as shown in Figure 7 .   \nThis is particularly true over the past several years, when the unemploym ent rates by educational \nattainment have widened significantly fr om where they were 10 years ago.  \nAll this may suggest that commun ity colleges can and should play a larger role in many of our \nmid-sized cities.  Community colleges in New Engl and have played less of a role in workforce \ndevelopment than in some parts of the country, where there is a very close connection between \nemployers (and potential employers) and the curricul a developed and offered at community colleges.  \nAs we think about future developments in our mi d-sized cities, it is impor tant that leaders at \ncommunity colleges and local business leaders wo rk together in the ongoing development of \nspecialized curricula that will meet th e evolving needs of local employers.   \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL 9:10 AM Eastern time on Wednesday, July 13, 2011, or upon delivery * \n \n \n \n 7Figure 8  shows that mid-sized cities in  New England are increasingly diverse .  Mid-sized \nNew England cities have a much higher proportion of  individuals who were born outside of the U.S. \nthan the rest of New England or the country, and this has intensifie d over recent decades.  These cities \nalso have a much higher percentage  of individuals who are not prof icient English speakers.  This \nhighlights a potential impediment to gett ing higher education or some jobs.   \nThe availability of English classes remains extremely important, and increasingly so.  The \nsame is true for providing greater  access to government programs for those with limited English.  For \nexample, a working paper by the Bank’s Ana Patricia Muñoz shows that small business \nentrepreneurship programs often do not target Latino populations.6  State and Federal programs \ndesigned to help fund or provide technical assistance to small busin esses may need to increasingly \ntailor some of their programs to  fit the needs of local populations. \nHowever, despite these challenges I believe that the diversity in our mid-sized cities can also \nbe a decided advantage.  Let me show another chart, Figure 9 , which instead of foreign born and \nlimited English speakers simply indicates the porti on of the population that is Hispanic, and the \nportion that is African American.  You see again that while New E ngland as a whole may be less \ndiverse than the rest of the nati on, our mid-sized cities are more di verse -- and increasingly so over \nthe decades.  Finding ways for businesses to reach  diverse populations is likely to become \nincreasingly important as the c ountry as a whole becomes more di verse, and as technology allows \neven small companies to reach markets in other c ountries.  A product or service developed by or for a \ndiverse population in Worcester or Hartford or another mid-sized ci ty may be a first step toward \naccessing diverse markets in the U.S., or even globally. \nMoreover, developing successful en trepreneurs within a diverse population could of course be \na source of local economic development.  The M uñoz paper finds Latino businesses starting up in \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL 9:10 AM Eastern time on Wednesday, July 13, 2011, or upon delivery * \n \n \n \n 8many of New England’s mid-sized cities, and this can  be a source of future job growth if some of \nthese businesses can grow.   \nFinally and importantly, I would observe that while New England has fared better than the rest \nof the country during the recession and the early stages  of the recovery, the same is not true for our \nmid-sized cities, as shown in Figure 10.   Unemployment rates are much  higher in the mid-sized cities \nthan they are in New England or the country as a whole, in contrast to 10 years ago when the \nunemployment rates in the regi on’s mid-sized cities were be low the national average.   \n \nConcluding Observations  \n \nIn summary and conclusion, our mid-sized ci ties are on average younger, proportionally less \nadvanced in education, and more diverse than the rest of New Engla nd.  This provides both \nopportunities and challenges,  as I have noted.   \nAs many of these cities are regi onal centers, further developing their activities as medical and \neducational centers will be impor tant, particularly given their younger population compared to New \nEngland as a whole.   \nA theme for this conference is the need to build collaborative leadership.  Leaders in \ngovernment will need to work collaboratively with leaders in education, the sciences, and businesses \nmore generally, and find ways to take advantage of some of the differences we see in our mid-sized \ncities.   \nI think we all know this, and the challenge is in  finding the best ways to do so, to everyone’s \nbenefit.  It is our hope that this forum will be one avenue for supporting and advancing that \ncollaboration. \nThank you. \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL 9:10 AM Eastern time on Wednesday, July 13, 2011, or upon delivery * \n \n \n \n 9                                                 \n \nNOTES : \n \n1  We define mid-sized cities in New England as those with a population ranging from 75,000 to 250,000, excluding \n“suburb cities” within 20 miles of Boston – specifically, Bridgeport, CT; Danbury, CT; Hartford, CT; New Haven, CT; \nNorwalk, CT; Stamford, CT; Waterbury, CT; Brockton, MA ; Fall River, MA; Lawrence, MA; Lowell, MA; Lynn, MA; \nNew Bedford, MA; Springfield, MA; Worc ester, MA; Manchester, NH; Nashua, NH;  Cranston, RI; Providence, RI; and \nWarwick, RI. \n \n2  As I have discussed in other forums, the following dynamic forms one explanation for why recessions that are \naccompanied by problems at financial intermediaries tend to be deeper recessions, followed by slower recoveries. Banks \nexperiencing large losses are often reluctant to raise additio nal capital – either because it could signal financial problems \nor be perceived as an attempt to avoid diluting existing shar eholders.  Instead, firms that choose not to raise additional \ncapital often satisfy capita l-to-assets requirements by shrinking their assets , and more importantly for the real economy, \nreducing their willingness to lend  (loans are assets on a bank’s balance sheet).  If this behavior is widespread, it can \nsignificantly reduce credit intermediation.  Earlier in my car eer I studied this dynamic with my colleague Joe Peek, and \nour research found such behavior during the credit crunch period in the United States during the 1990 recession and during \nthe Japanese banking crisis.   \n See the following from Peek and Rose ngren: “The Capital Crunch: Neither a Borrower nor a Lender Be,\" Journal of \nMoney, Credit and Banking, vol. 27, no. 3 (August 1995): 625-638.  “Bank Regulation and the Credit Crunch,” in the Journal of Banking & Finance, Volume 19, Issues 3-4, June 1995, pages 679-692.  \"The International Transmission of \nFinancial Shocks: The Case of Japan\" in the American Economic Review vol. 87, no. 4 (September 1997), pages 495-505.  \n\"Collateral Damage: Effects of the Japanese Bank Crisis on Real Activity in the United States\" in the American Economic \nReview, vol. 90, no. 1 (March 2000), pages 30-45.  \"Unnat ural Selection: Perverse Incen tives and the Misallocation of \nCredit in Japan\" in the American Economic Review, vol. 95(4), September 2005, pages 1144-1166. \n \n3  About 18,000 jobs were added in June and the May figure was revised to 25,000.  The percent change over the two \nmonths is 0.03%.  Employment rose by an average of 215,000 jobs per month from February through April but now has \naveraged 21,500 jobs over the past two months.  \n4  The employment-to-population ratio hit 58.2 percent in Dec. 2009, Nov. 2010, and June 2011.  It was 58.1 percent in \nJuly of 1983.  \n5  Using data from the Economic Census, the figure for health care employment in mid-sized cities is almost 30 percent \n– twice as large a proportion as for the U.S. or New England – but it should be noted that the figures are calculated as a percent of total jobs that are available in the Economic Ce nsus, which excludes several job-heavy sectors (like elementary \nand secondary schools, colleges and universities, public administration  and employees in most government owned \nestablishments like public utilities). Using di fferent data sources that include many of  these sectors suggests health care is \nover 22 percent of jobs in mid-sized Massachusetts cities, just under 15 percent in New England, and around 12 percent  in \nthe U.S. Either approach suggests that health care is a very important sector for jobs, in absolute terms and compared to \nthe U.S. and rest of New England.      \n \n6  Ana Patricia Muñoz, \"Small Businesses in Springfield, Massachusetts: A Look at Latino Entrepreneurship\", a Federal \nReserve Bank of Boston Community Development Discussion paper with Lynn Browne, Sol Carbonell, Prabal \nChakrabarti, DeAnna Green, Yolanda K.

Rosengren  \nPresident &  Chief Executive Officer  \nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston  \n \nRemarks at the Economic Outlook Seminar  \nStockholm, Sweden  \n \n \nSeptember 28, 2011  \n \n \n \nIt is a great pleasure to be in Sweden to participate in today’s session on the current economic \noutlook and tomorrow’s conference on capital markets in the post -crisis environment.  It is vital that \npolicymakers and practitioners study and apply the recen t lessons of the global economy and financial \ninterdependence, so I am glad to be able to join you in these discussions.   \nI should note, of course, that the views I express today are my own, and not necessarily those \nof my colleagues on the Federal Reserv e’s Board of Governors or the Federal Open Market \nCommittee (the FOMC).  \nOn a personal note, I should mention that my grandfather John Johanson left Sweden at the \nage of six, changing his name to Rosengren and joining his father – who was deploying what he had \nlearned as a gardener in Sweden to open greenhouses in America.  My relatives were able to take \nwhat they had learned in Sweden and apply it – with perhaps some variation – in the United States.  In \n\n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Weds ., Sept . 28, 2011, at 2:40 AM U. S. Eastern Time & 8:40 AM in Stockholm, Sweden;  or upon delivery  * \n \n \n \n 2 a similar way, there is much to consider about the ec onomic experience in Europe and the U.S. over \nthe past four years.  What is similar?  What is different?  And what can be learned and applied?  \nThe window into these broader questions that I would like to use today is housing.  One of the \nhallmarks of the r ecent financial crisis, and subsequent economic disruption, has been the very \nsignificant role played by unusually large movements in residential real estate values, within and \nacross countries.   \nGiven our setting today, let me start by comparing U.S. and  Swedish home price movements \nsince 1995, shown in Figure 1 .  In the U.S., house prices increased steadily and reached a peak in \n2006, before beginning an unprecedented decline – not just in selected regions of the country, but \nnationally  – resulting in ag gregate declines of more than 30 percent.  In contrast, Swedish real estate \nprices increased even more substantially, and have not experienced any substantial decline.  Indeed, \nthey continued to rise after the global financial crisis.  \nWhile the U.S. housin g price decline was a nationwide phenomenon, there were relatively \nmore severe declines in some parts of the country, such as the so -called “sand states” of Florida, \nArizona, Nevada, and California.  Figure 2  shows the home price declines in various metrop olitan \nareas (a subset of those included in the S&P/Case -Shiller 20 -city composite index) and the lines drop \nfurthest and fastest for the metro areas in Nevada, Arizona, Florida, and California.  \nAs I talk with economists from countries whose housing values  have risen markedly but not \nexperienced sharp declines, I have been struck by two things.  First, they are often confident that \nnational (versus regional) house -price reductions are unlikely.  And secondly, most assume that a \ndecline in house prices would  have a measured impact on the economy should that in fact occur.  But \nthe experience of Japan in recent decades and the U.S. more recently1 should provide some caution – \ngiven that the economic retrenchment that followed these significant declines in home  values \nexceeded most people’s expectations.  \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Weds ., Sept . 28, 2011, at 2:40 AM U. S. Eastern Time & 8:40 AM in Stockholm, Sweden;  or upon delivery  * \n \n \n \n 3 While sustained rapid increases in house prices are frequently followed by significant \ndeclines, I am certainly not predicting price declines in any country, given my limited knowledge of \nmarket characteristics .  But I do recommend a thoughtful consideration of the recent U.S. experience, \ngiven its severity and the fact that it was not foreseen.  Indeed, while residential investment2 now \ncomprises only 2.2 percent of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in the U.S., our  housing problems have \nhad a tremendously disproportionate impact on economic performance and on the recovery of growth \nand employment.   \nI would like to discuss some of the reasons for that disproportionate impact today.  By way of \npreview, let me mention  that I plan to highlight the following points.   \nFirst, while housing is a small component of U.S. GDP, it is also quite volatile.  Historically, \nan outsized proportion of U.S. economic growth in the first two years of a recovery from a recession \nis gener ated by residential investment.  The sector is very responsive to monetary policy3 since the \nability to purchase a home can be quite sensitive to the interest rate and the resulting cost of financing.  \nSecond, the characteristics of a country’s mortgage -finance market determine the impact that \nwill come from a change in the rates directly influenced by monetary policy.  In the U.S., most homes \nare financed by 30 -year fixed -rate mortgages, so a fall in long -term interest rates really only affects \nexisting hom e owners to the extent they refinance.  As a result, the U.S. gets less effect from the \nmovement of short -term, monetary policy interest rates compared to countries where the primary \nmortgage financing instruments are floating -rate loans.  In countries wit h this institutional feature, \nboth new and existing home buyers get more immediate boosts from lower short -term rates.  Figure 3  \nhelps to illustrate this by showing the greater responsiveness of U.S. adjustable -rate mortgage rates to \nthe target federal fun ds rate, versus 30 -year fixed -rate loans.  \nThird, many U.S. financial institutions have significant exposure to real estate, either through \ndirect lending or through the purchase of mortgage -backed securities.  As a result, declines in real \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Weds ., Sept . 28, 2011, at 2:40 AM U. S. Eastern Time & 8:40 AM in Stockholm, Sweden;  or upon delivery  * \n \n \n \n 4 estate prices ca n have a substantial impact on the capital of financial institutions, which impacts their \nability to finance not only the housing sector, but also other sectors of the economy.4 \nFourth, falling home prices have not only impaired the capital of many financi al institutions, \nbut in a very real sense have disrupted the transmission of monetary policy.  This is because falling \nhome prices have brought about a situation where the availability  of credit is more important in many \ncases than the cost of credit.  Bor rowers may not qualify for lower rates – in other words, the credit \nmight not be available to them – because their household balance sheet is weaker than prior to the \nrecession, because the collateral values of homes and commercial real estate have fallen,  and because \nlender perception of risks inherent in the economy and in collateral valuations has risen – all at a time \nwhen lenders’ capital has been depleted.  \nFifth, I will argue that changes in some housing policies in the U.S. could make it less difficu lt \nfor monetary policy to affect the economy when housing prices have fallen.  \nI will also discuss the actions taken last week at the FOMC to promote a faster recovery in the \nhousing sector and the economy more broadly.  I am very supportive of these action s. \nLet me stress that I know housing markets have critical institutional features that differ greatly \nacross countries – including financing arrangements, mortgage insurance, the role of government, tax \ntreatment, mortgage servicing, and borrower liability  in foreclosure.  This makes it difficult to \ngeneralize from the U.S. experience.   \nWhat may be transferable, however, is the observation that sharp declines in housing prices \ncan have additional negative effects, with broad implications for macroeconomic outcomes and \nmonetary policy – broader, perhaps, than may be assumed and incorporated into most statistical \nmodels of the economy.  I don’t intend to talk about whether housing prices will fall, but rather want \nto emphasize that when they do fall the effec t on the economy is often much greater than many people \nexpect.  \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Weds ., Sept . 28, 2011, at 2:40 AM U. S. Eastern Time & 8:40 AM in Stockholm, Sweden;  or upon delivery  * \n \n \n \n 5 Let me pause to mention at the outset that a number of my colleagues at the Federal Reserve \nare studying and speaking about these important issues.  Most recently Elizabeth Duke, a member of \nthe Fed’s Board of Governors and herself a former banker, spoke at the Board’s Policy Forum on the \nHousing Market Going Forward and I recommend her address to you.5  I share Governor Duke’s \nview that in the U.S. we “currently have a housing market that is s o severely out of balance that it is \nhampering our economic recovery.”  I may not be as convinced as she is about one possible remedy – \nthat banks may be suitable landlords upon converting foreclosed properties to rentals – but I \nrecommend absorbing her pe rspectives on things that can be done in the near term to help the housing \nmarket stabilize and rebalance.6 \nAlso, colleagues at the Boston Fed including Paul Willen and Chris Foote have done a great \ndeal of empirical work on these issues, and are exploring  the key institutional characteristics of the \nhousing market that play important roles in the current problems.  Among other things, they are \nworking on estimates of the macroeconomic effects of possible refinancing plans.  \n \nThe Role of Housing in the Slow U.S. Recovery  \n The decline in housing prices has created a multitude of difficulties for the U.S. economic \nrecovery.  I would like to provide some evidence of the problem, and discuss its origins.  \nThe housing sector in the U.S. played a major role in the recent financial crisis, and in making \nthe recovery from the resulting recession so anemic.  In the U.S. we had seen regional declines in \nhome prices during previous recessions, but had not seen a national  decline in house prices in the \npost-war era.  So for most lenders, investors, and homeowners, the sustained and substantial decline \nin home prices was not anticipated.  Even sophisticated investors had placed only a very small \nprobability on such a  correlated decline.  A key lesson from the past several years is that homes are \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Weds ., Sept . 28, 2011, at 2:40 AM U. S. Eastern Time & 8:40 AM in Stockholm, Sweden;  or upon delivery  * \n \n \n \n 6 not riskless investments – and that highly rated, regionally -diversified mortgage securities do not \nnecessarily carry low risk.  \n As mentioned earlier, even though residential investment is a small share of GDP (today only \n2.2 percent), it is quite interest -sensitive – it can decline quite dramatically as interest rates rise, and \nexpand quickly when interest rates are relatively low.  So it has been a disproportionally important  \npart of the monetary policy transmission mechanism.   \nIn the current situation, however, U.S. mortgage rates are quite low but residential investment \nhas not been the engine of growth that it normally is in economic recoveries.  As shown in Figure 4 , \nexpo rts have been a source of strength in the first two years of the U.S. recovery, and business fixed \ninvestment has grown at approximately the same rate in this recovery as in the previous three.  Yet the \nhousehold sector has been particularly weak.  Consump tion, which accounts for approximately 70 \npercent of U.S. GDP, has grown only about half as much in the first two years of the recovery as it did \nin the previous three recoveries.  And the shortfall for residential investment is even more striking.  In \nthe previous three recoveries, residential investment grew over 30 percent on average in the first years \nof the recovery – but has actually decreased  in the first two years of this recovery.  \n Figure 5  explores this pattern further by showing the contribution s to total GDP growth that \nresidential investment has provided in the first and second years of recent recoveries.  In the past three \nrecoveries, residential investment on average contributed more than 20 percent of GDP growth in the \nfirst year and 10 perc ent of growth in the second.  So in the typical recovery, residential investment \ncontributes much more to growth in the first two years of the recovery than would be expected given \nits share of GDP.  This reflects the fact that interest rates generally fal l during a recession and the \ninitial stages of a recovery – and residential investment is usually quite responsive to interest rates.   \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Weds ., Sept . 28, 2011, at 2:40 AM U. S. Eastern Time & 8:40 AM in Stockholm, Sweden;  or upon delivery  * \n \n \n \n 7 In this recovery, residential investment was only a small share of the growth in the first year of \nthe recovery and declined in the second year.  So the unusually slow recovery is, in part, due to the \nuncharacteristically muted response of residential investment to very low interest rates.  \nMore than one observer has commented that we are seeing a different pattern this time  that \nequates almost to a “negative feedback loop.”  High unemployment leads to risk aversion, which \ndecreases demand for new housing.  But without construction activity we are not seeing the typical \nuptick in housing -related jobs.  \n Having said a bit about  residential investment and the slow recovery, I would like to now \ntouch on other problems that stem from the decline in housing prices.  Because residential investment \nis not the only facet of the economy that is affected by the drop in home values.   \nIndeed, the decline in housing prices has contributed to a sharp decline in household wealth.  \nIn fact, Figure 6  shows (in both dollar and percent terms) that there was a significant decline in \nhousehold net worth from 2005 to 2009, and that it particularly i mpacted racial and ethnic minorities \nin the U.S.7  These insights are drawn from a Pew Research Center study that used data from the \nCensus Bureau's Survey of Income and Program Participation .8 \nTo explore this a bit more, Figure 7  shows that while homes ar e an important component of \nnet worth for Americans regardless of racial and ethnic group, African American and Hispanic \nhouseholds are particularly reliant on home values as a share of their wealth (between 50 and 60 \npercent, versus between 30 and 40 perc ent for White and Asian households in the U.S.).  While stock \nprices have increased substantially from their crisis lows, those households whose primary source of \nwealth is their home have been disproportionately affected by the decline in house prices.  A nd \nintuitively, households whose net worth has been significantly impacted are likely to reduce their \nconsumption levels by more than households whose net worth has recovered.  \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Weds ., Sept . 28, 2011, at 2:40 AM U. S. Eastern Time & 8:40 AM in Stockholm, Sweden;  or upon delivery  * \n \n \n \n 8  Figure 8  shows the erosion in home equity for U.S. households, again in both do llar and \npercent terms.  Home equity is not only a source of funds to finance consumer purchases, but also \nfrequently serves as a source of funds for individuals starting new businesses.  With the decline in \nhome equity, many entrepreneurs do not have that  route available to finance start -ups or to expand \nexisting small businesses.  \n The weak housing sector also has an impact on employment.  Figure 9  shows that far fewer \njobs have been created in the first two years of this recovery (the left bar in each pai r) than in previous \nrecoveries (the right bar in the pair).  In fact, construction jobs have continued to decline during the \nfirst two years of this recovery – we have lost over a half a million construction jobs since the \nrecovery began.  While constructi on employment is typically volatile during a recovery, on average \nthe sector adds roughly 150,000 jobs.   \nIndeed, Figure 10  shows that employment in construction has declined by 9 percent in the \nfirst two years of this recovery compared to growth over 4 pe rcent during the previous three \nrecoveries. And weak construction employment and activity also reduces the demand for labor in \nsectors that support construction.   \n Figure 11  highlights that the rate of mortgage delinquency in the U.S. has been much greate r \nduring this recession than in previous ones.  Despite two years of recovery (albeit a very slow one), \nthe mortgage delinquency rate remains well above the peak level seen over the previous 30 years.   \nAnd Figure 12  shows that with significant foreclosure s and a weak economy, both the housing \nvacancy rate and the rental vacancy rate remain quite high by historical standards.  \n So the problems in housing have greatly complicated the recovery in the U.S.  Not only has \nresidential investment been unusually wea k, but “to add insult to injury” consumption, business \nformation, and employment have also been affected by problems in the housing sector.  \n \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Weds ., Sept . 28, 2011, at 2:40 AM U.

Short -term interest rates were cut \nessentially to zero.   \nHitting the so -called “zero lower bound” has certainly brought challenges to the ability of \nmonetary policy to stimu late the economy.  However, once the zero lower bound was reached, the \nFederal Reserve used a variety of tools to try to push down longer -term interest rates, as merited by \neconomic conditions.  Our efforts have included asset purchases both traditional (T reasury securities) \nand nontraditional (mortgage -backed securities).  We have also altered our communications strategy.  \nAt the August  FOMC meeting we announced that the Fed expects to maintain short -term interest \nrates (the target range for the federal f unds rate) near the zero bound at least through mid -2013 unless \nthere is a significant improvement in economic conditions relative to our forecast, and as long as the \ninflation outlook remains subdued.9  At the September FOMC meeting we announced a plan to  extend \nthe maturity of our holdings of securities and reinvest principal payments from our holdings of agency \ndebt and agency mortgage backed securities in agency mortgage -backed securities.  The recent \nactions have helped lower long -term interest rates s ignificantly, which is intended to promote growth \nin interest -sensitive sectors of the economy such as housing.  \nFigure 13  shows that in the U.S. the 10 -year Treasury rate, and 30 -year mortgage rates, have \nreached historically low levels.  Figure 14  illustr ates that the combination of low rates and falling \nhouse prices significantly improved the affordability of homes.10  In addition, Figure 15  shows that \nboth population and household formation in the U.S. have continued to rise over the past five years.11   \nThe problem is, while many households have been able to refinance and some new home \nbuyers have taken advantage of the improved affordability of houses, falling home prices have made \nmany unable to refinance, and many unable or unwilling to purchase a home .  While the housing \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Weds ., Sept . 28, 2011, at 2:40 AM U. S. Eastern Time & 8:40 AM in Stockholm, Sweden;  or upon delivery  * \n \n \n \n 10 market would have been more severely impacted (and housing prices fallen more substantially) had \nthe Federal Reserve not eased monetary policy aggressively, the impact of our policies on the \neconomy has clearly been impaired by falling  housing prices.  \n Monetary policy would have had a greater impact if households were able to respond to the \nlower interest rates as if house prices had not fallen.  The data can help one gauge the scope of the \npotential.  The widely followed CoreLogic esti mate is that as of the second quarter, 10.9 million, or \n22.5 percent, of all mortgaged residential properties had negative equity, where the debt exceeds the \nvalue of the house.12  These so -called upside -down homeowners typically have a much harder time \nrefinancing than owners with positive equity.  \nAlong these lines, CoreLogic estimates that about three -quarters of owners with negative \nequity are paying \"above -market\" interest rates, which the company defines as rates above 5.1 \npercent.13 By contrast, slightly more than half of positive -equity owners are paying above -market \nrates. All in all, CoreLogic estimates that there are about 28 million borrowers who are paying above -\nmarket rates and thus might potentially benefit from a refinance.14  \nThere are several proposals that attempt to facilitate refinancing for homeowners who have \nbeen negatively impacted by the drop in housing prices. These proposals do face hurdles, including \nhow to address private mortgage insurance and second liens.  How ever, a program that made it \npossible for many homeowners to refinance, even if they were upside down, would likely provide \nsignificant reductions in mortgage payments to individuals who are likely to have a relatively high \npropensity to consume.  Clearly getting more money into the hands of homeowners who would spend \nit could help to fuel GDP growth.  This would reduce one of the impediments to a more significant \neffect from the monetary policy actions taken to date.  \nI hasten to add that there is already a  government program to allow underwater borrowers to \nrefinance, the Home Affordable Refinance Program (HARP).  This program allows underwater \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Weds ., Sept . 28, 2011, at 2:40 AM U. S. Eastern Time & 8:40 AM in Stockholm, Sweden;  or upon delivery  * \n \n \n \n 11 borrowers with Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac loans to refinance at lower rates. Unfortunately, the \nprogram has helped fewer borrowers than was originally hoped.  Fed Governor Betsy Duke outlined \nsome of the potential reasons why, in the talk I mentioned earlier.  They include loan -level price \nadjustments (LLPAs) that raise interest rates for many borrowers and thereby red uce the benefit of \nrefinancing; originator worries about “buybacks” forced on them by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac; \njunior lien -holder resistance to re -subordinating their loans; and mortgage insurance policies.   \n  The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) is now investigating whether there are ways \nto enhance the program to benefit more borrowers.15  As this work proceeds, I hope the FHFA \nconsiders dropping or reducing LLPAs in cases when a GSE loan is refinanced into another GSE \nloan.  Such a refinance actu ally reduces the GSE’s credit risk (they already guarantee the existing \nmortgage and the homeowner will be able to take advantage of lower rates, freeing up cash flow).  \n A second potential way to help resuscitate the housing sector would be to facilitate the \nreduction in the number of vacant homes.16  One way to do this would be to help responsible investors \npurchase vacant homes and then convert them into rental properties. Today, a majority of investor \ndeals are financed with cash, which suggests that the re is room for improvement in the financing of \ninvestor properties.  \nA step in the right direction is a new loan product from Fannie Mae that allows a cash -out \nrefinance of properties purchased with cash within the past six months, helping to “recycle” inv estor \ndollars through the market.  But more could be done. Two possibilities include allowing investors to \naccess FHA 203(k) purchase -rehab loans and increasing the cap on the number of Freddie Mac loans \nthat are available to a single investor.  In short, improving access to credit for responsible investors to \npurchase and improve properties would not only help provide affordable rental housing.  It would also \nhelp to boost housing demand and limit some of the collateral problems from the large supply of \nvacant homes.17 \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Weds ., Sept . 28, 2011, at 2:40 AM U. S. Eastern Time & 8:40 AM in Stockholm, Sweden;  or upon delivery  * \n \n \n \n 12 A third way to help today’s housing market would be to provide as much certainty as possible \nregarding future government policy in this area. The GSEs are likely to play a different role in the \nnew system.18  The uncertainty has real effects on  how well our current system works. A case in point \nconcerns GSE repurchase requests on delinquent loans.19  \nFinally, I would like to be able to guarantee that the United States will never again suffer a \nsignificant house -price decline.  But instead I can s uggest some improvements that could make the \nhousing market of the future more robust in the face of disruptive shocks.  One suggestion concerns \nspeeding up20 the resolution of delinquent mortgages that have no hope of becoming current again. \nThe government ’s Home Affordable Foreclosure Alternative program (HAFA) is intended to speed \nthe resolution of troubled homeownerships by offering monetary incentives to borrowers and \nservicers who agree to short sales or deeds -in-lieu of foreclosure. But like the large r HAMP program, \ntake-up rates for HAFA have been disappointing.21  \nThe ultimate solution may be to rethink the foreclosure process from the start, and economic \ntheory could play a role here.22 By influencing the costs and benefits of non -foreclosure transfer s, a \nnew system of ownership transfer might better align the incentives of borrowers and lenders, while \nstill protecting the legitimate property rights of homeowners. If so, society as a whole would benefit.  \n \n \nConcluding Observations  \nIn conclusion, I woul d reiterate that problems in the housing sector of the U.S. economy have \nbeen a major impediment to recovery.  As you know, we took significant actions last week at the \nFOMC to promote a faster recovery in the housing sector and the economy more broadly.23   \nI am very supportive of the actions, which were designed to promote stronger growth and \nreduce unemployment rates, consistent with our dual mandate, by putting downward pressure on \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Weds ., Sept . 28, 2011, at 2:40 AM U. S. Eastern Time & 8:40 AM in Stockholm, Sweden;  or upon delivery  * \n \n \n \n 13 longer -term interest rates and helping make financial conditions more acc ommodative.  The actions \nannounced last week involve extending the average maturity of our holdings of securities, by selling \n$400 billion of Treasury securities with maturities of less than three years, and purchasing $400 \nbillion in securities with matur ities of from six to thirty years.  I would highlight that 29 percent of the \nsecurities being purchased are in the maturity range over 20 years.  \nThe FOMC also announced that to support conditions in mortgage markets we will now \nreinvest principal payments from our holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage -backed securities \nin agency mortgage -backed securities, rather than purchasing Treasury securities.   \nThere was a substantial market reaction to the announcement.  Thirty -year Treasury yields \ndeclined by 18 basis points and thirty -year mortgage rates declined by 22 basis points that day – and \nfell further the following day.   \nPictured in Figure 16  is the spread between the 30 -year mortgage yield (a wholesale yield) \nand the 10 -year Treasury yield.  The spread illustrates in part what the Fed's actions are addressing – \nthe upward movement in the spread since mid 2011 – and the market's reaction, a 17 -basis -point drop \nin the spread, following the Fed’s announcement.  Since some of this action had been anticipated and \nalready reflected in market prices, I view this as a very significant decline.  \nWhile there are a variety of impacts that lower long -term Treasury and mortgage yields can \nhave, certainly one is encouraging more refinancing and home purchases than would happen in the \nabsence of action.  In my own view, the Federal Reserve should continue to closely monitor spreads \nbetween mortgage and Treasur y yields and consider taking action if that spread widens significantly, \nas it had recently.  \nWhile the housing sector and the economy would have been weaker in the absence of the \nFed’s actions to lower rates, I believe it is equally important to examine ho using policies that might be \nchanged to reduce the impediments to monetary policy and more generally help facilitate recovery.  \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Weds ., Sept . 28, 2011, at 2:40 AM U. S. Eastern Time & 8:40 AM in Stockholm, Sweden;  or upon delivery  * \n \n \n \n 14 There should be strong encouragement for the GSEs to focus on the housing recovery so home buyers \nand those that already have lo ans can fully benefit from the lower interest rates generated  by our \nmonetary policy action.  Given that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are currently under conservatorship \nby the U.S. government, I believe they should play a larger role in achieving the public  policy goals \ninherent in addressing these housing -market problems.  \n While monetary policy cannot fully offset the many problems stemming from the recession, it \ncan certainly mitigate some of the effects.  A policy action that, for instance, reduces the \nunemployment rate by half a percent over time will not return the economy to full employment, of \ncourse, but will still mean 750,000 jobs that would not have been created in the absence of the action.  \nOf course, carefully weighing the potential costs of add itional action with the expected potential \nbenefits involves a high degree of uncertainty, given we have not operated at the zero bound with \nfalling housing prices in the post -war period.   However, with unemployment at 9.1 percent and with \ninflation in th e medium term expected to remain below 2 percent, monetary and fiscal policies should \nbe focused on returning the economy to full employment.  \nGiven what I have laid out today, let me close with this.  We need to recognize the urgency of \nthe situation and t he broader economic implications of housing’s continued struggles.  All parties in \nthese markets should redouble their efforts, given the broader economic effects and their painful toll.   \n Thank you.  \n \n                                                 \n \n1 Not to mention some European countries.  \n \n2 Residential investment is the housing component of Gross Domestic Product (GDP).

Immigration does not have a similar effect on estimates \nfor white, black, or Hispanic households.  \n \n8 The Pew study by Rakesh Kochhar, Richard Fry and Paul Taylor was published on July  26, 2011, and entitled \"Wealth \nGaps Rise to Record Highs Between Whites, Blacks and Hispanics.\"  See http://pewsocialtrends.org/2011/07/26/wealth -\ngaps-rise-to-record -highs -between -whites -blacks -hispanics/  \n \n9 The statement, available at http://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/monetary/20110809a.htm , noted that \nconsistent with its mandate, “The Committee now expects a somewhat slower pace of recovery over coming quarte rs than \nit did at the time of the previous meeting and anticipates that the unemployment rate will decline only gradually toward \nlevels that the Committee judges to be consistent with its dual mandate” to foster maximum employment and price \nstability.  “Th e Committee also anticipates that inflation will settle, over coming quarters, at levels at or below those \nconsistent with the Committee's dual mandate.”  The Committee decided to keep the target range for the federal funds rate \nat 0 to 1/4 percent and “cu rrently anticipates that economic conditions – including low rates of resource utilization and a \nsubdued outlook for inflation over the medium run – are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels for the federal funds \nrate at least through mid -2013.”  \n \n10 Given median income, relative to the income needed to purchase the median priced home.  \n \n11 And if anything, household formation has not kept up with population growth, suggesting a growing pent -up demand for \nhomes.  \n \n12 See http://www.corelogic.com/about -us/new s/new -corelogic -data-reveals -q2-negative -equity -declines -in-hardest -hit-\nmarkets -and-8-million -negative -equity -borrowers -have -above.aspx  \n \n13 CoreLogic gets the 5.1 percent number by noting that the current mortgage rate is roughly 4.1 percent, then adding a \n100 basis -point “refinance trigger.”  Refinances are costly even under normal circumstances, so there has to be a non -\ntrivial difference b etween the existing rate and the new rate in order for a refinance to make financial sense.  \n \n14 The fraction of negative -equity mortgages paying above 5.1 percent is 74.3 percent (8.1 million out of a total 10.9 \nmillion underwater mortgages).

This document, titled “Reforming \nAmerica’s Housing Finance Market: A Report to C ongress,” is available at \nhttp://www.treasury.gov/initiatives/Documents/Reforming%20America%27s%20Housing%20Finance%20Market.pdf . \n \n19 The GS Es regularly review delinquent loans to ensure that their loan files are consistent with the representations and \nwarranties made by originators. In cases where the GSEs believe the loan file does not match what the originator \npromised, the GSE s can issue a  repurchase request. As delinquencies have risen, so have the number of these buyback \nrequests. Many have argued that concern over buybacks has made originators less willing to issue certain types of loans.  \nOver the long run, economic theory would predict  that market participants could work out a solution to this problem. For \nexample, third -party firms could arise to offer insurance to originators against buybacks. Alternatively, the originators and \nthe GSEs could find ways of doing business that would bet ter capture the mutual gains from trade. But these market \nsolutions are less likely to come about if mortgage -market participants are uncertain abo ut the future role of the GSEs.  \n \n20 According to the August 2011 Mortgage Monitor, published by Lender Process ing Services, Inc., foreclosure timelines \nhave lengthened significantly during the past three years. In July 2011, the average mortgage in foreclosure was \ndelinquent for 599 days, up from 319 days in January 2009 [The LPS Mortgage Monitor, published by LPS  Applied \nAnalytics, is available at \nhttp://www.lpsvcs.com/LPSCorporateInformation/ResourceCenter/PressResources/Pages/MortgageMonitor.aspx. The \nAugust 2011 Monitor includes data through the end of July. The days -delinquent statistic quoted in the text appe ars on \nslide 3.]. Also, foreclosure delays tend to be especially serious in states that require judicial involvement.  \n \n21 A report from the Special Inspector General for the Troubled Asset Relief Program (which funds HAFA) reports that far \nmore short  sales and deeds -in-lieu have taken place outside of HAFA than in it.  See p. 67 of the SIGTARP’s July 2011 \nQuarterly Report to Congress, available at \nhttp://www.sigtarp.gov/reports/congress/2011/July2011_Quarterly_Report_to_Congress.pdf.  \nThis report states: “As of June 30, 2011, which according to Treasury is the latest data available, approximately $37.9 \nmillion from TARP had been paid to investors, borrowers, and servicers in connection with 10,280 short sales or deeds -in-\nlieu of foreclosure transfers completed  under HAFA. As of May 31, 2011, which according to Treasury is the latest data \navailable, Treasury reported that the 10 largest servicers alone had completed 112,525 short sales and deeds -in-lieu \noutside HAMP for borrowers whose HAMP trial modifications h ad failed, borrowers who had chosen not to participate, or \nwere ineligible for the program.” The most recent data on the number of HAFA transactions is available from the U.S. \nTreasury at http://www.treasury.gov/initiatives/financial -stability/results/MHA -Reports/Pages/default.aspx. While \ndocumentation requirements and other regulations in HAFA may be responsible for much of this difference, the Special \nInspector General’s report suggests that the difference could result in part by the ability of servicers to collect fees and \ndeficiency judgments for non -HAFA transactions. Deficiency judgments are not permitted in the HAFA program. \nNotably, many HAFA requirements have recently been relaxed. For example, as of February 1, servicers of non -GSE \nmortgages partic ipating in HAFA are no longer required to verify a borrower’s financial information, or to determine that \nhis monthly mortgage payment exceeded 31 percent of his monthly income. However, servicers must continue to obtain a \nsigned affidavit indicating that the borrower has experienced some sort of financial hardship.

Rosengren \nPresident & Chief Executive Officer \nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston \n \nRemarks at the Global Interdependence Center’s \nConference on Capital Markets in  the Post Crisis Environment \n \nStockholm, Sweden \nSeptember 29, 2011 \n  \n \nI am very happy to be with you for this substant ive conference on capital  markets in the “post-\ncrisis” environment.  It is vital for policymak ers and practitioners to study and apply the recent \nlessons of financial interdependence, given the o bvious effects on public wellbeing.  So I am glad to \nbe able to join you in these discussions.  A nd I commend the Global Interdependence Center for \norganizing this event, and others like it. \nI should note, of course, that the views I expr ess today are my own, and not necessarily those \nof my colleagues on the Federal Reserve’s Boar d of Governors or the Federal Open Market \nCommittee (the FOMC).  That is a st andard disclaimer for Fed officials, but I really do mean it.  My \ncomments should not be construed as  official Fed perspectives or policy, but rather one person’s \ncarefully considered perspectives, based on much study.  Let me also mention that my charts, and the \nanalysis I will share with  you today, are all built on publicly available data. \n\n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Thurs., Sept. 29, 2011, at 2:50 AM U.S. Eastern Time & 8:50 AM  in Stockholm, Sweden; or upon delivery * \n \n \n \n 2My intent today is to offer up some constructive observations that I believe will help us move \ntowards greater financial stability, to the benefit of all.  We need to create a more stable financial infrastructure and I believe we can, in a thoughtful manner.   \nFor the second time in four years, problems w ith financial institutions have captured the \nattention not only of economists, but  also the mainstream press and th e public at large.  Given the \nimportance of credit to economic performance, we should reflect on why our financial system seems \nso susceptible to shocks, and on how we can strengt hen its resilience so gove rnment intervention is no \nlonger necessitated by such shocks.  My hope is that bankers and cen tral bankers can once again be \nrelegated from the front pages of our newspapers to the business sections. \nYesterday I had an opportunity to participate in an economic outlook forum and discuss some \nof the challenges in the real econom y – specifically in housing – that we are trying to address in the \nUnited States.  Today I’d like to shift somewhat from the real economy directly, and focus on more \nunderlying financial-market challenges.    \nIt goes without saying that this is  an important time to be disc ussing financial markets.  Global \nfinancial markets are being buffeted by concerns about the challenges f acing various financial \ninstitutions, in part as a result of issues with fiscal imbalances  in a number of countries.  This \nheightened uncertainty is occurri ng despite the aggressive monetary policy actions taken in response \nto the recent recession – actions that at first blush w ould seemingly mitigate some of these challenges.   \nConsistent with our mandate, the Federal Re serve acted aggressively when financial \ndisruptions emerged and the economy faltered.  After cutting the federa l funds rate essentially as far \nas possible, the Fed took less traditional policy actions, again to pursue our mandate.  Figure 1  shows \nthat bank reserves in the United Stat es have increased dramatically.  We have increased the size of the \nFederal Reserve balance sheet, providing over a trilli on dollars in additional bank reserves – yet even \nso, dollar funding markets have experienced strains.   \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Thurs., Sept. 29, 2011, at 2:50 AM U.S. Eastern Time & 8:50 AM  in Stockholm, Sweden; or upon delivery * \n \n \n \n 3Figure 2  highlights that interbank markets are showi ng more strains as th e spread between the \n3-month London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) and the overnight index swap rate has widened.  \nThis is happening even though most banks are loath to post higher rate s for fear of signaling financial \nchallenges.   \nAlso reflective of the current strain is Figure 3 , which essentially shows the cost of utilizing \nderivatives contracts to secure dollar funding.  It show s the spread between the 3-month dollar cash \nrate implied by a 3-month euro-dollar FX sw ap, and 3-month dollar LIBOR.  Under normal \nconditions the line should be quite close to zero, but during periods of dollar funding problems, the \nspread can widen.  As the chart shows, the spread is now at the widest it has been in the past several \nyears. \nSo how can there be a shortage of dollar f unding at a time when there are so many bank \nreserves?  One answer lies in th e structure of short-term funding markets – a structure that has \nevolved to a state that is, unf ortunately, particularly sensi tive to liquidity shocks.   \nToday I will highlight that the structure of  the U.S. money market mutual fund (MMMF) \nindustry1 -- and the practice of many fina ncial institutions to fund long-te rm dollar assets with short-\nterm dollar liabilities – have both helped make th e global financial system susceptible to liquidity \nshocks and (relatedly) to change s in the perceived credit risk  of market participants.   \nI will first discuss the role that MMMFs pl ay in providing short-term funding, including \nserving as an important source of short-term financ ing for European banks.  I will highlight that the \ncurrent structure makes MMMFs particularly susceptible to credit shocks that can turn into liquidity \nproblems for the whole industry – and will suggest so me ways that the industry could be made more \nresilient.   \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Thurs., Sept. 29, 2011, at 2:50 AM U.S. Eastern Time & 8:50 AM  in Stockholm, Sweden; or upon delivery * \n \n \n \n 4And I will then turn to the practice among some European ba nks of funding long-term dollar \nassets with short-term paper purchased by MMMFs.  Th is too, has proved to be a structure that makes \nshort-term credit markets suscep tible to liquidity shocks.   \nI will conclude with some general observations about the current stresses in financial markets. \n \nThe Role of Money Market Mutual Funds in Short-Term Credit Markets \nMMMFs are mutual funds that provi de investors the ability to i nvest in a diversified set of \nshort-term credit-market instruments.  Because  MMMFs generally invest in highly liquid, high \nquality, short-term credit instruments they are not required to alter their net value to reflect small \nmovements in underlying asset values.  The resulti ng stable (versus floating) net asset value makes \nthe investments attractive to investors looking for a transactional account that generally has paid a \nsomewhat higher return than comparable bank products.   \nLike other mutual funds, MMMFs are not required to hold any capital as protection against \nadverse movements in the value of the assets they hold.  This absence of cap ital, together with the \nstable net asset value, results in a structure that desp ite its appeal in other ways is prone to shareholder \n“runs” during times of financial stresses. \nMMMFs have been viewed as appealingly safe investment vehicles for investors seeking \nhighly liquid investment opportunities.  As a condition of transacting at a stable net asset value, the \nMMMFs, which are regulated by the Securities and Exchange Commi ssion (SEC), are required to \nmaintain significant liquidity ratios and are limited in the duration and credit ratings of the financial instruments they can hold.\n2, 3  \nMMMFs are critical players in short-term credit markets.  They have been very significant \nbuyers of commercial paper, asset-backed commer cial paper, and certificates of deposit.  MMMFs \nhave provided an important source of financing for organizations dependent  on wholesale financing, \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Thurs., Sept. 29, 2011, at 2:50 AM U.S. Eastern Time & 8:50 AM  in Stockholm, Sweden; or upon delivery * \n \n \n \n 5including branches of foreign banking organizations operating in the U.S. – I will discuss them in a \nmoment – and others that issu e short-term credit instruments to finance longer-term dollar-\ndenominated assets. \nAs Figure 4  illustrates, MMMFs are sizeable participan ts in financial markets with about $2.5 \ntrillion of assets under management.  They grew rapi dly for much of the last decade, but encountered \nsignificant problems in the wake of the failure  of Lehman Brothers.  One MMMF, the Reserve \nPrimary Fund, had a position in Le hman Brothers and was unable to maintain a fixed net asset value \n(“broke the buck”) after Lehman faile d and the value of its commercial  paper plummeted.  This led to \nrapid withdrawals from many MMMFs (a “run”) as  investors became concerned that other MMMFs \nwould not be able to maintain their stable net asset value.   \nIn response to the rapid withdrawals, the U. S. Treasury announced a temporary insurance \nprogram for MMMFs.  The Federal Reserve Bank of  Boston administered on behalf of the Federal \nReserve System a lending facility that was designed  to address the short-term liquidity needs of \nMMMFs and help stabilize short-term  credit markets that were disrupted by the rapid liquidation of \ninvestments by many MMMFs.4,5  These efforts proved successful at restoring stability and avoiding \nfurther harm, and all of the loan s were repaid with interest.6   \nSince then, balances at MMMFs have gradually d eclined – by more than a trillion dollars from \ntheir peak – over the past three year s in response to the historically low interest rate environment and \ncorresponding returns. \nFigure 5  shows the three major categor ies of MMMFs, determined by the assets in which they \ninvest.  The prime money market funds are the largest category, w ith approximately $1.5 trillion in \nassets.  The prime funds have the most flexibility  in investing and are a llowed to hold commercial \npaper, jumbo CDs,7 and asset-backed commercial paper as well as government-backed securities.  \nThe second largest category, with approximately $850 million in assets, involves MMMFs that invest \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Thurs., Sept. 29, 2011, at 2:50 AM U.S. Eastern Time & 8:50 AM  in Stockholm, Sweden; or upon delivery * \n \n \n \n 6in U.S. Treasury and agency securities.  These funds  have lower credit risk, but also generate lower \nreturns.  The smallest category involves MMMFs th at provide tax-free returns to investors.   \nAt the time of the Lehman Brothers failure, prime MMMFs that had credit-sensitive investors \nand exposure to large financial institutions expe rienced the largest and most rapid redemptions.8  \nMany investor outflows from prime funds were redirected to MMMFs that  were government-only \nfunds.   \nMMMFs have substantially increased their liquidity over the last y ear.  In part this reflects a \ntightening of liquidity requirements by the SEC,  but it also reflects th e realization among MMMF \nmanagers that during times of significant liquidity risk, they need to maintain a more defensive \nposture.  As Figure 6  shows, prime funds have been increasing their holdings of short-maturity assets \nof late – in part, one assumes, as a result of th e debt ceiling concerns in the U.S. and the funding \nworries related to governments and fi nancial institutions in Europe. \nSince MMMFs have increased liquidity in an en vironment of very low returns on short-term \ncredit instruments, their returns to inve stors have been squeezed further.   Figure 7  illustrates the \nimpact on MMMF returns.  The first line in the tabl e provides the average yiel ds for the five highest \nyielding MMMFs, and the second line  provides the average yields for the next five highest yielding \nfunds.  The table highlights that while the gross  yield averages about 40 basis points for the five \nhighest yielding MMMFs, inve stors are only getting a net yield of only five basis points.  \nMMMFs have purchased a large amount of  foreign-bank securities.  But as Figure 8  shows, \nmost MMMFs have been reducing their exposure to  European banks that the market may see as \nposing more significant credit risk s.  Some of the reductions have  been quite dramatic, and MMMFs \nare no longer holding short-term credit instruments i ssued by institutions headquartered in the most \nfinancially strained countries.  Th ey have greatly reduced the size of  their overall exposure, and have \nalso significantly reduced the matu rity they are willing to hold. \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Thurs., Sept. 29, 2011, at 2:50 AM U.S. Eastern Time & 8:50 AM  in Stockholm, Sweden; or upon delivery * \n \n \n \n 7However, one of the challenges for the MMMF i ndustry is that, just as in the fall of 2008, a \nvery few aggressive MMMFs – maybe even one – could under certain circumstances encounter \ntrouble that ends up ratcheting up redemp tion requests across the industry.   \nNo one wants to see a repeat of 2008, nor should we.  The industry and all participants can get \nto a better place.  For example, an examination of  the publicly available m onthly reports on portfolio \nholdings of MMMFs highlights that a few MMMFs hold financial paper that has not been \ndowngraded but nonetheless is seen by the market as posing more credit risk than could seem \nappropriate for entities that are allowed to maintain a fixed net asset value. \nMMMFs have been required to provide a monthly report of holdings and have increased their \nliquidity.  Still, we are passing the three-year anniversary of the failure of Lehman and the run on the MMMFs and it remains important to explore the ways that the industry, which pl ays a pivotal role in \nshort-term credit markets, can address its susceptib ility to a credit shock that could in turn be \ntransmitted to short-term financial markets.  I am  not saying anything that has not been expressed \nbefore, but want to highlight the opportunities we all have to move thoughtfully but expeditiously to a \nmore stable place. \nGiven all this, I believe a more proactive regu latory approach may be necessary.  While the \nmonthly reporting has been helpful, given the very s hort maturity of many of the assets, I believe the \nreporting should be more frequent to avoid the possi bility of “window dressi ng” at the end of the \nmonth.  Also, reducing a fund’s maximum permissibl e exposure to any one firm could reduce the \npotential loss that would occur from a credit even t involving only one counterparty.  Consideration \nmight also be given to whether the assets of risk ier firms (for example thos e with very high market \ncredit default swaps (“CDS”) prices are appropriate  investments for MMMFs, which are expected to \nmaintain a low risk profile. \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Thurs., Sept. 29, 2011, at 2:50 AM U.S. Eastern Time & 8:50 AM  in Stockholm, Sweden; or upon delivery * \n \n \n \n 8There have been a variety of proposals recommendi ng more substantial changes in this arena.  \nHowever, three years after a systemically significan t episode, no one proposal has been settled on.   \nMy own preferred approach would be to requ ire MMMFs to have a meaningful capital-like \nbuffer that exceeds, for example, their single-issu er concentration exposure limits – perhaps on the \norder of 2 to 3 percent – that, if violated, automatically leads to a fund’s conversion to a floating net \nasset value.  Examples of how to structure such  a buffer include having the MMMF’s sponsor directly \nfund the creation of the buffer, or creating a separate class of loss- absorbing shares that could be \nmarketed to investors willing to bear  some risk in exchange for a higher return than that provided by \nthe stable value shares.  If in some appropriate pe riod of time a satisfactory plan for such a capital \nbuffer is not produced and accepted, then those prime funds would be required to  float their net asset \nvalue.  \nAll in all, though, given the systemic importance of the MMMF industry, it is critical that one \nway or another we make the industry less susceptible to credit shocks and li quidity runs.  While many \nin the MMMF industry have been reducing their e xposure to troubled financ ial institutions, some \ncontinue to take what some observers might consid er outsized credit risks.  The experience of 2008 \nshowed the potential for a MMMF’s problems to precipitate redemptions that are ultimately \ndestabilizing to short-term credit ma rkets, and contribute to economic difficulties.  I am certainly not \npredicting any such outcome but not ing that policymakers, market pa rticipants, and the industry can \nand should make steady progress on these matters.  \nForeign Branches and Agenci es in the United States \n The consideration of MMMFs is intertwined with another issue of systemic risk that I would \nlike to discuss – the dependence, to  a large degree, of foreign branch es and agencies in the U.S. on \nshort-term wholesale funding. \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Thurs., Sept. 29, 2011, at 2:50 AM U.S. Eastern Time & 8:50 AM  in Stockholm, Sweden; or upon delivery * \n \n \n \n 9 Let me first note that while I will raise some concerns in this arena, we are beginning to \naddress them within the existing statutory framewor k.  However, over time other structural remedies \nmay be warranted and possible.   \nUnlike domestic banks or foreign bank subsidiaries  in the U.S., foreign branches and agencies \nare not allowed to have U.S. deposit insurance a nd thus cannot rely on insu red retail deposits as a \nfunding source.  In addition, forei gn banks are ineligible for member ship in, and receiving secured \nfunds from, the Federal Home Loan banks – which have been an important source of liquidity for \nmany domestic banks.  As a result, they are especi ally reliant on wholesale funding – that is, raising \nfunds by issuing jumbo certificates of deposit, commercial paper, a nd repurchase agreements; all of \nwhich during times of stress are less stab le than typical retail deposit accounts.9   \nParenthetically, I would note that foreign branches are not required to directly hold any capital \nwith their U.S. operations.  I will say more on this in a moment. \nWhile wholesale funding is an important part of a bank’s liability st ructure, an excessive \nreliance on short-term wholesale funding to finan ce long-term assets can be problematic.  In \nparticular, in situations where wholesale financing is not available, foreig n branches can find it \ndifficult to raise required dollar funding and the forei gn parent may not be able  to fill the funding gap \neffectively.  This is one of the reasons why fore ign banks were among the most aggressive users of \nthe Fed’s liquidity facilities a nd Discount Window in the wake of the run on MMMFs in the fall of \n2008.  Foreign branches and agencies utilize wholesale dollar deposits for two main purposes.  First, \nthey use the short-term wholesal e deposits to fund longer-term U.S.  dollar bank loans and securities \nholdings.  They frequently fund large corporate borro wing needs.  Second, the branches are often used \nto raise dollar funding for their global parent.  Thus , branches frequently pr ovide longer-term funding \nto their parent to fund dolla r assets the parent is holding outside of the branch. \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Thurs., Sept. 29, 2011, at 2:50 AM U.S. Eastern Time & 8:50 AM  in Stockholm, Sweden; or upon delivery * \n \n \n \n 10 I will say a fair amount about foreign branches today, so I want to stress that the focus stems \nfrom the important and useful func tion that they serve as a source of finance in our global economy. \n Figure 9  provides the major components of foreign br anch assets.  These are principally loans \nand leases and securities holdings such as high-grade corporate secu rities.  In addition, you can see \nthat foreign banks have been attemp ting to increase their liquidity in  case their access to wholesale \nfunding becomes constrained – as reflected in the sharp increase  in cash and bank reserves. \nFigure 10  provides the major components of foreign branch liabilities.  Roughly 75 percent of \nbranch liabilities are generated by jumbo deposits,  commercial paper and other borrowing, including \nfinancing through repurchase agreements.  One of  the primary sources of these funds are the \nMMMFs.    Using shorter-term wholesale funding (in bran ches) to fund longer-term assets held by the \nbranch or the parent proved probl ematic in the fall of 2008.  The investor run on money market funds \nforced the funds to stop acquiring new (and “rolli ng over” existing) jumbo deposits and commercial \npaper, causing a serious f unding problem for the issuing entities .  Short-term credit markets became \nseverely stressed, requiring signifi cant government intervention to re store liquidity to the market. \n Concerns over problems in Europe are once ag ain posing a problem for the strategy of short-\nterm wholesale funding of longer-ter m U.S. dollar assets.  Despite th e large supply of bank reserves I \nmentioned earlier, a reduction in MMMF financ ing has once again result ed in a problem for \nwholesale dollar funding.  The recent announcement of several central banks that they would provide \nlonger-term dollar financing has once again highlighted that short-term  credit markets are, in my own \nopinion, overly dependent on structures  that are highly sensitive to cr edit and liquidity conditions.  \nOver time it will be important to get to a place wh ere adequate funding flows do not require official \nintervention during times of stress. \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Thurs., Sept. 29, 2011, at 2:50 AM U.S. Eastern Time & 8:50 AM  in Stockholm, Sweden; or upon delivery * \n \n \n \n 11 As with MMMFs, a greater focus on financial stability should cause a re-evaluation of \nstructures with no direct capital and a clear relia nce on rolling over short-te rm liabilities to fund \nlonger-term assets.  The foreign branch system is im portant because of the role it plays in U.S. credit \nmarkets and also because of the dollar funding it f acilitates for foreign banks, facilitating global \ncommerce.  However, it does suffer from some of the same problems as the money market funds. \n There are a number ways to try to reduce these liquidity problems associated with the current \nbranch structure.  Clearly this issue requires much  careful thought and analys is, so what I’ll suggest \ntoday should be viewed only as examples of possible approaches  that could be taken.   \nOne supervisory approach could be  to preserve the current branch  structure but take steps to \nreduce funding risks in various ways.10  It may be advisable to requi re greater liquidity from global \nparents.  And I would note that several of the Basel III Capital Accord’s liquidity measures will make \nreliance on wholesale funding less attractive.11 \nSecondly, regulatory approaches that have been taken in so me countries require foreign \nbranches to hold capital, or re quire all bank operations to be under a separate holding company \nstructure with capital to support the entirety of domestic operations in the country.  Requiring capital \nfor all domestic operations of foreign banks has costs.12  But it is one option, worthy of study.   \nBoth of these approaches would in all likeli hood cause firms to reconsider whether a more \nstable funding model – for example a more stable mix of funds including wholesale, insured, and \nlonger-term debt – could be superi or to purely wholesale funding.   \nWhile we should actively consider a variety of options, my personal preference would be to \nmove towards all foreign banking operations requiri ng some form of bank capital.  This approach \ncould reduce the liquidity crises th at have occurred episodically, and could also address the possibility \nthat as some banks have become large relative to the size of their countries,  it could be difficult for \nparents to back up branches during a crisis. \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Thurs., Sept. 29, 2011, at 2:50 AM U.S. Eastern Time & 8:50 AM  in Stockholm, Sweden; or upon delivery * \n \n \n \n 12 All in all, I would suggest th at the financial stability issues  raised in 2008, and which have \nbecome increasingly prevalent of late , require a reexaminatio n of issues that influence the stability of \nshort-term credit markets. \n \nConcluding Observations \n In sum and in conclusion, short-term credit ma rkets have become increasingly susceptible to \nrapid shifts in sentiment – shifts that can create  global liquidity problems.  The structure of MMMFs, \neven with improvements that make them less at risk  of runs, can still cause problems – for example if \nMMMFs move assets quickly out of certain segmen ts of wholesale funding markets.  This could \nhappen because of increased credit concerns on the part of  either money-market investors or money-\nmarket managers.   \nAnd foreign banks that have become dependent on MMMFs and other sources of wholesale \nfunding are another concern.  As in 2008, now in  2011 we are seeing dollar shortages as MMMFs \nshun some financial institutions with various exposu res to troubles in Europe  – a situation that is \nhaving a negative impact on short-term credit markets.  All in all, the global banking system curren tly remains more vulnerable than it should and \ncould be.  And more than just the liquidity struct ure is problematic.  Some  global banks appear to \nhave lost the confidence of more than the MMMFs.  Share prices have fallen dramatically for some \nbank stocks, and credit default swap prices for some global banks are at elevated levels.   \nBank supervisors worldwide may do more to utilize these market signals when deciding \nwhether banks should be allowed to issue di vidends or make share repurchases.  Using market  \ntriggers as well as capital  triggers to prevent capital from leavi ng the banking system (or to bolster it \nas necessary) during times of stress should be revi sited.  Should market assessments be wrong, banks \nwould only have deferred dividends or share repurchases.  They c ould be resumed at a higher level \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Thurs., Sept. 29, 2011, at 2:50 AM U.S. Eastern Time & 8:50 AM  in Stockholm, Sweden; or upon delivery * \n \n \n \n 13once the problems are resolved.  Furthermore, using publicly observed signals to  trigger a cessation of \ndividends may have less of a market impact th an dividend reductions  based on management \njudgment.13   \nAllowing dividends and share repurchases to occu r when the risk of a crisis is high allows \nscarce capital to leave the banking system at a time when it is most needed.  Such a policy risks that \ntaxpayers, debt holders, and the economy will suffer should bank capital be insufficient to weather the \ncrisis.   \nIf market triggers were hit and bank supervis ors became concerned about credit availability \nfrom the financial system, in certa in circumstances they could choos e to suspend dividends and stock \nrepurchases for all systemically im portant banks.  This would retain capital in the banking system and \nallow the stronger banks to continue  their important role as financia l intermediaries at a time when \nsome of their peers are constraine d by their financial problems. While Basel III has proposed dividend \nreductions as capital becomes deplete d, I suspect that is likely to be too late, given th e slow pace at \nwhich accounting losses are realized.   \nIt has become clear that financial stability is too central to the perfor mance of economies not \nto explore options for moving forward and reducing in stability.  We need to move constructively and \nprudently to a better place, a nd I believe we can and should.   \n Thank you.                                                     \n \n \n1 The analysis presented here includes 2a-7 funds but, in fact, a broader definition of money funds can be considered  \nwhen discussing the structure and the sensitivity to liquidity shocks. \n \n2 Under section 2a-7 of the Investment Company Act – that is, under Securities and Exchange Commission Rule 2a-7 (17 \nCFR 270.2a-7) issued pursuant to the Investment Company Act of 1940 (Rule 2a-7). \n \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Thurs., Sept. 29, 2011, at 2:50 AM U.S. Eastern Time & 8:50 AM  in Stockholm, Sweden; or upon delivery * \n \n \n \n 14                                                                                                                                                                     \n3 They cannot hold securities with a maturity greater than 13 months, and the average maturity of their assets cannot \nexceed 90 days.  The securities have to be of low credit risk, an d a fund can have no more than  5 percent of its assets with \nany one issuer.   \n \n4 Given the disruptions, the Federal Reserve System announced an asset-backed commercial paper MMMF liquidity \nfacility. The facility, operated for the System by the Bost on Fed, allowed money market funds to sell asset-backed \ncommercial paper to banks – the MMMFs could use the sale procee ds to meet redemption requests – and the asset-backed \ncommercial paper was pledged by the banks to the Fed as part of a loan from the Fed, which was ultimately paid back \nwith interest.    \n5 For more on this episode see my remarks at the Stanford Finance Forum in June: \nhttp://www.bostonfed.org/news/speeche s/rosengren/2011/060311/index.htm  \n \n6 See “How Effective Were the Federal Reserve Emergenc y Liquidity Facilities? Evidence from the Asset-Backed \nCommercial Paper Money Market Mutual Fund Liqu idity Facility” (QAU Working Paper No. QAU10-3 \nby Burcu Duygan-Bump, Patrick M. Parkinson, Eric S. Roseng ren, Gustavo A. Suarez, and Paul S. Willen).  The working \npaper explains that following the failure of Lehman Brothers in September 2008, short-term credit markets were severely \ndisrupted. In response, the Federal Rese rve implemented new and unconventional facilities to help restore liquidity. Many \nexisting analyses of thes e interventions are confounded by  identification problems because they rely on aggregate data. \nTwo unique micro datasets allow us to exploit both time series and cross-sectional variation to evaluate one of the most \nunusual of these facilities—the Asset-Backed Commercial Pape r Money Market Mutual Fund Liquidity Facility (AMLF). \nThe AMLF extended collateralized loans to depository institutio ns that purchased asset-backed commercial paper (ABCP) \nfrom money market funds, helping these funds meet the heavy redemptions that followed Lehman’s bankruptcy. The \nprogram, which lent $150 billion in its first 10 days of oper ation, was wound down with no credit losses to the Federal \nReserve. Our findings indicate that the facility was effective as measured against its dual objectives: it helped stabilize \nasset outflows from money market mutual funds, and it impr oved liquidity in the ABCP market. Using a differences-in-\ndifferences approach we show that afte r the facility was implemented, money market fund outflows decreased more for \nthose funds that held more eligible collateral. Similarly,  we show that yields on AMLF-eligible ABCP decreased \nsignificantly relative to those on otherwise comparable AMLF-ineligible commercial paper.  \n7 Some funds restrict their investme nts to FDIC insured CDs.  The fore ign branch CDs tend to be jumbos. \n \n8 These are shareholders redeeming  their equity investments. \n \n9 During times of stress it may also be more difficult to rely on the foreign parent organization for support, as it may be \nunder stress as well. \n \n10 Steps could include increasing liquidity  concentration; limiting the level of r eceivables from related entities; requiring \nthat any such receivables be collateralized  by high-quality assets held at the paren t; increasing diversification in third part y \nfunding; establishing funding tenor limits, so that branches hold less shorter-term wholesale funding; requiring that \nbranches collateralize some of their third party funding with high-quality collateral; and requiring branches to better match \nthe tenor of assets with the tenor of liabilities they hold. \n \n11 However, in this regard it depends upon how the rules for “significant currencies” are enforced. \n \n12 For example, banks would have less flexibility to move liqui dity and capital across borders, and maintaining separate \nrisk analysis by country could raise costs for global banks. \n \n13 Since by construction the public trigger approach conveys no negative information about the bank’s earnings prospects \nbeyond what the market already knows. \n\nTowards Greater Financial Stability \nin Short -Term Credit Markets\nEric S.

Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY  * \n \n \n1 \n  \n \n \n“Global Financial Intermediaries: \nLessons and Continuing Challenges” \n \nAddress at the Federal \nReserve Bank of Boston’s \n56th Economic Conference: \nThe Long-Term Effects \nof the Great Recession \n \n \nEric S. Rosengren \nPresident & Chief Executive Officer \nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston \n \n \nOctober 19, 2011 \nBoston, Massachusetts \n \n \n \n \nI’d like to reiterate the welcome to confer ence participants that I offered yesterday.  \nThank you for being here to take part in this conference on the long-term  effects of what many \nhave come to call, sadly, the “Great Recession.”  I hope that the ideas and analysis exchanged at \nthis conference will help alleviate the effects of this downturn and the slow recovery, as well as help prevent future problems from cau sing so much hardship for so many. \n\n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, October 19, 2011 at  8:30 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY  * \n \n \n2 \n I should mention that the views I express toda y are my own, and not necessarily those of \nmy colleagues on the Federal Reserve’s Board of Governors or the Federal Open Market \nCommittee (the FOMC).   \nAs I – and others – have noted many times, a key lesson from the recent downturn and \nprior financial crises is that problems in financial institutions  and financial markets can and do \nspill over to the real economy, very significantl y.  Policymakers must worry about the financial \nsystem and markets because problems there can disrupt the financial intermediation on which market economies depend.\n1  When this happens the economy suffers, and the economic \nprospects of its participants.   \nGiven the severity of the recession that follo wed the recent financial crisis, it is crucial \nthat our financial infrastructure becomes res ilient enough so that financial intermediation can \ncontinue, regardless of a shock, without extraordinary interventi on from the public sector (the \ngovernment and, ultimately, taxpayers).  Du ring 2007 and 2008, the U.S. Congress, Treasury \ndepartment, Federal Deposit Insurance Cor poration, and the Federal Reserve all took \nextraordinary actions to avoid a more-severe fi nancial crisis and more damage to economic \nprospects.  Despite this unprecedented public-polic y response, the recession was long and severe \nand the recovery continues to be much slower than we would like.  And the United States was \nnot unique in this respect. Many foreign gove rnments and foreign cen tral banks also took \nunprecedented action to try to alle viate the effects of the financ ial crisis in their countries. \nParticularly noteworthy is how  many large global financial intermediaries experienced \nsevere distress.  These institutions play a vital role in the credit flows and financial \nintermediation that underpin the global economy.  They span national borders and presumably \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, October 19, 2011 at  8:30 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY  * \n \n \n3 \n have the ability to be better di versified across products and ge ographic locations than smaller \ninstitutions or intermediaries doi ng business in just one country.   \nBut because these global intermediaries are key players in many countries and in many \nfinancial markets, and because they are highly interconnected with other financial institutions, \nthey also serve as particularly efficient conductors  or transmitters of shocks in one area to the \nwider global financial system.  Unfortunately, such was the case  with the major shock caused by \nresidential real estate problems in the U.S.  Mo re recently it appears to be the case with the \nsovereign debt problems in Europe. \nAs you know, there have been significant legi slative and regulatory responses to the \nfinancial crisis that emerged in 2007.  In th e United States, the Dodd- Frank legislation made \nsignificant changes to frameworks for addressing systemically important financial institutions, \namong other things.  Internati onally, many of the impending Basel III rules are similarly \nintended to address some of the le ssons of the financial crisis.   \nI am very supportive of these efforts, but I suspect they can be strengthened and \nimproved.  Indeed some countries, such as the U.K. and Switzerland, are fairly far along in \nestablishing standards that are hi gher than those required by Basel III.  But in my view some \nsignificant challenges remain to be addressed if we are to have  a global banking system in which \nno institution is “too big to fail” given the collater al damage its disorderly demise would cause to \neconomies and citizens.   \nBefore the new domestic and international rules could be fully implemented, the world \nhas once again been buffeted by financial shocks , this time emanating in Europe.  And once \nagain large financial intermediaries, despite all th e positive roles they play in facilitating global \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, October 19, 2011 at  8:30 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY  * \n \n \n4 \n commerce, have been efficient in transmitting or  conducting the shocks.  As a result the world \neconomy has slowed, and stock prices of large financ ial intermediaries have fallen significantly.   \nOnce again, governments have started to inte rvene to mitigate global banking problems, \nwhich in turn may stress the debt burden of those governments, and could ultimately undermine the credit ratings of some countries.  While the full impact of sovereign debt problems and their \nimpact on large financial intermediaries will not be known for some time, it is apparent that the \nfinancial intermediaries encompass some vulnera bilities for the world financial system and the \nglobal economy. \n \nConsidering the Large Financial Intermediaries \nGiven the key role that large financial inte rmediaries played in the crisis of 2007 and \n2008, as well as their role in the problems that have arisen more recently, it is important to \nunderstand why financial intermediaries contribute vulnerabilities to  the global financial system.  \nSo I’d like to provide some background on the la rge intermediaries a nd their potential for \nconducting shocks aroun d the global economy. \nFigure 1  explores bank size relative to the size of  the home country, spec ifically the asset \nsize of the largest bank in each  country as a share of GDP.\n2  When financial intermediaries \nbecome large relative to the GDP of the home country, several potential challenges exist.3   First, \na large institution could essentiall y be “too big to save.”   Shou ld a global bank become insolvent \nand the home country need to recapita lize it – so that it can continue  its crucial role in financial \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, October 19, 2011 at  8:30 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY  * \n \n \n5 \n intermediation within the economy – then the sheer scale of the required equity capital could \nstrain a country trying to raise suffici ent funds to provide the equity.    \nConsider a hypothetical example.  A troubled two trillion dollar bank located in a country \nwhose GDP is also two trillion dollars would in all likelihood put  the country in a position of \nneeding to issue government debt to finance an e quity infusion.  If the government recapitalized \nthe bank with 10 percent more capital, the natio n’s debt to GDP ratio would increase by 10 \npercent.  If multiple banks failed at the same time,  the national debt to GDP ratio would rise even \nfurther.  Thus while government rescue of a bank may stem an individual institution’s crisis, it \ncan precipitate sovereign debt concerns. \nIreland’s recent experience is instructive.  The Irish banks were not among the world’s \nlargest financial intermediaries, but they were large relative to the size of their home country’s \neconomy.   Prior to its banking crisis, Ireland was a country with a relatively low debt to GDP, \nbut became a country with a high debt to GDP ratio – largely as  a result of providing emergency \nequity support for its troubled banking sector. \nNow I would like to dire ct your attention to Figure 2 , which shows the pricing on \nsovereign credit default swaps fo r a number of countries.  Cred it default swap (CDS) rates for \nmany countries are now very high by historical st andards – meaning the cost of insuring against \na sovereign default has risen appreciably.  While I know that thin trading in credit default swaps \nfor individual entities necessitates caution in their interpretation, the overall trend is clear.  A \ncountry needing to recapitalize on e or more of its financial intermediaries faces further fiscal \nstrain – potentially at a precarious time, when investors have already become more cautious \nabout trends in the countr y’s debt to GDP levels. \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, October 19, 2011 at  8:30 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY  * \n \n \n6 \n Another potential problem arises when investors have little confidence in a particular \nglobal bank or the home government.  In this cas e, simply recapitalizing the bank may not be \nsufficient to address concerns, and additional fina ncial support by the country may be necessary.  \nFor example if depositors rapidly withdraw their deposits from a troubled bank, the home \ncountry may need to support deposit holders in addition to providing equity (capital) – \nparticularly in countries wh ere deposit insurance regimes ar e not robust, or payment of \ndepositors’ claims is not timely.   \nWhat’s more, a failure to support the liabili ties of a troubled ba nk (in this case the \ndeposits) would poten tially destabilize other  banks in the country, even  those with relatively \nhealthy balance sheets.  Compared to simply in fusing capital, supporting lia bilities co uld require \nmuch larger expenditures by the home country and thus the home country would need to \ncontribute substantial additional funds. \nYet another issue concerns th e reliance of large financial intermediaries on so-called \nwholesale financing arrangements.  As you know, retail depositors are frequently covered (to \nvarying degrees) by deposit insurance, so in countries with credible deposit insurance \nframeworks, retail depositors cove red by insurance are less likely to  “run.”  In contrast, however, \nwholesale funds – such as very large certificat es of deposit, and commercial paper – tend to \nmove out of troubled banks relatively quickly.  Thus banks that depend heavily on wholesale \nfunding can potentially experien ce a fairly sudden liquidity crisis.  Such crises force \ngovernments to make quick decisions about prov iding support – decisions that have important \neconomic ramifications for their countries. \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, October 19, 2011 at  8:30 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY  * \n \n \n7 \n Discussing these concerns is not an esoteric exercise.  Figure 3  shows the average credit \ndefault swap spreads for largest financ ial intermediaries, in groups of five.4  As I just mentioned, \none needs to use caution in reading too much into credit default swap  rates – but they do indicate \nthat similar to credit default swap spreads on countries, financial firms around the world have \nseen a marked increase in CDS spreads.  Th e cost of insuring agai nst default has gone up \nsubstantially relative to the begi nning of the financial crisis.  Suffice to say for many banks, the \nrates remain quite elevated at present.   \nFigure 4  shows stock price declines  at the largest bank by count ry (and for countries with \nmore than one bank in the top 20 in assets, the d eclines are averaged).  Bank stock prices have \ndeclined substantially since the beginning of the year.  Many large financial intermediaries have \nexperienced significant declines and market pric es already reflect concerns with financial \nintermediaries outside and inside Europe.  Figure 5  provides stock-price data on the largest \ninstitutions in Europe and the U.S., again in gr oups of five, including th e average change from \nthe peak to the current level, and from the e nd of 2010 to the current level for each group of \nbanks. \n \nOutstanding Issues Related to Large Financial Intermediaries \nThe Basel III capital accord is designed to  reduce the risk that large financial \nintermediaries will become troubled and require government intervention.   While there are a \nvariety of proposed requirements in Basel III, two major initiativ es include potentially raising \ncapital requirements for systemically important institutions – to reduce the probability they \nbecome insolvent – and improving the ability of large financial intermediaries to withstand \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, October 19, 2011 at  8:30 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY  * \n \n \n8 \n liquidity shocks.  These are important and necess ary improvements, and the overall accord is an \nimportant step in the right dir ection.  Yet some important outs tanding issues remain to be \naddressed.  I would like to menti on some key ones, which of course are more interrelated than \nstand-alone. \n \n1. Resolution of large financial intermediaries  \nThe first outstanding issue involves the chal lenge of resolving a failing international \nfinancial institution.  Different countries ha ve very different bankruptcy frameworks and \nresolution arrangements, and these differences can  significantly impact who gets payment in a \nrestructuring.  These differences remain a major impediment to orderly resolution.5 \nAs seen in Figure 6, related to absolute pr iority in liquidation, there are significant \ndifferences across countries, particularly rela ted to the treatment of secured creditors and \nemployee claims.  These differences mean that the place where funds “reside” in a global organization will determine which creditors get pai d.  Knowing this, there is the potential for the \norganization in danger of failure to shift funds (pri or to closure) to coun tries where the treatment \nof particular classes of creditor s is favorable to the organization. \nA disorderly failure of a global financia l institution can be extremely damaging.  \nCreditors may not know which jurisdictions hold va luable assets.  They may be unclear on the \nprevailing bankruptcy rules, how these rules aff ect their positions, or how long their funds will \nbe tied up.  The situation surrounding  the failure of Lehmann Brothe rs is quite relevant here.  \nThree years after the bankruptcy, significant litiga tion continues.  Some creditors were impacted \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, October 19, 2011 at  8:30 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY  * \n \n \n9 \n by the movement of funds in the final days be fore bankruptcy, and many creditors still do not \nknow the amount they will recei ve or the timeframe in which they will be paid. \nThe failure of several Icela ndic banks also highlights th e problem.  While small by \ninternational standards, the tr oubled banks were large relative to the size of the Icelandic \neconomy.  Uncertainty about whethe r depositor claims (particular ly foreign depositors’ claims) \nwould be satisfied – and by whom – highlights the difficulties that can emerge when even \nrelatively small institutions fail. \nSuch uncertainty could provide depositors and creditors with a strong incentive to remove \nfunds from a troubled global financial instit ution.  This may mean that large financial \nintermediaries could be particularly susceptibl e to the rapid withdrawal of deposits due to \nuncertainty surrounding resolution.  Needless to say, th is is particularly probl ematic at a time of \nfinancial stress.   \nIdeally, international agreements would govern cross-border claims on global institutions.  \nHowever, as the table highlights, differences in  national views on which creditors should get the \nhighest priority make obtaining an  international agreement quite el usive, at least any time soon.  \nThere are fundamental legal and cultural diffe rences in national insolvency and resolution \nregimes – including differences in insolvency crit eria; which parties can initiate an insolvency \nproceeding; whether the debtor or an administrato r is in charge; the time for payment of claims; \nset-off and preference rules; and others.   \nWhile a uniform approach to creditor hi erarchy would arguably enhance financial \ninstitution resolution and financial stability efforts globally, the likelihood of harmonizing the \narray of entrenched national creditor hierarchies would seem to be unlikel y in the near term.  \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, October 19, 2011 at  8:30 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY  * \n \n \n10 \n Moreover, these differences are unique and import ant to individual countr ies.  Consequently, \ninterim or alternative measures seem appropriate.  But I hope I have helped illuminate a key \nchallenge that could make an orderly failure of a large institution potentially elusive. \n \n2. Wholesale financing of larg e financial intermediaries  \nA second outstanding issue involves large financ ial intermediaries’ re liance on wholesale \nfunding arrangements.  Many larg e financial intermediaries ra ise funds across international \nborders, so the location of their creditors may well differ from the location of their assets.  This \nsituation is quite prevalent among many large Eur opean banks that have raised funds in the \nshort-term credit markets for commercial paper a nd jumbo certificates of deposit, in order to \nfund longer-term assets either in the United States or elsewh ere in their global operations.6   \nBut this practice of raising s hort-term dollar liabilities to fund longer-term dollar assets \ncan make the financial institution less stable if gl obal creditors come to feel less certain about the \ninstitution’s prospects (or the prospects of a class of institutions).  In fact, Figure 7  shows that \nthe cost of raising dollar liab ilities through the use of forei gn exchange swaps has increased \nsubstantially this year – an indicator of  creditor concern about such institutions. \nThis reliance on wholesale liabilities – compar ed to retail liabilities like deposits that \nusually enjoy deposit insurance – makes a large financial intermediary more susceptible to \nliquidity pressures.  This is  precisely why the new Basel II I requirements devote significant \nattention to the liquidity a nd funding strategies of large financial intermediaries.   \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, October 19, 2011 at  8:30 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY  * \n \n \n11 \n Additionally, during periods of distress there is a natural incentive for regulators in a \ngiven country to “ring fence” some operations of a global bank within their borders – in other \nwords to prevent any bank assets from leav ing the country in order to maximize funding \navailable to meet their liabilities to domestic creditors.  Such a policy could make it difficult for \nlarge financial intermediaries to continue f unding – particularly wholesale funding – across \nnational borders.   \nAs long as the sources and uses of funds in  such situations differ because of national \nborders and related regulatory and legal requiremen ts, the ability to resolve a global bank will be \ncomplicated, giving rise to concer ns about the risks of broad fi nancial contagion.  I would add \nthat if we are to avoid future  crises and the need for extrao rdinary government intervention in \ncrises, then the issue of over-reliance on w holesale funding will need to be addressed.   \n 3. Protection of home country operations\n \nA third lingering issue concerns the prot ection of home count ry operations.  An \nalternative being explored in the United Ki ngdom and in Switzerland – areas with global \nfinancial intermediaries that are large relativ e to their economies – is whether in some \ncircumstances the public sector will only support the domestic operations of their banks.  By \nring-fencing responsibilities, the home country govern ment will be better able to forestall a crisis \nin their country.  However, other countries coul d be adversely affected  if subsidiaries and \nbranches in their jurisdiction must “fend for themselves.”  \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, October 19, 2011 at  8:30 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY  * \n \n \n12 \n Again, the Icelandic example highlights the problem of small countries supporting large \nfinancial intermediaries, and whether the hom e country and its regulatory authority and \ntaxpayers can be expected to be willing and able  to serve as a source of strength should the bank \nbe in danger of failing, or fail.  It is exactly these concerns that  have caused some countries to \nrequire that all branches of fo reign banks operating within thei r borders be supported by capital \n(sometimes referred to as full subsidiarization).   \nThe benefits of creating a subsidiary with  deposit insurance and access to the Federal \nHome Loan Bank system would likely change the nature of their U.S. operations.  By requiring \ncapital against all assets in the country, fina ncial firms are more likely to depend on a more \nstable mix of liabilities – includ ing retail deposits, wholesale fundi ng, and term debt – rather than \njust wholesale deposits.  And th e capital in the country would provide additional protection to \nmeet domestic claims should the global parent  become troubled.  Alternatively, the domestic \noperations would be more readily salable, which could potentially reduce the spread of \ndifficulties and limit the disruption of crucial fina ncial intermediation.  However, this solution \nalso comes at a cost – as risk management , liquidity management, capital management and \nregulatory requirements become more  costly to the parent, since all financial operations in a \ncountry are now subject to  the regulatory requiremen ts of that host country. \n 4. Reluctance to be proactive in re taining and raising additional capital \n \nA fourth outstanding issue involves the reluct ance of bank management or regulators to \nbe proactive in retaining and raising additiona l capital for an institution or for groups of \ninstitutions.  Basel III provides ne w restrictions on the ability of banks to pay dividends as their \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, October 19, 2011 at  8:30 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY  * \n \n \n13 \n capital becomes depleted.  However, book and re gulatory capital measures tend to be lagging \nindicators of the financial strength of the bank.  Some financial intermediaries have experienced \nlarge declines in share prices and large increases in the pricing on credit default swaps, but still \ncontinue to pay dividend s or buy back shares.   \nGiven the support of governments to large fina ncial intermediaries around the world in \n2008, a more proactive approach to  retaining capital within organi zations during times of stress \nis in my view warranted – a view I have expr essed a number of times in  various talks.  If \ntaxpayer funds in a country may be used to bolster  a bank due to its critica l role as a financial \nintermediary in the country’s economy, that step  should not manifest itself in paying scarce \nfunds to equity holders.   \nMoving to a structure where an institutio n’s dividends are deferred during times of \nfinancial stress would greatly facilitate the increa se of capital buffers at times when investors are \nconcerned with a given bank’s financial performan ce.  Using easily observable financial triggers, \nsuch as very substantial declines in a firm’s stock price, to  pause share repurch ases and dividends \nwould provide no additional information about th e institution’s financial strength – but would \nallow it to build up capital during times of stress.   \nThe amount of necessary government support fo r large financial institutions globally \nshould provide a strong incentive for the capital requirement aspects of Basel III.  In fact, it is \nnotable that proposals in both the U.K. and Switzerland are ca lling for significantly higher \ncapital requirements than in Basel III, to re duce the need for future  interventions by those \ngovernments.   \n \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, October 19, 2011 at  8:30 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY  * \n \n \n14 \n Concluding Observations \nIn conclusion, during 2008, governments around th e world were forced to intervene to \nprotect the global financial system.  The Dodd- Frank legislation provide d significant regulatory \ntools to address the “too big to fail” problem.  However, three years after the failure of Lehmann \nBrothers, there remain significant impediments to  avoiding the need for government intervention \nto protect large financial inte rmediaries.  Everyone knows that some large European financial \ninstitutions have of late encount ered problems. So it is  critical that we focus on strengthening the \nfinancial architecture, so that the struggles of one institution or a group of them no longer poses \nrisks to the broader global economy.   \nSignificant challenges remain to be addresse d if we are to have a global banking system \nwhere no bank is too big to fail given the collat eral damage it would cause to economies and \ncitizens.  I hope that this conference and others like it will be part of the important process of \naddressing these outstanding issues and challenges. \nThank you.  \n                                                             \n \n1 I discussed my definition of financial stability, and the implications of the definiti on, in a talk earlier this \nyear at the Stanford Financial Forum.  I noted that in my view “Financial stability reflects the ability of \nthe financial system to consistently supply the cred it intermediation and payment services that are needed \nin the real economy if it is to continue on its gr owth path.” And “Financial  instability occurs when \nproblems (or concerns about potential problems) within  institutions, markets, payments systems, or the \nfinancial system in general significantly impair th e supply of credit intermediation services – so as to \nsubstantially impact the expected path of real  economic activity.”  The talk is available at \nhttp://www.bostonfed.org/news/speeches /rosengren/2011/060311/index.htm. \n \n2 This includes the U.S., and all European countries with a bank ranked among the top 50 worldwide as of  \nDecember 31, 2010. \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, October 19, 2011 at  8:30 A.M.

Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY  * \n \n \n1 \n  \n \n \n“Higher Education and the Economy” \n  \nRemarks at New England Board of Higher Education’s “New \nEngland Works” Summit on Bri dging Higher Education and \nthe Workforce \n \n \nEric S. Rosengren \nPresident & Chief Executive Officer \nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston \n \n \nNovember 7, 2011 \nBoston, Massachusetts \n \n \n \n \n \nIt is a great pleasure to be with you today.  I want to welcome all of you to the Boston \nFed and especially commend all the educators in the room for the work that you do.  I benefited \nimmeasurably from my experience at Colby College as an undergraduate and at the University of \nWisconsin-Madison in graduate school.  I am pleas ed now to have the opportunity to “give back” \nto both schools, in that I se rve on an advisory committee for the economics department at \nMadison, and on Colby College’s Board of Trustees .  These experiences give me a window into \nsome of the daunting challenges that you face, part icularly in the current economic environment.   \nToday I want to spend a few minutes di scussing the nexus between what you do as \neducators and what I do as a centr al banker.  Like a central banke r should, let me first note that \n\n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Monday, November 7, 2011 at 8:30 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY  * \n \n \n2 \n my comments represent my perspectives, and no t necessarily those of my colleagues on the \nFederal Reserve’s Board of Governors or the Fe deral Open Market Committee.  Returning to \nthat nexus between what you and I do, at first glance it might seem as if there is not much \ncommonality.  A case in point – generally when se tting monetary policy, we assume we have \nlittle impact on demographic variables including the educational attainment of the workforce.1  \nNot that such variables are unimportant, by any st retch, because we all know that the educational \ncharacteristics of the workforce play an importa nt role in the dynamics of an economy.  A well-\neducated work force is likely to be more pr oductive, and highly skille d workers tend to have \nmuch lower unemployment rate s in economic downturns. \n On the other hand, as senior officials at  colleges and univers ities, you likely view \nmacroeconomic conditions as something you have little control over.  You focus instead on key matters like educating students, worrying about ra ising funds for the endowments that are a key \ningredient to financial aid, a nd affording new and engaging edu cational programs.  So while you \nmight take them as “given,” the recent rece ssion has only highlighted how economic conditions \naffect how you go about educating students. \nI would like to suggest, however, that what educators do matters to the Fed and what the \nFed does matters to educator s.  I’ll touch briefly on some of the reasons why. \nAs you all probably know, the monthly U.S. employment report was released last Friday.  \nThe unemployment rate is now 9.0 percent – a rate that remains stubbornly, and unacceptably, \nhigh.  The Federal Reserve has taken unprecedented actions to improve the growth rate in the \neconomy.  But economic “headwinds” – stemming from the previous financial crisis and \nconcerns about possible future financial shocks – have meant that despite Federal Reserve \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Monday, November 7, 2011 at 8:30 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY  * \n \n \n3 \n actions, economic growth has been lethargic an d job growth has been too slow to make \nsignificant inroads into reduci ng the unemployment rate.   \nHowever, underlying the average  unemployment statistic s are a vast range of \ncircumstances, depending on educational attainment.   \nToday I want to discuss some of those st atistics and propose that  as you and your peers \nare making admissions, financial aid, and retent ion-program decisions at your schools, you are \npowerfully shaping the outcomes for individuals – and society more generally.  I also want to \nemphasize that institutions represented in this  room play an important role in economic \ndevelopment in the communities in which you ar e located.  There are important synergies \nbetween communities and schools of higher educati on.  Schools are important anchors for their \ncommunities.  They provide good and stable jobs  for people in the area, and businesses that \nsupport the academic community benefit as well.  Th ey also bring in highly motivated students, \nsome of whom choose to use their education to  form businesses in the communities where they \nwere educated. And of course the schools benefi ts, in many ways, from their communities.   \n \nEducational Attainment and the Work Force \n It is stating the obvious, but educational attainment is one of the defining characteristics \nof a workforce.  Particularly in New England we  tend to have highly skilled and highly educated \nworkers.   \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Monday, November 7, 2011 at 8:30 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY  * \n \n \n4 \n I would like to take just a mo ment to show how educational attainment is important not \nonly to individuals, but also to the communitie s they inhabit.  In the current economic \nenvironment, the variation in unemployment by edu cational attainment is pa rticularly striking.   \nTo begin, let me draw your attention to Figure 1 .  As a result of a long and severe \nrecession, the unemployment rate has gone up dramatically for people in all categories of \neducational attainment, but no one will be surprise d to hear that the levels of unemployment are \ndramatically different depending on educational attainment.  Thos e with no high school diploma \nare experiencing more than three times the unemploym ent rate of those with at least a bachelor’s \ndegree.   While the current unemployment rate is  9.0 percent percent, for those with at least a \ncollege education it is only 4.4 percent.    \nIt is important to note that while the leve l of unemployment has va ried by educational \nattainment, Figure 1 is not supportive of what  economists call a “structural” unemployment \nexplanation for persistently high unemployment – such as when th ere are lots of open jobs that \ncannot be filled because the available workers ha ve the wrong skill sets for those positions.  As \nyou may know, evidence of a change in the struct ural level of unemployment has been a matter \nof significant debate among economists and pol icymakers.  Figure 1 might provide some \nevidence that structural unemployment was a pr oblem if, for example, unemployment had risen \ndramatically for lower-skilled workers but there wa s a shortage of highly sk illed workers (that is, \ntheir unemployment rate had fallen).  \nStimulating an economy where most of the unemployment is structural would place \nadditional demand on high-skilled jobs – causing  rapid increases in compensation for those \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Monday, November 7, 2011 at 8:30 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY  * \n \n \n5 \n workers without generating improvement in the overall unemployment ra te, as the supply of \nhighly educated workers would be slow to respond.   \nBut we see quite the opposite right now, because people at all levels of educational \nattainment have experienced a substantia l increase in unemployment, as shown in Figure 2 .  In \nfact, if one compares the percentage increas e in unemployment by category of educational \nattainment, it is striking what a high percentage increase in un employment has occurred in each  \ncategory.  This is consistent not with the “m ismatch” dynamic of structural unemployment but \nwith a story of weak demand  throughout  the economy.   \nOn this subject I would recommend a recen t paper by economists Bob Triest and Bill \nDickens, presented last month at the Boston Fed’s annual economi c conference.  They provide \nimportant evidence on employment flows – eviden ce that is consistent with most of the \nunemployment being driven by inadequate demand, rather than structural problems.2 \nA look at the compensation data in Figure 3  provides additional evidence that structural \nunemployment cannot explain the persistently high unemployment rate.  If most of the current \nunemployment were structural, we  would expect to see compen sation increasing as employers \nbid for scarce high-skilled workers.  But as th e figure shows, compensation growth has slowed, \nand remains quite low relative to compen sation over the past 30 years.   \nSimilarly, Figure 4  shows there has been no great di vergence in compensation trends \nacross occupations.  If a skills mi smatch existed, one would exp ect wages in the sectors where \nsupply is short to be accelerating, while wages would be declining in sectors where there was \nexcess labor supply.  We do not see this happeni ng.  Growth in compensation for management \nand professionals – presumably a higher skilled occupational category – has not shown evidence \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Monday, November 7, 2011 at 8:30 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY  * \n \n \n6 \n of sharp acceleration relative to occupations that one would pres ume have somewhat lower skill \nrequirements, such as work in natural re sources, construction, and maintenance.   \nIn fact, Figure 5  presents the increase in labor costs over the past nine quarters (since the \nbeginning of the recovery) by occupation, and it does not show dramatically different growth in \ncompensation by job type.  In fact, management  and professional occupations have seen \ncompensation grow less than workers in natura l resources, constructi on, and maintenance over \nthese nine quarters of recovery.   \nThis is just some of the evidence that suggests why the notion of rising structural \nunemployment cannot explain th e high aggregate unemployment rate we are unfortunately \nexperiencing.  This distinction is very impor tant to the policy response.  Of course, for \nindividuals it should be noted that employment prospects ar e significantly improved with \neducational attainment. \nBut educational attainment affects far more than just employment prospects.  The left-\nhand chart in Figure 6  shows the relationship between median household income and \neducational attainment.  While the median in come of all households is approximately $50,000, \nthere are substantial differences based on edu cational attainment.  Those with no high school \ndiploma have less than half the median income, and those with just a high school diploma (no \ncollege experience) have about three-quarter s of the median income.  And those with \nprofessional degrees have more than twice the median income.   \nAnd the right panel of the figure shows that growth in median income over the past two \ndecades also varies substantially by educational a ttainment.  For example, those with only a high \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Monday, November 7, 2011 at 8:30 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY  * \n \n \n7 \n school education have experienced  a significant decline in median  real income where the most \nrapid growth has been for those that have  received doctorate or master’s degrees. \n Figure 7  shows that educational attainment also translates into significant differences in \nnet worth.  Those with college degrees have more than triple the net wort h of those that do not.  \nOver the last two decades, those with college degr ees have had a significant increase in their real \nnet worth – while in contrast, those with no hi gh school diploma have substantially less net \nworth, and their real net worth has declined over  the past two decades.  Of course, the causation \ncan work in both directions here, especially with regard to inheri ted net worth – that is, parental \nwealth makes it easier to afford higher education. \n \nThe Implications \n Figure 8  shows that the U.S. workforce is beco ming more educated.  There has been a \nsubstantial increase in the number of people in the workforce that have a bachelor’s degree or \nhigher.  Given the employment, income, and net wo rth differentials shown in earlier charts, it is \nnot surprising that an increasing number of hi gh school students are re alizing that higher \neducational attainment is in their interest.   \nHowever, underlying this positive trend are sh arp differences across racial categories.  \nFigure 9  shows that educational attainment diffe rs substantially by race.  While Asian \nindividuals have been particul arly successful in obtaining colle ge degrees, African-Americans \nand Hispanics in the labor force significantly la g in educational attain ment.  This lack of \neducation makes it much more difficult for them  to maximize their potential, given the evolving \nwork-force needs in the US economy. \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Monday, November 7, 2011 at 8:30 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY  * \n \n \n8 \n  I think there are a number of potential impli cations for educational leaders from this \nanalysis.  As you consider whom to admit, how  much of an endowment to spend to provide \nfinancial aid, whether financial ai d should be in the form of grants  or loans, and how those scarce \nfunds should be allocated, I would urge you to k eep in mind that you are making choices that are \nnot only important for individuals but for societ y more generally.  And I would urge public \npolicymakers to keep similar notions in mind when they consider budgetary investments in public and community institutions.     \nIndeed, income and net worth differences are highly related to educational attainment, as \nI have shown.  Insuring that children have ad equate preparation, from  early childhood education \nthrough high school, is critically important.  A nd it is critical that t hose whose families have \nlimited financial means are not shut out from the opportunities an education provides.  In short, \nfinding ways to encourage greater educational a ttainment – particularly for low and moderate \nincome families and those racial groups that have traditionally been underrepresented – will be \nan important determinant of the quality of the U. S. work force and the income distribution in our \ncountry. \n Similarly, many of your instituti ons are in cities that have been hard hit by the economic \ndownturn and tepid recovery, making it even more  important – to a macroeconomic policymaker \n– that you reach out to affect ed communities, and view your institutions as anchors of \ncommunity economic development.  Certainly the location of this conference, in Boston, \nhighlights the tangible benefits that can accrue to a community when it has great colleges, and \ncollege leaders that take the development of their communities seriously. \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Monday, November 7, 2011 at 8:30 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY  * \n \n \n9 \n  Finally, I am pleased to note that many sc hools have become better at bridging their \nstudents to the working world.  I would strongly  encourage using alumni networks and other \nresources to provide students with internship  opportunities.  A vibrant New England needs a \nvibrant work force, and internship s can be an important way for co mmunities to attract and retain \ntop talent.   \nHelping the region attract and retain talented  college students is one reason the Boston \nFed partnered with the Greater Boston Chambe r of Commerce to provid e a better clearinghouse \nfor college internships in the Boston area.  I would encourage your institutions’ career offices to \ndirect students looking for internship opportuni ties to the web site that has been set up.3  We and \nour partners hope it will continue  to grow and provide many oppor tunities in the greater Boston \narea over time. \n I have described the Boston Fed’s research  that highlights the important role that \neducation plays in our regional development.  Le t me touch briefly on other policy work that we \ndo and describe what is currently a major concern to us.  At the Boston Fed it is central to our \nmission to explore ways that U.S. monetary policy – entrusted by C ongress to the Federal \nReserve System – can promote maximum employmen t with stable prices.  My own forecast is \nthat inflation is likely to be below 2 percent over the next several years, in part because of the \nvery weak labor markets.  Given the very weak  labor market conditions and the low expected \ninflation rate, the Federal Reserve should in my view continue to take action to aggressively try \nto reduce the stubbornly high U.S. unemployment rate. \nBut clearly the Federal Reserve cannot do it alone.  Given the sobering macroeconomic \nsituation, it is important that fiscal policy, cont rolled by the federal government and the states, do \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Monday, November 7, 2011 at 8:30 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY  * \n \n \n10 \n its part.  It is also important for international policy makers to take actions that provide more \nstable world markets.  But at the same time, in  my view the Federal Reserve should continue to \nuse the tools at its disposal to boost demand in the economy.  And at the same time, we would do \nwell to work on addressing any impediments to  students getting the employment opportunities \nthat will serve them, their comm unities, and the macroeconomy. \nIt is a pleasure to be here with you today, and to take a fe w minutes to explore the nexus \nbetween higher education and the macroeconomy.  Thank you for having me. \n \n                                                             \n \nNOTES: \n \n1 I am aware, of course, that invest ment in human capital through schooling may have a degree of sensitivity to \ninterest rates. \n \n2 See their paper at http://www.bostonfed.org/eco nomic/conf/LTE2011/pape rs/dickens-triest.pdf .

As you all know , Chip is one of the country’s \nleading experts on real es tate – an area that has been the fo cus of much attention and a lot of \ndifficulties over the last few years.   \nNormally when giving a talk I try to focu s on an important element of the economic \noutlook, or an important policy action the Federal Reserve has recently taken – and I use data to \nexplain the issue and its relevance.   \n\n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, November 16, 2011 at  12:40 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY  * \n \n \n \n \n \n \n2 \n Today, however, I am going to take a different ta ck.  I still want to us e data – never fear – \nbut for a somewhat different reason.   \nAs you know, ever since the financial crisis , the Federal Reserve has been lauded by \nsome for its bold actions and criticized by others .  This comes with the territory of being the \nnation’s central bank.  Certainly much of the cr iticism stems from an economy that is very \ndifficult for many citizens.  And importantly, some of the criticism is deserved – and we at the \nFed truly try to learn wh en we do fall short.   \nBut some of the criticism stems from wh at I’ll call some “common misconceptions” or \nassumptions about the Fed.1  Today I would like to offer a pl ainspoken defense to some of those \ncommon misconceptions.  A defense rooted in fact s and numbers, to be sure – my rhetorical \nskills may not win over Fed critics, but the f acts and numbers may help them and others \nunderstand how the Fed actually operates. \nLet me acknowledge, of course, that as importa nt and illuminating as they are, facts and \ndata do not capture the emotion and the frustratio n of these challenging economic times.  At the \nFed we appreciate the widespread frustration st emming from the financia l crisis, the recession, \nand the anemic recovery.  But to go forward a nd tangibly improve things, we must use facts to \nguide our work, and must do a better job of shari ng key facts and the data that underlie how and \nwhy the Fed takes the steps it does. \nLet me add as I always do that my comments  reflect my perspec tives, not necessarily \nthose of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee or the Fed’s Board of Governors. \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, November 16, 2011 at  12:40 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY  * \n \n \n \n \n \n \n3 \n In recent years the U.S. central bank has taken unusual steps to combat a threatening \nfinancial crisis, a severe recession, and a disappoin ting recovery.  By no means were we perfect, \nbut we acted in the public’s inte rest and I’m very supportive of the strong steps taken.  I would \npoint out that the U.S. experience in the 1920s  and 1930s, and Japan’s experience in recent \ndecades, show the even more dramatic economic pain that comes when central banks and national governments act less than forcefully, or declar e the crisis over too soon. \nHowever, the extraordinary steps the Fed has taken over the last four  years have led to \nsome misconceptions and mistaken assumptions.  Central banking and monetary policy are not \neasy to explain, but the Fed could have done a better job of it.  But at the end of the day we’ve \nseen the creation of certain misconceptions, not supported by facts, about the U.S. central bank \nas an institution.  The best way to address a mi sconception is to offer up the facts.  So today I \nplan to address some of the misconceived a ssumptions about the Federal Reserve and our \nactions. \nIt is not surprising the Fede ral Reserve and other central banks have received an unusual \namount of attention of late.  We  are experiencing historic times , and an unusual confluence of \nevents.  We experienced a global financial crisis which underlined the fact that financial markets \nand financial institutions have a si gnificant impact on the real econom y and all of its participants.  \nWe have seen in dramatic fashion how increased  global interconnectedness , despite its benefits, \nallows problems to quickly move across natio nal borders.  As a case in point, witness the \nreactions of our own U.S. financial markets to actions occurring, or not occurring, in Greece – a \ncountry of less than 11 million people, roughly th e size of Ohio – and other countries.  Add to \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, November 16, 2011 at  12:40 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY  * \n \n \n \n \n \n \n4 \n this the fact that, both  here and abroad, fiscal problems ha ve increasingly limited the response we \nwould normally expect in a severe economic do wnturn and a painfully slow recovery.   \nThese events, taken together, have made for ecasting the future path  of the economy quite \nchallenging – and should instill humility about pred icting the future, or how future shocks could \nimpact the domestic or world economy. \n In response to the crises, the Federal Rese rve has been forceful in trying to promote \ngrowth and thus reduce the unemployment rate, wh ile achieving core inflation rates close to 2 \npercent.  Other central banks have too.  Central banks2 have attempted to fight the crisis and \ndownturn by dramatically increa sing their balance sheets (see Figure 1 ), buying non-traditional \nassets, and pushing short and long-term rates to  new lows to try to create conditions that \nstimulate economic activity.   \nUnfortunately, the creative and forceful response of many central banks to a bad \neconomic situation has not often been matched by fi scal policymakers and international officials.   \nCentral banks cannot address these economic problems on their own.  They can mitigate some of the problems by reducing the cost of credit to in dividuals and businesses.  And make no mistake, \nwhile the scale of the problem is great, that should not dissuade us  from actions that make even \njust “a dent.”  For instance, an action that re duces the unemployment rate  by half a percent does \nnot bring us close to full em ployment, and does not solve the country’s problems, but \nnonetheless would perhaps create roughly 750,000 jobs  that may not have been created in the \nabsence of the action.  \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, November 16, 2011 at  12:40 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY  * \n \n \n \n \n \n \n5 \n Federal Reserve actions alone cannot solve a ll the problems affecting the domestic and \nworld economy.  But the Fed can carefully weigh the costs and benefits of actions, and where \nactions can move us closer to better economic  outcomes without substa ntial costs, it can and \nshould take action.  In fact, that’s  exactly what the Fed has been doing, and that is exactly what it \nshould be doing – consistent with  the dual mandate given to us by Congress, to do what we can \nto achieve maximum sustainable employm ent consistent with stable prices. \nWith that introduction, allow me now to disc uss four common misconceptions about the \nFed.  To give you an overview, the four assumptions or misconceptions are as follows: \n• The Federal Reserve is not audited and its actions occur without oversight \n• The Federal Reserve is not a transparent organization \n• “Printing money” has caused serious inflation \n• Rates are already low so further moneta ry policy actions wi ll have no impact on the \neconomy \nThere are of course a number of other issu es we could discuss, but I think these are \nimportant and involve plenty for us to cover today. \n \nCommon Misconception 1:  The Federal Reserve is not audited a nd its actions occur without oversight \n \n In recent years there have been those a dvocating that the Federal Reserve should be \naudited.  They are right in that the Fed should be audited – but they  are mistaken in believing that \nthe Fed is not.  In truth the Fed is a heavily a udited organization subject to substantial oversight.  \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, November 16, 2011 at  12:40 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY  * \n \n \n \n \n \n \n6 \n This is entirely appropriate given the sensitivit y of what central banks do, and the need to do it \nwithout reproach.   \nIn truth, \n• all twelve Federal Reserve Banks em ploy professional internal auditors; \n• an outside audit firm, Deloitte & Touc he, audits our financial statements; \n• the Federal Reserve’s Inspector General, cr eated by Congress, aud its our activities; \n• the U.S. Government Accountability  Office audits our actions, and  \n• Congress, which created the Federal Reserv e System, provides si gnificant oversight \nregarding Fed actions, as demonstrated by frequent requests to testify before \ncommittees – and by legislation over th e years that has altered our role.3   \nBut as one who loves data and facts, let me say a bit more to be quite specific on this \nmatter. \n We produce an annual report that  includes audited financial st atements and a letter from \nme as CEO attesting to effective internal contro ls, based on the work of our internal audit and \nrisk-management teams.  We include a letter fr om Deloitte & Touche at testing that we have \nmaintained in all material respects effective internal control over financial reporting. \n We are also audited by the Office of Inspect or General, created by Congress to provide \nindependent oversight over the Federal Rese rve – with the power to do investigations, \ninspections, audits, and reports.  The Inspector General reports to Congr ess semi-annually – the \nmost recent report covers activities th rough March and is available on the web.4   \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, November 16, 2011 at  12:40 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY  * \n \n \n \n \n \n \n7 \n In Figure 2,  I list some of the reports by the Inspect or General over the past year, all of \nwhich are available on the Board’s web site.   As  you can see, the reports cover a wide range of \ntopics.   \nWe are also audited by the U.S. Govern ment Accountability Office (GAO), which \nconducts audits, investigations, inspections, and re ports on behalf of Congre ss.  These reports are \npublicly available on the GAO web site.  Figure 3  shows some of the GAO reports done in the \npast year regarding a wide variet y of Federal Reserve activities.   As with the Inspector General \nreports, one GAO report covers the operations of  the Fed’s emergency liquidity facilities, \nincluding the one run at the Bost on Fed on behalf of the System.5   \n And we have direct oversight by Congress,  which requests testimony on a wide range of \ntopics.  Figure 4  lists some of the recent Congre ssional testimony provided by the Fed’s \nGovernors, all of which are available on the Boar d website.  For the sake of brevity this figure \ndoes not include the testimony of staff other than Governors.  Naturally, Congressional hearings \ninclude extensive questioning concer ning our actions and policies.   \nWe are an entity created by Congress.  C ongress can and does change our roles and \nresponsibilities over time.  A good example is th e Dodd-Frank legislation which increased our \nresponsibilities in some areas (like savings and loan holding company supervision) and curtailed \nour role in others (such as lending in “emergency and exigent” circumstances). \n So in sum we are a heavily audi ted and supervised organization.   \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, November 16, 2011 at  12:40 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY  * \n \n \n \n \n \n \n8 \n However, I suspect that some  who argue for more audits of the Federal Reserve may \nactually be advocating for the politicization of monetary po licy.  The Federal Reserve was \ndesigned by Congress to be a non-partisan organi zation that conducts mo netary policy in the \npublic interest free of pol itical influence.  Good m onetary policy in the pu blic’s long-run interest \ncan involve unpopular decisions in the short run – such as the Vo lcker-era effort to rein in \ninflation using very high interest rates.  Ce ntral banks in developed countries have become \nindependent of legislative bodies and the chief executive precisely because monetary policy has \nbeen shown to result in better economic outcomes (e.g., growth, a nd price stability) when it is \nnot influenced by partisan politics.   \nI strongly believe that offici als in the Federal Reserve c onduct policy without regard to \npartisan politics, and to the best of their abilities try to administ er monetary policy in the national \ninterest.  This is a hallmark of our  organization and should not change. \nIn sum, the common misconception is that th e Federal Reserve is not audited and its \nactions occur without oversight.  The fact is that the Fed is widely audited, and is subject to \nrobust oversight – which is as it should be.6 \n \nCommon Misconception 2: The Federal Reserve is not a transparent organization  \n When I first joined the Federal Reserve 25 y ears ago, the lack of tr ansparency was a very \nvalid criticism of the Fed and most other central  banks.  However, the fact is that much has \nchanged in the last 25 years – and particularly in recent years.  \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, November 16, 2011 at  12:40 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY  * \n \n \n \n \n \n \n9 \n Let me admit that in the midst of the financia l crisis in the fall of 2008 one could fairly \nsay that we did not spend sufficient time explai ning to the public the unique and extraordinary \nactions being taken.  All I can say is that in the midst of the crisis there was a focus on solutions, \nand given the severity of the situation, this resulted in our spending less time communicating \nwell about what we were doing a nd why.  Though no excuse, reacting to a crisis in real time \neffectively requires something else “give” – and we were frankly so preoccupied with \nextinguishing the fire we did not explain as we ll as we should have wh at we were doing and \nwhy.  At the Fed we have tried since to explain precisely what we did and why, but we are still \nsome distance from being understood, or fully trusted for that matter. \nI think the Fed has learned from this.  I would argue that at this poi nt our organization has \nshifted a great deal compared to two years ago, and at this point we ar e quite transparent and \ngetting better at it in time. \n When I started at the Fed there was no explic it mention of our federal funds target after \nFederal Open Market Committee meetings, no mi nutes of the meetings, and no transcript \nreleased with a five-year lag.  The minutes we  provide now are quite detailed, providing a \nsummary of staff presentations, di scussion of the views of all participants regarding the outlook \nfor the economy, and discussion of the de bate around the policy recommendation.    \nIn addition, we have started providing economic projections after each scheduled two-day \nmeeting – currently four times a year.  This pr ovides a summary of the forecasts by the twelve \nReserve Bank presidents and the Governors (currently there are five); on variables related to \ninflation, unemployment, and the growth rate of GDP.  We provide both the range of forecasts \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, November 16, 2011 at  12:40 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY  * \n \n \n \n \n \n \n10 \n and the central tendency of the forecasts.  And the Fed is continuing to review its \ncommunications practices to en sure accountability and increa se public understanding.   \nAlso, after the four two-day FOMC mee tings the Chairman now conducts a press \nconference.  He fully describes re cent policy decisions and the forecas ts of the participants in the \nFOMC meeting, and answers questions pos ed by members of the press.    \n And the Federal Reserve has also been communicating more directly with the public.  \nThe Chairman has participated in a variety of  what for central bankers are less traditional \nopportunities, from “60 Minutes” to various town  hall style meetings, including one last week \nwith soldiers and their families on base in Texas.    \nThe role of the Reserve Bank presidents has also evolved.  Figure 5  lists the speeches I \nhave given this year that like today’s include a published text, charts, and an invitation to \nmembers of the media.  The text and slides of  this speech are availabl e to anyone on our public \nweb site.  When we can, we make video summarie s available as well.  We  “tweet” some of the \nmain points.7  And at the end of the speech I will be  answering whatever questions you would \nlike to raise.   \nI also give a variety of informal talks that generally provide condensed versions of some \nof my previous public speeches.  In addition, I have from time to time had interviews with \nmembers of the media working in print, radio, and TV.  And I am not alone in this respect.  My \npeers have similarly been tryi ng to communicate more about actio ns we are taking on a range of \nissues, from monetary policy to supervisory policy to financial st ability.  We do not always agree \non policy matters and this in itself is an indicator of transparency. \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, November 16, 2011 at  12:40 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY  * \n \n \n \n \n \n \n11 \n  Also, there are some areas in which the Fede ral Reserve is now bei ng more transparent – \nin part with the encouragement of Congress.  The emergency facility lo ans we made during the \ncrisis are listed on our web site, and inform ation on “Discount Window” loans to banks are \nprovided with a lag.   \nThe reason for this lag is straightforward – not  secret for secrecy’s sake.  As a lender of \nlast resort concerned about fina ncial stability and the continua tion of lending during times of \nfinancial turbulence, you want in stitutions that are in generally sound financial condition to turn \nto the central bank when there is  a temporary shortage of liquid ity in the banking system – in \nother words when they have liquidity  but not solvency  problems.  In the pa rlance of monetary \npolicymaking, this prevents interest rates from rising significantly during a financial disruption.8   \nHowever, immediate disclosure might cause fi nancial institutions to view loans from the \nFed as stigmatized, possibly raising concerns with depositors and investors, and further \ncontributing to liquidity problems.  The Dodd-Fr ank legislation wrestled with this issue and \ncame up with what I view as a reasonable solu tion – disclosure of Discount Window loans after \ntwo years. \n So I fully acknowledge that the Federal Rese rve has not always been very transparent – \nbut feel very comfortable attesti ng that there has been a rather dr amatic change over the last two \ndecades, and in particular over the last few years.  While we at the Fed continue to examine ways \nto better explain and describe monetary polic y and other aspects of central banking, I would \nsuggest that there are now regular opportunities to hear from Federa l Reserve officials directly or \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, November 16, 2011 at  12:40 P.M.

The fact is that we are quite an op en central bank – much better than we used to be \n– and are improving in this area even as we speak. \n \nCommon Misconception 3: “Printing money” has caus ed serious inflation \n \n Figure 6  highlights that both bank re serves and the total assets of the Federal Reserve \nhave grown substantially during the crisis, recessi on, and anemic recovery – with the most rapid \nexpansion occurring in the fall of 2008.  The asse t expansion is broken out in more detail in \nFigure 7 .  In the wake of the failure of Lehman Brot hers and the freezing up of short-term credit \nmarkets, the Federal Reserve established a variet y of emergency liquidity facilities.  Something \nthat is frequently overlooked is that over time all the loans were paid back with interest and the \nfacilities have been closed.  The size of the Fed’s balance sheet ha s still continued to grow, as a \nresult of our large-scale purchases of Treasury and mortgage-backed secu rities – policy actions \nwe took given the weak economy and our primar y policy rate hitting the lower bound of near \nzero.   \nHowever, while the most rapid growth in reserves occurred three years ago, Figure 8  \nshows that over the three-year period ending last quarter the U. S. has experienced the lowest \naverage inflation rate of any such  period over the past th irty years.  Over the past three years, \ntotal personal consumption expenditures (PCE\n9) inflation has averaged only 1.2 percent.   \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, November 16, 2011 at  12:40 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY  * \n \n \n \n \n \n \n13 \n Figure 9  shows that in only two of the five most  recent three-year periods has total PCE \ninflation been above 2 percent – and these two pe riods were ones where food and energy shocks \noccurred.   \nWe have indeed expanded our balance sheet – some call that “printi ng money” – but it is \na misconception that it has resu lted in significant inflation. \n The reason why this is so is shown in Figure 10 , which depicts loan growth at \ncommercial banks over the same three-year periods.   Anemic loan growth in the credit crunch \nera of the early 1990s is one outlier on the char t, and the negative growth in the most recent \nthree-year period is another.  In the recent period  banks have become more risk averse, and have \nfocused (appropriately) on rebui lding their capital – while many borrowers have had their \nborrowing capacity weakened by the difficult business conditions of a severe recession and slow recovery.  The end result is cu rtailed lending.  Bank reserves are not going to be inflationary \nwhen bank lending is not expanding.\n10   \n Let me be quick to stress that inflation woul d be serious and detrimental at higher levels.  \nI am not suggesting otherwise.  I am just pointing out some facts that sugges t it is currently very \nrestrained. \nIndeed, other market indicators show little ev idence of concern over inflation.  The 10- \nyear U.S. Treasury bond has fallen to  around 2 percent, as shown in Figure 11 .  Similarly, other \ncountries where the central banks have expande d their balance sheets to fight the anemic \neconomic conditions also have very low 10-year  government bond rates.   Evidently investors \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, November 16, 2011 at  12:40 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY  * \n \n \n \n \n \n \n14 \n are not expecting large increases in inflati on, or they would demand much higher rates to \npurchase long-term securities.   \nAs everyone knows, high unemployment goes hand in hand with wages and salaries \ngrowing very slowly, at least for most jobs.  Given the current c onditions in the job market, there \nis little upward pressure on wages and salaries – and this means that there is little reason to \nexpect significant inflationary pressures as highe r labor costs push up higher end prices.  I would \nadd that while measures of money such as M211 have grown rapidly of late, much of that growth \nreflects investor risk aversion – investors move d funds to bank accounts during the debt ceiling \ndiscussion in August and in light of the European problems that have emerged more recently. \nFinally, I would note that one country where the central bank expanded its balance sheet \nsignificantly, some time ago, is Japan.  The Ja panese central bank bega n expanding its balance \nsheet more than a decade ago but rather than experiencing rapid inflation, they have been \nconcerned with deflation, as shown in Figure 12 .  Deflation – which is not my forecast at this \npoint, let me say – can be extremely difficult to overcome, as consumers expect products will be \ncheaper in the future, wages and salaries declin e, and debtors face high real interest rates. \nMake no mistake, the Federal Reserve will need to remove its current policy \naccommodation as the economy improves.  The cu rrent level of bank re serves would not be \nappropriate if we were at fu ll employment – such accommodation would indeed be inflationary \nin that situation.  However, that is not the situ ation the country is in now , and I fully expect we \nwill remove accommodation appropriately as the economy improves. \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, November 16, 2011 at  12:40 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY  * \n \n \n \n \n \n \n15 \n In sum, the common misconception is that “pri nting money” has caused serious inflation.  \nThe fact is that inflation has remained extrem ely restrained during this period of accommodative \nmonetary policy necessitated by economic conditions.  \n \nCommon Misconception 4: Rates are already low so further monetary po licy actions will have no impact on the \neconomy  \n The empirical evidence shows that Fed purch ases of Treasury and MBS securities did \ncause market interest rates to fall.  While rate s can be impacted by a variety of factors – for \nexample if the economy were to show signs of ra pid growth you would expect  rates to rise – 10-\nyear rates now are much lower than they  were before we unde rtook our actions.   \n It is unlikely that lower rates would have no impact on the economy.  Such an assumption \nwould be quite a leap of faith, because in general further lowering rates would:\n  \n  \n• impact home purchases – because lower rate s can have a big impact on cash flow of \nconsumers; \n• impact consumer durables like cars – because  auto-loan rates are one of the largest \npayments many people make each month; \n• impact investment – because lower rates im prove the potential benefit (the net present \nvalue) of investment projects; \n• impact exchange rates and foreign trade – as suggested by the complaints heard from \nsome trading partners when the Fe d has previously lowered rates; \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, November 16, 2011 at  12:40 P.M.

Research by my colleague Giovanni Olivei \nhas found that prior to the cris is our statistical model of th e economy would imply that a \nsustained decline in the 10-year Treasury rate of 100 basis points would lead to a cumulative \nincrease in real GDP over two year s of approximately 2.5 percent.   \nWith the reduction in interest sensitivity in housing more recently, the model would \nimply that a sustained decline in the 10-year Trea sury rate of 100 basis points would now lead to \na cumulative increase in real GDP over two year s of approximately 2 percent – as shown in \nFigure 13 .12  Concerns with falling prices, high unem ployment, and limited access to credit have \nlikely all contributed to this lower – but clearly non-zero – re sponse to lower rates in housing \nmarkets.13  The assertion that our rate actions simp ly will have no impact is not supported by our \nstatistical work. \nIn sum, the common misconception is that ra tes are already low so further monetary \npolicy actions will have no impact on the economy.  In fact, statistical analysis suggests the \nopposite. \n \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, November 16, 2011 at  12:40 P.M.

We had significant \nfinancial shocks that impacted the real economy during the crisis and recession, and we remain at \nrisk that financial shocks  here or abroad could s till impact our economy.   \nThe Federal Reserve, like other central ba nks, has taken strong action to mitigate the \nimpact and avoid worse outcomes for the economy.  As stated at the outset of my talk, the Fed’s \nactions have mitigated problems but we alone ca nnot quickly restore full employment.  That will \ntake time and appropriate actions by internationa l policymakers, U.S. fiscal policymakers, and \nmonetary policymakers.   \nThank you for indulging me today as I di scussed some common misconceptions about \nthe Federal Reserve.  In sum, I believe the fact s show that the Fed rema ins an organization with \nsignificant oversight, which has s ubstantially increased its transp arency, and continues to pursue \nactions consistent with our Congressional mandate to  work to the best of our ability to achieve \nmaximum employment consistent with st able prices, in the national interest. \nThank you, and I would be happy to  take a few questions now. \n \n                                                             \n \nNOTES:  \n \n1 The American Heritage Dictionary’s primary definiti on of a misconception is “An incorrect interpretation or \nunderstanding.”  I am also thinking of assumptions, which the same dictionary defines as “a statement accepted or \nsupposed true without proof or demonstration.” \n \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, November 16, 2011 at  12:40 P.M.

In contrast, the CPI measures the out-of-pocket \nexpenditures of urban households, a smaller set of items than  the set covered by the PCE. The two indices also differ \nin the basket of items included in the PCE is chain-weighted  – that is, it changes from quarter to quarter – while the \ncomposition of the CPI basket remains fixed.” \n  \n10 What we call the money multiplier – whereby reserves ge nerate lending (bank assets) which generates deposits \n(bank liabilities) that are counted as money – has been severed by the decline in lending.    \n \n11 For a definition of M2 see the Monetary Policy Report to the Congress  \n(http://www.federalreserve.gov/monetary policy/files/20110713_mprfullreport.pdf ) July 13, 2011 – page 37 \n(footnote 13). \n  \n12 Forthcoming in a research brief entitled \"The Sensitivity of Demand to Interest Rate Changes: Has It Changed \nRecently?\" by Vice President an d economist Giovanni Olivei. \n \n \n13 Tests on other components of the for ecast cannot reject that the coefficien ts we use to model the economy have \nnot changed.   \n\nFour Common Misconceptions \nAbout the Federal Reserve  \nEric S.
