        "content": "EMBARGOED UNTIL  \n11:30 A.M. Eastern Time on  \nWednesday, January 9, 2019 OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \nThe views expressed today are my own, not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal Reserve Board of \nGovernors or the Federal Open Market Committee.    \n   \n \n   \n \n“Perspectives on Monetary Policy  \nand Market Volatility ” \n \n \nEric S. Rosengren  \nPresident & Chief Executive Officer  \nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston  \n \n \nThe Boston Economic Club  \n \n \nBoston, Massachusetts  \nJanuary 9, 2019  \n \n \n \n\n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 11:30 A.M. on Wednesday, January 9, 201 9 U.S. Eastern Time, OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n1 \n  \nGood morning.  It is a pleasure  to welcome  the Boston Economic Club to the Federal \nReserve Bank  of Boston , and to be joined by many of  the Bank’s staff members as well.  Early \nJanuary is a good time to assess the economy’s recent performance, its fundamentals, its outlook, \nand the forces that may impact it over the year ahead.   \nAs everyone knows, the past several months have seen a good deal of financial mark et \nvolatility.  From the beginning  of October to the end of December , the Dow Jones Industrial \nAverage fell 12.5 percent , and the S&P 500 index  fell 14.3 percent.  However, over the full year \nthe same indices declined  a smaller  6.0 percent and 7.0 percent , respectively .  Furthermore, o ne \nmeasure of stock marke t volatility, the Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index – or \nVIX – ended December well above its historical average , at 25.4 .  In addition, the rate on  10-\nyear Treasury notes,  which had  reached a high of 3.2 4 percent, finished December  trading below \n2.7 percent .   \n The decline in stock prices has certainly caught the attention of investors .  It constitutes a  \ntighten ing of  current  financial conditions, given the decrease in the value of these assets , and \ncould portend a decline in future economic growth.  I n that scenario , there might be less need – \nor even no need – for further tightening  of monetary policy by the Federal Reserve .   \nHowever, a critical issue is whether financial market  sentiment is  too pessimistic, too \noptimistic, or about right.  After all,  we know that financial markets can, and do, reverse \nthemselves.  This could happen  if it turns out that late last year many investors had become  \noverly pessimistic about  potential risks to the economic outlook.  If the economy continue s to be \nresilient, one might expect financial markets to reprice if it becomes  clear that risks ha d been \noverstated.  \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 11:30 A.M. on Wednesday, January 9, 201 9 U.S. Eastern Time, OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n2 \n  Indeed,  I personally suspect that financial mar ket sentiment  may have become unduly \npessimistic.  I recognize that the risk of a U.S. economic slowdown, led by weakness abroad, has \nincreased.  But m onetary policy remains accommodative, as does fiscal policy.  Economic \ngrowth was quite strong in 2018 , and some of th at strength is likely to carry forward.  \nFurthermore, the engine behind  the good growth level in 2018 was the consumer.  There are \nmany reasons to believe the consumer is still engaged and willing to spend  – employment growth \nremains strong,  wage growth rates are rising,  the savings rate is high, and consum er confidence \nremains high by historical standards .   \n However, I do view the current economic outlook as being quite uncertain.  Even at the \nbest of times, it is difficult to navigate soft  landings for the economy.  Recent data from China ’s \neconomy , the potential for increased trade tensions, and heightened volatility all coun sel for \npolicy to be both flexible and patient.  My baseline forecast still assumes growth somewhat \nabove potential , and some modest declines in the unemployment rate over this year.  \nNonetheless, I am sensitive to the heightened risks, and believe that policy is currently \nappropriately balancing risks.  Should these risks materialize and significantly impact the \neconom y, resulting  in an economic slowdown  – which is not my baseline forecast – policy would \nneed to recalibrate for that less -favorable environment.  But a t this juncture, w ith two very \ndifferent scenarios  – economic slowdown implied by financial markets ; or growth  somewhat \nabove potential GDP growth , consistent with economic forecasts  – I believe we can wait for \ngreater clarity before adjusting policy .   \n With that as introduction, I  would like to  preview my remarks to day.  I will begin by \nproviding some noteworthy  context to recent financial -market movements.  I will then examine \nwhether  these market movements have altered  the predictions of  private -sector forecasters.  I will \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 11:30 A.M. on Wednesday, January 9, 201 9 U.S. Eastern Time, OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n3 \n then discuss  how these private -sector  forecasts compare to th e forecasts made by Federal \nReserve policymakers  at the December 2018  Federal Open Market Committee  (FOMC) meeting.  \nFinally, I will explain  why my own assessment is closer to the relative optimism of many  \neconomi c forecasters th an it is to  the more pessimistic outlook suggested  by recent declines in \nfinancial markets.  \nAt the same time, I will hasten to add that the market’s effect of tightening financial \nconditions  – coupled with the uncertainty in forecast s – make it imperative that monetary policy \nshould be data depe ndent .  By this I mean that there should be no particular bias toward raising \nor lowering rates until the data more c learly indicate the path for  domestic and international \neconomic growth.  \n \nRecent Financial Market Movements , in Context  \n Figure 1  shows the yield on the  benchmark  10-year Treasury note over the past three \nyears.  For much of that period, the 10 -year rate was rising gradually, reflecting a str engthening  \nU.S. economy, inflation nearing the Federal Reserve’s  2 percent target , and gradu al tightening of \nmonetary policy.  While the 10 -year rate had risen to 3.2 4 percent in November  of 2018 , it fell \nappreciably in December , and is currently trading around  2.7 percent.   \n Figure 2  shows a similar pattern  prevailing in stock prices over the last three years .  The \nstock market rose from early in 2016 until the beginning of 2018, when  the Dow Jones Industrial \nAverage and the S&P 500 index both fell – before rising in the summer of 2018 and then falling \nsigni ficantly over the past several months.  Still, d espite the se recent declines, stock prices \nremain well above where they were t hree years ago.  \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 11:30 A.M. on Wednesday, January 9, 201 9 U.S. Eastern Time, OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n4 \n  Figure 3  shows the volatility index for stocks, the VIX.  As unsettling as the  recent \ndeclines  have been, the increased volatility  in the stock market  – with daily market swings  of \nmore than 1 percent  – has become increasingly common of late . This highlights that many \ninvestors  are quite uncertain about the outlook, and markets are particularly sen sitive to new \ninformation.  \n Figure 4  shows the price of oil.  Oil prices have also been increasing over the past three \nyears , as demand outstripped supply, in part because of a tightening in supply by OPEC .  Earlier \nthis year, the p rice of oil  exceed ed $75 a barrel , but more recently it has  declined sharply , to the \nmid-50s per barrel . \n Looking beyond U.S. financial markets, Figure 5  shows stock market performance in \nJapan, Europe, and China  along with  the U.S .  What we see is that d espite the declines in U .S. \nstocks  recently, U .S. stock prices have fared significantly better than many foreign stock -price \nindices.  Of the four, the U.S. S&P 500 index  remains the furthest above its level at the start of \n2016.  By comparison , the o ther regions’  stock indices ro se less in 2016, leveled off in 2017, and \ndeclined in 2018.  Among these four stock indices, Chinese stocks have fallen the most  – likely \nbecause  the Chinese economy has been slowing, financial stability concerns have risen, and \nChina has been the country most involved with and impacted by  trade policy  changes with the \nU.S. \n In summary, clearly financial markets ended 2018  on a sour note.  U .S. stock indices \nhave performed better than many foreign counterparts , but were  down 6  to 7 percent over the \nyear – and the decline and the increased volatility have understandably raised concerns about the \ndurability of the economic recovery.  However , at least to date, the economic data and the \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 11:30 A.M. on Wednesday, January 9, 201 9 U.S. Eastern Time, OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n5 \n outlook of forecasters ha ve both been more optimistic than recent financia l market movements \nmight indicate.  \n \nEffects on Economic Forecasters ’ Outlook  \nWhile economics is sometimes referred to as the dismal science, at present economic \nforecasters seem to have a more optimistic outlook than the sentiment suggested by recent \nfinancial market movements.  \n Figure 6  provides the Blue Chip forecast, as of December 10, for real GDP growth over \n2019.  The Blue Chip forecast is a compilation of the outlooks of roughly 50 private forecasters, \nwith the solid line reflecting the average of those forecasts, and the dotted lines reflecting the \naverage of the 10 highest forecasts and the average of the 10 lowest forecast s.  The consensus is \nfor growth slower than last year, but averaging more than 2 percent over next year.   In addition, \neven the  Blue Chip’s  average of the 10 lowest forecasts does not expect any quarter next year to \nbe negative.   \n Figure 7 provides the Blue Chip forecast for the unemployment rate over 2019.  The \nconsensus forecast is for the unemployment rate to drift down t o 3.5 percent by the end of this \nyear.  In addition,  the average of the 10 highest forecasts do es not expect the unemployment rate \nto rise above 4 percent in any quarter this year.  \n One likely reason for th e forecasters’  low assessment of the probability of negative real \nGDP growth , or significantly higher unemployment , is the strength of consumer spending.  \nFigure 8 shows that o ther than in the first quarter of 2018,  consumer s have increased their \npurchases of goods and services by more th an 3 percent over the past year.   \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 11:30 A.M. on Wednesday, January 9, 201 9 U.S. Eastern Time, OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n6 \n I would note also that m ost forecasters expect the last quarter of 2018 to end up proving \nto have been strong  for consumer spending .  This would reflect the strong growth in income and \nemployment , and the fact  that house values continue to rise.  \n Figure 9 shows the consumer confidence index  as published by the Conference Board .  \nWhile the index remains quite high, there was a decline in December as consumers became more \ncautious  – presumably because of recent f inancial market movements.1   \n Turning to  labor market conditions, Figure 1 0 shows the monthly change in U.S. payroll \nemployment.  Payroll employment gr ew by around 312,000 in December  and averaged 220,000 \nper month in 2018.   This is much higher than the roughly 100,000 jobs necessary for the \nunemployment rate to merely  remain flat , and much stronger than most forecasters had expected.   \nAll this is consistent with a very robust labor market.  \n Figure 1 1 shows that filings for initial claims for unemploymen t are still trending down, \nand below the levels we have seen over  most of  the past three years.  In fact, initial claims for \nunemployment insurance remain fairly close to 50 -year lows.  \n \nFOMC Members’  Outlook s \n Participants in  the FOMC,2 the U.S. monetary policy  decision -making body , also provide \ntheir economic forecasts on a quarterly basis , in the Summary of Economic Projections or SEP .  \nFigure 1 2 shows the forecast s of FOMC participants for real GDP over the next several years.  \nFor 2019 , FOMC participants ’ median forecast was for growth above 2 percent, with the central \ntendency also above 2 percent.3  Given my  1.8 percent  estimate of the economy’s “ potential ” \ngrowth rate , a forecast of above 2 percent  growth would be consistent with further declines in the \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 11:30 A.M. on Wednesday, January 9, 201 9 U.S. Eastern Time, OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n7 \n unemployment rate.  I should n ote that every  FOMC participant  in the central tendency  \nanticipated  real GDP growth remaining at or above 1 .5 percent through 2021.  \n Consistent with the forecast for real GDP gr owth, Figure 1 3 shows the median \nunemployment rate expected by FOMC participants and the central tendency.  The median for \nthe fourth quarter of  2019 is 3.5 percent , which is below the current level. The chart shows it  \nrising somewhat thereaft er.  I would also note that  in the SEP , for the unemployment rate \nforecast the central tendency  is quite similar to the median  forecast . \n In terms of inflation, the FOMC median forecast  was a bit below 2 percent for 2019 , but \nsomewhat above 2 percent thereafter , as sho wn in Figure 1 4.  Thus , FOMC participants expect \ninflation to remain quite near their  symmetri c inflation target of 2 percent.  \n \nConcluding Observations  \n My own view is that the economic outlook is actually brighter than the outlook one might \ninfer from recent financial -market movements .  I expect real growth over 2019  to remain solid \nenough to tighten the U.S. labor market  somewhat.  My views are therefore close r to the \noptimism reflected  by many professional forecasters and the FOMC  members of late , than they \nare to  the recent pessimism in financial markets.  \n Nonetheless, financial market volatility reflect s a perception of heightened risks.  \nConcerns with global growth, international trade, and geopolitical upheaval are important to take \ninto account, and serve as a prudent  warning that actual economic outcomes could diverge \nsignificantly from what is being forecast.  \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 11:30 A.M. on Wednesday, January 9, 201 9 U.S. Eastern Time, OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n8 \n  I will close by returning to the implications of all this for the Federal Reserve’s monetary \npolicymaking.  Today , we have explored the c ontrast of relatively optimistic economic forecasts \nand the pessimism reflected of late  by financial market participants .  This contrast , if nothing \nelse, highlights why monetary policy should not be on a set course , but rather  should take into \naccount and  reflect how real economic data unfold.   \nTo that end, if  the pessimism evident in financial markets eventually shows through to \neconomic outcomes, there would be less need (and perhaps no need) for further increases in \ninterest rates.   However, my current expectation is that the  more optimistic view will prevail, \nwith economic outcomes  consistent with the more upbeat forecasts (and stock markets perhaps \nrebounding ).  Yet given the reduced  certainty I have about my forecast – in light of  the slowing \nabroad and volatile financial markets  – in my view , the appropriate stance for monetary policy is , \nfor now , to not have a bias on moving policy in either direction until there is greater clarity \naround economic trends here and abroad.  The Fed eral Reserve’s current m onetary policy seems \nappropriate for now, and can  patiently observe future economic developments.  \n Thank you.   \n  \n1 Note that the University of Michigan ’s Index of Consumer Sentiment did not see a decline in December. See more \nhere: http://www.sca.isr.umich.edu/ .   \n \n2 FOMC participants include Federal Reserve governors and Federal Reserve Bank presidents.  Not all presidents \nare voting members in each year but all presidents submit forecasts.    \n \n3 The median forecast is the middle projection when the projections are ar ranged from lowest to highest. When the \nnumber of projections is even, the median is the average of the two middle projections.  The central tendency \nexcludes the three highest and three lowest projections for each variable in each year.

Eastern Time on  \nTuesda y, March 5 , 2019  OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n \nThe views expressed today are my own, not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal Reserve Board of \nGovernors or the Federal Open Market Committee.  \n  \n \n \n  \n \n   \n \n“Risk Management in M onetary \nPolicymaking ” \n \n \nEric S. Rosengren  \nPresident & Chief Executive Officer  \nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston  \n \n \nNational Association of Corporate Directors  \nNew England Chapter  \n \n \nBoston, Massachusetts  \nMarch 5 , 2019  \n \n \n \n\n\n EMBARGOED UNTIL 7:35 A.M. on Tuesday, March 5 , 2019 U.S. Eastern Time, OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n1 \n Good morning .  It is a pleasure to be with  the New England chapter of the National \nAssociation of Corporate Directors .  I’d like to especially acknowledge and thank one of your \nmembers, Cathy Minehan, who was my predecessor as president of the Federal Reserve Bank of \nBoston, and helped make this event  possible.  \nAs corporate directors, you as sess the plans and forecasts of  the organizations you \noversee – and also grap ple with the risks inherent in those plans, and how th ose risks can be \nmanaged.  In something of a parallel, I will talk today not only about the outlook for the \neconomy, but also the risks to that outlook – and how the Federal Reserve is taking those risks \ninto account as it executes monetary policy.  \nToday I plan to share my outlook for the econom y with you, as well as the implications \nthat outlook has for the Fed’s policymaking , in my view .  In order to look ahead, however, I \nthink it is important to begin by reflect ing on the economy at the end of last year, in the fourth \nquarter.  \n  I won’t need to remind you that t he fourth quarter of  2018 featured  a series of  problem s – \nsome  realized, some potential – that affect ed financial market s.  Domestic and international stock \nindices  fell, stock volatility rose, oil prices fell, l ong Treasury rates fell , and credit spreads \nwidened.  These asset price movements  – along with the partial government shutdown, trade \nconcerns,  and declines in consumer sentiment – likely contributed to much weaker than expected \nDecember retail sales.   The constellation of financial- market movements also caused some \nanalysts to highlight  recession proba bilities , and the heightened risk of a more pronounced \nslowdown for the global economy .  \n\n EMBARGOED UNTIL 7:35 A.M. on Tuesday, March 5 , 2019 U.S. Eastern Time, OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n2 \n After the calendar t urned to 2019, many financial markets  recovered smartly , and \nCongress and the Administration reached a  budget agreement that avoided an extended \nshutdown.  These developments  appear to h ave alleviated  some of the more  pronounced \nconcerns . \nHowever, many of the underlying global growth issues  that generated the recent spate of \nfinancial -market concerns  are as yet unresolved.  These issues include  slowing growth in China \nand Europe, constraints on international trade, the potential for Brexit- generated challenges,  and \nproblems at some  European banks – all issues that could weigh on an already -slowing economy .  \nThese conditions , together , provide ample justification for focus ing on prudent risk managem ent \nwhen setting monetary policy.  \nMy view , as I will discuss today, is that the most likely outcome for 2019 is relatively \nhealthy  U.S. economic  growth somewhat above 2 percent over  the course of the year, with \ninflation very close to Fed policymakers’  2 percent target , and a U.S. labor market  that continues \nto tighten somewhat .  All in all, a relatively strong forecast .  \nHowever, policymakers cannot place complete faith in what they believe is the most \nlikely outcome .  So the Federal Reserve must take into account key r isks to the forecast , and \ndevelop a strategy for managing those risks .   \nObviously one such risk involves the economy’s grow th rate, both at home and abroad.  \nDomestic g rowth somewhat above  2 percent , as I anticipate, would be a slowdown relative to the \nroughly  3 percent growth of last year , although still somewhat above my estimate of the \neconomy’s so- called potential growth  rate.1  The modest slowing from last year’s rate would be \ndue to the  diminishing  fiscal stimulus from earlier policies , and the effects  of four increases in \n\n EMBARGOED UNTIL 7:35 A.M. on Tuesday, March 5 , 2019 U.S. Eastern Time, OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n3 \n short -term interest rate s last year.   Those effects are built into my forecast  for a growth rate \nsomewhat above 2 percent – which  would still be sufficient to bring additional improvements to \nlabor markets , without much risk of higher inflation.  In that sense, it would be a very welcome \noutcome.  But there i s some  risk that more pronounced slowdowns in the rest of the world could \ndampen U.S. growth more than I am forecastin g.   \nOn the other hand, earlier concerns  that the economy might overheat in a number of ways \nseem somewhat less pressing  at this juncture .  Given the growth outlook, I  expect i nflation to  end \n2019 close to the Federal Reserve’s  2 percent target .  And s ome financial stability risks have \nbeen reduce d, as recent  financial market volatility  has tempered investor ebullience .  So, in my \nview,  there is less reason to fear overheating, and somewhat greater risks to the outlook – and \ntogether these factors are sufficient to justify a pause in the recent monetary tightening cycle.  I \nwould a dd to these factors one more – the  difficulties in interpreting the  trajectory of the \neconomy due to delays in economic data, caused by the partial government shutdown. \nAltogether, it is a good time for policymakers to  be patient , taking the time to evaluate  the risks \nI’ve outlined, as well as the underlying strength of the economy.  \nOverall , my message today is positive.   In my view , the U.S.  economy will likely grow \nfast enough to cause further tighten ing in labor markets .  Financial markets have stabil ized, and \nstock  prices have recovered from their December lows.   Concerns  about  government shutdowns \nare diminished , and there appears to be more optimism relative to trade disputes .  While labor \nmarkets are tight and wage pressures are rising, inflation is so far quite  well behaved .  This \nmeans  that, in the face of heig htened risks, policymakers can be patient , waiting to see additional \nincoming data  to better discern  the direction of the economy before taking any further monetary \n\n EMBARGOED UNTIL 7:35 A.M. on Tuesday, March 5 , 2019 U.S. Eastern Time, OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n4 \n policy action.  This is the essence of the prudent risk management in policymaking that is my \ntheme today.  \n \nFinancial M arkets – R ecovery from  the Fourth Q uarter  \n With that summary and overview, let  me now walk you through the data that underpins \nmy views.  \n Figure 1  shows the movement  of two domestic stock indices  – the Dow Jones 30 \nIndustrials  and the S&P 500 – since the beginning of 2018.  The indices showed no particular \ntrend in the first half of 2018 before rising  in the third quarter, and then rather sharp ly declin ing \nin the fourth quarter.  S tock prices  declined  approximately 15 percent  from the ir peak to the \nDecember lows .  However, there has been a significant recovery since the December holiday \nweek, with the stock indices  now exceeding their  level s at the start of 2018.   \n Figure 2  highlights that the stock market declines were a global phenomen on.  \nInternational  stock  indices  all swooned in the fourth quarter  (or earlier, in the case of China) .  \nBut unlike U.S. stocks they remain well below ( roughly 10 percent below ) their levels at  the \nbeginning of 2018.  The declin es sparked concerns that both the Europe an and Chi nese \neconomies might be slowing down more than anticipated.   \n Global  and domestic  slowdown concerns also resulted in significant  stock volatility  at the \nend of 2018, as shown in Figure 3 .  You may recall that there was a similar spike  in volatility at \nthe beginning  of 2018, stemming at least in part from  similar concerns  over  slower global \n\n EMBARGOED UNTIL 7:35 A.M. on Tuesday, March 5 , 2019 U.S. Eastern Time, OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n5 \n growth , including  slowing in China and other emerging markets.  As stocks have improved since \nthe beginning of this year, the volatility has subsided. \n While there is evidence of recovery in domestic and global stock indices, accompanied \nby a reduction in volatility, d ebt markets have not recovered to the same degree.   Figure 4  shows  \nthat the 10- year U.S. Treasury rate is about  50 basis points lower than its recent peak in the fall.  \nInvestors tend to move into l onger -term Treasury securities when they are concerned with global \nrisks  – in part, what many call a  “flight  to quality. ”  This increase in demand for Treasuries raises \ntheir price and lowers their yield.   One possible way  to interpret the fall in 10 - year Treasury \nrates is as a response by some investors who choose to use longer -term Treasury securitie s as a \nhedge against global risks , possibly  suggesting lingering  concern with downside risk, at least in \nthe bond markets .  \nFigure 5  shows two common measures of the slope of the yield curve.  The most \ncommonly used measure, the spread representing the 10- year Treasury rate mi nus the 2- year \nTreasury rate, declined significantly over 2018 – as the Federal Reserve raised short -term rates \nand as Treasury security rates declined .  A second measure of the yield curve studied by \nEngstrom and Sharpe (2018)2 looks at the implied forward yield on a three -month Treasury bill \nsix quarters  ahead , minus the yield on a current three- month bill.   By focusing  on the near -term \npath of interest rates rather than a 10 -year horizon, this measure  may  reflect the  market ’s \nassessment of whether near -term monetary policy may  tighten or ease.   The decline in this \nshorter yield curve measure is consistent with increased assessments of risk  by many investors, \nas well as the Federal Reserve’s recent willingness to be patient in light of those increased risk \nconcerns . \n\n EMBARGOED UNTIL 7:35 A.M. on Tuesday, March 5 , 2019 U.S. Eastern Time, OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n6 \n  Figure 6  shows that risks are also being priced in to credit spreads.   The spread  between  \nhigh-yield corporate bonds and 10- year U.S. Treasuries rose significantly at the end of 2018.  \nThis spread is important because it reflects a perception that corporate default risks  have \nincreased .  These risks might be most acute if investors thought that the probabi lity of a more \nsignificant economic slowdown had increased .  There has been some reversal of this increase \nsince the beginning of th e year,  but high -yield rate spreads remain higher than levels seen for \nmuch of 2018.  \nFigure 7  shows U.S. debt markets aren’t the only place where concerns about slowing \nglobal growth are surfacing .  Yields on 10- year German government bonds  have declined from \ntheir already low levels , potentially reflecting some flight to quality within Europe .  In contrast, \nItalian 10 -year government bond yield s have risen significantly, as investors require a higher  risk \npremium for Italian debt, likely react ing to the risk that global and European slowing  will \nweaken Italy’s economy and its government’s ability to meet its debt obligations . \nOverall, markets are still pricing in somewhat elevated  risk, even as some o f the concerns \nfrom the end of last year seem to have subsided somewhat .  U.S. stock markets have partially \nrecovered and stock volatility is lower, but foreign stocks and all debt markets are still priced as \nif there are heightened risks.  These heightened risks are another reason why patience in  \nmonetary policy is appropriate at this time.  \n \n \n \n\n EMBARGOED UNTIL 7:35 A.M. on Tuesday, March 5 , 2019 U.S. Eastern Time, OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n7 \n The Most Likely  Outlook  for the Economy  \n While downside risks are elevated, it is important not to lose sight of the modal forecast, \nthat is, the most likely outcome forecasters see for the economy.  Figure 8  shows the February \n10th Blue Chip Forecast, encompassing approximately 50 private -sector economists ’ forecast s for \nreal GDP over 2019.  The solid  line shows the average of the forecasts for real GDP.  These  \nprivate forecasts a re not anticipating a significant slowdown – with GDP growing somewhat \nabove 2 percent over the year.  Even the average of the 10 lowest forecasts does not show  a sharp \nslowdown, with growth over the year somewhat above 1.5 percent.   \n If growth exceeds 2 percent , as in the consensus  forecast , labor markets would be \nexpected to tighten further.   Figure 9  shows unemployment rate by race and ethnicity  – and each \nmeasure is  quite low by historical standards.  One  of the advantage s of such low unemployment \nrates  is that additional members of racial and ethnic groups that have tend ed to have high er \nunemployment rates are drawn into the labor market.  \nFigure 10  shows that in itial claims for unemployment remain quite low.   This suggests  \nthat employers are loathe to lay  off workers in an environment where finding new hire s could be \nchallenging.  \n Despite the clear benefits to  having a tight labor market, we have to keep in mind that \nthere are costs when  a labor market becomes too tight.   I will explore  this possibility in  my next \nfew charts.  \n  Figure 11  depicts the so -called quits r ate – the number of people who voluntarily leave \ntheir job as a share of total employmen t.  Voluntary job- leavers  do not qualify for unemployment \n\n EMBARGOED UNTIL 7:35 A.M. on Tuesday, March 5 , 2019 U.S. Eastern Time, OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n8 \n insurance  – so t he higher quit s rates  reflect worker s’ confidence that they will quickly find \nalternative employment if they leave a job .  But it is also a sign of emerging wage pressures . \nWorkers are likely voluntarily leaving jobs because other employers offer higher wages .  As \nworkers move to higher -paying jobs, the effect on wages can cascade through firms who lose as \nwell as gain employees.   The employer gaining a worker may face pressure to offer his or her  \ncurrent workforce the new (higher) market  wage , and the former employer will need to offer the \nhigher  market wage to attract a new worker to the position , which may also affect prevailing \nwages for the employer’s  workforce . \n To clarify, I am not suggesting  that wage growth is a problem per se.  On the contrary, I \nwant to see wage growth – particularly if it is a result of improved productivity.  B ut wage \ngrow th that drives inflation significantly above target would be a problem.  Again, we want to \nconsider the risk of the labor market becoming too  tight, given the downsides to that happening.  \nThe Federal Reserve’s dual mandate from Congress encompasses not just maximum sustainable \nemployment, but also stable prices.   \n Figure 12  shows that there has indeed been upward momentum in wages.  Both average \nhourly earnings and the  employment cost index  have been rising.   At current rates of increase, \nwage growth  roughly reflect s worker  compensation for their increased efficiency (productivity \ngrowth, about 1 percent) plus the increased cost of living ( inflation , about 2 percent) .  However,  \nif wages were to continue  to accelerate without a pickup in productivity , some of the increase in  \nwage cost s would be reflected in smaller profit margins or higher prices.  \n\n EMBARGOED UNTIL 7:35 A.M. on Tuesday, March 5 , 2019 U.S. Eastern Time, OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n9 \n  In Figure 13, we see wages trending up in several industries that tend to have lower -\nskilled workers .  This is good for employees , but highlights the p ressure that tight labor markets \nplace on some businesses.  \nFigure 14  shows that, to date, rising wages have  not placed significant pressure on \nprices , perhaps because most firms have significant profit margins to absorb any cost increases .  \nIn particular, core inflation remains just below the Federal Reserve’s  2 percent target, while total \nPCE inflation has fal len below 2 percent , largely  a result of lower oil prices .  Declines in oil \nprices could have longer -lasting effects on the level  of prices, but should have only temporary \neffects on inflation  (i.e., the rate of change) . \nTo further parse inflation  readings , Figure 15  shows that the 2 percent overall inflation \nrate reflects the combination of services  price increases of over  2 percent  with the more volatile \ngoods  prices that mostly fell from 2013 through 2016, and ha d risen significantly more slowly \nthan services of late.  While g oods prices did ris e much more slow ly than services, there had \nbeen a recent  increase, which at least partly reflect ed the impact that tariffs may be having on \ntraded goods  prices .  Goods prices declined slightly in December.   \n \nConcluding Observations  \n While  the modal forecast for the economy is consistent with growth s lightly above 2 \npercent, inflation close to target, and  some further tightening of labor markets , the risks to th at \noutlook have increased recently .  In my view, c urrent mone tary policy needs to balance this  \nrelatively benign forecast with the increased downside risks that are reflected in asset prices .  \n\n EMBARGOED UNTIL 7:35 A.M. on Tuesday, March 5 , 2019 U.S. Eastern Time, OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n10 \n  I will reiterate that while there has been some recovery in equity prices , financial markets \noverall continue to pric e in downside risks to the economy.  This is most obvious in longer \nTreasury rates and wider credit spreads , consistent with the ongoing risks posed by slower global \ngrowth.   While incoming data are still delayed because of the partial government shutdown, there \nis some indication in the December retail sales data that the economy may be slowing a bit faster \nthan policymakers  anticipated.  \nIt could be that asset -price declines,  government shutdowns, and challenges in reachin g \ntrade agreements  were the source of slowing in the real economy  at the end of last year .  Or it \ncould be that asset price weakness reflected the perception that the economy was slowing, \nparticularly in the face of rising interest rates.   It remains to be seen whether the few signs of \nweakness at the turn of the year reflect an underlying slowdown in the economy, or a response to \na variety of temporary concerns that may fade . \nIt may be several  meetings  of the Federal Open Market Committee before Fed \npolicymakers  have a clear er read on whether the risks are becoming reality  – and  by how much \nthe economy will slow compared to last year.   With less ebullience in financial markets and no \nimmediate signs of inflationary pressures, patient ly watch ing to see how the economy develops  \nis the appropriate policy for now, and represents prudent management of risks to the forecast . \nThank you.  \n \n1 Growth above the economy’s “potential” rate of growth, which I estimate to be 1.8  percent, would typically push \ndown unemployment.  \n \n2 See https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/feds/files/2018055pap.pdf",

It is a pleasure to be in Hong Kong for the Credit Suisse Asian \nInvestment Conference.  \nMy colleagues and I spend a fair amount of time talking to members of the public about \nthe economic analysis that goes into monetary policy making .  We spend somewhat less time \ntalking about the tools we will use to attain our economic goals.  And t o date we have s pent \nrelatively little time speaking in detail about one of those tools, the Fed eral Reserve ’s balance \nsheet  – that is, the assets  the U.S. central bank  is holding  and liabilities  and capital used to \nfinance those assets .1  It is an admittedly  complicated topic, but one  that needs more explanation .  \nThe balance sheet needs to be better understood – beyond just its total size, and beyond just the \nassets on it.   I say this  given its likely importance in the future, should there eventual ly be  an \neconomic downturn ; and given the suggestion in some quarters that balance sheet policies are \nbehind recent market volatility ( a suggestion I disagree with).   \nTechnically speaking, t he Federal Reserve’s balance sheet, like that of any enterprise, \nreflect s a point -in-time fin ancial snapshot.  The balance sheet is always evolving, and as a result \nthe Federal Reserve publishes it  each week.2  I would point out that last week the Fed released \nadditional information regarding its plans and principl es for balance sheet normalization.3 \nThroughout my remarks t oday , I will be highlighting the importance of the balance sheet \nas a tool that will likely need to be used by central banks  around the world , given  the low interest \nrate environments in many developed countries .  I will touch on some of the  misconceptions  that \nhave emerged around the topic, look in some detail at the actual composition of the Fed’s \nbalance sheet, discuss the Fed’s balance sheet normalization approach, disprove some mistaken \nassumptions about the bala nce sheet and recent financial market turbulence, and comment on the \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 8:30 P.M. on Monday, March 25, 2019 , U.S. Eastern Time , \nwhich is 8:30 A.M. on Tuesday, March 26, 2019 in Hong Kong  – OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n \n \n3 \n role of the balance sheet going forward – providing my own view of the role balance sheet \npolicies and actions could play in the future . \n \nMisconceptions  about the Federal Reserve Balance Sheet  \nThe balance sheet policies of the U.S. central bank  have received rather significant \nattention over the past two quarters.  That attention stands in contrast to the somewhat surpris ing \nlack of market reaction in Se ptember 2017 to the announcement of a very gradual runoff of \nFederal Reserve assets .4   \nEven more surprising to me was the association – made by some market analysts at the \nend of 2018 – that the increased  market volatility, falling long -term interest rates, and declining \nglobal stock market prices in the fourth quarter  could be attributed to Federal Reserve balance \nsheet actions.  In  actuality , the runoff in balance sheet assets continued at a little faster  pace in \nthe first two months  of this year than in the fourth quarter of last year , yet markets have risen  and \nvolatility has declined – which certainly does not squar e with the earlier commentary.   This \nepisode highlights  the reason for  concern that some misconceptions  have emerged about  the \neffects  of Federal Reserve balance sheet actions – and what such actions can, and cannot, \nachieve.   \nI have talked to a variety of market observers  who argue that the Fed’s  balance sheet \nshould return to levels similar to those that existed prior to the financial crisis of 2008 -2009 .  The \nargument for such a policy is based more on misconception  than fact, since  it does not recogni ze \nthat factors unrelated to monetary policy also impact the growth of the Federal Reserve ’s balance \nsheet , as I will demonstrate in a moment .  Furthermore, I think it is a mistake to focus primarily \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 8:30 P.M. on Monday, March 25, 2019 , U.S. Eastern Time , \nwhich is 8:30 A.M. on Tuesday, March 26, 2019 in Hong Kong  – OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n \n \n4 \n on the size of the balance sheet, with much less attention placed on the quantity of bank reserves \nand the duration of the ass ets being held . In my view , these latter  aspects are much more \nimportant  than overall size,  from a policy perspective.  \n It is important to dispel  misconceptions surrounding central bank balance sheet s if for no \nother reason than this:  It is quite likely that central bank  balance sheet s will be integral to the \nconduct of  monetary policy in the future , in the U.S.  and many other countries.  When  a \nrecession  eventually occur s, central banks would normally decrease short -term interest  rates .  \nBut with interest rates already low in most developed countries , central banks would likely reach  \nthe effective lower bound  quite quickly .  In fact, i n Japan and Europe it is theoretically possible \nthat rates might  not rise much above the effective lower bound before a hypothetical next \nrecession occurs.  As in the Great Recession that followed the financial crisis, this could force \ncentral bankers to use asset purchases to create more accommodative financial conditions and \nstimul ate their economies, which would necessarily entail an expansion of their balance sheet s.5  \nIf balance sheet policies are to become a more regular feature of monetary policy actions \naround the world, my view is that it is important that central bankers  are clear with the public \nabout why they would pursue such policies, what effects they will have, and what complications \nmight arise as a consequence of using such policies .   \n Allow me to outline the key  points that I will explore in more detail today .  First, part of \nthe expansion of the Federal Reserve ’s balance sheet  occurs as a normal consequence of a \ngrowing economy with a growing need for currency, a factor not related to monetary policy  \naction .  A second factor that is unrelated to monetary policy is changes  in the balances held  at the \nFed by the U.S. Treasury .  The Treasury’s General  Account has  grown significantly  following \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 8:30 P.M. on Monday, March 25, 2019 , U.S. Eastern Time , \nwhich is 8:30 A.M. on Tuesday, March 26, 2019 in Hong Kong  – OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n \n \n5 \n the financial crisis , in part because the Treasury shifted from using accounts at commercial banks \nto the Treasury General Account  and decided  to maintain larger  balance s.6,7  As a c onsequen ce \nof these factors , returning the balance sheet to a pre -crisis size may sound like the end result of \nnormalizing policy, but in fact is neither desirable nor feasible .  In addition, demand for reserves \nis much greater than pre -crisis, in part because financial institutions see the benefits of having a \nhigher level of liqui d assets.  \nSecond, when scaled relative to  GDP, the Federal Reserve ’s balance sheet is actually \nsmall compared to those of central banks in many other developed countries.   \nAnd t hird, as suggested by the previous discussion of currency and Treasury balanc es, it \nis important to focus on aspects of the central bank  balance sheet that policymakers  directly \ncontrol, and that are closely  related to polic y decisions .  I have in mind bank reserves , which can \ndirectly affect the ability to control short -term interest rate s, and the duration of assets , which can \nalso play a role in policymakers’  ability to lower longer -term interest rate s, as I will discuss in a \nmoment .   \nAs you likely know,  the Federal Reserve has announced  that it will continue using  the \nsame  monetary policy framework that it has since the financial crisis, which maintains  an ample \nsupply of reserves to ensure  that it can effectively maintain a “floor ” type system  for controlling \nshort -term interest rates  via adm inistered rates .8 I will describe this in more detail in a moment.   \nIn particul ar, variability in some of the components of the Federal Reserve ’s balance sheet make \nit necessary to have ample  reserves as a reasonable buffer if policymakers  seek to avoid \nsignificant volatility in short -term interest rates.9  \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 8:30 P.M. on Monday, March 25, 2019 , U.S. Eastern Time , \nwhich is 8:30 A.M. on Tuesday, March 26, 2019 in Hong Kong  – OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n \n \n6 \n Finally, in my view, monetary policy makers  should give more consideration to \nstructuring the balance sheet to provide  more leeway for policy measures  to be taken  when the \nnext economic downturn occurs.   This consideration primarily centers on building in the \nflexibility to exchange short -term for long -term Treasury securities so as to lower longer -term \nTreasury rates.   I will now discuss  all these points in more detail.  \n \nExamining the Federal Reserve ’s Balance Sheet  \n As I mentioned at the outset, the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet , like that  of any \nenterprise , reflect s at a single point in time the assets  it holds, and the liabilities  and capital  used \nto finance those assets .   \nFigure 1  shows how the assets and liabilities of the Fed have changed since before the \nGreat Recession. The table provides a high -level overview of the largest categories of assets and \nliabilities of the Federal Reserve , for January 2004 and for February  2019 .  The  assets are \ncomposed primarily of U.S. Treasury securities and mortgage -backed securities that have a \ngovernment guarantee.  All of these securities accrue  interest.   \nThese interest -generating  assets are financed primarily by three categories of liabiliti es: \nFederal Reserve notes  – U.S. currency  – a category that does not pay interest ; deposits held for \nthe Treasury ; and reserves  held for thousands of depository  institutions, which  pay an overnight \nrate – or interest on reserves.10  I would note that t he net income generated by the Fed’s balance \nsheet activity is turned over to the U.S. Treasury annually .11 \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 8:30 P.M. on Monday, March 25, 2019 , U.S. Eastern Time , \nwhich is 8:30 A.M. on Tuesday, March 26, 2019 in Hong Kong  – OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n \n \n7 \n  As Figure 1  illustrates, there have been significant changes to the assets and liabilities of \nthe Federal Reserve over the past 15 years.  In terms of assets, in 2004 the Federal Reserve held \nroughly one -third of its securities as short -term Treasury bills and held no  mortgage -backed \nsecurities.  By 2019, the Federal Reserve held essentiall y no Treasury bills and had dramatically \nincreased its holdings of long-term securities such as Treasury bonds and mortgage -backed \nsecurities.   This change in the composition of  assets reflects  a Fed policy choice  that was \nnecessitated by the fact that the short -term policy rate was already at its effective  lower bound, \neven as the economy remained quite weak.  Hoping to stimulate the economy, the Fed purchased \nlong-term securities in order to reduce long -term interest rates ( because debt security prices \nmove inversely with their interest rates , higher prices spurred by purchases  reduce d rates ).   \nIn principle, the Federal Reserve  can move to  longer -term assets either by exchanging \nthem for the central bank’s  holdings of short -term assets on the Fed  balance sheet (a reallocation \nof the portfolio, accomplished by selling short -term assets and purchasing longer -term assets) or \nby simply purchasing longer -term securities  – that is, crediti ng the banks that the Fed  purchase s \nthem from with new reserves.  In practice, the Fed did some of both.  In the end, t he overall \namount of assets the central bank  held became much larger , growing from less than  $1 trillion to \napproximately $4.5 trillion , in large part due to these policy -related purchases of long -term \nsecurities .   \nWhile much of this growth was initially a result of intentional monetary policy action s \nand the operation of lending facilities  set up to provide liquidity during the financial crisis , there \nwere also secular trends unrelated to Fed policy that caused  the balance sheet to grow .  These \ntrends primarily affected the composition of Federal Reserve liabilities.  \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 8:30 P.M. on Monday, March 25, 2019 , U.S. Eastern Time , \nwhich is 8:30 A.M. on Tuesday, March 26, 2019 in Hong Kong  – OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n \n \n8 \n  What liabilities  finan ced the growing assets  on the Fed’s balance sheet ?  Before the \ncrisis, t he largest category of Fed liabilities was currency holdings.  Currency is held by domestic \nindividuals who use it as a medium of  exchange, but is also held abroad .  In some countries the \nU.S. dollar is the  de facto domestic  currency, whereas  in other countries the U.S. dollar is often \nused as  a store of value, hedg ing against the possibility of exchange rate depreciation of the local \ncurrency.    \nThe Federal Reserve passively issues currency  through banks  in response to domestic and \ninternational  demand  for currency from bank customers .  And w hen individuals hold U .S. \ncurrency, they are in effect providing an interest -free loan to the federal  government .12   \nAs Figure 2 shows, as of 2019, currency holdings were  more than twice the size of the  \nFed’s  entire  balance sheet in 2004.  It is important to note that this particular driver of currency \nliabilities  is not a monetary policy action by the Fed .  Since 2004, c urrency has grown from \nunder $700 billion to $1.66 trillion.  The change in currency holdings alone highlight s that the \nFed’s balance sheet will not be able to shrink to earlier levels.   \nOf cour se, Figure 2 also shows that in 2004, just under 90 percent of  the Federal \nReserve’s balance sheet was financed by currency .  And now that percentage is just over  40 \npercent .   \nAmong the non-currency  liabilities on the Fed’s balance sheet , “Other Liabilities ” and the \n“U.S. Treasury General  Account ” are, like currency  growth , not primarily  driven by monetary \npolicy actions .  The balance sheet would have need ed to grow to accommodate  these changes as \nwell.  In short, those who argue for returning to a balance sheet closer to the former $1 trillion  \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 8:30 P.M. on Monday, March 25, 2019 , U.S. Eastern Time , \nwhich is 8:30 A.M. on Tuesday, March 26, 2019 in Hong Kong  – OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n \n \n9 \n level from before the financial  crisis  are ignoring the non -monetary policy reasons that the \nbalance sheet has expanded.  \n Even if one picks a much shorter horizon, significant changes in the composition of the \nFederal Reserve ’s liabilities  are evident , as shown in Figure 3 .  From September 2017 to \nFebruary  2019, Federal Reserve  policymakers have very gradually reduced the overall balance \nsheet by letting some of the securities that are maturing roll  off.  However, this relatively small \nreduction on the  asset  side of the balance sheet  has been accompanied by increases in both \ncurrency and the U .S. Treasury  General Account on the liabilities side.  The result has been  an \neven larger shrinkage of  reserves  – a Fed liability  – than would have occurred due to the r olling \noff alone . \n Figure 4  shows the overall size of the balance sheet compared to the amount of excess \nreserves  of depository institutions  – the reserves in excess of  the minimums  required to meet \nreserve requirements .13  During the period whe n Federal Reserve policymakers  were reinvesting \nmaturing securities and holding the balance sheet ’s overall size  relatively constant, excess \nreserves were declining because the other liabilities mentioned  earlier were rising , absorbing \nreserves out of the banking sy stem .  With an enormous surplus of reserves already in the banking \nsystem, the Fed chose not to offset these reserve declines.  As total assets have declin ed, and \nother liabilities have continu ed to grow, excess reserves are declining more rapidly than  the \noverall balance sheet . \n Figure 5  shows central bank s’ balance sheet s relative to GDP in major industrial ized \ncountries.  Examining the central bank’s balance sheet assets as a share of GDP shows that t he \nFederal Reserve ’s balance sheet , relative to the size of its economy , is smaller than that of these  \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 8:30 P.M. on Monday, March 25, 2019 , U.S. Eastern Time , \nwhich is 8:30 A.M. on Tuesday, March 26, 2019 in Hong Kong  – OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n \n \n10 \n other major developed  countries.  This is despite the fact that as a reserve currency, international \ndemand for  U.S. currency will be considerably larger than is the case for other currenc ies.  \nAnother reason  the Federal Reserve ’s balance sheet is smaller as a share of GDP than other \ndeveloped countries’ balance sheets  stems from the  aggressive and proactive easing by the Fed \nduring the financial crisis , which restored U.S. growth faster th an otherwise .14  I would assert \nthat partly a s a result  of that aggressive action , the Fed was able to move sooner to unwind its \nemergency monetary polic ies and  the United States is  further along in the balance sheet \nnormalization p rocess relative to many peers.  \n Overall, these facts suggest that the balance sheet should not be expected to decline to \nanything close to the pre -crisis size , in my view .  Growth in non -monetary policy related  \nliabilities , like currency , make it quite likely  that the absolute size of the Fed’s  balance sheet will \ncontinue to grow.    \nHowever, the size of the balance sheet  — more specifically, the size of reserve balances \nin the banking system  — is also closely  related to how the central bank  choose s to conduct \nmonetary policy , and how we want monetary policy to react in the next recession.   I will now \nexplore these aspects of the balance sheet with you.  \n \nBalance Sheet Normalization  \n Following its January meeting, t he Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), the U.S. \nmonetary policy  decision -making body,  issued  a short statement regarding monetary policy \nimplementation  and balance s heet normalization .15  The Committee said:  \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 8:30 P.M. on Monday, March 25, 2019 , U.S. Eastern Time , \nwhich is 8:30 A.M. on Tuesday, March 26, 2019 in Hong Kong  – OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n \n \n11 \n The Committee intends to continue to implement monetary policy in a regime in \nwhich an ample  supply of reserves ensures that control over the level of the federal \nfunds rate and other short -term interest rates is exercised primarily through the \nsetting of the Federal Reserve's administered rates, and in which active \nmanagement of the supply of re serves is not required.  \n \nTwo aspects of the announcement are particularly notable as we consider the future size \nof the  Fed’s  balance sheet.   \nFirst, the FOMC indicated  that the Federal Reserve  would continue to operate in an \nenvironment of an “ample” supp ly of reserves, which implies a floor -type system  of interest rate \ncontrol , consistent with the operating framework used since the fall of 2008.  Prior to the \nfinancial crisis , the Federal Reserve  operated in a “scarcity of reserves ” monetary policy  \nframework .  That meant simply that  there were enough reserves in the banking system to satisfy \nshort -term borrowing and lending needs, but not more.  As a consequence, to maintain the \ntargeted level for short -term interest rates , the Fed regular ly conduct ed open -market operations \nby adjust ing the supply of  reserves  (and thus the federal funds interest rate ), given its estimate of \nreserves demand .   \nBut o nce short -term rates had hit zero and the Federal Reserve’s  asset purchases had \ndramatically expanded the supply of excess reserves, it could no longer set short -term rates by \nmaking small adjustments to the supply of reserves.  There were just too many reserves to do \nthat.  So the Federal Reserve  moved to a “floor system ” where we rely on a key administer ed \ninterest rate  that we can set  regardless of reserve levels: the rate the Fed pays on excess reserves . \nIn theory, this rate will  establish  a floor  below which market rates w ill not fall  (since  banking  \ninstitutions would  generally  not lend out short -term money at  a rate less than the rate the Fed \npays risk -free on banks’  excess reserves) .  The announcement that the Fed is  continuing with the \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 8:30 P.M. on Monday, March 25, 2019 , U.S. Eastern Time , \nwhich is 8:30 A.M. on Tuesday, March 26, 2019 in Hong Kong  – OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n \n \n12 \n floor system implies that we intend  to maintain an ample supply of reserves at depository \ninstitution s. \n A second implication  of the announcement was that within the context of  an ample \nsupply  of reserves, intervention to add or reduce reserves to offset other liability movements  is \nnot necessary  (thus the phrase , “active management of the supply of reserves is not re quired .”)  \nIn this operating model, excess reserves need to be ample  enough that surprise movements in  \nother liabilities on the Fed’s balance sheet  do not need to be offset  through open market \noperations . \n Figure 6 shows  the major liability categories over the past 15 years.  While currency \ndemand has increased quite smoothly overall, liabilities like  the U.S. Treasury General Account \nand Other Liabilities have shown significant fluctuations.  To avoid regular interventio ns to \nreduce  short -term interest rate volatility, reserves need to be large enough that large , temporary \ndeclines or surges in liabilities do not cause short -term rates to spike  or plummet .  With ample \nreserves, fluctuations in other liabilities do not need to be offset.  \n \nThe Balance Sheet and Recent Financial Market Turbulence  \n Some market analysts attribute turbulence in financial markets during  the fourth quarter \nof 2018 to the Federal Reserve’s continuing reduction of the size of its balance sheet.  In my \nview, however, concerns about the international economy, potential trade disputes, and a U.S. \ngovernment shutdown are much more plausible explanations for the financial market turbulence.   \nFor one thing, t he Fed’s reduction is still quite gradual .  And equity markets experienced  a \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 8:30 P.M. on Monday, March 25, 2019 , U.S. Eastern Time , \nwhich is 8:30 A.M. on Tuesday, March 26, 2019 in Hong Kong  – OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n \n \n13 \n substantial recovery in the first two months of 2019 , even while the runoff of the balance sheet \nwas slightly faster than  in the fourth quarter .  \n Figure 7  shows the monthly change in the Federal Reserve System assets .  By design , the \nrunoff was intended to be quite gradual.  The  runoffs during the  third and fourth quarter s of 2018  \nwere similar , with an average mo nthly decline of 0.9 percent in both periods.  A similar decline \noccurred in January  2019 , with a mor e rapid decl ine following in Fe bruary 2019 .  Despite the \nroughly similar magnitude of runoff , the stock market rose over the third quarter while falling in \nthe fourth  quarter of last year  and recovering again since the beginning of this  year.  So there \nseems to be little correlation between equity  market  movements and the relatively small and \nsteady  decline in the balance sheet.  \n Looking at another financial indicator – the behavior of term premia – also argues against \nthe idea that the reduction in the Fed’s balance sheet spurred market turbulence.  Conceptually, \nquantitative easing should work through the term premium , or the return needed to induce \ninvestors to hold long-term securities instead of short -term securities .  Term premia from 2004 to \nearly 2019 are shown in Figure 8 .  As the Fed purchases long-term securities, it raises the price \nand lowers the rate on those securities, thus reducing the term premium.  This also encourages \ninvestors to “bid up ” the price and lower the interest rates on other high -duration securities , so \nthat the Fed’s purchase s of government -guaranteed securities have beneficial spillover effects to \na wide array of other asset prices .   \nWith quantitative tightening , one would expect over time that Treasury yields and term \npremi a would move  higher.  In  contrast, last December the 10 -year U.S. Treasury rate fell and \nthe term premium remained quite low  – not the reaction one would expect if the very gradual \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 8:30 P.M. on Monday, March 25, 2019 , U.S. Eastern Time , \nwhich is 8:30 A.M. on Tuesday, March 26, 2019 in Hong Kong  – OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n \n \n14 \n reduction in the balance sheet w ere responsible for substantial tightening , which caused asset \nprices to fall . \n \nThe Balance Sheet Going Forward  \n Both the composition and size of the central bank’s balance sheet can influence  financial \nconditions , and thus  the path of the economy.  As I discussed earlier, holding the balance sheet ’s \nsize constant w ould still reduce the amount of excess reserves , as liabilities  – such as currency  – \ngrow over time .  While the point at which the balance sheet no longer is being reduced  is clearly \nimportant , another significant  issue going forward will be determining the point  at which  the \nFederal Reserve should once again begin purchasing securities to offset the decline in reserves \n(and the size of its balance sheet) that would otherwise occur as currency and other  liabilities  \ngrow .   \n Another key  issue will be the composition of the balance sheet  and the duration of the \nassets on it .  Figure 9  shows that the Fed  has been very gradually reducing the duration of U.S. \nTreasury  securities holdings  on its balance sheet .  Even so, the duration is far higher than it was \nprior to the financial crisis.  One reason for this rise in duration is shown in Figure 10 .  The Fed \ncurrently holds virtually no U.S. Treasury bills , which had been more than one -third of the Fed’s \nsecurities holdings prior to the financial crisis.   \nIn my view, one benefit of having both short - and long -maturity Treasuries on the Fed  \nbalance she et is that it provides a way to stimulate the economy through quantitative easing  \nwithout increasing the size of the balance sheet , should that be necessary .  As suggested earlier, \npolicymakers  could lower longer -term interest rates by selling Treasury bil ls and buying  long-\n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 8:30 P.M. on Monday, March 25, 2019 , U.S. Eastern Time , \nwhich is 8:30 A.M. on Tuesday, March 26, 2019 in Hong Kong  – OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n \n \n15 \n term Treasuries, leaving the size of the balance sheet constant.  But to do so, the Fed  need s to \nhave some Treasury bills on the balance sheet.  Thus , increas ing the share of U.S. Treasury bills \nand more quickly lower ing the duration of securities  held as assets  may be an important goal as \npart of the normalization  process .  This would give the Federal Reserve  the flexibility to take the \npolicy step of lengthen ing the maturity  of its balance sheet assets the  next time a s ignificant \neconomic downturn occurs.  \n \nConcluding Observations  \n Active use of the central bank’s balance sheet is a relatively new tool for monetary \npolicy.  As a n emerging part of the monetary  policy toolkit, altering the size and composition of \nthe central bank ’s balance sheet does not yet have a long history of careful analysis  of its effects.  \nIn fact, most central banks still see moving short -term interest rates as the primary tool to \ninfluence the economy.  However, I think it is important to understand how balance sheet \nchanges can and do impact the economy .   \nIn summary, i t is unrealistic to expect the Federal Reserve ’s balance sheet to return to the \nsize it was before the financial  crisis , for several reasons  that I have described today .  First,  the \ndemand for some of the Fed’s liabilities  – for instance  currency  – continue s to grow , which given \nthe binding characteristics of a balance sheet implies  the purchase of additional assets over \ntime.16,17  A second reason is that operating framework s affect  the desired size and composition \nof the balance sheet .  At the January 2019 FOMC meeting, the Committee announced plans to \ncontinue running a floor system with an abundance of reserves .  A “scarcity of reserves ” \nframework  like the Fed operated with before the financial crisis  would have a smaller  pool of  \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 8:30 P.M. on Monday, March 25, 2019 , U.S. Eastern Time , \nwhich is 8:30 A.M. on Tuesday, March 26, 2019 in Hong Kong  – OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n \n \n16 \n reserves and a smaller balance sheet than a floor system with an abundance of reserves.  Third, \nsome of the liability categories have become more variable, and if policymakers  want to avoid \nregular interventions in the  financial  market, it requires that there be enough excess reserves that \nthese fluctuations in liability categories do not create additional volatility in short -term rates.  \n As I mentioned today, some have suggested that t he Fed’s balance sheet is partly \nresponsible for financial market volatility at the end of 2018 , but I disagree .  The Federal \nReserve ’s balance sheet decline has been quite gradual, and proceeded along roughly the same \npath when stock  price s have been rising as whe n stock  price s have  been  falling.  Furtherm ore, I \nnoted that the term premium , the main mechanism by which  the balance sheet impacts the \neconomy, remains at quite low levels.  \n In conclusion , I will say that i n a hypothetical next recession, it may be that many central \nbanks have little room to reduce short -term rates .  This will likely generat e an increased need to \nutilize the balance sheet as a stimulative tool of monetary policy .  Therefore , it is important for \npolicymakers to continue to research how bal ance sheet operations influence the economy  – and \nI dare say it is important for market observers, lawmakers , and the public to become more \ncomfortable with the benefits of central banks using their balance sheet tools to pursue the public \ninterest .   \n Thank you.  \n   \n1 See, for example, the discussion of balance sheets in Corporate Finance  by Ross, Westerfield, and Jaffe.  \n \n2 See https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/bst_fedsbalancesheet.htm . \n                                                            \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 8:30 P.M. on Monday, March 25, 2019 , U.S. Eastern Time , \nwhich is 8:30 A.M. on Tuesday, March 26, 2019 in Hong Kong  – OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n \n \n17 \n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n3 See the March 20, 2019 statement Balance Sheet Normalization Principles and Plans :  \nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20190320c.htm . \n \n4 After the September 2017 FOMC meeting, it was announced that the program for gradually reducing the Federal \nReserve’s securities holdings would begin in October 2017.  \n \n5 Specifi cally, such actions would likely entail an expansion of reserves, which, along with the normal and gradual \nincrease in currency requirements, would significantly swell the size of central bank balance sheets.  \n \n6 See Chicago Fed Letter, No. 395, 2018, The S tructure of Federal Reserve Liabilities, by Thomas Haasl, Sam \nSchulhofer -Wohl, and Anna Paulson: https://www.chicagofed.org/publications/chicago -fed-letter/2018/395 . \n \n7 This is done to cover payments in the event that the Treasury is unable to issue debt.  \n \n8 After the January 2019 FOMC meeting, it was announced that the operating regime would continue to be a floor \nsystem. See https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20190130c.htm . \n \n9 If the Fed shrinks available reserves too much, then fluctuations in reserves due to factors beyond our control —\nsuch as the Treasury’s deposits to and withdrawals from its Fed account —could lead to a scarcity or surplus of \nreserves that would in turn caus e significant volatility in short -term interest rates. Knowing how large is an “ample” \nsupply is something we are learning about; but as I have outlined, it is essential to keep an ample supply if we are to \ncontrol short -term interest rates as we have in r ecent years.  \n \n10 Congress gave the Federal Reserve the authorization to pay interest on reserves, effective October of 2008.   \nPaying interest on reserves is an important tool as the Fed works to raise rates – because banks can receive interest \non reserves held overnight with the Federal Reserve, banks will not want to lend at a rate below what they can get \nfrom holding funds with the Fed.   \n \n11 The net income generated by the Fed’s balance sheet activity is turned over to the U.S. Treasury as part of the \ncentral bank’s annual remittance of earnings net of expenses.  \n \n12 When banks purchase currency from the Fed, they “pay” for it with reserves, and thus their reserve balances \ndecrease.  If the Fed wishes to offset this decline in reserves, the Fed can purchase  government securities, which \nreplaces the reserves in the banking system, maintaining the overall level of reserves even as currency increases.  If \nit does not, reserve balances in the banking system will decline as currency use increases.  Those Treasury  securities \nare assets on the Fed’s balance sheet. The interest earned by the Federal Reserve on these securities is ultimately \nreturned to the federal government.   \n \n13 It is important to note that there are other reasons for banks to hold reserves; for ex ample, banks use reserves to \nmeet their liquidity requirements of holding high quality liquid assets.  \n \n14 It is important to note  the figure also shows that the other central banks have significantly expanded their balance \nsheets.  \n \n15 See the January 30, 2019 Statement Regarding Monetary Policy Implementation and Balance Sheet \nNormalization:  https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressrelea ses/monetary20190130c.htm  \n \n16 As I demonstrated, currency is now much larger than the Federal Reserve’s entire pre -crisis balance sheet.  \n \n17 If we intend to operate in an environment of ample reserves, policymakers will need to match increased currency \ndeman d with increased Treasury holdings.",

Eastern Time on  \nMonday , April, 15  2019 OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n \n \nThe views expressed today are my own, not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal Reserve Board of \nGovernors or the Federal Open Market Committee.   \n  \n \n \nMonetary Policymaking in Today’s Environment: \nFinding “ Policy Space” in a Low-Rate World \n \n \nEric S. Rosengren  \nPresident & Chief Executive Officer  \nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston  \n  \n33rd Annual Cornelson Distinguished Lecture at \nDavidson College  \n \n \nDavidson, N orth Carolina  \nApril 15 , 2019 \n \n \n \n  \n\n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 8:00 P.M . on Monday, April 15,  2019 U.S. Eastern Time, OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n \n \n2 \n It is a pleasure to be at Davidson College and provide my  perspective on the economy.  \nDavidson is, of course, steeped in history and traditions.  There is even a connection here to the \nFederal Reserve.  As you likely know, Woodrow Wilson, who as president  signed the Federal \nReserve Act into law, was a student here for a time.  And t he Corne lson Lecture is another \nwonderful  tradition .  I feel honored to join the ranks of economists  you have invited here for the \nlecture.1 \nTurning from history and tradition to the present, I would say that i n many respects the \neconomy is doing quite well , especially if you’re going by the Fed’s dual mandate: stable prices \nand maximum sustainable employment .  Labor markets remain quite tight , which is  great news \nfor many – including this year’s graduating senior  class, who are about to enter the workforce .  \nWith the national  unemployment rate at 3.8 percent, employers have to compete vigorously  for \nworkers , and as a consequence, wage  increases have been trending up.   \nIn addition, one broad measure of the economy ’s strength , real  (or inflation -adjusted)  \nGDP, increased roughly 3 percent in 2018 – although since the start of th is year, the incoming \ndata suggest that economic growth has slowed .  As a result, f irst quarter GDP growth is likely to \nshow a noticeable slowdown relative to the 3 percent pace seen  last year.    \nAlso, the inflation rate remains slightly below the Federal Reserve’s  2 percent targe t.  To \nbe clear, t he miss  relative to our  target  is relatively modest;  core inflation  (measured using the \nPersonal Consumption Expenditures or PCE price index , which is Fed policymakers’  preferred \nmeasure) , averaged  1.8 percent over the past year  in the United States , just below the target .  \nHowever, inflation has been below target for much of the past decade , in large part due to the \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 8:00 P.M . on Monday, April 15,  2019 U.S. Eastern Time, OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n \n \n3 \n depth of the Great Re cession and the considerable amount of time needed after to recoup the \nlosses in activity and employment.2   \nAnd t he Federal Reserve is not  alone  in this .  The central banks of both Japan and Europe \nalso have had  difficulty bringing  inflation back to target  after significant recessions  of their own, \npersistently undershooting their  inflation targets  by an even larger extent  than the Fed .   \nExperiencing b elow -target inflation  rates , of course , factor s into Federal Reserve \nmonetary policymaking  decision s.3  One reason for the policy committee’s  decision to be patient \nin determining future rate adjustments , despite tight labor markets , is waiting  to see more \nconvincing evidence that inflation will achieve and sustain  the 2 percent inflation target.  \nIt is important to note that the  persisten ce of below -target inflation  risks having inflation \nexpectations  decline in response .4  As Japan ’s experience has sho wn, once inflation expectations \nreset to a level below target, it can be difficult to alter those expectations.  And there are \nconsequences throughout the economy.  \nA second potential problem is that  the combination of  low inflation rates and low real \nrates of interest provides the central bank very little room to  implement its traditional policy \nresponse to an economic downturn: lowering short -term interest rates .  Currently, the Fed has set \nthe target for its policy interest rate, t he federal funds rate, in a range f rom 2.25 to 2.50 percent , \nand the  effective rate in the marketplace has recently hovered around 2.4 percent.  In react ion to  \nmost recessions, the Federal Reserve’s typical reduction of the federal funds rate has been in the \nrange of roughly 5 to 6 percentage points .  Therefore, t he current  low interest  rate environment  \ngives policymakers  very little “room to maneuver ” in a hypothetical next recession , at least in the \ntraditional monetary policy mode of reducing short -term rates .  \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 8:00 P.M . on Monday, April 15,  2019 U.S. Eastern Time, OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n \n \n4 \n Today , I will discuss  why achieving  an inflation target is important, and , in particular, \nwhy it is important to have  what I will call monetary policy “ space ” to react to econ omic \ndownturns.  Then I will discuss some ways that the Federal Reserve’s  inflation target can be  \nmore firmly ingrain ed.   \nBy the way, t his discussion is particularly relevant this year , because the Federal Reserve \nis conducting a review of its  monetary policy “framework ” – or the set of tools and processes \nthat we use to define and attain high- level economic goals .5  An important part of that discussion \nis how to better reinforce the  2 percent inflation target. \n \nThe Problem: Finding Adequate  Monetary Policy “S pace” \nFigure 1  shows interest rates  in the Euro  Area, Japan, and the United States  since \nJanuary 2000.  In the years since the financial crisis, i nterest rates have remain ed low.  \nCompared to other recoveries , rates have stayed lower for longer throughout this now  quite \nextended  economic recovery.6  Unfortunately, Japan and Europe ’s recoveries have not been  \nstrong enough to justify an increase in short -term rates  to date in the current cycle.  As a result, \nwere these areas to experience economic downturns , the options of the associated central banks \nto cut short -term interest rates to stimulate the ir econom ies would be quite restricted.  In the \nU.S., we have experienced  a stronger reco very, and with the federal funds rate at  2.4 percent  \n(well below the interest rates seen at the peaks of previous recoveries ), monetary policymaker s \nhave more space to lower interest rates , if necessary,  than our counterparts in Europe or Japan.  \nFigure 2  shows the size of peak -to-trough cuts  in interest rates in the previous three \nrecessions.  In  each of  the past three episodes , including the relatively mild 2001 downturn, the \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 8:00 P.M . on Monday, April 15,  2019 U.S. Eastern Time, OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n \n \n5 \n Federal Reserve ha s lowered short -term interest rates by more than 5 percentage points .  As the \nprevious figure and discussion highlighted, this implies that policymakers  now  have much less \nlatitude to use short -term rates  to counter a recession.  The fact t hat other key economies  would \nbe able to respond even less aggressively  adds to the concern.  \nOf course, cuts in s hort-term interest rates are not the only monetary policy tool that \npolicymakers can use to combat economic downturns .  Central banks have  purchase d longer -\nterm assets to reduce the interest rates  on those assets , rates that are arguably much more tightly \nconnected to spending and employment decisions than their policy rates .  Figure 3  shows that as \na result of such asset purchases, desi gned to make economic conditions more accommodative, \nbalance sheets of central banks in the U .S., Euro Area, and Japan all increased significantly in \nthe last recession  and slow recovery  – in an attempt to make monetary policy more \naccommodative.  \nFigure 4  shows that 10- year government bond yield s in the U.S., Germany, and Japan \ndeclined significantly, in part  as a result of central banks purchasing these assets.  (Central bank \npurchase s push up demand, and thus price – and yields move in the opposite direction as the \nprice for debt securities).  However, long- term yields in Japan and in Germany are very  close to \nzero, giving the  monetary authorities  little space to push rates down further from current levels.7  \nIn the U nited States, the 10- year Treasury rate provides more space, but is still quite low by \nhistorical standards.  So this other  monetary policy tool  – influencing long -term rates  – would \nalso have limited power to respond to a hypothetical economic downturn, similar to the case with \nlow short -term interest rates .  \n \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 8:00 P.M . on Monday, April 15,  2019 U.S. Eastern Time, OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n \n \n6 \n The Importance of  a Symmetric I nflation G oal \nAll in all,  we live in a world where central banks in many developed countries have little, \nif any,  traditional monetary policy space with which to operate, should an economic downturn \noccur .  I expect that despite some deceleration from last year, the pace of growth in economic \nactivity will be enough to bring further reductions in the une mployment rate in the near term, so \na recession  is not my modal forecast.8  Nevertheless, the current low interest rate environment \nraises important issues about how to best conduct monetary policy.  For this reason, I will now \nturn to some data to explore further the issue of policy space  – and import antly the role of \ninflation and the inflation target .   \nAs Figure 5  illustrates, the nominal interest rate comprises two components .  The f irst \ncomponent is c ompensation for expected inflation , wherein  one hopes to earn a rate of interest \nthat increases one’s accounts at least as fast as the rate of inflation, otherwise your investment \nwill lose  real purchasing power as prices rise.  This component is shown on the chart as a \nforecast for core PCE inflati on.  The second  component is  the real interest rate.  The real interest \nrate in the long  run will depend on the return to investing in the real economy.  As such, t his rate \nwill be determined by non -monetary factors , like the rate of productivity growth and \ndemographic trends in labor force growth .   \nBoth of these factors have  been  growing more slowly of late, reducing the  real interest \nrate.  A risk in current circumstances is that  if inflation regularly undershoots the central bank’s \ninflation ta rget, inflation expectations may  fall.  In something of a snowball effect , a decline in \ninflation expectations c ould lead to further declines in  nominal  interest rates – ultimately \nproviding  even less policy space.  \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 8:00 P.M . on Monday, April 15,  2019 U.S. Eastern Time, OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n \n \n7 \n Figure 6  shows the core PCE inflation rate in each year since 1999, with the Federal \nReserve’s stated inflation target of 2 percent  indicated by  the horizontal line, although I should \nnote that the Fed first announced a formal 2 percent target in 2012.9  Most of the observations for  \nU.S. inflation since 1999 have been below our current  inflation target.  In the last 10 years , there \nhas only been one year – 2011 – in which inflation has exceeded the target , and then only barely . \nFigure 7  shows the frequency  distribution  of quarterly inflation rates over the past 20 \nyears .  Each bar  represents the number of quarters that the annualized inflation rate has been in \nthat particular range .  The  distribution clearly skews to one side – the bar s representing inflation \nbelow 2 percent have many more observations than the bars  representing inflation above 2 \npercent.  This is just another way of representing the below -2-percent inflation pattern in the \nprevious chart.  \nIn hindsight, i t appears that the 2 percent inflation goal has essentially acted more like a \nceiling , rather than a symmetric target  around which inflation fluctuates .  If the target w ere \nsymmetric, we would expect to see a more balanced distribution, with a roughly equal number of \nobservations above and below 2 perce nt.  This frequency distribution and its skewing below 2 \npercent  illustrates  one of the key reasons to hold interest rates steady  at present , as members of \nthe Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC)  await  stronger evidence that we  can consistently \nand symmetrically attain a 2 percent symmetric inflation target, a goal that has clearly been \nelusive over the past 2 0 years . \n \n \n \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 8:00 P.M . on Monday, April 15,  2019 U.S. Eastern Time, OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n \n \n8 \n Monetary Framework Considerations  \nWhat are the implications of all this for monetary policy?  And not just for current policy, \nbut for the broader ways that monetary  policymakers think about policy and the tools and targets \nthat are used – i n other words, the policy framework?  \nLooking forward, achieving  a symmetric inflation target is like ly to be that much more \ndifficult in a world where interest rates are low, given the constraint on reducing rates e nough to \nmove  inflation back towards (or above) the Fed policymakers’  target.   Low interest rates mean \nlimited monetary policy space, with a greater likelihood of reach ing the  effective lower bound \nfor interest rates  during a downturn.  This , in turn, means that inflation is more likely to underrun \nthan overrun the inflation target.  \nOne possible solution to this difficulty would be  to offset the undershoot of inflation \nduring recessions , whe n constrained by  the effective lower bound on interest rates,  with an \novershoot of inflation during the economic recover ies, as shown in Figure 8 .  Put differently, the \nFed could aim to achieve  its inflation target on average over the economic cycle.  This would \nallow the inflation rate to move within a range  centered around its target .  The figure highlights \nhow this would work in practice.   \nFigure 8 shows an inflation range of 1.5 to 2.5 percent , averag ing 2 percent ( on average  \nhitting the target ).  In contrast, if  inflation slips during periods at the effective lower bound, but \nwe only reach – but don’t exceed – 2 percent inflation during economic recoveries , then inflation  \nwill average below 2 percent over the cycle, as it has recently . \nFigure 9  shows that our below -2-percent average inflation  rate is not an  artifact of \nparticularly bad outcomes during the Great Recession, or any other period.  In fact, we have \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 8:00 P.M . on Monday, April 15,  2019 U.S. Eastern Time, OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n \n \n9 \n averag ed below 2 percent inflation, for both core and  total PCE  inflation measure s, whether \nlooking over the past  5, 10, 15, or 20 years.   \nA closely  related  alternative to focusing on an inflation range  is to more deliberately try \nto hit an inflation average  over a specified period of time.  While the details  of how inflation \naveraging is implemented can matter  – for instance , how m any years go into the average? D oes \nthe average take into account the future or just past outcomes ? When would we start the average \nin current circumstances ? – the bottom line is  that policymakers  would explicitly need more \ninflation outcomes above  2 percent than we have experienced over the recent past.  \nThe desirability of such a policy is that if recession lowers inflation, public expectation \nthat the Federal Reserve will generate higher -than-target inflation in the future should keep \ninflation expectations stable . This, in turn, will provide more policy  space to offset the next \nrecession.  In sum, the benefit of inflation averaging would be to make the extent of recessions \nless severe.  \nThis strategy of increasing the policy buffer is closely related to another alternative, \nwhich is referred to as “ price level target ing.”  Price level targeting attempts to keep the general \nlevel of prices close to an imaginary price line that grows at a fixed rate – say 2 percent.   Figure \n10 shows that if FOMC members  had committed to such a policy starting in 1999, actual prices \nover the next 20 years w ould have been consistently below that imaginary price line  – which is \nthe same thing as saying inflation has averaged below 2 percent over that period.  In order to \nreturn to the 2 percent target line, periods of below -2-percent inflation would need to be offset by \nperiods of above -2-percent inflation.   In that manner, successful price level target ing generally \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 8:00 P.M . on Monday, April 15,  2019 U.S. Eastern Time, OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n \n \n10 \n will engender inflation rates that vary symmetrically around the 2 percent target, somewhat like \nthe pattern depicted in F igure 8 . \nMy own preference is for the Federal Reserve to adopt  an inflation range that explicitly \nrecognizes the challenge of the effective lower bound.  We might be forced to accept below -2-\npercent inflation during recessions, but we would commit to achieving above -2-percent inflation \nin good times, so as to provide more policy space to counteract the next recession.  As an approach , it is eas ier to explain than price level targeting, is consistent with the Federal \nReserve’s  current 2 percent inflation target, and recognizes th at there ar e limits on policymakers’  \nability to be quite so precise in hitting an inflation  target.   \nRegardless  of my preferences , I am very happy to note that over the course of this year, \nthe Fed  will be gathering  input on whether we should change the way we think about our 2 \npercent inflation target  – in a way that would allow us to more effectively stabilize th e economy, \ngiven the constraints  I have discussed today .  Given the history of one -sided misses on inflation, \nand the likelihood of being constrained on the downside in interest rates moves, now is a good time to be having the discussion about the Fed’s  monetary policy framework. \nI would note that there are other ways to create more monetary policy space, i ncluding \nconsidering how the central bank  should allocate its  balance sheet assets , as shown in Figure 11.  \nI recently discussed a number of central bank  balance sheet  issue s in some detail .\n10  The topic is \nsomewhat technical, but very important – given that central banks may need to turn to balance \nsheet tools to stimulate the economy during the hypothetical next recession, given a low -rate \nenvironment with limited room to reduce rates before they reach zero .   \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 8:00 P.M . on Monday, April 15,  2019 U.S. Eastern Time, OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n \n \n11 \n Here, I focus on one aspect that is germane to today’s discussion.  By holding mostly \nlong-term securities, the Federal Reserve is lowering the long -term rate.  This flattening of the \nyield curve may provide more short -term interest rate space, but at a cost – if the Fed’s balance \nsheet had more short -term securities, there would be the ability to change the maturity \ncomposition in a downturn where we reach the effective lower bound, moving from short - to \nlong-term securities in order to push down long- term rates and stimulate the economy.   \nIf we want to have more capacity to lower long- term rates in recessions  without \nincreasing the size of the Fed’s  balance sheet , policymakers may  wish  to hold more short -term \nsecurities  in good times .  Figure 11  shows that the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet  currently \ncontains  no Treasury bills and more long -term securities than were h eld prior to the financial \ncrisis.  I am pleased that t he appropriate asset allocation of the Federal Reserve balance sheet \nwill be a topic in future FOMC discuss ions. \n \nConcluding Observations  \nNow is a good time to reflect  on the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy framework.  T he \nU.S. and many developed economies are likely to be challenged by the implications of a low \ninterest rate environment  for their  ability to offset recessions .  The reality of limited monetary \npolicy space provides important context for why the Federal Reserve should broadly consider its  \ncurrent policies and their  likely outcomes.   \nWhile I would currently prefer moving to an inflation range, I look forward to future \ndiscussions .  A key matter f or me will be considering whether the possible changes to the Fed’s  \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 8:00 P.M . on Monday, April 15,  2019 U.S. Eastern Time, OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n \n \n12 \n monetary policy framework could provide policy space for action in a hypothetical future  \neconomic downturn.  \nThank you again for inviting me to Davidson and for the opportunity to present this \nyear’s Cornelson lecture .  \n \n \n \n1 For more about the Cornelson Lecture series, see:  https://www.davidson.edu/academics/economics/cornelson -\nlecture.  \n \n2 For additional discussion, see Oct. 14, 2016 remarks at Federal Reserve Bank of  Boston annual economic \nconference, by Eric S. Rosengren, After the Great Recession, a Not -So-Great Recovery . \n \n3 The Federal Open Market Committee, or FOMC, is the U.S. monetary policy decision -making body.  \n \n4 Of course, if inflation rises above 2 percent we should be just as worried on the upside.  \n \n5 See https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/review -of-monetary -policy -strategy -tools -and-\ncommunications -fed-listens -events.htm  \n \n6  For example, consider the experience in t he wake of the, albeit milder, 2001 recession: The Federal Reserve kept \nrates at their low point for just under a year, and then raised them quite regularly from 2004 to 2006.  \n \n7  In fact, long -term yields in Germa ny and Japan have recently fallen below zero.   \n \n8 The modal forecast is th e most likely outcome forecasters see for the economy.  \n \n9 Saying “The inflation rate over the longer run is primarily determined by monetary policy, and hence the \nCommittee has the ability to specify a longer -run goal for inflation.

Eastern Time on  \nTuesday, May 21,  2019 OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n \n \nThe views expressed today are my own, not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal Reserve Board of \nGovernors or the Federal Open Market Committee.   \n \n \n \n \n“Monetary Policy  in a Low Inflation and  \nLow Unemployment Economy ” \n \n \nEric S.

I would like to thank the Economic Club of New York for inviting me to \njoin you today .  It is good to be with you.  \nMy remarks this afternoon will be about today’s economic environment , characterized by \nlow inflation and low unemployment  – and specifically about monetary policymaking in that \nenvironment .  I’ll touch on the outlook for the economy , and the Fed’s “dual mandate” goals  – \nmaximum sustainable employment and stable prices – where in the readings are sending \nsomewhat opposite signals at present.  I’ll spend some time walking you through the data and \nanalysis that underpin my views on the matter  of undershooting the target for inflation  that the \nFed has established .  And I’ll co mment on the implications for current policy , from my own \nperspective of course .  First, however, I’d like to spend a moment on trade, which is on \neveryone’s mind and of course has implications for prices and the broader economy.  \n \nTrade Issues and the U.S.  Economy  \nObviously , the last 10 days featured plenty of market volatility in response to difficulties \nsurrounding the trade negotiations between the United States and China .  It is still unclear \nwhether , and for how long , recently  proposed tariffs by the U.S. and China will be in effect .  \nU.S. tariffs are effectively taxes on imports , and our trading partners’ tariffs  are taxes they pay  \non our exports .1  Even before they are in place, an announce ment of a future tariff  might  affect \ntrade.2  In addition to the effects on imports and exports, policymakers would expect financial \nmarket s to react  to tariff announcements .  And if the tariffs are widespread  and prolonged , the \nfinancial market reaction would likely be greater, as would the overall slowing effect on  growth.   \n\n EMBARGOED UNTIL 12:10 P.M . on Tuesday, May 21,  2019 U.S. Eastern Time, OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n3 \n Of course, t ariffs matter when it comes to inflation , which we at the Fed are mandated to \nmanage .  In general, tariffs will tend to raise prices on imported goods  to the U.S.   Of course , \nthese effects can be mitigated by many factors, such as how easy it is to find alternatives to \ngoods subject to tariffs .  If Chinese produc ts have competitors in non -tariff locations , buyers in \nthe U .S. could simply shift purchases to  those competitors .  The same holds for U .S. exports.   \nBut general ly speaking , price levels for imported goods should rise due to the tariffs.3  \nHowever, for now, I am optimistically assuming that both sides in the trade negotiations will \nwork to reach an agreement .  I am also assuming that while the uncertainty is not helpful, it will \nbe transitory, and thus have only a modest effect on  the forecast  for the U.S. economy overall . \n \nThe Economic Outlook , and the Implications for Monetary Policy  \nSetting aside  recent trade -related  concerns , the broader U.S.  economy seems to  be \ndisplaying  a sounder footing than it was at the beginning of this year.  Equity markets declined \nsignificantly in the fourth quarter  of last year, but had largely recovered  prior to recent events.  \nOther  concerns  – for example , worries about foreign growth slowing as a result of Brexit , and \nabout the Chinese economy faltering  – appear to have subsided since the beginning of the year .  \nAnd first -quarter growth in the U.S. was stronger than many forecasters expected.   \nConsistent with a reduction in some non -trade risks , and improvement in financial \nconditions, the higher -frequency U.S. economic data to date  are consistent with a moderate pace \nof economic growth.  A recent survey of professional forecasters posted  a median growth rate for  \n2019  real GDP of 2.6 percent.4  While this growth rate is a little bit stronger than my own \n\n EMBARGOED UNTIL 12:10 P.M . on Tuesday, May 21,  2019 U.S. Eastern Time, OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n4 \n forecast, both the consensus outloo k and my own forecast suggest a modest step down from last \nyear’s pace but still imply enough momentum to push the unemployment rate  down even further .   \nClearly, h owever, the uncertainty surrounding U.S.-China trade negotiations pose s a \npotential downside risk to this forecast.  If the trade uncertainty is prolonged, financial markets \ncould retrench further , and households and firms could curtail spending .  While m y baseline \nforecast assumes that a trade agreement  will occur  without ser iously disrupting global trade or \nglobal economies, it may be some time before that uncertainty is resolved . \n Assuming that the consensus of private forecasters proves  right , and we continue to have \nsolid growth in the U .S. – with no significant foreign sh ocks – what should that imply for \nmonetary policy?   \nThe U.S. unemployment rate is currently at 3.6 percent, well below the median of Federal \nOpen Market Committee (FOMC) participants’ estimates5 of  the longer-run unemployment  rate,  \n4.3 percent , as described in the Fed’s most recent Summary of Economic Projections ( SEP).6  If \nthe central bank  focused only on labor markets, the current level of  unemployment might  call for \na somewhat more restrictive  monetary policy.   \nBut, of course , Congress has also charged the Fed with the responsibility of attaining a \nlow and stable inflation  rate.  As of the most recent reading, the core PCE inflation rate is 1.6 \npercent, somewhat below the Fed’s  2 percent inflation target .  These latest data foll ow a period \nof several years during which inflation ha d generally under run the 2 percent target , although the \nsame measure nearly reached 2 percent as recently as last December .  Lower than desired \ninflation might imply a somewhat accommodative , or looser,  policy  stance – to ensure that  \ninflation rise s more persistently  to the Fed’s  2 percent target.   \n\n EMBARGOED UNTIL 12:10 P.M . on Tuesday, May 21,  2019 U.S. Eastern Time, OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n5 \n The Fed ’s dual mandate from Congress had not posed this type of  conflict  in the early \nyears after the global financial crisis, as unemployment had  been undesirably high and inflation \nsomewhat low.  Both impl ied the need for monetary stimulus .  But today , the two elements of the \nFed’s  mandate are  sending opposing signals  for monetary policy, with low unemployment \nperhaps suggesting a bit tighter poli cy, and low inflation the opposite.  \n The Federal Reserve’s  current monetary policy framework says that policymakers  will \ntake a “balanced ” approach when the implications of our goals  are conflicting.  That is, \npolicymakers  will weight equally the extent to which employment and inflation deviate from \ntheir goals in setting policy.   \nIn weighing currently conflicting employment and inflation readings , it is important to \nconsider  whether the se opposing outcomes  are likely to persist, or reflect only temporary \ndeviations.  In current circumstances , if one were concerned that the economy would falter  \nsignificantly , the likely rise in unemployment and fall in inflation further  below target might lead \npolicymakers to  ease.   If, alternatively, one expect s the economy to grow quickly  and believes \nthat the recent decline in inflation was only temporary , a further decline in unemployment and \neventual rise in  inflation to target might lead policymakers  to tighten.  \nAnd in fact, c urrently most forecasts envision  the economy growing somewhat above the \nrate considered its “ potential ” this year , then slowing to a growth  rate somewhat below potential  \nin subsequent years .  And most see the current low readings on inflation as temporary.   \nIn this setting, I see no clarion call to alter current policy  in the near term .  I view current \npolicy as slightly accommodative and likely to be consistent with  inflation returning to the Fed’s  \n2 percent inflation target over time.  This is likely to occur more rapidly if tariffs are imposed.  \n\n EMBARGOED UNTIL 12:10 P.M . on Tuesday, May 21,  2019 U.S. Eastern Time, OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n6 \n However, given that inflation has underrun the  target over the last several years, it is wise to \nadmit to some uncertainty about this part of the forecast.  It is my view  that the Fed can afford to \nwait to see if that forecast does  indeed  materialize.  In addition, the  presence of a prominent  \ndownside risk – more disruptive trade negotia tions  – seems to me to  be another important reason \nfor policymaker patience until this source of uncertainty is more  resolved . \n \nChallenges with Undershooting I nflation  \n Now let me walk you through the data and analysis that underpin my views on the matter  \nof undershooting inflation . \nFigure 1  shows inflation as measured by the  core PCE inflation  rate, which excludes \nfood and energy prices, and total PCE inflation , which includes all consumer goods and servi ces \n– from January 2014 through March 2019 .   \nParenthetically, t he Fed’s  inflation goal is couched in terms of total inflation  – because , \nof course , food and energy prices are important components of consumers ’ expenditure s, but \neconomists  often look to core inflation as a measure that may better capt ure the underlying \nmovement of inflation .  As implied by the difference between the core and total inflation \nmeasures shown in Figure 1, f ood and energy prices can move around quite dramatically , but \nmost often those shifts are temporary and not reflective of the underlying inflation trend. Thus , \nthe core measure that excludes food and energy prices  may provide  a more reliable indicator of \nwhere the total inflation rate is heading .   \nBoth series – core and total – hit 2 percent toward the end of last year, but both are \ncurrently undershooting the 2 percent target.   As discussed a moment ago, a n important question \n\n EMBARGOED UNTIL 12:10 P.M . on Tuesday, May 21,  2019 U.S. Eastern Time, OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n7 \n for monetary policy makers  is whether these misses reflect more persistent factors, such as \nreduc ed inflationary pressures or a reduction in inflation expectations, or instead  more temporary \nfactors.  \n Figure 2  shows the same graph  as Figure 1  – now with a third line  representing  the \nTrimmed Mean PCE measure , which is calculated by the  Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas .7  The \nTrimmed Mean PCE inflation rate is an alternative measure of core inflation.   Rather than \nexcluding specific categories that tend to be volatile, like food and energy, the Trimmed Mean \nmeasure is more agnostic about which series are “noisy ,” and instead exclude s those prices that \nmoved up or down dramatically  during  a specific  period.  By excluding these outliers , it is hoped \nthat the Trimmed Mean  measure better captures the underlying trajectory of inflation , by \nfocusing on  the price movements of goods and services that did not experience unusually high or \nlow transient  price level movements that period.  As Figure 2 shows, the Trimmed Mean \nmeasure since 2014 has been gradually returning to the 2 percent inflation target, and is currently \n1.96 percent , which rounds to the Fed’s  2 percent inflation target.  \n Figure 3  provides an example of two prices  that declined  substantial ly recently : indices \nfor clothing and footwear , and for portfolio  management and investment  advice  services.  Note \nthat the scale is much larger than  in the previous two charts.  The behavior of the clothing and \nfootwear  category  is notable , because the price  index registered a decline of more than 2 percent \nin the most recent report. This movement ref lects, in part , changes in the way the government \ncollects information on apparel  prices, a change that presumably does not reflect underlying \npricing trends.  The price for portfolio  management  and investment advice  services is based on \nthe fees paid to asset managers and thus is tied to fluctuations in asset values, so th e downward \n\n EMBARGOED UNTIL 12:10 P.M . on Tuesday, May 21,  2019 U.S. Eastern Time, OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n8 \n movement in asset prices at the end of last year resulted in  a lower index  value  for this \ncomponent .  \nThese are two examples that demonstrate why looking at the Trimmed Mean PCE \ninflation rate  may provide  a better sense of the underlying inflation  trend .  One can see the \nbenefit of  exclud ing these sorts of large , but temporary , price changes.  \n Figure 4  shows the inflation forecasts from the previously mentioned Survey  of \nProfessional Forecasters , for core inflation through 2021.  The median forecast implies that \nrecent declines in inflation are indeed transitory, as the medi an forecast sees  core PCE very close \nto the Fed’s  2 percent inflation target in 2020 and 2021 . \n Given that inflation has been undershooting the Federal Reserve’s  2 percent inflation \ntarget over much of the last several years, it makes sense to ask why policymakers  should have \nmore success achieving the inflation target over the next several years ?  Certainly , one reason is  \nthat labor markets are tight.  Figure 5  shows FOMC participants’  median estimate for the \nunemployment  rate in the long er run, the solid line, along with the range of FOMC members’ \nestimate of  what the unemployment rate will be in the long er run, the shaded region.  The dashed \nline shows the actual unemployment rate.  At 3. 9 percent  for the first quarter of 2019 and more \nrecently 3.6 percent for the month of April , the current unemployment rate  is below not only the \nmedian estimate, but indeed the bottom of the range  of estimates  for full employment.  With \nlabor markets tighter than what is estimated as sustainable in the longer run, wages would be \nexpected to gradually rise.  Of course, w orkers  getting paid more  is good news, and up to a point \naccelerating wages can be paid by productivity gains and shrinking profit margins  – but at some \npoint , accelerating wages result in firms raising prices more quickly.   \n\n EMBARGOED UNTIL 12:10 P.M . on Tuesday, May 21,  2019 U.S. Eastern Time, OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n9 \n  Figure 6  shows that consistent with the recent and likely continued tightening of labor \nmarkets, wages and salaries have been gradually rising.  In the wake of the financial crisis, wage  \ngrowth  was quite low, but ha s now risen to about  3 percent , whether measured by average hourly \nearnings or by  the employment cost index measure of workers’  wages.  Wage growth  at 3 \npercent is consistent with a standard benchmark in which workers are compensated for cost-of-\nliving increases  — roughly 2 percent inflation  — plus the roughly 1 percent increase over the \nsame period in their productivity.  \n If productivity growth increases , wages can rise even further without putting pressure on \nthe net cost to employers, and thus easing the pressure on employers  to raise prices more quic kly \nto cover the higher wage costs .  Figure 7  shows a 20 -quarter moving average of a productivity \nmeasure, the change in real output per hour  worked .  This measure had dipped below 1 percent  – \nwell below productivity gains seen 15 years ago.  However, more recently this measure of \nproductivity has risen somewhat above 1 percent.   Again, i f productivity continues to gradually \nimprove, there should be room for non -inflationary wage increases  of the sort  that are not \n“financed” by low er profit margins .  However, in the absence of continued improvements in \nproductivity, a rising trend in wages could eventually  place upward pressure on inflation.  \n Another potential source of price pressures could be generated if tariffs become more \npreva lent and more persistent .  If virtually all goods imported from China were subject to tariffs, \nthe resulting increase  in prices would likely become much more apparent to consumers.  \n While tight labor markets and the potential for further t ariffs  could cause some upward \npressure on prices, it is interesting to note that inflation has been tracking below 2 percent for \nsome time.  Figure 8  shows the average rate of inflation over a variety of time periods .  For all \nof the periods displayed, average inflation has been below the Fed’s  2 percent target.8  Because \n\n EMBARGOED UNTIL 12:10 P.M . on Tuesday, May 21,  2019 U.S. Eastern Time, OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n10 \n our framework states  that the inflation target is to be  symmetric  — that is, the Fed  cares equally \nabout inflation that exceeds or falls short of 2 percent  — average  measured inflation would not \nbe expected to deviate significantly from  2 percent over long periods of time  in such a \nframework .  \n While policy  should not overreact to temporary inflation misses from the Fed’s  target, it \nwould not be desirable to continue consistently undershooting inflation.  Regularly \nundershooting could cause inflation expectations to decline, a process that has been shown to be \ndifficult to reverse in other developed areas, including Japan and Europe .  For this reason, the \ncurrent stance  of monetary policy, which I view as mildly accommodative, should be helpful in \nrestor ing inflation more convincingly to the 2 percent inflation target over time.  \n \nConcluding Observations  \n In sum, i nflation is  currently  below the Fed’s target, and has fairly consistently  been \nbelow  target  in recent years .  Still , labor markets remain tight , and there is  an upward trend in \nwages.  Given those current outcomes for our dual mandate  goals , I believe the Fed’s  current \nframework and its balanced approach  do not provide much impetus to alter the stance o f \nmonetary policy at this time . \n The Federal Reserve is currently conducting a review of its monetary policy framework , \nincluding  the strategy, tools, and communi cation practices the U.S. central bank  uses in pursui ng \nits dual mandate .  An interesting question for the ongoing discussion of the monetary policy \nframework is whether the Federal Reserve should aim for  somewhat above -target  inflation \nduring recoveries , knowing that it will likely  underrun its inflation goal in downturns or \n\n EMBARGOED UNTIL 12:10 P.M . on Tuesday, May 21,  2019 U.S. Eastern Time, OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n11 \n recessions .  This concern is heightened by the likelihood that prevailing short -term interest rates \nwill be  low, and thus more likely to  hit the effective lower bound  during downturns .   \n Such an approach  would not change the Fed’s  inflation target over the cycle .  Rather, it  \nmight reinforce the notion that policymakers  aim to achieve 2 percent inflation on average , not \nallowing long periods of below -2 percent inflation to reset inflation expectations below the  2 \npercent inflation goal .  \n Thank you.  \n \n \n1 If imposed, retaliatory tariffs affect both the amount  purchased and the prices paid of both imports and exports, \nboth for final purchases and for key inputs to products produced here and abroad. Thus a “trade war” can have a \nvariety of impacts on the economic outlook.  \n \n2 Specifically, imports and exports may  temporarily surge to avoid the tariff. On the other hand, if people assume \nthat a tariff will be temporary, perhaps because they believe that trade negotiations will eventually be successful, \nbuyers in the U .S. and China may defer purchases, awaiting a return to normal prices.  \n \n3 In terms of inflation, temporary tariffs will raise prices on imports. The price effects on imports could be muted if \nfirms can find suppliers with a similar -enough product that is not subject to the tariff, at a price below the after -tariff \nprice of the taxed good. Similarly, if exporters can find alternative markets, the price effect will be muted. But it is \nunlikely that this will be a common occurrence, at least in the short run, so the effect on producers’ and sellers’ costs \nwill often be hard to avoid. In addition, producers of un -tariffed products similar to those that have been so taxed \nmay view the imposition of tariffs as providing an opportunity to raise prices; this would be e specially true in \nindustries in which wages have been rising more quickly, squeezing profit margins.   \n \n4 The most recent survey was released by the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia on May 10 , 2019 .

Central European Summer Time (3:30 A.M. U.S. Standard Time)  \non Friday, June 21, 2019,  OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n1 \n  \nGood Morning.  I am very happy  to be here with you and to be able to offer comments on \nthe paper by Professor Mitsuhiro  Fukao .  I commend the conference organizers for convening \nthese important discussions of macroprudential issues.  \nMany would agree that  the Japanese financial  crisis was perhaps the m ost significant \nfinancial event  of the 1990s.  Indeed, b anking problems that brought about dramatic \nmacroeconomic effects had already been occurring in emerging markets , but the Japanese crisis \ndemonstrated  that developed countries with large financial institutions could experience  \nproblems that affected  not only their domestic economy , but also  global markets  and other \ncountries’ economies .   \nIn many ways, the Japanese banking crisis had a long aftermath and many residual \neffects .  Indeed, I would suggest that many of the fiscal and monetary policy issues that emerged \nin the Japanese c risis are still being grappled with today.  \n The paper by Professor Fukao provides rich details o f what led to th e financial crisis  in \nJapan .1  He emphasizes many of the macroeconomic dynamics  that contributed to financial \ninstitution s’ problems, particularly the asset price bubbles that had emerged in both real estate \nprices and stock prices.   These problems were compounded , of course,  by institutional features \nthat allowed banks to rapidly increase their real estate lending  – both directly, and through \nrelated Jusen,2 which grew as real estate prices rose .  The situation  was exacerbated by  the cross -\nholding s of shares  between banks and their customers, which increased exposure even  as the \nstock market rose.   In addition, many Japanese  banks did not have stable funding models .  The \nlong-term credit banks were particularly exposed to “runnable” sources of funding through their \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 9:30 A.M. Central European Summer Time (3:30 A.M. U.S. Standard Time)  \non Friday, June 21, 2019,  OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n2 \n use of easily -redeemed bank debentures, which  ran as emerging problems became more \napparent.3  These initial problems were compounded by other  factors  that hobbled financial \nintermediation and ultimately lengthened the time to recovery  in Japan  – in particular, the slow \nsupervisory and regulatory response .  (Banks were not forced to address problems,  transparency \nrelated to th ose problems was discouraged , and accounting strategies were adopted that \npostponed their recognition .)   \n I agree with Professor Fakao  that these elements are the primary source of the pre-crisis \nbuild -up, as well as important contributors to  the length of the crisis.  My remarks today , \nhowever, will focus on two aspects of the crisis which receive less attention in the paper.   \nThe first aspect I will cover  has to do with the significant macroeconomic repercussions \nof the Japan ese financial  crisis  of the late 1990s .  These repercussions , I will argue,  highlight the  \nimportan ce of  avoid ing replication of these problems, and why conferences like this one  that \nfocus on macroprudential supervision and regulation are so important.  Indeed, t his is th e second \naspect of the crisis on which I will spend some time today.   I believe  it is important to consider \nhow macroprudential regu lations – including appropriate stress testing and tools such as the \nCountercyclical Capital Buffer, or CC yB – could have mitigated the Japanese banking \nproblems.4  I will conclude my remarks with some observations  about the current Japanese \nbanking landscape . \n \nMacroeconomic Spillovers from Banking Problems  \n At the time of the Japanese banking crisis, much of the focus among economists and \npolicymakers was on avoiding the fiscal  problems generated by bank bailouts.  This focus \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 9:30 A.M. Central European Summer Time (3:30 A.M. U.S. Standard Time)  \non Friday, June 21, 2019,  OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n3 \n resulted in significant work on incentives5 created by deposit insurance and bank ba ilouts, and \nthe implications for taxpayers when these problems occurred.  There was much less focus , \nhowever,  on the  macroeconomic consequences of banking problems . \n Once Japanese real estate prices and stock prices began to decline, the banking problems \nspilled over to the real economy.  With non -performing loans rising, and capital eroding, \nJapanese banks tightened  lending conditions .6  (Loans, of course, are assets for banks so in times \nof diminished capital banks pull back on lending to maintain capital -to-asset ratios.)  At the same \ntime, and somewhat to the contrary, some Japanese  banks lent to weakened firms , temporarily \npropping the m up so as to avoid (or at least postpone) realization of losses , to avoid further \ndepleting bank capital .  This resulted in the allocation of the already -reduced supply of loanable \nfunds  towards “zombie”  firms ,7 a significant misallocation of credit .8  This misallocation of \ncredit even included firms focused on export s, as well as firms operating within the domestic \neconomy.9   \nHowever, the problems did not only affect the Japanese economy.  Because Japanese \nbanks were actively involved in global marke ts, capital -constrained banks that needed to reduce \nassets often reduced  their global lending before restricting domestic lending.10  This constituted \nan additional misallocation, as they often reduced lending to well-performing , collateralized \nborrowers in other countries  that were  not experiencing the sorts of difficulties  that were  being \nexperienced in Japan.11 \n The extent of the problem s revealed by the Japanese banking crisis should have been \nsufficient to lead many countries to enhance their suite of macroprudential tools.  Unfortunately, \nit took an even bigger and more global problem – the financial crisis that began in 2008  – before \ncountries turned to the job of improving macroprudential policies.  Given the polici es that have \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 9:30 A.M. Central European Summer Time (3:30 A.M. U.S. Standard Time)  \non Friday, June 21, 2019,  OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n4 \n been implemented subsequ ent to  the global financial crisis, I think it is fair to ask whether such \npolicies  would  have helped in the Japa nese situation .  While clearly speculative, my own view is \nthat with effective implementation of macroprudential policies, many of the issue s would have \nbeen substantially mitigated.  \n \nMacro prudential Tools \n Perhaps one of the most important policy innovations that grew out of the global financial \ncrisis of 2008 was the development and implementation of bank stress tests.  These  tests address  \nboth prudential and macroprudential goals .  An effective stress test assesse s whether , in the \npresence of a large negative shock, banks will be able to remain well capitalized and continue  to \nprovide intermediation services  so vital to economic activity .   \nAs Figures 1 and 2 show, real estate prices  and stock prices in Japan both began a \nparticularly sharp rise in the middle of the 1980s.  Capital gains on banks’ holdings of stocks and \nlow losses on their real estate portfolios led banks to p ut more money into real estate, amplifying \nthe cycle.  \n Had the Japanese authorities put in place bank  stress tests  – and rigorously applied the \nresults – the banking crisis may have been less severe.  Consider the fact that t he “severely \nadverse ” scenario  in this year’s U.S. stress test envisions a peak to trough decline in stock prices \nof 50  percent  and declines in residential and commercial real estate prices of 25  percent  and 35  \npercent, respectively.   Had Japanese superv isors applied  a similar stress test to Japanese banks , \nthe bank ing institutions  would have been encouraged to retain  much  more capital , giving them \nsignificantly more cap ital as a buffer  when asset prices did decline.  It would have also \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 9:30 A.M. Central European Summer Time (3:30 A.M. U.S. Standard Time)  \non Friday, June 21, 2019,  OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n5 \n highlighted the exposure to Jusen  and to stock ho ldings, potentially forcing  banks  to reduce these \nexposure s, since these areas would carry higher capital charge s.  Since stress tests are normally \nreleased publicly, some of the potential systemic concerns could have been publicly recognized  \nearlier, potentially making it less feasible to  hide losses.  This greater transparency might also \nhave led to a more vigorous recapitalization of banks.  \n A second tool that would have been helpful is the CCyB.   As asset prices rose abruptly, \nsupervisors could have  increased the  CCyB , building  a much bigger bank capital cushion during \nthe period when asset prices rose.  Complementing  the stress test, this capital cushion would \nhave further insulated banks from  the capital -eroding effects  of falling asset prices , and likely \nwould have discouraged aggressive lending into increasingly risky sectors .  Importantly, once \nasset prices began to fall , the CCyB could have been reduced  – easing  binding capital \nrequirements , and therein reducing the pressure on  banks to shri nk domestic and global  lending .  \nWhile buffers  induced by stress tests or the CCyB  would have been unlikely to completely \neliminate the “ credit crunch ” caused by  binding capital  requirements , they would certainly have \nhelped.  \n \nJapanese Banking Problems Today  \n Today, one must acknowledge that the state of the Japanese macroeconomy  poses \nsignificant challenges for Japanese banks.  The country ’s aging population an d very low birth \nrates  reduce the available lending opportunities for banks.  In addition, because these \ndemographic features imply a lower real growth rate for the economy, they have contributed to \nvery low term premia, and this makes less profitable  the traditional role that financial \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 9:30 A.M. Central European Summer Time (3:30 A.M. U.S. Standard Time)  \non Friday, June 21, 2019,  OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n6 \n intermediaries play in transform ing short -term deposits into long-term loans.   With monetary \npolicy keeping both short - and long -term rates very close to zero, the  spread of long over short \nrates that is normally an important source of profits for banks is almost nonexistent .   \nAs Figure 3  shows, the average return on assets for the largest banks  in Japan  is quite \nlow, and significantly lags that of the largest banks in the U .S. and Europe.  As shown in Figure \n4, the difficult  lending environment has also resulted in an average price to tangible book  ratio – \na measure of the market value of the bank  – which  lags international peers.  \n Naturally, a  prolonged period of depressed returns may encourage bank management to \nreach for yield.  One example of this reach -for-yield behavior might be  seen in Japanese banks ’ \ninvest ments  in tranches of collateralized loan obligations, or CLOs.  Although t he AAA tranches \nof CLOs receive high assessments  from rating agencies, they also pay substantial premiums \nrelative to U .S. Treasuries or  the AAA tranches of other securitized products , reflecting the \nmarket’s assessment of their riskiness .  This raises questions not only about the comparability of \nratings across asset classes, but also , more importantly , about how such positions will fare in t he \nnext downturn.  \n Figure 5  shows the CLO holding s of one large Japanese bank  that publicly reports them .  \nThe data are drawn from the bank’s publicly available annual report.   Over the past three years, \nthe bank’s CLO exposure has risen  – as reported in the financial press – and is now larger than \nthe bank’s Tier 1 common equity.  While CLO structures have improved since  the financial \ncrisis, the riskiness their large premiums reflect , as well as  the lack of liquidity , could become \nprobl ematic in a depressed global economy , should such a scenario emerge .12  Even if the \ntranches in question did not default, t heir ratings , along with their market valuations,  would \nlikely migrate lower.  \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 9:30 A.M. Central European Summer Time (3:30 A.M. U.S. Standard Time)  \non Friday, June 21, 2019,  OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n7 \n  The combination of  low returns and seeming reach -for-yield behavior raises important \nquestions about whether Japanese banks will remain resilient  in a possible future global \nrecession , should one occur .  How critical are more vibrant and profitable banks for dynamism in \nthe economy?   And how will  Japan’s banks fare in  an economic downturn given their current \nperformance?    \n \nConcluding Observations  \n In summary and conclusion, I would observe that t he Japanese  financial  crisis  of the late \n1990s  bore significant implications  for the entire Japanese e conomy .  The banking problems \nwere costly to taxpayers, as significant government resources were employed to recapitaliz e the \nbanks .  However, much more importantly, Japan ’s domestic economy was severely impacted , \nwith lasting  effects .  In addition, because of the global reach of the largest Japanese banks, the \nproblems were essentially exported , as Japanese banks pulled back on foreign lending in order to \nbring  assets better in line with their shrunken capital .  Essentially , Japanese banks reduce d their \nglobal footprint.  \n Had macroprudential policies been in place  and exercised , some of these problems might  \nhave been mitigated.  Rigorous stress tests would have revealed emerging problems, required \nretention of more bank capital, and di scouraged aggressive lending.  A CCyB  would  similarly  \nhave brought about a larger capital cushion to absorb shocks , which would  have reduced the \nneed for such dramatic shrinkage of lending when asset prices declined.  \n Despite the passage of time and adoption of better policies, one could argue that the \nJapanese banking system is now, once again , being threatened by adverse economic conditions.  \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 9:30 A.M. Central European Summer Time (3:30 A.M. U.S. Standard Time)  \non Friday, June 21, 2019,  OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n8 \n A shrinking population, aging demographics, and very low interest rates prov ide very little room \nfor Japanese banks to operate profitably .  This of course  provides an  incentive to reach for yield , \npotentially implying  additional risk-taking.   \nAll this raises questions about  how res ilient the banking system is , or could be,  in the  face \nof some future global downturn .  All in all, my view is that  Japan, like the U nited States, might \nbenefit from considering an expanded set of macroprudential tools to enhance  the financial \nsystem’s resilience in the face of potential global economic scenarios.  \n Thank you again for the opportunity to discuss Professor Fukao’s paper and to offer these \ncomments on the macroprudential implications of the 1990s Japanese financial  crisis.  \n \n1 See Causes of Japanese Financial Crisis in the late 1990s , Mitsuhiro Fukao.  \n \n2 Jusen are non -bank financial institutions in Japan, created in the 1970s as subsidiaries of banks.  \n \n3 A Bank debenture is an unsecured loan certificate issued by a company, backed by general credit rather than by \nspecified assets.  \n \n4 For additional  discussion of the CCyB and other financial stability  policy tools , see March 23, 2018 remarks at the \nTenth Conference of the International Research Forum on Monetary Policy by Eric S.

Rosengren  \nPresident & Chief Executive Officer  \nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston  \n \n \n2019 Annual Meeting of the  \nCentral Bank Research Association  \n \n \nColumbia University  \nNew York, New York   \nJuly 19 , 2019  \n \n \n \n \n\n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 4:30 P.M. EST on Friday, July 19, 2019, OR UPON DELIVERY  \n1 \n  Good afternoon.  It is a pleasure  to serve on a panel with such distinguished  central \nbankers , to discuss the very important issue of central bank independence.  The experience and \nglobal reach of the panelists serve as reminders that th e issue of independent central banks is \nhighly relevant around  the world.  \n As I begin and throughout my remarks t oday, I hope to clarify  what central bank \nindependence  is, and what it isn’t.1  Doing so requires  distinguish ing between the “what” and the \n“how” of monetary policy in the U.S. – what goals the central bank is supposed to achieve, and \nhow it pursues those goals.2  \nIn the U.S., the what  is the set of Congressionally  mandated  goals for monetary policy , \nfor which the c entral bank is accountable.  The how encompasses the tools authorized by \nCongress and how we use them , which the Fed has altered over time to achieve those goals  as \nconditions change.  To me, central banks need not have independence with respect to the what – \nthe end goals, which are set by the elected representatives.  But central banks should have \nindependence with respect to the how – the means of getting there .  Former Federal Reserve \nVice Chair Stanley Fischer referred to this as having “instrument independence” but not “goal \nindependence.”3 \nRegarding what  a central bank is charged with achieving, I believe t he people’s elected \nrepresentatives in government sh ould set goals for the nation’s central bank.  In many countries \nthere is a single  stated mandate  given to the central bank – for example, achieving  a particular \nnumerical inflation rate , or keeping  the inflation rate within a particular range.4  In contra st, since \n1977 the Federal Reserve in the United States has operated under a dual Congressional mandate , \nwith the two goals essentially summed up as maximum sustainable employment and stable \nprices.5   \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 4:30 P.M. EST on Friday, July 19, 2019, OR UPON DELIVERY  \n2 \n No consideration of independence would be complete wit hout a discussion of \naccountability.  So, before turning to the “how” I’d like to digress for a moment, to provide a bit \nof detail on the Fed’s mandate, as well as the Fed’s accountability for implementing its mandate \nin the public interest.6 \nIn January 20 12, the Fed (through its policymaking Federal Open Market Committee or \nFOMC)  adopt ed a formal monetary policy framework  containing the explicit numerical objective \nthat it views as consistent with its Congressional price -stability mandate.7  The FOMC noted in \nits statement that the Committee judged that inflation at the rate of 2 percent8 was most \nconsistent over the longer run with the Fed’s statutory mandate.9   \nAt the same time it reiterated its commitment to attaining the other aspect of  the dual \nmandate, maxim um sustainable  employment .  On this, let me note that the maximum sustainable \nemployment  rate may change over time depending on variables beyond the Fed’s control, such \nas the demographic  composition of the workforce, and other labo r market characteristics .  As \nsuch, the framework recognizes that the Fed cannot choose a target for maximum employment.  \nSo the Fed aims to achieve its best estimate of maximum sustainable employment, recognizing \nthat the factors that determine it change over time.  \nThe Federal Reserve Reform Act of 1977, which added the dual mandate, also contained \nthe first of several iterations of accountability mechanisms for the Fed’s execution of its dual \nmandate, including reporting to and consultation with Congress.10  Today, under Section 2B of \nthe Federal Reserve Act,11 the Chairman of th e Board of Governors is required  to testify at semi -\nannual hearings before Congress ional committees12 on efforts, activities, objectives and plans of \nthe Fed in conducting monetary po licy.  The Fed is also required to submit written reports to \nCongress on the conduct of monetary policy and economic developments and prospects, taking \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 4:30 P.M. EST on Friday, July 19, 2019, OR UPON DELIVERY  \n3 \n into account develop ments in unemployment, productivity, exchange rates, international trade, \nand other factors .  This appearance and reporting process is a key way  in which Congress \noversees the Federal Reserve and holds it accountable for the responsibilities it has been \ndelegated.    \nWhile in some countries an explicit  numerical  inflation goal is mandated by the \ngovernment,13 in the United States  only the broad  goals of price stability and maximum \nemployment are  set by the government and are somewhat open to  interpret ation  by the Federal \nReserve  – and explicitly answered to in monetary policy hearings.  \n Havi ng touched on the “what,” let me say that how a central bank achieves its goal or \ngoals is inherently a more technical enterprise.  It includes the specific instruments used to \ninfluence the economy, the operating details of how these instruments are to be  implemented, the \nstrategies to weigh various economic conditions in determining the setting of policy instruments, \nthe models used to make sense of economic data and to forecast outcomes over time, and the \ncommunications that the central bank uses to clar ify its intent and augment the transmission of \npolicy through financial markets.  \nSimply put,  monetary policy  decisions center primarily on the technical processes by \nwhich central banks determine how best to interpret and implement the government -mandated \ngoals.  For example, understanding how key economic relationships in the economy work to \ntransmit central bank actions to employment and inflation outcomes, and trying to detect when \nsuch relationships are changing, are both the sorts of technical endeavor s that are central to \nsetting policy.   \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 4:30 P.M. EST on Friday, July 19, 2019, OR UPON DELIVERY  \n4 \n It is important that central banks have flexibility to adjust  their tactics to a changing \neconomic environment .14  This technical work often needs to be completed quickly.  Also , it is \nquite possible that the mandated  goals of the central bank – which center on attaining medium -\nrun economic prosperity – can differ substantially from the understandably shorter -term \npressures facing elected officials.   Allowing  the central bank  the independence to alter its \ninstruments  as it deems necessary in the short - to medium -run reduces the possibility that \npolitical  or partisan  pressures will divert the central bank from its mandated monetary policy \ngoals . \nTo reiterate , central bank independence is not about deciding what to pursue  but rather \nallowing the central bank to determine how best to pursue it  (while  holding the central bank \naccountable for as much) .  For the Federal Reserve, while long -term goals are determined by \nCongress,  the day-to-day implementation of policies is and should be  conducted based on data \nand technical analysis, independent of short -term political objectives .15 \n Now I will briefly cover a few key insights from academic work on central bank \nindependence.  Then I’ll turn to the economic data to consider the im plications of central bank \nindependence, and look at the change over time in certain concepts focus ed on  by the central \nbank, as evidenced by mentions in official meeting records.  I’ll also briefly touch on the Fed’s \nreview, under way, of its monetary policy framework.  This exercise demonstrates, in my view, \nthe Fed’s commitment to using its tactical independ ence, coupled with accountability and \ntransparency, to service the public interest.  \n \n \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 4:30 P.M. EST on Friday, July 19, 2019, OR UPON DELIVERY  \n5 \n Emergence of Formal Studies of Central Bank Independence  in Academic  Literature   \nIn order to understand central bank independence, it is important to take into account  \nsome of the academic literature on the subject.  It is notable that much of this literature emerged \nfrom the study of periods in which inflation was high and variable, and in some cases in which \ncentral governments used their country’s central bank to achiev e fiscal objectives , essentially  \n“printing money” to finance spending without regard for the inflationary consequences.16  \nMuch of the earliest academic literature on central bank independence in the U .S. was \nmotivated by the historical experience of high and variable inflation in the late 1960s and early \n1970s.   In particular , Allan Meltzer’s A History of the Federal Reserve  documents how closely \nFederal Reserve Chairman Arthur Burns consulted with the Nixon administration, and attributes \nthe accommod ative monetary policy of that time to responding to executive branch pressure to \nsupport the expansion of fiscal policy, given the Vietnam War.17     \nAs inflation  rose dramatically  in the late 1960s and the 1970s, economists began to focus \non the institutional reasons behind the failure to contain inflation.  Many of the earliest academic \narticles focused on political economy motivations for a central bank allow ing inflation  to rise .  \nFor ex ample, Robert Barro and  David  Gordon ’s A Positive Theory o f Monetary Policy in a \nNatural Rate Model  provide s a model where in the central bank tries to over-stimulate the \neconomy , pushing the economy  below the natural rate of unemployment, which the public \nanticipates, resulting in higher inflation.18  They suggest, h owever, that this bias can be \nattenuated or even avoided, if the central bank is constrained  to focus on maintaining low \ninflation.  How to constrain the central bank to avoid this inflationary bias is a non -trivial \nproblem, and an issue that Ken neth Rogoff’s The Optimal Degree of Commitment to an \nIntermediate Monetary Target  seeks to address .  Rogoff essentially advocates for a simple model \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 4:30 P.M. EST on Friday, July 19, 2019, OR UPON DELIVERY  \n6 \n where the central banker places more weight on inflation than an elected government would, and \nas a result generates a lower inflation rate.19  \nThis theoretical literature was followed by  empirical studies that focused on empirical \nmeasures of central bank independence, looking in the data for an association between the \nindependen ce of central banks so measured and their countries’ inflation outcomes.20  In general, \nthe studies  found that countries with more independent central banks have lower inflation rates , \ncompared with countries with less independent central banks.  These empirical findings have \nbeen used to  support the international trend toward s central bank independence , but so too have \nthe egregious examples in which some governments use their central bank as a printing press, \nuniformly leading to poor economic outcomes . \n \nThe Evolution  and Implications of  Independen ce  \n In the United States, the independence of the Fed eral Reserve  has evolved along with \ngeneral ly held  views on the benefits of central bank  independence.21  Figure 1  highlights  periods \nwhere actual economic outcomes deviated from maximum employment and stab le prices since \n1960 .  It plots the “loss function” for the Fed, expressed as the sum of squared  deviation s of \nunemployment from an estimate of the natural rate of unemployment , and squared deviations of \ninflation from  two different esti mates of the target for inflation.22  The largest losses , as the chart \nshows,  occur in the 1970s as inflation and unemployment rose ; in the early 1980s when Federal \nReserve Chairman Paul Volcker slowed down the economy, raising unemployment significantly \nso as to bring down the elevated inflation rate ; and in the aftermath of the financial crisis  of \n2008 , when unemployment (but not inflation) was quite elevated .  The losses of the 1970s \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 4:30 P.M. EST on Friday, July 19, 2019, OR UPON DELIVERY  \n7 \n clearly ha d their roots in the lack of independence Al lan Meltzer documented.  The 1980s losses \nwere indirectly related to independence, too, as they stemmed from the painful but necessary \nremedies to the earlier era where independence was compromised.  \n Of course t his figure  reflects the U.S. experience.  But longer e conomic history around \nthe world contains more dramatic examples in which monetary policymakers lack ed \nindependence from the short -term financing constraints faced by fiscal policymakers, sometimes \nresulting in ruinous h yperinflation.  We learn what central bank independence is , not only \nthrough academic studies, but  also through its absence  during such episodes.  \nThe framework the Fed found itself in during th e 1960s and 1970s raised doubts that the \ncentral bank could attain its goals , likely related to the concern that the Fed had not been as \nindependent of short -run goals as it should have been, resulting in elevated inflation .  Figure 2  \nprovides mentions  of the word “credibility” from FOMC meeting transcripts .23  The word  \nreceived little attention during the 1960s and early 1970s, but became increasingly common  as \nthe inflation rate rose after the mid -1970s.  Once th e amended Federal Reserve Act  provided \nmore explicit goal s for monetary policy, the F ederal Reserve sought  to maintain credibility in \norder to achieve price stability.  With a clearer mandate  that delegated the attainment of ultimate \ngoals to the FOMC,  the policy -making body  was empowered to take actions consistent with that \nmandate.  \nHowev er, a clearer mandate also means making unpopular decisions, sometimes at \ninopportune times , as discussed in the seminal Barro and Gordon work .  Specifically, in order to \navoid the tendency to overheat the economy and build inflationary pressures, the cent ral bank \nhas, at times , needed to slow an unsustainably rapid expansion by raising interest rates.  Such \npolicy actions may not be uniformly popular, even if they aim to sustain an expansion and avoid \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 4:30 P.M. EST on Friday, July 19, 2019, OR UPON DELIVERY  \n8 \n the costs of rising inflation.   Such times particularly require greater transparency  about what the \nFed is doing, and why .  As Figure 3  shows, the mentions  of the word  “transparency ” in FOMC \nrecords has risen over the past 20 years.   \nTransparency also improves accountability.  For examp le, increas ed transparency at the \nFed has included clarifying annually our strategy of long -term goals and objectives , at the first \nFOMC meeting  of the year , and adopting an explicit inflation target of 2 percent.  What’s more, \nincreased transparenc y around  goals  make s it easier for the public and Congress to evaluate how \nwell the Fed’s actions are performing relative to those goals .  \nBecause Congress provides oversight  of the central bank , but naturally respond s to public \nconcerns, it has become quite important for the Fed to communicate more clearly not only with \nCongress, but also with the public at large.  This increased focus on clarity and transparency is \nshown by the increased mentions  of the word “ communic ation ” in FOMC meetings , in Figure 4 .  \nCommunication played very little role in the meetings prior to 1990, but has become much more \nof a priority .24  Announcements around FOMC meetings – which  had once  been quite obscure  – \nnow include a statement  describing the policy action and its justification , a press conference  with \nthe Chair of the FOMC,  detailed minutes  released shortly after the meeting,  and, with a lag, \nverbatim transcripts.  In addition, all FOMC members – members of the Fed’s Board of \nGovernors and the 12 Reserve Bank presidents – deliver economic outlook talks that provide \nupdates on the state of the economy and how the economic data align with our dual mandate.  \nGiven all this, the public has the opportunity for much greater visibility  into the actions the Fed  \ntakes, and hopefully a much better understanding of why we believe these actions are necessary \nto attain the public’s long -run goals .   \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 4:30 P.M. EST on Friday, July 19, 2019, OR UPON DELIVERY  \n9 \n With greater clarity on goals, and more transparency and communication around how \npolicymakers  alter policy  to achieve those goals, there has been considerable success in changing \nthe inflation experience .  Figure 5  shows that the FOMC  in its deliberations has focused on \nkeeping inflation expectations well anchored  – by which we  mean ensuring that the public \nbelieves the Fed will act to consistently attain its  inflation target .  The hope is that a highly \ncredible inflation goal will lead to well -anchored inflation expectations which, in turn, will imply \nthat temporary changes in p rices will not lead individuals to alter their longer -run expectations of \ninflation, and thus short -run blips in inflation will be transitory rather than persistent.   Figure 6  \nshows a marked change in the behavior of inflation since the late 1970s.  The hi gh and variable \ninflation of the 1970s has been replaced by a low and remarkably stable rate of inflation since the \nearly 1990s . The Dallas Fed’s Trimmed Mean PCE inflation rate measure, the solid  line, shows \nthat the temporary blips in inflation discussed above have indeed remained temporary, and so \ninflation has remained quite close to policymakers’  2 percent target for most of the past two \ndecades.  \nAn advantage of a stable inflation process with  well-anchored expectations is that it \nprovides the central bank greater leeway to offset bouts of high unemployment during recessions. \nFigure 7 highlights that while monetary policymakers  have more flexibility with well -anchored \ninflation expectations, th ose expectations cannot be taken for granted.  Following periods in \nwhich the economy has stretched beyond full employment, recessions frequently ensued.   \nEarlier in our hi story, increased inflationary pressures forced the central bank to react with \ntighter credit conditions.  More recently, an over -stretched economy has been associated with \nconcerns about financial instability.   \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 4:30 P.M. EST on Friday, July 19, 2019, OR UPON DELIVERY  \n10 \n Indeed, a s Figure 8  highlights, the FOMC  has increasingly discus sed financial stability \nconcerns  at its policy meetings .  The mentions of terms associated with financial instability \nduring FOMC discussions , tracked in the figure , reflect the significant financial -market \nturbulence  that led to, and accompanied, the past two recessions .  Central bankers strive to attain \nsustainable  economic expansions.  Financial instability that arises in part from an overheated \neconomy has been the proximate cause of recent U.S. downturns.  Thus, maintaining a focus on \nfinancial stability concerns remains critical .  \n \nCentral Bank Independence and the Fed’s Monetary Policy Framework  \n Independence is one element of a much broader issue – the monetary policy framework. \nThis year , the Federal Reserve has embarked on a broad  review  of its framework  – that is,  the \nstrategy, tools, and communication practices the Fed  uses to pursue its monetary policy goals .  \nBecause the Fed wants to hear from a broad set of public constituents about its performance in \nattaining goals on their behalf, t his review include s a “listening tour ” with forums featuring a \nwide range of public perspectives at Reserve Banks  across the country  and at the Board of \nGovernors in Washington D.C.  A Federal Reserve System -sponsored conference held at the \nFederal Reserve Bank of  Chicago , for instance, solicit ed viewpoints from both academic \nresearchers and representatives of low -income and under -represented groups .  Later t his year, the \nFOMC  will discuss the economic research and public perspectives offered during  these events,  \nand will  determine whether the F ed should consider  changes to its framework consistent with the \ngoals established  by Congress.  \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 4:30 P.M. EST on Friday, July 19, 2019, OR UPON DELIVERY  \n11 \n  This may seem like an unusual event, and in some respects it is, but i t is important to note \nthat the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy framework has changed signi ficantly over the past 50 \nyears .25  For example , Figure 9 shows how frequently money aggregates and specifically M1 \nand M2 we re mentioned  during FOMC meetings  since the 1960s .  While they received \nsignificant attention during the 1970s and 1980s, they have not been mentioned with any  great  \nfrequency over the past 20 years.  The decision to deemphasi ze money aggregates in \npolicymaking reflected real-world changes in financial markets and financial institutions  – \nchanges  that made aggregates less reliable  indicator s of underlying macroeconomic \nfundamentals , which in turn made monetary policy based on these aggregates less effective at \nachieving the Fed’s goals .   \nMore recently, during the financial crisis, the Federal Reserve aggressively used  asset \npurcha ses (in shorthand,  its balance sheet ) to lower long -term interest rates so as to stimulate the  \neconomy during the  extended financial turmoil and an economic downturn , once short -term \ninterest rates reached the effective lower bound .  Figure 10  shows that the Fed’s balance sheet \ndid not receive  much attention , in terms of mentions during FOMC meetings,  prior to the crisis – \nbut became widely discussed as interest rates approached zero  during the financial crisis .  \nSimilarly, Figure 11  shows that  “forward guidance ” – that is, communications that are used to \nshape expectations about the future path of interest rates – was a tool that was primarily \ndiscussed only when  short -term interest rates approached zero.  Both of these tools reflect ed \nchanges in the Fed’s  framework that were responses to evolving conditions and the realities of \nthe moment – the need to continue to provide monetary stimulus despite short -term interest rates \nbeing at the effective lower bound , yet with an unemployment rate still well above a level \nconsistent with maximum employment.   \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 4:30 P.M. EST on Friday, July 19, 2019, OR UPON DELIVERY  \n12 \n My examples are chosen to demonstrate that the value of independence lies not only in \ndelegating the setting of the policy instrument to the central bank, but also in providing the \ncentral bank the f reedom to change other aspects of its framework as it deems necessary to best \nachieve its mandated goals.  This ability to dynamic ally change the implementation of monetary \npolicy  — flexibility in the how with which I began this discussion  — is a critical aspect of \nindependence that has received less attention in the discourse around central bank independence .   \nImportantly, w hile the tactics  the Fed chose in response to evolving economic circumstance were \ninnovative and new, they did not change the what —that is, they were consistent with meeting the  \noverarching  statutory mandate provided by Congress to return as quickly as possible to \nmaximum  sustainable  employment and price stability.    \nOur history shows that the Fed has frequently changed the instrume nts it uses to attain \npolicy goals, and has changed how the Committee has used communications to explain its \ndecisions, articulate its goals, shape expectations, and improve accountability for its delegated \nauthority.  An issue of particular importance is recognizing that consistently attaining the 2 \npercent inflation target has become increasingly challenging in a world with very low interest \nrates, which implies a higher likelihood that future economic downturns will result in short -term \nrates quickly hit ting their effective lower bound.  The Fed’s  current framework review will try to \nassess whether there are ways in which we might change the how of policy to better address this \nchallenge going forward, ensuring that inflation and inflation expectations remain well anchored  \naround our two percent goal.   \nMy own view is that o pen and transparent discussions of monetary policy issues  will help \nprovid e the public a better understanding of those challenges and how the central bank hopes to \naddress them.  For a central bank to prove the value of its tactical  independen ce, it needs to \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 4:30 P.M. EST on Friday, July 19, 2019, OR UPON DELIVERY  \n13 \n evolve with changes in the economy, and explain clearly why its policie s are consistent with \nachieving the overarching mandate  from the peoples’ elected representatives . \n \nConcluding Observations  \nThe Federal Reserve receives its mandate from Congress and is accountable to the public \nand their Congress ional representatives  for carry ing out that mandate.  The appropriate central \nbank i ndependence for the Fed  is not independence from Congressional oversight or \naccountability , nor is it independence to set some new, broad goals that supersede those \nmandated by Congress .26  However, the degree of independence  the Fed has  over the “how” or \nthe “means” (instrument independence) has included  the flexibility to implement  monetary \npolicy in a way that responds effectively to changing  economic conditions so as to best achieve \nthe Fed’s  Cong ressional dual mandate of maximum employment and price stability.   \nEmpirical work has highlighted that  better economic outcomes occur over the longer term \nwhen the central bank’s policy implementation is independent from the type of cyclicality that \ncan b e induced by trying to meet short -term objectives.   In the U.S., that independence is based \non a combination of delegated responsibility to achieve the legislated mandate, along with a \ndecades -long process of developing understanding among legislators, adm inistrations, the public, \nand the central bank about the long -run benefits of central bank independence – essentially, that \nthe primary goal of the Fed is to attain the long -run goals  that best serve the public’s interests . \nIn closing I will provide a more  colloquial rationale for the delegation of  the “how” that \ncomes with  central bank independence.  In truth, in modern life we  ask people all the time to act \non our behalf , with independence .  For example, lots of very smart people leave it to commercial \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 4:30 P.M. EST on Friday, July 19, 2019, OR UPON DELIVERY  \n14 \n airline pilots to get them to their destination , plot ting the best course and fly ing the p lane through \nany emergencies.  B ut we expect the  pilots  to keep us informed, too.  And we certainly expect \nhomebuilders to construct what i s in our blueprints, but we  leave the plumbing and wiring to \nthem , albeit with frequent reports and updates .  And  speaking from personal experience,  some \npeople hire a wedding planner or caterer to help execute a wonderful event – one that they  \ndescribed and helped to plan,  but in the end  leave to the  wedding planner to execute,  \ntroubleshoot , and also not let things get out of hand.27  All analogies are imperfect, but these \nillustrations bear some similarities to central banking.  \n Thank you again for the opportunity to be part of such a distinguished panel and to offer \nthese comments on central bank independence.  \n  \nNOTES  \n \n1 The focus of this talk is governance issues related to monetary policy.  It is important to note, however, that the \nFederal Reserve also plays an important role in bank supervision, financial stability, and the U.S. payment system.  \nThese remarks do not a ddress governance issues related to these other functions of the Federal Reserve.  \n \n2 Some would suggest it also entails broadening a bit the notion of what is included in the “how.” Traditionally, \nindependence has focused on the freedom to set our policy i nstrument in the way that we think will best achieve our \ngoals. It may well be worth exploring including in the domain of independence additional elements of our monetary \npolicy “framework” — including which policy instrument we use, the tactics we use to s et the instrument, and the \nways we communicate about the rationale for our policy, as well as our intentions for future policy. But that \nexploration is largely beyond the scope of my talk today.  \n \n3 See Nov. 4, 2015 speech by Vice Chair Fischer entitled, Central Bank Independence , at the 2015 Herbert Stein \nMemorial Lecture National E conomists Club, Washington, D.C . In this speech he discussed the difference between \n“instrum ent independence” in which “the central bank has control over the policy instruments it has been assigned ,” \nand “goal independence” in the establishment of operational goals.     \n \n4 Australia is an example of a country that has an inflation range.  Australia's inflation target is to keep the annual \nconsumer price index (CPI) inflation rate between 2 and 3 percent, on average, over time.  \n \n5 The Federal Reserve Act provides the followi ng monetary policy goals, “promote effectively the goals of \nmaximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long -term interest rates.”  The first two are the dual mandate.                                                              \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 4:30 P.M. EST on Friday, July 19, 2019, OR UPON DELIVERY  \n15 \n                                                                                                                                                                                            \nModerate long -term interest rates are generally viewed as a product of the first tw o, provided that the maximum \nemployment is a sustainable maximum employment.  \n \n6 Above all, accounta bility resides in the fact that lawmakers have the authority to adjust the Fed’s mandate and \nmodify its powers and the instruments available to it, as they have exercised from time to time through the Fed’s \nhistory .  \n \n7 The longer -run goals were first articulated in the FOMC’s January 25, 2012 press release and have been reaffirmed \nannually. See https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/FOMC_LongerRunGoals.pdf .  \n \n8 As measured by the annual change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures.  \n \n9 January 25, 2012 was the first time that the Federal Reserve released a n FOMC statement of longer -run goals and \nmonetary policy strategy that included an explicit inflation target: “The Committee judges that inflation at the rate of \n2 percent, as measured by the annual change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures, is most \nconsistent over the longer run with the Federal Reserve's statutory mandate.”  \n \n10 The Full Employment and Balanced Growth Act of 1978 (better known as the Humphrey -Hawkins Act) amended \nthe Employment Act of 1946.  \n \n11 American Homeownership and Economic Opportunity Act of 2000 (114 Stat. 2 944, 3028), adding a new Section \n2B to the Federal Reserve Act, 12 U.S.C. Section 225b.  \n \n12 The Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs and the House of Representatives C ommittee on \nFinancial Services.  \n \n13 The European Central Bank is mandated to achieve only price stability, but the ECB has provided the specific \nimplementation goal.  The Governing Council adopted this definition in 1998: “Price stability is defined as a ye ar-\non-year increase in the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) for the euro area of below 2 percent.”  It then \nfurther clarified price stability in 2003 as: “It aims to maintain inflation rates below, but close to, 2 percent over the \nmedium term.”  Thus, a verbal mandate with clear implementation guidance by the central bank is consistent with \nthe practice in the United States, though the United States has a dual mandate.  The Bank of England receives an \nannual letter from the government confirming th e explicit mandate they should follow.  The 2018 letter provides an \nexample: “The Bank of England Act 1998 (the Act) requires that I specify the definition of price stability and the \ngovernment’s economic policy objectives at least once in every period of 12 months beginning on the anniversary of \nthe day the Act came into force.  I am doing that today by publishing the remit for the Monetary Policy Committee, \nwhere the only change is an update to the timing of the open letter process.  I hereby re -confirm t he inflation target \nas 2 per cent as measured by the 12 -month increase in the Consumer Prices Index (CPI). The inflation target of 2 per \ncent is symmetric and applies at all times. This reflects the primacy of price stability and the forward -looking \ninflat ion target in the UK monetary policy framework.” See: \nhttps://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/upload s/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/752077/PU2207_\nMPC_remit_web.pdf   \n \n14 For example, as money aggregates became less predictive of inflation, the Federal Reserve stopped focusing \nmonetary policy decisions on growth in money aggregates.  \n \n15 For a more skep tical legal discussion of the need for central bank independence see Conti -Brown, P.

While the  authors find \na strong negat ive correlation between central bank independence and inflation, they do not see significant \ndifferences when looking at real variables.  \n \n21 Note how the Federal Reserve is structured to provide independence.  For example, the Federal Reserve does not \nrequire congressional appropriations, Federal Reserve Governors are appointed to  long terms, 14 years, and the \nReserve B ank presidents are not a ppointed by the President nor require Senate confirmation.  \n \n22  For more discussion, see: Fuhrer, J., Olivei, G., Rosengren, E ., and Tootell,  G.

Prior to June 1967, these documents were called historical minutes.

Rosengren  \nPresident & Chief Executive Officer  \nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston  \n \n \nThe Leo J.

U.S. Standard Time on Tuesday, September 3, 2019 OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n \n \n1  Good afternoon .  Let me begin by thanking Stonehill College for i nviting me to speak .  \nAnd l et me also congratulate the College on the opening of the new Meehan School of Business.  \nSummer is usually regarded as a time to be more relaxed, take some vacation time, and \nput your worries aside.   In summertime,  Gershwin suggested , the livin’ is easy.    \nUnfortunately, this year, the financial markets didn’t get the memo.  August saw a  series \nof announcements regarding  possible  additional tariffs ; discussions about possible future tax \ncuts; a significant fall in the 10-year Treasury rate , which now stands at 1.5 percent ; and a one -\nday decline in the Dow Jones Industrial Average of over 800 points,  followed by elevated \nvolatility in the Dow over subsequent days.   \nIndeed, i t has not exactly been a low -key, calm summer  in the markets .  Which begs the \nquestion – what are these financial market gyrations telling us about the economic outlook ? \n Let me point out that d espite the se headline -grabbing swing s in financial  conditions , \ndomestic economic  conditions have remained relatively benign :   \n The economy grew by 2 percent in the second quarter, and forecasters are expecting \ngrowth in the next two quarters to be similar.   \n The unemployment rate reached a nearly  50-year low of 3.6 percent in April , and \ncurrently stands at 3.7 percent .  Forecasters are expecting th ese near -record lows to \ncontinue for at least the next two quarters.   \n Inflation , as measure d by the PCE price index , is running below the Federal Reserve’s  2 \npercent target, but an alternate measure that remov es outsized moves that are likely to \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL  \n5 P.M. U.S. Standard Time on Tuesday, September 3, 2019 OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n \n \n2 represent one-off changes – known as the Dallas trimmed mean  PCE – shows inflation \nrunning at 2 percent .1\n \nSo, with economic conditions relatively strong,  why has financial market volatility \npicked up  so markedly  this summer ? \nFinancial market participants are certainly concerned that risks related to international \ntrade and geopolitic s have intensified.  Tariffs are a tax on imported goods  and, along with t he \nimpact of retaliatory tariffs, they increase the risk that the earnings of firms reliant on foreign \ntrade will be hurt.  The reduction in earnings for these firms could affect asset valuations.2    \nIn addition , and perhaps more important ly, potential trade disruptions are emerging  at a \ntime when many U.S. trading partners are facing mounting economic challenges.  For example , \nChina, t he world’s second -largest economy , faces a number of concerns about the future \nrobustness of its economy .  China is heavily reliant on trade, so trade restrictions will take a bite \nout of the country’s economic activity.  Moreover, t he situation in Hong Kong is raising \nconcerns on many levels, including  from an economic standpoint .  Other countries are vulnerab le \nto possible U.S. tariffs  as well.  Japan , South Korea,  and ma ny European economies are even \nmore  dependent on trade  than the United States  and face a number of unusual challenges of their \nown.3  \n \n  \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL  \n5 P.M. U.S. Standard Time on Tuesday, September 3, 2019 OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n \n \n3 Exploring t he Yield Curve  \n In addition to the se important global  headwinds , we see that  yields  on the 10 -year U.S. \nTreasury bond have fallen below many short -term yields, resulting in an inverted yield curve.  In \nthe past , yield curve inversions have often  preceded economic downturns.   \nHowever, the current situation is somewhat different, in my assessment .  Previously , \nmost of the yield curve inversions were driven by the Federal Reserve raising short -term rates \nwell above the level expected to prevail in the long run , in order to slow the economy down and \nprevent inflation from accelerating .  Today, the short -term interest rate that the Federal Reserve \ntargets, the federal funds rate, is at a level roughly equal to our 2 percent inflation target and still \nbelow its exp ected level in the long run.  Rather than policy actions by the Fed that raise the \nshort -term rate, what is currently driving the yield curve inversion is the decline in the longer -\nterm rate.  \nThe depressed long -term yield , in part , reflects the challenging  economic conditions in \nmuch  of the  rest of the  world.  Currently, U .S. government bond yields (determined, of course, in \nthe marketplace, not set by policymakers) are higher than  those  in most other developed \ncountries.  This provides an incent ive for foreign investors  to buy U.S government securities , \nespecially if the risk of a dollar depreciation is perceived as low.  But such an increase  in demand \npushes the prices of U.S. government securities up, and yield s down . \n \n  \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL  \n5 P.M. U.S. Standard Time on Tuesday, September 3, 2019 OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n \n \n4 Weighing the Risks, and Considering  Policy  \n The core question of my remarks  today , then , is this: As we all look ahead and evaluate \nthe economy’s  prospects, how should the relatively good domestic economy and forecasts for the \nsecond half of this year be seen against signific ant risks  from trade, a slowdown in some of our \ntrading partners , and the low long -term rates creating an inverted yield curve ?   \nAt times like this, it is important to carefully study  incoming economic data.  If the risks \nbecome pronounced and threaten the U.S. outlook , then further  monetary  easing may be \nappropriate.  However , if the data continue to indicate a  U.S. economy growing slightly above \nthe level considered  to be the economy’s potential  growth  rate (an estimate of the  econom y’s \nmaximum sustainable output over the long term4), with continued gradual increases  in wages and \nprices, then in my view , no immediate policy action would be required.    \nIn fact, the gradual slowing of GDP growth that  we are seeing  is really not surprising  –\nand is not necessarily a signal of a weakening economy headed for a recession, but  instead  a \nnatural pattern .  As resource constraints (like the availability of workers) become more binding  \nand the effects of the fiscal stimulus wan e, and with monetary policy onl y marginally \naccommodative, economists  would expect actual economic growth to settle in the vicinity of  the \ngrowth rate associated with the economy’s potential.  \n \nEconomic Forecasts  and Indicators  \n In the spirit of the data dependence , let’s now turn to the numbers .  Figure 1  shows the \ngrowth in real GDP for the first two quarters of 2019 and the Blue Chip consensus forecast \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL  \n5 P.M. U.S. Standard Time on Tuesday, September 3, 2019 OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n \n \n5 through a  year from now .  The Blue Chip  panel  comprise s roughly 50 professional for ecasters \nwho provide their estimates  of the future state of a variety of economic variables . \nActual s econd quarter growth in real GDP was 2 percent.  The Blue Chip forecasters \nexpect real GDP to grow at a 2 percent annualized rate for each of the next two quarters.  My \nown forecast is quite s imilar, anticipat ing growth in the second half of this year of 2 percent  – \nwhich is somewhat above my estimate of the potential growth rate in the economy.   Growth \nabove that potential rate is what drives unemployment lower , which may further  boost wage and \nprice  inflation . \n Figure 2  illustrates some of the drivers of s econd quarter growth .  Real GDP  growth  was \n2 percent , despite weakness in business fixed investment , residential investment , and exports, as \nvery strong growth in consumer spend ing offset the weakness in these other components of real \nGDP.  If the consumer continues to spend, and global conditions do not deteriorate further,  the \neconomy is likely to  continue to  grow around  2 percent , in part because the underpinnings of \nconsumption growth  — household income growth and household wealth  — remain strong, and \nconsumption accounts for about  70 percent of GDP  in the U.S .   \n To that end, Figure 3 shows that data we have to date on retail sales are consistent with \ncontinued relat ively strong consumption.  In fact, retail sales growth for July was stronger than \nthe growth in any of the previous three months.   \n However, Figure 4 shows that the University of Michigan consumer sentiment survey \ndid decline in August, suggesting  consumers may have focused their attention on  gyrations in the \nstock market and the possibility of another round of tariffs , although the measure has not yet \ndeviated meaningfully from its range since the beginning of 2017 .  By contrast , the Conference \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL  \n5 P.M. U.S. Standard Time on Tuesday, September 3, 2019 OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n \n \n6 Board Consumer Confidence i ndex was little changed in August relative to July.   But in sum , as \nlong as employment continues to expand as it has  – even recently  – the consumer should remain \na source of strength for the economy.  \n However, tariff -related trade disruption  and weakness in the global economy remain key \nrisks for the U.S. economy.   That said,  Figure 5 shows exports as a percent of GDP  for a number \nof nations .  Countries with a large export share of GDP will be highly sensitive to slowing global \nmark et conditions and the imposition of tariffs.  Among the countries shown, the United States \nstands out as having a relatively small export share of GDP , at just 12 percent.  In contrast, \nGermany , South Korea,  and Italy are much more highly exposed to global  trade.5   \n To date, economic forecasts and the underlying data are consistent with a  U.S. economy \ngrowing slightly above its potential  rate.  However, the forecasts and recent data highlight that \ncontinued strong  consumption is key to that outlook.  Becau se of tariffs and slowing global \ngrowth, both business fixed investment and exports  have been weak.  Clearly , there is a \ndownside risk that trade or geopolitical problems could escalate, resulting in a much weaker \nsituation  than is currently anticipated in  economic forecasts.  \n \nFinancial Market Indicators  \n As I mentioned earlier, o ne source of concern with the economic outlook i nvolves  recent  \nmovements in financial markets.  Figure 6 shows the 3-month and 10-year Treasury yields , with \nrecession shading .  The 10 -year Treasury yield  rose to 3.24 early last November and is currently \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL  \n5 P.M. U.S. Standard Time on Tuesday, September 3, 2019 OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n \n \n7 about 1.5 percent.  This is obviously a very sizable  decline , and  much more substantial than the \ndecline in short -term rates.   \nThe current rate configuration in the United States, with the yield curve inversion, should  \nbe placed in the context of the interest rates prevailing in other developed economies .  Figure 7 \nshows the  monetary authority’s  policy rate in Europe, Japan, and the United States.  While the \nU.S. central bank has raised the policy rate over the past several years, in Japan and the Euro \narea the policy rate has not been raised , reflecting the weakness of these economies relative t o \nthe U nited States. \n Because the policy rate remains near the effective  lower  bound in Europe and Japan, the  \ncentral banks there  have been providing monetary stimulus by purchasing long -term securities.  \nFigure 8 shows rates o n 10-year government bonds in the U .S., Germany, and Japan.  \nParticularly striking is the 10 -year German rate , which is now more than 200 basis points lower \nthan the comparable U .S. rate, and is more negative than the European central bank’s short -term \npolicy rate.  \nThe weakness in Ja pan and Europe, and the associated easing across the yield curve, \ncauses foreign investors to search for higher yields in the United States.  This has encouraged \nforeign investors to buy 10 -year U.S. Treasuries .6  In addition to the higher yield , U.S. Treasuries \nprovide a “recession hedge ” — in an economic downturn  here or abroad , the safety and \nrelatively high yields of long-term U.S. government bonds would like ly become even more \nattractive to investors , so their prices would rise and yields decline f urther.   Holding long bonds \ntoday thus offers the prospect of capital gains during a downturn , which  would partly insulate \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL  \n5 P.M. U.S. Standard Time on Tuesday, September 3, 2019 OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n \n \n8 investors  against the losses  on other assets in their portfolios  that would likely arise in such \ncircumstances.  \n These alternative explanations for what makes U.S. Treasuries attractive today are \nchallenging  to disentangle, making  the decline  in long -term U.S. Treasury rates somewhat  open \nto interpret ation .  To the extent that the decline  reflects weakness in foreign  economies with \nlimited policy space, that foreign weakness is likely already incorporated into economic \nforecasts.  If instead the rate is falling due to perceptions that an economic downturn here is \nbecoming more likely, then one would have to say that t he view from bond markets diverges \nfrom that of most economic forecasters  and constitutes a downside risk to the forecasts . \n But the financial markets are sending mixed signals about economic risks. If one thought \nthat the economy was going into an economic downturn, one would expect such concerns to be \nreflected in equity  prices, as corporate earnings tend to decline significantly in a recession.  \nFigure 9 shows the S&P  500 and Dow Jones average s.  While both indices are down a little \nmore than  3 percent from the ir July highs, overall stock prices remain robust .  Recession \nconcerns do not seem to be reflected  in the current pricing of stocks.  \n Another market indicator that can reflect recession concerns is the spread between  yields \non BAA -rated  corporate bonds (bonds with the lowest of the “ investment grade ” ratings ) and 10 -\nyear Treasury yields , as shown in Figure 10.  This spread , which would grow  if perceived risks \nabout priv ate sector investments were heightened,  is not unusually elevated, as we would expect \nif bond investors were concerned about a near-term recession.  \n In sum , one widespread interpretation of the inversion in the Treasury yield curve is that \nit portends a likely economic downturn  in the U nited States .  I would say, however, t hat such a \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL  \n5 P.M. U.S. Standard Time on Tuesday, September 3, 2019 OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n \n \n9 view does not seem to be strongly echoed in equity markets, bond spreads , or economic \nforecasts.  A plausible alternative explanation would be weakness among U.S. trading par tners \nhas depress ed long rates in their countries , which ha s, in turn , depressed long -term Treasury rates \nin the United States  by shifting demand to long-term Treasuries , inverting  the yield curve . We \nare wise not to place too much confidence in either int erpretation, but instead watch closely for \nsigns of risks materializing in the economic data.  \n \nInflation  Considerations  \n Another potential concern is that inflation has remain ed consistently below the 2  percent  \ngoal that the Fed has announced and intends  to deliver .  Figure 11 shows core PCE inflation and \nthe Dallas trimmed  mean PCE.  Both measures try to remove “noise ” from the measured \ninflation  rate.  The Dallas trimmed mean, as previously stated,  removes any unusual outliers in \nthe inflation series and is currently at 2 percent.  Core PCE , which removes the often -volatile \nfood and energy prices,  is at 1.6 percent.  During previous periods when the series have diverged, \ncore PCE has tended to move toward the Dallas trimmed mean.  This would be consist ent with a \nsituation where the recent low reading s in core PCE reflect transitory changes  in prices (other \nthan food and energy ) that  are removed by the Dallas trimmed mean  measure . \n Figure 1 2 shows that wages and salaries , using either average hourly earnings or the \nEmployment Cost Index , have been slowly increasing.  As wages rise, unless productivity rises \nas well  to offset the increase in production costs , firms will need to decide whether to reduce \nmargins or raise prices.  Th e gradual increase in wages and salaries is consistent with a tight \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL  \n5 P.M. U.S. Standard Time on Tuesday, September 3, 2019 OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n \n \n10 labor market.  With the unemployment rate at 3.7 percent, this tightness in labor markets should \nalso gradually cause inflation to return to the Federal Reserve’s  2 percent target.  \n  \nConclu ding Observat ions \n Concerns over tariffs and geopolitical uncertainties have  increased discussion around a \npossible economic downturn.  It is clearly reasonable to make the assess ment  that r isks are \nelevated.  Should those risks become a reality , the appropriate monetary pol icy would be to ease \naggressively.  However, to date, these elevated risks have not become reality , at least for the U .S.  \neconomy .  Economic forecasts – and, as I’ve demonst rated,  many financial market indicators – \nremain benign, consistent with a forecas t of growth slightly above potential.    \nIn my view, one  should not be overconfident that the economy will be just fine or that an \neconomic downturn is inevitable.  As a result, t his is a particularly good time to carefully watch \nincoming data  – to determine whether any additional policy adjustments are necessary to achieve \nthe Fed’s Congressionally mandated goals of maximum employment and stable prices.   \nReturning to where I started my remarks, I’ll just say that is how I plan to spend the last few days \nof summer, and beyond.  \n Thank you.  \n \n \n1 For more discussion, see the Dallas Fed’s Two Measures of Core Inflation: A Comparison , by Jim Dolmas and \nEvan F.

But these countries also \nface a number of domestic challenges of their own, from trade disrupt ions between Japan and South Korea and \nbetween the U.S. and China to an unsteady recovery in the Euro area combined with a variety of political challenges \nin European countries and the U.K.   \n \n4 For context on the estimate of the economy’s potential growth rate, see the Congressional Budget Office, for \nexample https://www.cbo.gov/publication/53558 . \n \n5 There are other ways that international co nditions affect U.S. firms. For example, multinational firms, many of \nwhich produce goods and services in foreign countries, will also be affected by foreign economic activity and may \nface reduced earnings.  \n  \n6 With the implicit bet that the interest rate differential will not be offset by a future dollar depreciation .",

U.S. Standard Time on Friday, September 20, 2019 OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n1 \n              Good Morning, i t is a pleasure to be here at NYU ’s Stern School of Business  to \nparticipate in this conference  on credit markets .  I want to thank the Salomon Center for the \nStudy of Financial Institutions for inviting me to share my view s of the economy.  \nI’d like to begin with a few remarks about monetary policy  which I believe are relevant to \nthe discussions taking place here today .  At the Federal Open Market Committee ( FOMC ) \nmeeting  earlier this week, the Committee voted to reduce the federal funds rate by 25 basis \npoints.  I dissented, and  in my remarks today I will explain my views on the appropriate degree \nof monetary accommodation at this time .  I will also share my perspectives on the potential \nbuildup of some finan cial-stability co ncerns .  \nI will  take a few minutes to  summarize my argument  as I begin, and then delve into a \nlittle more detail to show you the data which  inform my views.  \n \nFirst, the stance of policy is already accommodative.    \nThe latest policy action of the Committee reduces the short -term interest rates the  Federal \nReserve  controls  to a range from 1. 75 to 2  percent .  This  rate on unsecured overnight credit  is \nvery close to current readings on inflation , and thus holders of federal  funds will earn a nominal \nreturn  that does little more than compensate them for the prevailing rate of inflation . The \nCommittee a lso provides information on what they expect the federal funds rate to be in the \nlonger run , and that estimate  is 2.5 percent.  These two factors suggest that  the stance of \nmonetary policy is currently accommodative .  Yet, i t is notable that the federal funds futures \nmarket  is pricing in a significant probability of another decrease  by year end . The market \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL  \n11:20  A.M. U.S. Standard Time on Friday, September 20, 2019 OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n2 \n apparently believes the economy needs added stimulus to continue the expansion.  My own view \nis different.1  \n \nSecond, the economic data suggest continued expansion . \nIt is not unusual to have a sequence of decreases in the federal funds rate  when the \neconomy is in an economic downturn, often when interest rates have become too contractionary  \nand there is concern that the economy is slowing too much . The data we have in hand suggest \ninstead that the recovery would continue apace  even with little monetary policy accommodation .  \nConsider , as we always do,  the Fed eral Reserve ’s dual mandate  from Congress – maximum \nsustainable employment, and price stability.2  With respect to those goals, t he national \nunemployment rate is currently  3.7 percent, a rate that is very low by historical standards  and \nlikely well below the natural rate of unemploy ment .  Regarding price  stability , which we define \nas 2 percent inflation, it is true that earlier in the year inflation  was running below target .  But as \nthe Consumer Price Index ( CPI) release last week indicated, those low readings seem to have \nbeen temporary.  The 12-month change in the core CPI reported last week rose to 2.4 percent,  \nreflecting the more rapid price increases of  the past three months.  \n \nThird, risks to the economic outlook are of concern, to be sure.   \nGiven economic results that seem  broadly in line with the  Fed’s  dual mandate, why the \nconcern?  Well c learly , there are elevated risks.  The trade dispute with China is having an \nimpact on both the U nited States  and global econom ies.  While manufacturing is a relatively \nsmall sector in t he U .S. economy,  it is a cyclically  sensitive sector, and  tariffs and slower global \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL  \n11:20  A.M. U.S. Standard Time on Friday, September 20, 2019 OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n3 \n growth are stressing it .  Related  to the trade disputes , business fixed investment has been \naffected, as firms are uncertain about  which tariffs will be imposed – and the potential retaliation \nby countries impacted by the tariffs.   \nBut even with these trade -related impediments , real GDP grew 2 percent  in the second \nquarter, a bit above my estimate of its sustainable rate .  And economic forecasts, which \nincorporate the effects of tariffs and slower global growth  on the U .S. economy , expect growth to \ncontinue in real terms at close to 2 percen t.  So the risks, while of concern,  have not slowed the \neconomy below its sustainable rate of growth . \n \nFourth, r esponding to risks  to the economic outlook  with too much monetary accommodation \nentails  costs , and thus introduces risks of its own  – one such risk is  the potential build up of \nfinancial instability.  \nIt is appropriate for policymakers  to respond to risks in the outlook . The response should \ndepend, of course,  on how likely one think s the outlook is to deteriorate , and by how much , and \nalso what  you believe  are the likely costs of reducing rates.  As I suggested a moment ago, so far \nthe economy seems to have weathered the  impact of trade disruptions and slowing foreign \ngrowth.  \nOne potential cost  of increased accommodation  is that very low rates can encourage \nhouseholds and firms to take excessive risks.  This could show up in the form of  increased \nhousehold and firm  lever age, with prices for risky assets reach ing levels  that may not be \nsustainable over time.   \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL  \n11:20  A.M. U.S. Standard Time on Friday, September 20, 2019 OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n4 \n  Assessing those risks and costs is challenging, to be sure, and a matter of judgment on \nwhich people  may disagree .  Still, I would argue that having such an accommo dative stance  of \nmonetary polic y is unusual  in what appears to be a fairly robust economy .  Typically , the federal \nfunds rate is pushed  below the level policymakers expect it to be in the long run only during \neconomic downturns .  During a downturn, t he costs of lowering rates are relatively modest, as \nfears of rising inflation are low and the concern is usually that too little credit is being extended.  \nHowever, the current situation involves pushing rates low er when asset prices, and in particular  \nsome  risky asset prices , already seem  inflated .  I don’t see current financial risks as causing  a \ndownturn , but such conditions have  the potential to amplify a  downturn , should it occur . \n \nCurrent Economic Condition s \n Having laid out the outlines of my argument, let me  walk you through  some of the key \ndata on the current economic situation and private -sector forecasts.   \nFigure  1 provides recent economic data for employment, inflation, and stock prices , as \nwell as the consensus  Blue Chip forecast for eco nomic variables  for 2019 as of June and \nSeptember .  The table shows that from May through August, the fundamentals rema ined quite \nstrong and have shown very little variation.  The unemployment rate is currently at 3.7 percent, \nwhere it has been all summer,  and private forecasters expect we will end the year slightly lower , \nat 3.6 percent.  While  the core PCE  measure of  inflation (which removes the often -volatile food \nand energy prices ) has been a bit below the Fed’s 2 percent  target , core CPI has been  firmer over \nthe summer, consistent with the interpretation that the softer readings on inflation that we saw in \nthe spring  will likely be temporary.  Finally, the most recent consensus forecast for real GDP for \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL  \n11:20  A.M. U.S. Standard Time on Friday, September 20, 2019 OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n5 \n the year is 2.3 percent, which is above the estimate of its sustainable rate, and thus  consistent \nwith somewhat tighter labor markets  (as reflected in the Blue Chip’s small decline in the \nforecasted  unemployment  rate).3 In sum, current economic conditions are quite favorable, and \nstable, and private  forecasters expect those conditions to remain quite similar through the end of \nthe year .   \nFigure 2 shows the target federal funds rate  in the second half of  this year relative to the \nFed’s  inflation target of 2 percent.  We began the year with the federa l funds rate somewhat \nabove the inflation target.  With this most recent reduction in the federal funds rate , it is now \nbelow where we expect the inflation rate will converge to over time.    \n Figure 3  shows the target federal funds rate since June , along with a projection of its path  \n(the forecast is calculated using the CME Group probabilit y for the most likely outcome  for the \ntarget range),  and the median of the FOMC participants’ federal funds rate expect ation  over the \nlong run, currently 2.5 percent . With this week’s reducti on, the federal funds rate is trading in the \ntarget range of 1.75 to 2 .0, notably below its long -run “neutral” level . In sum, w hether judged \nrelative to inflation or relative to its long -run neutral level,  monetary policy is currently \naccommodative.   \n \nMonetary Policy and Economic Conditions  \n Now I would like to explore how unusual it is to have such accommodative monetary \nconditions while the economic outcomes suggest continued above -trend expansion . \nThe top  panel in  Figure 4  show s the unemployment rate and the Congressional Budget \nOffice’s (CBO ’s) estimate of the natural rate of unemployment.  When  a recession occurs, shown \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL  \n11:20  A.M. U.S. Standard Time on Friday, September 20, 2019 OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n6 \n as shading, the unemployment rate rises above the natural rate – and during the recovery the \nunemployment rate eventually tends to fall below the natural rate.  The figure shows  that at \npresent , the unemployment rate is below the CBO’s estimate of the natural rate.  \nThe bottom panel in Figure 4 provides a gauge of where  the federal funds rate  is relative \nto what we call “r star” ( r*), the real short -term interest rate that is neither contractionary nor \nstimulative  when the economy faces no headwinds or tailwinds. That interest rate  is consistent \nwith an economy  that is at full employment with stable inflation .4  The previous chart showed \nthat the nominal  federal funds rate  expected by the Committee  in the long run is 2.5 percent . \nWith an inflation target of 2 percent, this implies that the Committee sees an  r* in the  long-run of \n0.5 percent.   \nBy comparing the top and bottom panels of Figure 4, we see that over time when the \nactual unemployment rate is high relative to the natural rate  of unemployment , the real federal \nfunds rate tends to be low relative to r*; in the chart,  the real federal funds rate minus r* tends to \nbe low, reflecting  the fact  that monetary policy needs to be accommodative to help the economy \nrecover  from the headwinds it is facing during recessions .  When the unemployment rate is quite \nlow, the real federal funds rate tends to be above the long run real rate; the real federal funds rate \nminus r* tends to be high.  While this relationship is only shown through the second quarter, \nwith the last two reductions in the federal funds rate , we are below the 0.5 percent r* we expect \nin the long  run.  S imply put , we normally do not have monetary policy this accommodative when \nthe unemployment rate is this low.   \n Figure 5  has the same bottom  panel , but a t op panel  that shows  two measures of inflation \n– the core PCE inflation rate and the Dallas Trimmed Mean PCE inflation rate  (which removes \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL  \n11:20  A.M. U.S. Standard Time on Friday, September 20, 2019 OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n7 \n outlier observations, regardless of the category ) – and the Federal Reserve’s  2 percent inflation \ntarge t.  As in Figure 4, t he bottom panel show s the real federal funds rate minus r*.   \nComparing the top and bottom panels, we see that when inflation is high relative to the \ntarget, monetary conditions are tightened – the real federal funds rate minus r* tends to be high.  \nSimilarly, when inflation is quite low, monetary policy tends to be accommodative and the real \nfederal funds rate minus r* tends to be low.  Currently , the Dallas Trimmed Mean PCE is at 2 \npercent .  In my view, with inflation near target,  this level of accommodation is not needed.   \n Of course , there are risks  to the current favorable conditions and forecasts , including  the \nrisks brought on by current trade policy  – and those risks  might  make one more concerned about \na possible downturn .  However, I take some solace in a few facts.  M ost of the U.S. trade dispute \nis currently with one country .  And while the trade dispute has the pot ential for painful impacts \non some industries in the U.S., in total the estimated direct impacts for the U.S. macroeconomy \nto date are not particularly large —perhaps several 10ths  of a percentage point on GDP  (in part \nbecause exports are only 12 percent of U.S. GDP  and tariffs are not on all goods from all \ncountries ).   \nBut the potential for trade disputes to  undermin e confidence in the economy for \nbusiness es and households is a concern.  One warning signal would be if  economic data that tend \nto be leading indicators of  recession  showed signs of  stress.  \n To that end, Figure 6 shows building permits.  Before the 1990 and 2007 recession s (and \nmany other recessions, not shown in the figure) , building permits plummeted.  Currently, w hile \nbuilding permits have leveled off, they have not shown significant declines.   \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL  \n11:20  A.M. U.S. Standard Time on Friday, September 20, 2019 OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n8 \n  Figure 7 shows initial claims for unemployment insurance.  As firms become worried \nabout a recession , they slow down hiring  – and some firms need to lay  off workers.  As a result, \ninitial claims for unemployment insurance were  on the rise before previous recession s.  Today, \ninitial claims are still falling  and are near the low for the period shown.  \n Of course, many observers are concerned about the inverted yield curve, which is a topic \nI explored in a speech earlier this month. My own view is the inverted yield curve may be driven \nby different forces this time.5  \nIn sum, it is fairly unusual to have monetary policy this accommodative at a time when \nthe economy still appears to be expanding  fairly  robustly .  While risks are elevated, many of the \nnon-manufacturing indicators of recession are not showing magnified concern.   \n \nFinancial Stability  Concerns  \nNow , I will turn to addressing some of the financial stability -related risks and costs that \ncan result from monetary policy  being too accommodative.   Figure 8 shows the average debt \nmultiples of highly leveraged loans.  It’s important to note that h igh leverage does not  generally  \ncause  recessions, but high leverage can be an amplifier that makes recessions more severe.  \nGoing into the 2007 recession, highly leveraged loans had increased significantly to a multiple of \na bit below five.  Once the recession occurred , borrowers and lenders pulled back , and debt \nmultiples decreased significantly.   \nThe decade -long period of very low interest rates has led highly leveraged firms to \ngradually increase  their debt multiples to very high levels .  Importantly, t he low interest cost of \nleverage today masks the true costs of leverage that only become visible once the economy \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL  \n11:20  A.M. U.S. Standard Time on Friday, September 20, 2019 OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n9 \n deteriorates.  During good times , higher leverage increases returns ; it is not until the downturn \nthat the problem becomes apparent, and then the  costs are  borne not only by the shareholders, but \nalso by the employees  of firms and the communities in which the affected firms operate.  \n Lowering  interest rates not only decreas es the cost of credit , it also encourag es a greater \nquantity of credit.  Households and firms are incented by the lower rates to take on more \nleverage, and this can be to their detriment when the next downturn occurs . \n Furthermore, the c osts of  credit conditions that are too-accommodative can sometimes \nappear in unexpected places.  Figure 9 shows the capitalization rates for different  types of  \nproperty.  The capitalization , or “cap ,” rate is the ratio of net operating income produced by a \nproperty to the price paid for the property, calculated at the time of a transaction.  S o falling \ncapitalization rates imply lower expected returns on the property , or equivalently a high multiple \nof a pro perty’s valuation relative to its expected income stream . Part of these low cap rates can \nbe explained by low interest rates generally, but very low cap rates can indicate an overly \noptimistic valuation of real estate assets that makes these investments vu lnerable in a downturn.  \n I will also point out that evolving  market models , along with low interest rates, are \ncreating a new type of potential financial stability risk in commercial real estate.   One such \nmarket model is the development of co -working spaces in many major urban office markets.    \n A stylized model of co -working office space arrangements appears  in Figure 1 0.6  What \nmakes this form of development a potential financial stability risk is two -fold.   \nFirst, c o-working companies – which enter into long -term leases with the property \nowners – have tended to re -lease to smaller -sized and less mature companies on a shorter -term \nbasis.  This segment of the economy is likely to be particularly susceptible to an econo mic \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL  \n11:20  A.M. U.S. Standard Time on Friday, September 20, 2019 OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n10 \n downturn, potentially resulting in office vacancies rising more quickly than they have \nhistorically.  Thus, in a downturn the co -working company would be exposed to the loss of \ntenant income, which puts both them and the property owner at risk if they cannot make lease \npayments to the owner of the building.   \nA second reason for concern is that some companies may utilize  bankruptcy -remote \nspecial purpose e ntities, or SPEs, for lease s.  This structure may allow  the co -working company \nto potentially walk away from unprofitable lease arrangements in an economic downturn without \nthe property owner having recourse to the ultimate parent , the co-working company.  Simply put, \nI am concerne d that commercial real estate  losses will be larger in the next downturn b ecause of \nthis growing feature of the real estate market, which could ultimately make runs and vacancies \nmore likely  due to this new leasing model .  \n The fact that the shared office model relies on small -company tenants with short -term \nleases , combined wit h the potential lack of recourse for the property owner , is potentially \nproblematic in a recession.  This also raises the issue of whether bank loans to property owners \nin cities with major penetration by co -working models could experience a higher inciden ce of \ndefault and greater loss -given -defaults than we have seen historically.   \nThe potential for increased losses accruing to property owners comes not just from the \nlimited liability arising from the SP E structure, but also from the change in the composi tion of \ntenants.  The owner of the building may be willing to take on this added risk because shared \noffice space often pays higher rent, which is p articularly attractive in a low -interest -rate \nenvironment.  Thus , this new model for offices has the potential for a run on commercial real \nestate  as revenues decline  (small lessees  not renewing) combined with reach ing-for-yield  \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL  \n11:20  A.M. U.S. Standard Time on Friday, September 20, 2019 OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n11 \n behavior  (owners willing to lease to an SP E to get higher rents).  It will not be until a recession \nthat this evolving  model will be  truly tested.   \n These are just two examples of the potential costs of very low interest rates in a relatively \nstable  economic environment.  The incentive to take on more leverage and to reach for yield can \nbe costly  – but the  costs  are apparent  only when a downturn occurs.   \nIn sum, this is an important time in the cycle to be thinking about structures and \nsituations that could challenge financial stability in a downturn.   The combination of reaching for \nyield with ru nnable liabilities is a common problem in financial stability situations.  It’s \nimportant to think about the potential for runs on commercial real estate stemming from a \nsituation where short -term leases might not be renewed in recession, and long -term lea ses are no \nlonger economically viable.   Interest rates play into the situation, as low rates potentially lead to \na reach for yield, and building owners are more willing to lease to SPEs to get higher returns \n(rents) at a time when capitalization rates are quite low.    \n \nConclu ding Observat ions \n I voted  against the reduction in interest rates at the most recent  FOMC meeting.  The \neconomic data that we have seen so far suggest that the economy remains  healthy and robust to a \nnumber of shocks and uncertainties .  While risks  clearly exist  related to  trade and geopolitical \nconcerns , lower ing rates to address uncertainty is not costless.   In my view,  there are clearly \nrisks of headwinds hitting the economy, but  the stance of monetary policy is already \naccommodative. There are also risks of tailwinds and costs to monetary policy being too \naccommodative.  Additional accommodation is not needed for an economy where labor markets \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL  \n11:20  A.M. U.S. Standard Time on Friday, September 20, 2019 OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n12 \n are already tight  – and risk s further inflating the prices of risk ier assets , and encouraging \nhouseholds and firms to take on what may be too much leverage.  \n Thank you.  \n \n1 For additional discussion, see https://www.bostonfed.org/news -and-events/speeches/2019/weighing -the-risks -to-\nthe-economic -outlook.aspx . \n \n2 The Federal Reserve Act provides the following monetary policy goals, “promote effectively the goals of \nmaximum employment, stable prices, and moder ate long -term interest rates.”  The first two are the dual mandate.   \nModerate long -term interest rates are generally viewed as a product of the first two, provided that the maximum \nemployment is a sustainable maximum employment.  \n \n3 My own forecast is quite  similar, anticipating growth in the second half of this year of 2 percent – which is \nsomewhat above my estimate of the potential growth rate in the economy.   \n \n4 For more on the Laubach -Williams model, s ee: https://www.newyorkfed.org/research/policy/rstar .    \n \n5 For additional discussion, see https://www.bostonfed.org/news -and-events/speeches/2019/weighing -the-risks -to-\nthe-economic -outlook.aspx . \n \n6 This figure refl ects information gathered from  CB Insights, Colliers, CreditSights, Cushman & Wakefield, JLL, \nRCA, SEC filings, and major media cove rage.",

It is wonderful  to be back on campus at the University of Wisconsin -\nMadison .  I appreciate the opportunity to  take part in today’s  American Economic Challenges \nSymposium , and congratulate the Department of Economics and the Juli Plant Grainger Institute \nfor Economic Research on putting together such a terrific program .  I am pleased to be able to \nspeak with you today about the current state of the  economy , and the  implications for monetary \npolicy and interest rates .   \nLast Friday , we all noted with interest the publication of the September employment \nreport  from the U.S. Department of Labor .1  Interpretation of the report seems  to have varied , \ndepending on the observer.  To those concerned with and focused on risks to the economic \noutlook, the payroll -employment number of 136,000  – which is slower growth than earlier this \nyear – as well as the weakness in the manufacturing s ector, supported the narrative  that tariffs  \nand weakness globall y are slowing down the domestic economy.  However, other s noted  that the \npreceding months were revised a bit higher, the unemployment rate had declined to 3.5 percent  – \na nearly 50-year low  – and that slower employment  growth may instead reflect an economy \ngrowing beyond capacity and facing hiring constraints associated with a very tight labor market.  \nMy own view is that the September employment report highlights trends we have b een \nseeing since the spring : the presence of elevated downside risks, but actual economic outcomes \nthat are not much different than what most forecasters  expected six month s ago  or longer . \n To be sure, the economy faces a number of  downside risks .  In an a lready slowing global \neconomy, t he imposition of tariffs and the prospect of additional tariffs are together  resulting in \nslower exports and weakness in the manufacturing and agr icultural sectors.  Indeed, the high-\nfrequency  incoming economic  data have been consistent with a slowdown that is largely \n\n  EMBARGOED UNTIL  \n12:35 P.M. U.S. Central Time (1: 35 P.M.  Eastern Time) on Friday, October 11, 2019 - OR UPON DELIVERY  \n  \n \n2 \n concentrated in manufacturing  – which has reduced business fixed investment , as firms wrestle \nwith the implications of higher  trade barriers .  In addition, geopolitical concerns remain elevated.  \nThe recent attack on Saudi oil production and the potential for a difficult  Brexit , in a Europe that \nis already growing slowly , highlight that the global recovery faces risks that make it somewhat  \nfragile.  \n Despite these clear risks, second -quarter U.S. eco nomic growth was above the estimated  \n“potential ” rate (that is, an estimate of the economy’s maximum sustainable output over the long \nterm).2  Looking forward, Fed policymakers ’ September Summary of Economic Projections  \n(SEP)  and the consensus of private forecasters both anticipate growth around potential .   \nHow can the economy continue to expand  at potential with the sort of weakening in \nexports and investment  that we are seeing ?  To date , the answer has been strong consumer \nspending.  The U.S. consumer has been bolstered by plentiful jobs in tight labor markets, strong \ngrowth in personal income , and increases in household wealth due to rising prices of assets like \nstock s and ho mes.  An important question remains whether consumption can continue to offset \nthe negative effects of trade problems  and slower foreign growth . \n While  U.S. consumers have been resilient to date, continued  resilience is not guaranteed . \nSo it is important to consider  whether the economy can continue on its quite favorable pa th – \nwith grow th around potential , tight labor markets , and inflation near the Fed’s target of 2 percent.  \nThe stance of monetary policy is already accommodative, so my view is that policymakers can \nbe patient  and continue to evaluate incoming data before taking additional action .  My forecast \nfor the economy  does not envision  additional easing being  necessary .  However,  should  risks \n\n  EMBARGOED UNTIL  \n12:35 P.M. U.S. Central Time (1: 35 P.M.  Eastern Time) on Friday, October 11, 2019 - OR UPON DELIVERY  \n  \n \n3 \n materialize and econom ic growth  slow materially , to below the potential  rate, I would be \nprepared to support aggressive easing. \n \nCurrent Economic Conditions  \n Figure 1  provides the median forecast of Fed policymakers for key economic variables \nfrom the SEP s from March and September  2019 .  How different are the forecasts of economic \noutcomes in September , compared with what we anticipated before the recent increase in  tariffs \nand the cuts in  the federal funds rate?  What is striking  to me  is how little the forecast s for 2019 \nhave changed.   \nOf course , this is due  in part  to the significant easing actions that the Federal Open \nMarket Committee ( FOMC ) has already put in place, which will continue to stimulate the \neconomy this year and next.  More recently, Fed  policymakers have  added a couple of interest \nrate cuts to the mix.  These actions , to some extent , help to keep the forecast in the healthy zone.  \nInterestingly, t he forecast for real GDP growth for 2019 has actually increased over this \nperiod, though only by 0.1 percent age point .  In March and September , the median forecast  for \nthe unemployment rate at the end of this year was 3.7 percent, an unemployment rate that looks \ntoo pessimistic now , given the September employment report ’s reading of  3.5 percent.  While \ntotal and core PCE inflation are lower than had been expected, core PCE inflation (which \nremoves the often -volatile food and energy prices) has risen 0.3 percent age points  from its lows \nearlier this year.  \n\n  EMBARGOED UNTIL  \n12:35 P.M. U.S. Central Time (1: 35 P.M.  Eastern Time) on Friday, October 11, 2019 - OR UPON DELIVERY  \n  \n \n4 \n Overall,  then,  the economy has evolved about as expected, despite the unanticipated \nincrease in tariffs and the slower growth of exp orts and business fixed investment .  Moreover , \nrecent monetary policy easing is likely to provide some stimulus over the next several quarters . \n Not only has the economy evolved about as expected, but it is currently close to where \npolicymakers  had hoped i t would be at this time.  Figure 2  shows the recent path s for some \nalternative measures  of inflation.  The dashed line indicates  the Fed’s 2 percent inflation target.  \nThree different measures of inflation are shown  on the chart .  On a 12 -month basis, c ore CPI is \ncurrently at 2.4 percent .  Core CPI  has risen over the past several months , settling at 2.4 percent \nfor August and September .  The Dallas Trimmed Mean, which removes extreme observations, \nrounds to  2 percent.  Core PCE is at 1.8 percent, slightly below the Fed’s  target  – but has also \ntrended up recently.  With tight labor markets and an already accommodative  stance of  policy, it \nseems likely that inflation will remain close to target as long as the economy does not \nunexpectedly slow down.  \n Figure 3  provides the Committee’s most recent  estimate of full employment (the dashed \nline) at 4.2 percent.  While the level of unemployment associated with full employment is \ndifficult to estimate, and the FOMC  has lowered its median estimate of full employment over the \npast several years, we see that the September unemployment rate  of 3.5 percent is well below \npolicymakers ’ best current estimate of full employment.  \n In sum, t he U.S. economy is now very close to meeting the Fed ’s Congressional  mandate \nof full employment and stable prices (which we define  as 2 percent inflation ).  In addition, I \nwould note that the Committee’s September median forecast for 2019 real GDP growth was 2.2 \npercent , consistent with no significant slowdown in the second  half of this year.  So as we look at \n\n  EMBARGOED UNTIL  \n12:35 P.M. U.S. Central Time (1: 35 P.M.  Eastern Time) on Friday, October 11, 2019 - OR UPON DELIVERY  \n  \n \n5 \n economic performance, forecasts, and risks to the forecast s, the overriding  policy question is \nwhether the risks are so elevated that further easing is required , despite already accommodative \npolicy.  \n \nFinancial Consideration s \n Certainly , one reason for concern about the economic outlook is the movement of the 10 -\nyear U.S. Treasury yield .  The yield on 10-year Treasury bond s has declined significantly, \nleading  many financial market participants  to express concern that this signals a more significant \nimpending slowdown.  An alternative explanation that I have discussed in recent talks  is that \nvery low (and in some cases negative) long-term foreign rates  are playing a role in pushing down \nU.S. long rates , as foreign investors move money from low -rate economies into the (relatively) \nhigh-rate U.S. markets, pushing down U.S. yields.3 Also, it seems like g lobal  investors are using \nU.S. Treasuries to partially hedge against  the possibility of an economic downturn  in their \ncountry or region , since the prices of  long-duration U.S. Treasury securities normally rise during \neconomic downturns .  I see both of these as  more likely explanations  of the recent movements  \nthan an impending  U.S. slowdown . \n Other financial indicators do not portend a significant slowdown.  Despite high leverage \nin the corpo rate sector and more issuance at  the bottom  end of investment -grade ratings, the \nspread between yields on corporate bonds and Tre asury bonds, shown in Figure 5 , remains \nbelow the average spread of the past 25 years.  Similarly, the stock market, shown in Figure 6 , \nremains close to all -time highs.  \n\n  EMBARGOED UNTIL  \n12:35 P.M. U.S. Central Time (1: 35 P.M.  Eastern Time) on Friday, October 11, 2019 - OR UPON DELIVERY  \n  \n \n6 \n  Recent developments in oil markets are more consistent with apparent risks to the glob al \neconomy.  As shown  in Figure 7 , oil prices have fallen  – usually a sign that investors see \nadditional weakness developing in the global economy  – despite  the supply disruption caused by \nthe attack on Saudi oil production .  The dollar has continued to appreciate  against various \ncurrencies, and relative to the pound  – as Brexit concerns remain elevated – which is shown in \nFigure 8 .  And Figure 9  shows the continued impact of the trade war with China, as both \nexports  to and imports  from  China have declined significantly.  \n \nImplications of the R isks \n Given that the economy is close to achieving the Fed’s dual mandate , should the risks \nthat are clearly present cause policymakers at the Fed  to alter monetary policy?  At this  point in \nthe cycle, s hould risks be addressed preemptively, or should FOMC participants  wait until  they \nmaterialize ? \nDespite the clear risks to the econom ic outlook , most professional private forecasters \nexpect the economy to continue to grow around its potential.  Figure 10  provides the most recent \nBlue Chip forecast  – a summary of  the views of  approximately 50 private forecasters  -- for real \nGDP over the next several years  on the left, as well as a comparison to the earlier March forecast \non the right .  In the chart on the left, t he solid line shows the average forecast for real GDP , \nwhich at about  1.7 percent  is the same as my estimate of the potential growth of the economy.  \nThe d ashed line s reflect the average of the 10 lowest and 10 highest forecasts  for real GDP.  \nEven the lowest 10 forecasts still expect positive economic growth, though slower than my \nestimate of potential.   The chart on the right compares the average of the 10 lowest from the \n\n  EMBARGOED UNTIL  \n12:35 P.M. U.S. Central Time (1: 35 P.M.  Eastern Time) on Friday, October 11, 2019 - OR UPON DELIVERY  \n  \n \n7 \n current forecast (the dark blue dashed line on both char ts), with the average of the 10 lowest \nfrom the March forecast.  The lowest forecasts have not become more pessimistic.  \n With both the Fed ’s forecast and private forecasts expecting the economy to grow at \nclose to potential, the decision to ease further or keep rates as they are  rests on how much \ninsurance to take out against  the risks  that I have outlined .  To answer that question, one should \ntake into account how much insurance is already in place – that is, what is  the current stance of \nmonetary policy ?  Figure 11  shows the federal funds rate relative to the SEP estimate of what \nthe federal funds rate will be in the long run  – roughly speaking, the interest rate that FOMC \nmembers believe is neither stimulative nor contractionary, other things equal .  The median \nestimate of the long-run federal funds rate is 2.5 percent .  The target for the federal funds rate  \nwas set by the FOMC at a range of 1.75  to 2.0 percent  at its most recent meeting, after two one-\nquarter -percentage point reductions in the rate in July and September  of this year.  In short, the \ncurrent level of the federal funds rate is already below the FOMC’s estimate of the long -run rate.  \nIn sum, monetary policy is already accommodative .  This is especially notable  given that \nthe average forecaster expects gr owth close to potential, with  already -tight labor markets.   But \nnote, too, that Figure 11 shows the funds rate is not that far from zero, which suggests the Fed , at \ncurrent rates , has limited scope to lower rates in the event of a down turn. That limited policy \nspace – which some see as reason to “keep powder dry ,” and others as reason to act early – \nshould also figure into the Fed’s  determination of appropriate policy today.  \n \n \n \n\n  EMBARGOED UNTIL  \n12:35 P.M. U.S. Central Time (1: 35 P.M.  Eastern Time) on Friday, October 11, 2019 - OR UPON DELIVERY  \n  \n \n8 \n Conclu ding Observations  \n In summary and conclusion, I would  note that a fter two recent rate easings of 25 basis \npoint s each , monetary policy is already accommodative.  Sustaining g rowth at potential depends \non the U.S. consumer continuing to offset  the weakness we are seeing in exports and business \nfixed investmen t.  To me , it seems appropriate to continue to closely monitor incoming data to \ndetermine if the forecast of growth around potential is likely t o be achieved , or if the risks I have \noutlined are indeed materializing .   \nWhile the risks to the global and U .S. economies  remain , there are also risks to easing too \naggressively, as I’ve highlighted in previous speeches .  Ever -lower interest rates could encourage \nreach ing-for-yield behavior at exactly the wrong stage of the economic cycle.   This remains an \nimportant consideration factoring into my view s on the elements  policymakers must weigh and \nbalance at this complex time for our economy.  \nThank you  for having me back to Madison . \n  \n1 For more, s ee Employment Situation Summary , released Oct. 4, 2019 .  \n \n2 For context on the estimate of the economy’s potential growth rate, see the Congressional Budget Office, for \nexample https://www.cbo.gov/publication/53558 . \n \n3 For additional discussion, see: R osengren, Eric:  “Weighing the Risks to the Economic Outlook ,” Sept. 3, 2019, and \n“Assessing Economic Conditions and Risks to Financial Stability ,” Sept . 20, 2019.",

The Costs and Benefits of Financial \nRegulation”  \n  \n \nOslo , Norway   \nNovember  11, 2019  \n \n \n \n\n\n  EMBARGOED UNTIL  \n8:15 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time (2 :15 P.M. Norway  Time) on Mon day, November 11, 2019 - OR UPON DELIVERY  \n  \n \n1 \n  Good afternoon .  I would like to thank the Norges Bank for inviting me to participate in \nthis timely and important conference.  As someone with a background in both economic research \nand bank supervision,  I believe  the conversations taking place over these two days around re-\nexamining bank regulation and financial stability are  very important .  It is particularly important \nat this stage of the business cycle to assess  whether our economies  are prepared for a \nhypothetical  next downturn , and consider whether policymakers  have  built sufficient resilience \ninto the financial system – so it can withstand the kinds of stability problems that were so \nprevalent in the last recessio n.  \n One significant  difference between  now and previous cycles  is the low level of interest \nrates in the United States, Germany, and  Japan . The low -rate environment  is particularly striking \nbecause it occurs at a time whe n all three  countries’ labor markets  remain relatively tight by \nhistorical standards.   \nPolicy rates in the United States  are currently quite low.  This is partly  a result of low \nequilibrium real rates globally , and low inflation targets.  But it is also due to the Fed eral \nReserve  setting its policy rate quite low , to offset risks to the U.S. economy stemming from \ntariffs an d the global slowdown.  Although  core PCE inflation is 1.7 percent and the \nunemployment rate sits near a 50 -year low, nominal interest rates have been reduced and short -\nterm real rates  are now negative.   \nWith rates  this low, there is  very little room to reduce short -term rates  should the \neconomy stumble , as the Fed normally cuts rates well over 4 percentage points during a \nrecession .  Similarly, the 10-year U.S. Treasury rate ha s declined, which limits the  room to push \nlong-term sovereign  rates down in a  hypothetical economic downturn.  \n\n  EMBARGOED UNTIL  \n8:15 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time (2 :15 P.M. Norway  Time) on Mon day, November 11, 2019 - OR UPON DELIVERY  \n  \n \n2 \n Taken together, one might characterize the situation as one where monetary policy \n“buffers” have been diminished quite significantly.  This limitation on monetary policy ’s ability \nto buffer the eco nomy in a downturn is a key consequence  of economies operating in a low \ninterest rate environment.   In the U.S., the likelihood that this low interest rate environment will \npose a persistent challenge for conventional interest rate policy is one reason  the central bank  has \nbegun  to re-examin e its monetary policy framework .1  \n And the Fed eral Reserve  is not the only developed -economy central bank  facing this \nissue .  Increasingly, there are questions about  whether too much is , even now,  being asked of \nmonetary policy  in Germany and Japan , for example.  In these countries, the room for monetary \npolicy to react to significant negative shocks is even more meager  than in the U.S. , given that \nboth short -term and long -term nominal interest rates are already negative .   \n With the constraints on traditional monetary policy ’s ability to buffer or help reduce the \neffects of a downturn,  many countries have begun to re-examine  other ways monetary policy  can \nbe pursued  to stimulate their economies.  Besides the tools  that have already been deployed at \nthe effective lower bound , I would suggest that the low rate environment and the diminished \ncapacity of monetary  policy to offset shocks  implies that we also need to just as carefully \nexamin e regulatory  and financial stability  tools .2  Today, I will argue that policies and tools that \nmay have been appropriate in a high interest rate environment will likely not be sufficient in the \ncurrent environment.  \n For several reasons, a  low interest rate environment make s it more difficult  to exit \nrecessions .  This difficulty is due not just to the smaller monetary policy buffer, but also to the \n\n  EMBARGOED UNTIL  \n8:15 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time (2 :15 P.M. Norway  Time) on Mon day, November 11, 2019 - OR UPON DELIVERY  \n  \n \n3 \n fact that  a low interest rate environment encourages greater household and firm leverage  that will \namplify the severity of a downturn, should it occur.   \nThe consequences of a low rate environment also make it difficult for monetary policy to \nplay a solo role in countercyclical policy .  A low -rate environment  implies  a greater need  to \nutilize  coun tercyclical fiscal  policy, as well as a need for  larger  regulatory and financial -stability \nbuffers .  For example, the recent and prospective decline in some capital ratios puts banks in a \nless advantageous position, particularly if one expect s a low interest rate environment  to prevail \nfor some time.   \nIn short, the low interest  rate environment  that many developed countries face  require s \npolicymakers  to re-examine other economic buffers .  And those buffers,  in my view, are not \nadequate at pres ent in many countries represented at this conference.  \n \nLow Interest Rates and the Implications of a Diminished Monetary Policy Buffer  \n Figure 1  shows the short -term policy rates in the United States, the Euro Area, and \nJapan.  In the U .S., prior to the last recession , the federal funds rate was over 5 percent.   On \naverage over the past six recessions, the Fed has lowered the funds rate by about 5 percentage \npoints.  Had the Great Recession not been quite so severe, the 5 percentage points of fed eral \nfunds decrease available at its start might have been sufficient  to offset the downturn .  But \nbecause of the financial crisis and the severity of the ensuing recession, despite dropping  the \nfederal funds rate quickly to zero, the recession was still historically severe  and sustained .  The \nfunds rate was pinned at just above zero for seven years , far longer than any model predicted \nwould be necessary before the recession .  Even as the  eleventh  year of the recovery  begins , the \n\n  EMBARGOED UNTIL  \n8:15 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time (2 :15 P.M. Norway  Time) on Mon day, November 11, 2019 - OR UPON DELIVERY  \n  \n \n4 \n federal funds rate has never exceeded 2.4 percent , and as I noted a few moment s ago, the Fed has \nonce again lowered the funds rate to mitigate the risks of a global slowdown and trade disputes.   \nAs a result, while the macroeconomic environment in the U.S. is relatively beni gn, short -\nterm interest rates in the U .S. have limited room to react to a significant adverse  shock.  In \nGermany and Japan , where the economic outcomes have not been as encouraging , short -term \nrates remain negative , despite being over a decade  from  the financial crisis.   \nSo how is policy to respond?  \n One reaction to the limitations on lowering short -term policy rates in the wake of the \nGreat Recession has been for central banks to use their balance sheets to push down long-term \nrates.   These quant itative easings and maturity transformations  could be considered  the \n“traditional nontraditional\" policies.   However, Figure 2  shows that  the buffer  for this alternate \nmonetary  policy  tool is also in a somewhat diminished  state.  In the U .S., the 10 -year Tre asury \nrate has fluctuated recently between 1.5 and 2 percent, below the Fed’s  2 percent inflation target.  \nIn Germany and Japan , 10-year nominal rates are already negative, providing very little , if any , \ncapacity for monetary policy stimulus using  balance sheet actions.  \n While we don’t know exactly how long low rates will last, some of the underlying factors \nproducing low equilibrium rates are likely to persist .  Slowing population  growth  and aging \npopulations are with us for the duration.  We can hope for improved productivity gains , and that \nmay happen, but we do not  see signs yet of a convincing resurgence in trend productivity growth.  \nFigure 3  provides the median and central tendency  around what the Federal Open Market \nCommittee (FOMC), the U.S. monetary policy decision -making body,  expects the federal funds \nrate to be in the long er run.  The estimate of the long er-run nominal federal funds rate has \n\n  EMBARGOED UNTIL  \n8:15 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time (2 :15 P.M. Norway  Time) on Mon day, November 11, 2019 - OR UPON DELIVERY  \n  \n \n5 \n declined significantly just since 2014, and  the most recent median estimate of 2.5 percent is the \nlowest it has been over the past five years.  \n The implications of th e diminished monetary policy buffer are  significant .  Monetary \npolicy has been the tool of choice to provide countercyclical stimulus  during much of the \npostwar era.  Given the  current  diminished monetary  policy  buffer, recessions  may be deeper and \nrecoveries slower than what we have experienced historically , unless additional buffers  are \nprovided by fiscal, regulatory , and financial stability policies  and deemed appropriate to utilize \nby policymakers .  \n \nImplications for the Bank ing System  \n One implication of a low interest rate environment with limited monetary policy buffers \nis that recoveries from future recession s may be more shallow, possibly resulting in a prolonged \nperiod of relatively poor economic performance , and an extended episode of policy rates at the \neffective lower bound .  The implications for the banking system are important to consider.  \nMany bank s tress tests , such as those conducted in the U.S., do not  capture the  effects of \nprolonged economic underperformance  on banks , as the  tests often consider a span of only a \ncouple years (in the U.S., nine quarters) .  If the tests underestimate the full impact of sluggish \nrecoveries in a low rate environment, they might correspondingly indicate  capital buffers that are \ninsufficient to protect banks against losses .3  \n Figure 4  shows the path of three capital ratios  for U.S. Gl obal Systemically Important \nBank Holding Companies, or GSIBs .  Equity capital to total assets and the tier 1 leverage  ratio \nboth leveled off in early 2016 and have declined somewhat since then.  The common equity t ier \n\n  EMBARGOED UNTIL  \n8:15 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time (2 :15 P.M. Norway  Time) on Mon day, November 11, 2019 - OR UPON DELIVERY  \n  \n \n6 \n 1 risk -based capital ratio is now modestly higher than in  2016.  It’s worth recalling the equity \ncapital and tier 1 leverage ratios were focal points for many investors during the financial crisis.   \nThe recent declines  in these key capital ratios  raise  the question of whether the level of capital \nrepresents an adequate  and appropriate buffer , if a low interest rate , constrained monetary policy  \nenvironment  continues . \n Figure 5  shows the profitability of the largest banks in the United States, the Euro Ar ea, \nand Japan.   In both the Euro Area and Japan, the challenging macroeconomic environment has \nresulted in very depressed interest rates.   In the U.S., which is no longer at the effective lower \nbound, the macroeconomic environment has been more favorable.   Differences in bank \nprofitability reflect, in part, the impact of these macroeconomic differences.   In an environment \nof a hypothetical global recession, it is unlikely that the profit opportunities would be any better \n– in fact, the loan losses could pro vide a very challenging environment.  \n With capital ratios in the U .S. leveling off  – and in some instances falling  – and \nprofitability depressed  in certain regions , it is important to ask whether the financial system is  \nprepared for a  hypothetical  global economic downturn .  In addressing that question, i t is \ninteresting to consider  banks ’ payout ratios, as shown in Figure 6 .  In the United States, even as  \ndividends have been increasing, share repurchases have also been accelerating, resulting in qu ite \nhigh payout ratios  (specifically, dividends and repurchases as a share of net income) .  If the \nstress test no long er requires U.S. banks to pre -fund dividends and share buybacks  – that is, if \nbanks are no longer required to meet capital ratios after payouts in stress conditions  – one can \nexpect payout ratios to rise further , dissipating the volume of capital that would be available to \nensure solvency .4  \n\n  EMBARGOED UNTIL  \n8:15 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time (2 :15 P.M. Norway  Time) on Mon day, November 11, 2019 - OR UPON DELIVERY  \n  \n \n7 \n  One way to avoid such  a difficult operating environment for banks is to activate the  \nCounter cyclic al Capital Buffers (CCyB) .5  By increasing capital requirements during an \neconomic expansion, the CCyB would put b anks in a better position  to handle an economic \ndownturn  in an era in which monetary policy buffers  are limited .  Hopefully , better -capitalized  \nbanks would help compensate for limited monetary and fiscal policy  buffers .   \nFigure 7  shows the CCyBs  currently in effect and announced by jurisdiction.6  There is \noften a long transition period between the announcement of a Countercyclical Capital Buffer \nchange and its implementation.  The chart shows  that many countries have increase d their \nCCyBs , and some are planning further increases .  In the U .S., in sharp contrast , the CCyB  \nremains at zero.   \nIn my view, proposals that would substitute CCyBs for capital adequacy buffers could \nhave undesirable effects. 7  Although the CCyB could provide an offset for the lack of monetary \npolicy buffer in a low interest rate environment, banks would likely be undercapitalized at the \ntrough  of the economic downturn once the CCyB has been reduced – due to the lower capital \nrequirements going into a recession.  \nIn the last recession, banks were unwilling to stop dividend  payout s in a proactive way.  \nThis is not surprising ; no bank wants to sign al it is in distress, but this potential reputational risk \nresults in banks being slow to retain needed capital.  Regulatory stress tests can help by requiring \nall banks to be able to fund dividends and share buybacks in stressed situations .  Given the lik ely \ninability of banks to raise funds sufficient to pre -fund high dividend payouts, this would likely \nresult in most banks reduc ing payouts to meet the regulatory pre-funding requirement  as their \ncapital is eroded.   \n\n  EMBARGOED UNTIL  \n8:15 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time (2 :15 P.M. Norway  Time) on Mon day, November 11, 2019 - OR UPON DELIVERY  \n  \n \n8 \n Indeed, Figure 8  examines the 2007 -2010 period and compares cumulative cash \ndividends paid on common stock by the largest banks to the capital infusions they received \nthrough the Capital Purchase Program.  The chart illustrates that roughly half of the capital \ninfus ions into the largest banks during the financial crisis could have been avoided with a more \nproactive reduction in dividend payouts as economic problems ar ose.   \nThere is little reason to believe that banks will be more proactive in the next crisis if they \nare no longer required to pre -fund payout s as a mean s of managing the risk attending stressed \nconditions .  I also see the historical record arguing against the recently proposed change to no \nlonger require pre -funding of payout  amounts . \n In summary, I am not sur e that recent developments and proposals  in bank regulation \nproperly reflect the risks we are likely to face in a low  interest  rate environment that challenges \nbank profitability and provides less by way of monetary policy buffers.  Specifically, capital \nbuffers should be rising now so that there is more room for them to decline if the economy \nfalters.  While this is true for the United States, it may be even more true in Japan and Europe . \n \nLeverage in the Corporate Sector  \n In a low i nterest rate environment  with robust capital market conditions, corporations  are \nincented  to take on more leverage.  And leverage  potentially amplifies the  economic problems \nthat arise in a downturn .8  Outside the U.S., in some jurisdictions, there are mor e opportunities \nfor regulators to influence or limit excessive leverage.  I believe U.S. policymakers would do \nwell to explore ways that policies could be used to prevent the buildup of leverage in a low -rate \n\n  EMBARGOED UNTIL  \n8:15 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time (2 :15 P.M. Norway  Time) on Mon day, November 11, 2019 - OR UPON DELIVERY  \n  \n \n9 \n environment, hopefully reducing the  macroeconomic spillover that could result from over-\nlevered  households and firms.  \n Figure 9  shows the ratio of nonfinancial corporate business debt to GDP in the U .S.  This \nratio now exceeds its peak prior to the last recession and is at a n all-time high for the series.  As \nworrisome as this level of debt is , as the financial crisis highlighted , the distribution of risks to \nleverage across types of borrowers  may be as important as the level of leverage  itself.  \n Figure 10  shows the share of investment grade bonds rated BBB, the lowest rating that \nstill qualifies as investment grade.  Prior to t he past two recessions , the share of BBB -rated \ninvestment -grade bonds was much lower, and then increased significantly during and following \nthe recessi on. In those episodes, the rising share of BBB -rated debt  initially  reflected , in part, \ndowngrades of what were formerly higher -rated securities.  However, as this long recovery  has \nprogressed , the share of BBB securities has instead risen steadily , as fir ms have chosen to issue \nsignificant quantit ies of debt securities . \n Figure 11  shows the share of loan  issuances  with high leverage, used here to refer to  six \nor more times earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization ( EBITDA ).  While \nthe share of highly leveraged loans out of to tal loans has increased significantly since 2010, the \nshare of highly leveraged loans used to finance leveraged buyout s has risen even more \ndramatically .  In the United States , guidance – including the leveraged lo an guidance  – is not \nitself legally enforceable on banks.  In addition, unlike in other countries where regulators may \nlimit leveraged lending for financial stability reasons, the suite of macroprudential  tools is more \nlimited in the U.S. and U.S. bank reg ulators have sought to address bank s’ provision of \nleveraged loans through consideration of safety and soundness of the individual banks.  As a \n\n  EMBARGOED UNTIL  \n8:15 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time (2 :15 P.M. Norway  Time) on Mon day, November 11, 2019 - OR UPON DELIVERY  \n  \n \n10 \n result, we see that the low interest rate environment, and the global willingness to “reach for \nyield,” have pro vided a ready market for corporations  issuing highly leveraged loans.   \n Thus , corporations are not only becoming more leveraged relative to GDP, but the \ndistribution of credits is much more skewed towards the riskier credits than in the past.  In sum, \none implication of this low interest rate environment has been that it appears to have encourage d \nlenders to look for higher -risk and higher -return loans .  That desire has been met by a  ready \nmarket for corporations willing to fund themselves with this riskier debt.  Unfortunately, t his \nstate of affairs  is likely to lead to  more corporations being in financial distress – or even being in \nbankruptcy – in a hypothetical recession because they are no longer able to service their high \ndebt lev els.  Greater corporate losses in a downturn, in turn , will exacerbate the negative \noutcomes relative to those that would have occurred with a less risky state of leverage.  The \nlimited monetary policy buffers available magnify the problem.  So I consider it impo rtant to ask \nwhether such high leverage, and the potential collateral damage it may cause in a downturn, \nrequire s more significant public policy responses.  \n \nConcluding Observations  \n While a low interest rate environment has implications for the sufficiency of monetary \npolicy buffers  – a topic of the  current  monetary policy framework discussion in the United States  \n– it also has implications for regulatory policies and financial stability policies.  A low interest \nrate environment is likely to  depress bank profits and , separately,  make monetary policy less able \nto offset shocks.  This combination suggests a higher capital buffer is required  now than what \nwould  be need ed in a higher interest rate environment , so that capital  ratios will have more room \n\n  EMBARGOED UNTIL  \n8:15 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time (2 :15 P.M. Norway  Time) on Mon day, November 11, 2019 - OR UPON DELIVERY  \n  \n \n11 \n to decline  during a downturn .  At least to date, it is my view that capital regulations may not \nfully reflect this increased risk.  \n Similarly, financial stability concerns stemming from  leverage in the economy may \nrequire some  rethinkin g in a low interest rate environment.  To date , in the U .S. there is no \ncomprehensive way for public policy to address the incentives to increase corporate or household \nleverage in a low interest rate environment.  There is , however,  more latitude to influ ence \nleverage in some other countries .   \nIn sum, I would suggest that the potential costs of the excessive leverage that arise in a \nlow interest rate environment deserve more research and , I suspect , more focused and proactive  \npolicy actions.  \nThank you . \n  \n \n1 See https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/review -of-monetary -policy -strategy -tools -and-communications.htm   \n \n2 For additional discussion, see  April 18, 2018 remarks by Eric S.

Rosengren  \nPresident & Chief Executive Officer  \nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston  \n \n \nThe Forecasters Club of New York  \n \n \n \nNew York , New York  \nDecember  17, 2019 \n \n \n \n\n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL  \n1:00 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Tuesday, December 17, 2019 - OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n1 \n  \nGood afternoon.  Than k you for inviting me to N ew York to address the Forecasters \nClub.  A s we close out a year and begin to look to a new one , it is a  great time to be talking about  \nforecasts  and the economic outlook .   \nI’ll begin with a summary overview, and then walk you through some key data.  \nThe economy continues to perform quite well , as the December employment report from \nthe Labor Department highlighted .  We have strong  labor markets , with the unemployment rate \nreturning to its 50 -year low .  And the reported  job growth of 266,000 was a nice surprise , \nparticularly for  retailers hop ing for strong holiday sales.  Consistent with the positive news in the \nemployment report, retailers I have talk ed with have been optimistic  about h oliday sales .  \nFortunately for the  economy, m any consumer s seem to be  in a buying mood.  \n Since April , the economy  has performed  pretty much as many professional forecasters \nexpected  – this, despite recent concerns with downside risks , notably those  associated with  \nslower global growth and uncertainty about  trade policy .  While the composition  of real GDP has \nbeen somewhat different th an expected by many forecasts from late spring , GDP growth and \nunemployment have generally been quite close to what was forecast  – for example in  the Survey \nof Professional Forecasters , the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia’s quarterly survey of \nroughly 50 forecasters . \n Several months ago the  financial news  seemed to highlight  the increasing likelihood of an  \neconomic downturn, but more recently  those concerns appear  to have subsided .  In fact, the \noutlook s of most private forecasters ha ve consistently centered on continued growth in the  \neconomy, even while the prognosticators who focus on financial variables such as the slope of \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL  \n1:00 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Tuesday, December 17, 2019 - OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n2 \n yield curve have placed a higher probability o n an economic downturn.  In other words , financial \nmarket  practitioner s may have priced in slightly more risk to the economy, but economic \nforecasters saw the most likely outcome as economic expansion.    \nMy own view is that it is unlikely we will have a n economic downturn  in the coming \nyear, given the  generally  positive financial conditions and the continued accommodative \nmonetary and fiscal policies.  Of course , this outlook  assumes that we do not have a significant \nnegative shock from abroad , or experience a negative shock from a sharp ra tcheting up  of trade \ndisputes with major trading partners.1 \n With the recent positive economic news, and with monetary and fiscal policy al ready \naccommodative, I see no need to make the current stance of monetary policy  more \naccommodative  in the near term.  Given that monetary policy works with lags, and Federal \nReserve policymakers have already eased monetary policy three times in 2019, my view is that it \nis approp riate to take a patient approach to considering any policy  changes,  unles s there is a \nmaterial change to the  outlook . \n I would like to turn now to why my perspective  on the economy is optimistic.  I’ll review \nboth the  forecast s and economic data , to explain  my outlook . \n \nThe Economic Outlook  \n Turning to the data, Figure 1  shows the Survey of Professional Forecasters’ outlook for \nthe unemployment rate , and the actual data for the first three quarters  of the year .  Since  April, \nthe unemployment rate has moved  in a tight range.  In April , the unemployment rate was 3.6 \npercent, and in November the unemployment rate was  little change d at 3.5 percent.  In the \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL  \n1:00 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Tuesday, December 17, 2019 - OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n3 \n intervening period , it fluctuated in a range from 3.5 to 3.7  percen t.  November’s Survey of \nProfessional Forecasters show s that forecast ers expect the unemployment rate to remain in th is \nrange  for the next year .  In addition, the shaded region shows the spread between the 25th and \n75th percentile forecasts  is quite  narrow.  My own forecast is quite similar , in that I believe the \nunemployment rate will likely fluctuate narrowly around its current value.  \n Figure 2  provides actuals for the first three quarters  of the year and the Survey of \nProfessional Forecasters expe ctations  for core inflation  – which is measured using the Personal \nConsumption Expenditures , or PCE , price index .2  In early  2019 , core PCE inflation was lower \nthan expected.  However, most forecasters continue to believe  that shortfall  reflect ed temporary  \nfactors  – and thus they expect the  core PCE, which has subsequently risen , to remain  close to the \nFed’s  2 percent inflation target in 2020.3  My own forecast is quite similar .  I expect that given \nthe strong  labor market, PCE inflation should move in a narrow range around the Fed’s 2 percent \ntarget.  \n Figure 3  provides actual and forecast real GDP growth.  The economy has grown  at close \nto a 2 percent  annual rate  over th e past two quarters , as strength in the household sector has \nlargely offset  the weakness in business investment.  That pattern is likely to continue, as \nconsumer  spending is  bolstered by job creation, increases in personal income, and increases in \nwealth.  In addition, the recent monetary policy easing is likely to continue to bo lster the housing \nsector.  \n Overall the median forecasts from the Survey of Professional Forecasters look quite \nsimilar to my own.  The U.S. economy is quite solid, and barring  an unexpected adverse  shock, \nmy view is that the economy is currently well positioned for the coming year.   And, depending \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL  \n1:00 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Tuesday, December 17, 2019 - OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n4 \n on one’s view about potential GDP growth  – because growth above potential implies lower \nunemployment – it is an economy where labor markets might be expected to strength en further.  \nRisks to the Economic Forecast  \n Of course,  the global economy still faces a number of downside  risks. Yet, s ome of the \nconcerns surrounding trade and global growth that were elevated earlier this year appear to have \nabated somewhat .  As you may recall , earlier this fall there wa s significant discussion about a \nrising probability of a recession in 2020.  These concerns were particularly elevated around the \ntime that  trade discussions seemed to falter , and financial market participants became concerned \nthat the  temporarily  inverted  slope of the yield curve was portending an imminent slowdown.4 \n Despite the concerns  raised by financial market participants , most economic forecasters \nassessed a lo w probability of a recession.  The Survey of Professional Forecasters asks \nparticipants in the survey to provide their assessment  of the probability distribution of outcomes \nfor variables such as real GDP , for the coming year .  Figure 4 provides the average of \nprobabilities based on that survey.  The f igure shows most of the distribution of forecasts for  real \nGDP  fall in the 1 to 3 percent range.  Very  little of the distribution  is associated with \nprobabilities of negative real GDP , which is consisten t with a low likelihood of a recession next \nyear. \n To a large extent, these  probabilities likely reflect the strong household sector numbers I \nmentioned earlier .  Figure 5  shows the growth in real consumer spending , which has been quite \nstrong over the pas t two quarters.  As previously mentioned, p lentiful jobs and growth in income \nhave provided improvements in confidence and bode well for holiday sales  and beyond .  \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL  \n1:00 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Tuesday, December 17, 2019 - OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n5 \n  Trends in the saving rate and household wealth (net worth) shown in Figure 6  also \nhighlight why the consumer is well positioned to spend.  Both the saving rate and household net \nworth are trending upward simultaneously and have been for some time now, bringing their \nlevels to near highs.  As you can see from the portion of the cha rt before the last recession, t he \ntwo don’t typically move in the same direction.   \nFigure 7 shows that after a series of quarters in which  real residential investment  fell, the \nhousing sector appears to be responding to lower inte rest rates  in the marketp lace.  Of course,  the \nlower mortgage rates are partly spurred by the F ederal Open Market Committee ’s 75 basis  point  \nreduction in the federal funds  rate, as shown in Figure 8. \n Figure 9 shows one reason that a measure of the slope of the yield curve may not always \npredict an economic down turn, as I  have discussed in recent talks .  The blue line displays one \nmeasure of the slope  — the 10-year U.S. Treasury rate minus the 3 -month Treasury rate.  The \ngreen line shows the real federal funds rate , minus the estimated real e quilibrium  rate.  Positive \nvalues of this series are meant to capture times when  the Fed is pursuing restrictive monetary \npolicy, and vice versa for negative values.   In the  periods preceding the previous two recessions , \nthe Federal Reserve took a more restrictive monetary policy stance in respons e to rising wages \nand prices .  The more restrictive monetary policy in these episodes raise d the short -term interest \nrates enough to cause  an inversion of the yield curve.  \nIn each of the past three recessions, the green line has been in  positive  territory  – simply \nmeaning that  monetary policy became more restrictive ( the policy rate set by the Fed was higher \nthan the estimate of the equilibrium rate ) at the same time that the yield curve flattened  or \ninverted .  In the most recent period, the real federal funds rate has remained below the \nequilibrium interest rate  estimate .  Of course, the true value of the equilibrium interest rate (“r -\n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL  \n1:00 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Tuesday, December 17, 2019 - OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n6 \n star” or r*) is uncertain, and estimates have been declining for some time.  Yet i f the estimate is \naccurate, w ith the  recent  75 basis  point s of reduction the federal funds rate  is now much lower \nthan the estimated equilibrium rate .5   If a negative  slope of the yield curve was , in part , \npredictive because of its association with tightening monetary policy , it may be less predictive in \ncurrent circumstances  – because unlike the other historical episodes, monetary policy continues \nto be accommodative . \n An inverted yield curve isn’t the only risk  to the economic outlook , however.  Figure 10 \nhighlights another reason why some analysts have been concerned about a possible  recession.  \nThe purchasing managers ’ survey from the Institute for Supply Management  provides both \nmanufacturing and  nonmanufacturing ind ices, where observations above 50 indicate increases  in \nactivity , and observations below 50 indicate declines.  A decli ne in manufacturing is sometimes  a \nleading indicator of a potential recession.   And at times, such declines  have sometimes predicted \nrecessions that never occurred.   \nAs an alternative, n ote that the past two recessions were associated with sub-50 readings \nfor both the manufacturing and nonmanufacturing surveys.  As just noted , when only the \nmanufacturing sector has fallen below 50, it has not been a reliable predictor of  a recession.  One \ncould argue that the current reading has the potentia l to be another such false signal, given \ncurrent events.  In particular, s ince tariffs are particularly focused on traded goods, it is not \nsurprising that manufacturing has been weak.  However, the services that account for the \nnonmanufacturing index movem ent have held up quite well, since these industries have not been \nas directly impacted by the trade disputes.  \n Figure 1 1 illustrate s another indication t hat financial conditions remain  accommodative : \nthe very low 10 -year Treasury term premium.  In other words , not only is the federal funds rate \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL  \n1:00 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Tuesday, December 17, 2019 - OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n7 \n below the equilibrium rate, but long rates also remain quite low by historical standards.  The \nterm premium is likely low, at least in part, because many developed countries are still \nconducting quantitative easing , making U .S. Treasuries look quite attractive by comparison, \nboosting their demand and depress ing the 10-year U.S. Treasury rate.   \n With both fiscal and monetary policy being accommodative, financial conditions \nsupportive, and recent data positive, I agr ee with the  surveyed  professional forecasters that the \nlikelihood of a recession in 2020  is relatively low.  However, a low probability does not mean it \ncannot happen, and certainly a negative shock from abroad or a significant flare up in trade \ndispute s could change the outlook significantly.   Hence, as always, i t is appropriate to continue \nto closely monitor incoming data.  \n \nConcluding O bservations  \n In summary and conclusion, my view is that the economy is currently in a good place.  \nLabor markets are strong , inflation is moving to target, and growth is likely to be somewhat \nabove potential.  Particularly given the recent cuts in the federal funds rate, and the fact that \nmonetary actions take effect with some lag, I would say that this is a good time to  patiently \nassess the economy.  In the short run, I do not see a need for additional policy easing  unless there \nis a material change to the forecast.  \n Thank you , and best wishes for a happy and healthy New Year.   \n \n1 For additional discussion, see: Rosengren, Eric: “ Exploring Economic Conditions and the Implications for \nMonetary Policy ,” Oct. 11, 2019.                                                              \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL  \n1:00 P.M.

Core inflation measures remove volatile food and energy not \nbecause they are not important, but because their volatility can distract from broader trends.  The core number is \noften a better gauge of true underlying inflation pressur es.  \n \n4 For more discussion, see: Rosengren, Eric: “ Assessing Economic Conditions and Risks to Financial Stability ,” \nSept. 20, 2019.  \n \n5 As economists would put it,  “r” is now much lower than “r *” it would appear – if the estimate of r* is correct and \npolicymakers’ estimates cease declining.",
