Collins \nPresident & Chief Executive Officer  \nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston  \n \n \nFebruary 6, 2024 \n \n \n* Organized by the Federal Reserve Board and the  \nFederal Reserve Banks of Atlanta, Boston, Cleveland,  \nPhiladelphia, San Francisco, and St. Louis  \n \n \nThe views expressed today are my own, not necessarily those of my colleagues on the \nFederal Reserve Board of Governors or the Federal Open Market Committee.   \n \n   \n \n  \n \n   \n \n   \n   Remarks as Prepared for Delivery  \nEMBARGOED UNTIL 2: 00 P.M U.S. Eastern Time,  \nTuesday , February 6, 202 4 – OR UPON DELIVERY  \n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery  \nEMBARGOED UNTIL 2:00 P.M U.S. Eastern Time,  \nTuesday, February 6, 2024 –  OR UPON DELIVERY  \n  \n It is a pleasure to take part in this conference, for a few reasons.  First, the topic \nof persistent labor market disparities is important and timely.  Second, the papers being \npresented are interesting and well done.  I’ll say more about them in a moment.   And to \necho Raphael Bostic yesterday, I am thrilled that t he Boston Fed has joined five other \nregional Reserve Banks and the Board of Governors on this work.  We really do go \nfarther when we go together.   \n I am delighted to have the opportunity to provide opening remarks to today’s \nsessions.   I want to start by underlining the importance of rigorously exploring \npersistently uneven labor market outcomes.  Appropriately, the conference organizers have rooted this effort in the Fed’s mandate from Congress, typically summarized as \nmaximum employment and price stability –  the oft- cited “dual mandate.”  \n Of course, the widely followed overall unemployment rate is the standard \nmeasure for the state of the U.S. labor market.  But underneath that single statistic are \nwide-ranging differences across geographies, and demographic groups.  No one \nstatistic can ad equately characterize the labor market because aggregate numbers can \nmask the wide range of experiences across people, sectors, and places.  Uneven labor \nmarket outcomes call for a full and focused exploration, motivated by our duty to pursue the Fed’s maximum employment mandate.   \n For some people, communities, and places, there are substantial and persistent \ngaps in economic outcomes –  including but not limited to employment.  This \nunderutilization of the workforce adversely affects national productivity and prosperity.  \n I often describe our work at the Boston Fed as pursuing and supporting a vibrant \neconomy that works for everyone, not just for some people.  That, along with the Fed’s \nmandate, compels us to understand the challenges contributing to higher \nunemployment and  underemployment present in some areas and among some \ndemographic groups – and long- run barriers to full participation in the labor market.   \n The Federal Reserve needs to parse the labor market for another reason: to \ngauge the cyclical position of the economy, thereby allowing monetary policymakers to \n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery  \nEMBARGOED UNTIL 2:00 P.M U.S. Eastern Time,  \nTuesday, February 6, 2024 –  OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n1 \n appropriately calibrate the stance of policy; and to better understand and thus achieve \nthe full -employment portion of the dual mandate.  \n Regarding the labor market’s cyclical position, consider that during and after the \nGreat Recession of 2007- 9, aggregate labor market participation fell significantly.  To \ngauge the short -run state of the labor market, the interest -rate-setting Federal Open  \nMarket Committee needed to understand how much of this decline was cyclical, and \nhow much was structural. Undoubtedly, many people dropped out of the labor force due \nto the cyclical situation –  a poor job market.  But structural factors, most notably the \naging of the population, also played a role.  Disentangling the relative contribution and persistence of cyclical and structural factors was key to formulating and implementing \nan appropriate policy response.      \n Understanding the behavior of labor force participation is important, because \nwhen participation changes, the unemployment rate becomes an inadequate indicator \nof full employment.  If participation increases in a tight labor market, labor supply \nexpands – and higher levels of economic activity may not generate additional price \npressures, requiring tighter monetary policy.  And higher levels of activity and \nparticipation can benefit those drawn into the labor market.  \n We know that many structural factors impact participation.  Examples include the \nlong- running decline in job opportunities for less -educated workers, which has \nparticularly affected prime- age men; and the high cost and limited availability of \nchildcare, which tends to reduce participation among women with children.  As I travel \naround my district – New England –  and speak to a wide variety of stakeholders, I hear \nabout issues that impede participation in the workforce, which is a challenge not only for individuals but also for employers.  In this way, issues like childcare can really affect the \neconomy.  \n Of course, monetary policy is not the right tool to address these types of \nstructural labor market frictions.  However, Fed economists can, and do, conduct rigorous research on structural issues, and we convene conferences like this to discuss \n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery  \nEMBARGOED UNTIL 2:00 P.M U.S. Eastern Time,  \nTuesday, February 6, 2024 – OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n2 \n our own work and that of others.  These kinds of intellectual exchanges reflect, as I \nnoted earlier, the Federal Reserve’s mandate to promote full employment.  \n Last fall, the annual Boston Fed economic conference focused on the question of \nhow best to define and promote full employment – “maximum sustained employment.”  I \nrecommend the papers and sessions to you.1  Presenters paid particular attention to \nbarriers preventing many individuals from fully participating in the labor market.  \nConference participants analyzed gaps in employment along racial and gender lines; \ndiscussed the effectiveness of job- training pro grams; learned about new ways of \nmeasuring the gig economy; and analyzed the barriers to employment faced by individuals who had contact with the criminal justice system.    \n Like that conference, today’s discussion brings together rigorous, thoughtful, \ncreative researchers to explore policy -relevant issues, in service to the public good.  \nConvenings like these demonstrate the power of inquiry and collaboration.  \n Today’s session turns to dimensions of a particularly important facet of this work \n– the experiences of women and men in the workforce, and the economic and cultural \nfactors affecting individual decisions about workforce engagement.   \n I want to thank today’s speakers for the research they’ve conducted, and will \nshare with us, on how some incentives and barriers drive differing labor force \nparticipation decisions and experiences for men and women.  \n Each of the papers illuminates one or more ways gender differences in \nemployment and participation can arise.  Let me mention a highlight or two:  \n  \n The Xu paper highlights how weak labor markets during economic downturns \ncan actually increase participation for some workers.  For example, a woman \nmay enter the labor force in response to her spouse being laid off.   \n \n1 Conference material and session videos are available at https://www.bostonfed.org/news -and-\nevents/events/economic -research- conference- series/rethinking- full-employment.aspx  \n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery  \nEMBARGOED UNTIL 2:00 P.M U.S. Eastern Time,  \nTuesday, February 6, 2024 –  OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n3 \n  The Buzard et al. paper considers how stereotypes about parental availability \ncan worsen gender inequality in the labor market. Because mothers are called \nmuch more frequently than fathers when issues arise for their child at school, \nwomen face an implicit  barrier to labor force participation.  \n \n The Bengali et al. paper considers the factors behind declining participation by \nprime -age men.  While changing demographics explain little of this decline, \nincreased caregiving by men plays some role.  However, the authors find the largest contributor to the rise in male nonparticipation is skills mismatch.  The \nauthors further document that these factors, and the rise in nonparticipation \ngenerally, are more pronounced for prime- age Black men.   \n \n The Goerge et al. paper uses random variation generated in the administration of \nchildcare subsidies to test whether such subsidies raise maternal employment \nand earnings.  The results indicate that childcare subsidies have a positive and \nstatistically sig nificant effect on maternal employment.  The authors also find that \ndifferences in total earnings induced by the policies, while not statistically significant, were in the same positive direction and about the same size as the \nemployment effects.  \n \n That is just a preview of the great research we will hear about today.  My thanks \nto all the organizers, contributors, and attendees.  \n Now I’ll turn the floor to Richard Reeves, founder and president of the American \nInstitute for Boys and Men, and a longtime thought leader at Brookings.  \n Thank you.",

Collins  \nPresident & Chief Executive Officer  \nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston  \n \n \n \nFebruary 7, 2024 \n \n \n \nHeld at the Federal Reserve B ank of Bosto n \n \n \n \nThe views expressed today are my own, not necessarily those of my colleagues on the \nFederal Reserve Board of Governors or the Federal Open Market Committee.   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   Remarks as Prepared for Delivery  \nEMBARGOED UNTIL 11:30  A.M U.S. Eastern Time,  \nWedne sday, February 7, 202 4 – OR UPON DELIVERY  \n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery  \nEMBARGOED UNTIL 11:30 A.M U.S. Eastern Time,  \nWednesday, February 7, 2024 – OR UPON DELIVERY  \n  \n \n  Key Takeaways  \n1.  The U.S. economy overall performed remarkably well in 2023.  Inflation slowed notably last \nyear, while the job market remained quite favorable.  These very encouraging trends have \nreinforced Collins’ optimism that we are on a path to price stability with a healthy job market.  \n2.  However, Collins says she will need to see more evidence that the disinflationary process will \ncontinue before beginning to carefully adjust the monetary policy stance.  Recent developments in \nthe economic data highlight that progress toward achieving the Fed’s mandated goals could be \nuneven, and more time is needed to discern whether some of the promising economic trends we \nsaw in 2023 will both broaden and persist, going forward.  \n3.  In Collins’ view, the threat of inflation settling persistently above the Committee’s 2 percent \ntarget has receded, and risks to the economy overall are moving into better balance.  Still, a \nsustained, durable return to 2 percent inflation will likely requ ire demand growing at a more \nmoderate pace this year. Collins sees the current stance of monetary policy as consistent with \nachieving this outcome.  \n4.  Collins says policy should reflect the commitment to restoring price stability while also aiming \nto preserve the more -equitable outcomes seen in this recovery.  In the current environment, \nappropriate policy requires an assessment of the incoming data that  is holistic and increasingly \nfocused on implications for the economic outlook.  While not on a preset path, she believes it will \nlikely become appropriate to begin easing policy restraint later this year.  \n5.  Collins also notes that overall, the strength of an economy has many dimensions.  In this \nregard, the Federal Reserve is involved in a breadth of activities, all in the public interest – to \nsupport a vibrant economy that works for all: monetary policymakin g, economic research, bank \nsupervision, infrastructure and services for the financial system, and supporting collaborations \nthat expand prospects for progress in communities.   \n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery  \nEMBARGOED UNTIL 11:30 A.M U.S. Eastern Time,  \nWednesday, February 7, 2024 – OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n1 \n  \n It is my great pleasure to welcome the Boston Economic Club back to the \nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston.  I had a chance to greet you last February, for the \nevent featuring Neel Kashkari and Roger Lowenstein, and I’m really delighted to be with \nyou today.  We appreciate that the Club chooses to hold its meetings here at the Bank \neach month – and certa inly want the Boston Fed to be a key place for those who study \nthe economy to gather.  \n Our focus here at the Boston Fed is on policies and services that support a \nvibrant economy that provides opportunities for everyone.  And we share the Club’s \ninterest in a frank exchange of views, rigorous use of data, and focus on important \ntopics with the potential for impact.  \n I should mention, as always, that my remarks represent my own views, not \nnecessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal Reserve Board of Governors or the \nFederal Open Market Committee.  \n \nThe Promise and Potential of New England  \n At the Boston Fed, our district includes just about all of New England, and I take \nseriously my commitment to all six states, visiting each one at least annually.  \nExchanging perspective with a wide range of stakeholders in the economy is vital to \npolicym aking – and is meaningful, inspiring, and really enjoyable.  \n Although I lived in New England at an earlier stage of my career, I have been \nable to return with “fresh eyes” and note some of what makes it wonderful.  Without \nquestion the talent and brainpower in so many fields – certainly economics and finance \namong them – make this region very special.   \n Today we’re gathered in Boston.  Extraordinary problem solving has occurred \nhere, creating better living standards and entire industries – in medicine, technology, \nand financial products, to name a few.  We have amazing talent and institutions here.   \n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery  \nEMBARGOED UNTIL 11:30 A.M U.S. Eastern Time,  \nWednesday, February 7, 2024 – OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n2 \n  I mention this because we live in a world of challenges, and Greater Boston and \nNew England face many – including housing supply and expense; transportation \ninfrastructure; access to dependent care, and the potential for climate shifts to affect \nassets or  expenses.1   \n But we have an immense capacity for innovation and problem solving, as we’ve \nshown.  I look forward to what we can accomplish in New England to support a vibrant \neconomy that works for all.  I am optimistic about what we can accomplish when we \ncare, colla borate, study, and act.   \n \nThe Boston’s Fed’s Portfolio and Mission  \n I’d like to highlight some of the ways the Boston Fed reflects that spirit of \ninnovation and problem -solving.  As you know, the strength of an economy has many \ndimensions – so the Federal Reserve, our nation’s Central Bank, is involved in a \nnumber of acti vities, all in the public interest.  Most people know us for monetary policy, \nand the research that underpins it.  We’re also supervisors of some of the nation’s \nfinancial institutions, and provide back -end infrastructure and services for the financial \nsystem.  And we examine factors that could limit people from participating in the \neconomy, and support research and collaborations that expand prospects for progress \nin communities.  \n I’ll mention just two examples of Boston Fed innovation.     \n First, many parts of New England that were once centers for manufacturing or \nnatural resources have faced long -term challenges.  Our Working Places initiative,2 \n \n1 See, for example, the following work by Boston Fed staff:  \n▪ The Effects of Weather on Massachusetts Municipal Expenditures: Implications of Climate Change \nfor Local Governments in New England (bostonfed.org)  \n▪ Early Child Care for Working Parents (bostonfed.org) ; Podcast Season 2: A Private Crisis - Federal \nReserve Bank of Boston  \n▪ Housing and rent prices with Paul Willen - Federal Reserve Bank of Boston  \n \n \n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery  \nEMBARGOED UNTIL 11:30 A.M U.S. Eastern Time,  \nWednesday, February 7, 2024 – OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n3 \n started under my predecessor Eric Rosengren, is based on research showing that an \nessential element of place -based economic resurgence is local, cross -sector \ncollaboration.  Now in 30 communities  across 5 states , teams of local leaders choose a \nshared goal for improving the economy that benefits low -income people – for example, \ncreatively supporting workforce development, affordable housing, or childcare supply; or \nremoving barriers to entrepreneurship.  They dev elop and implement strategies.  The \nFed hosts , convenes, and supports these efforts – but not financially.  The real work is \nin local ingenuity and commitment.  \n Second, I mentioned the Fed’s work on payments.  It wasn’t so long ago that \npaper checks had to be physically flown around the country to settle at the bank they \nwere drawn on – a slow, costly necessity.  The Boston Fed and others helped pioneer \ndigital c heck imaging, and expanded automated clearing of electronic payments – and \nmore recently, creation of an entirely new interbank system for instant payments, the \nFedNow Service.3   \n When fully available, instant payments will provide substantial benefits for \nconsumers and businesses, including rapid access to funds, or just -in-time payments to \nmanage cash flows in bank accounts.  The FedNow Service can help workers in the gig \neconomy get access to their wages on completing their shifts; help consumers pay a bill \non its due date, avoiding a late fee; and help small businesses get instant proceeds to \nhelp cash flow.  \n While I’m always happy to talk more about all we do, today, I’ll focus the rest of \nmy remarks on the economy, monetary policy and my outlook, and then will look \nforward to taking questions.  \n \n2 I discussed this work in more detail in this talk: “ The National and Regional Economy: Navigating Near -\nterm Changes and Long -term Challenges” (bostonfed.org) .  And one can learn more about the Bank’s \nwork to support growth in smaller cities and rural areas at https://www.bostonfed.org/community -\ndevelopment/supporting -growth -in-smaller -industrial -cities.aspx  \n \n3 Learn more about the FedNow® Service at https://explore.fednow.org/about  \n \n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery  \nEMBARGOED UNTIL 11:30 A.M U.S. Eastern Time,  \nWednesday, February 7, 2024 – OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n4 \n  \nThe National Economy and Fed Policy  \n Economic outcomes last year surpassed most observers’ expectations, including \nmy own.  Growth and the labor market remained quite strong, while inflation slowed \nnotably.   \n As some of you know, I have described myself as a “realistic optimist” for well \nover a year now.  These very encouraging trends have reinforced my optimism that we \nare on a path to price stability, with inflation durably at 2 percent, and a healthy labor \nmarket.  However, the “realistic” part is important as well – uncertainty remains \nelevated, and there are risks to my outlook – although those risks are coming into better \nbalance.    \n Last Friday’s data release showing a surprisingly strong labor market is a case in \npoint – and in this case, good news.  Still, it helps illustrate the logic in methodically \nwaiting for more evidence that the economy is sustainably on that desired path, before \nbeginning a policy adjustment.   \n These are the issues I’d like to discuss with you today.  To do so, I’ll start by \nhighlighting key aspects of recent economic performance, then discuss my outlook, and \nthe implications for policy.  \n \nRecent Economic Performance  \n As I mentioned, the U.S. economy overall performed remarkably well in 2023.  \nGDP growth, at 3.1 percent, defied widespread pessimistic forecasts made at the end of \n2022.  The unemployment rate remained historically low – below 4 percent – with strong \novera ll employment gains and healthy wage increases.  \n These positive developments were accompanied by greater progress on inflation \nthan most anticipated.  Headline and core inflation, where the latter excludes volatile \nfood and energy prices, were both around 2 percent over the last 6 months of 2023.  \nThey h ad been above 3 percent and 4 percent, respectively, in the second half of 2022.  \n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery  \nEMBARGOED UNTIL 11:30 A.M U.S. Eastern Time,  \nWednesday, February 7, 2024 – OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n5 \n By the way, obviously food and energy are vital, but we focus on core inflation because \nit has been shown to be a strong predictor of future inflation trends.  \n Normally, strong economic activity tends to raise inflationary pressures.  The fact \nthat this did not occur indicates significant, favorable supply -side developments, which \ntend to be disinflationary.  In particular, last year’s improvements in the economy ’s \nproductive capacity were driven by further resolution of supply chain bottlenecks; a \nrebound in labor supply, in part driven by immigration; and increased labor productivity \nin some sectors.   \n Importantly, these positive economic developments have continued to be \nunusually equitable, a point highlighted by Cecilia  Rouse, former chair of the Council of \nEconomic Advisers and now president of the Brookings Institution, at our economic \nconference last fall, which some of you attended.4  The rise in labor force participation \namong working -age individuals was widespread across racial and other demographic \ngroups.  I have heard from contacts in New England that some employers have \nincreased efforts to train workers and are exploring ways t o find untapped talent.  This \nshould continue expanding opportunities for people who typically face greater \nchallenges finding employment.  \n In this strong labor market, with unemployment rates near historic lows, many \nworkers have also moved into better jobs.  Aggregate wage growth was around 5 \npercent in 2022 and 4 percent last year, and wage gains have been especially favorable \nand sustained  for lower -paying occupations.  While such developments cannot be taken \n \n4 Dr. Rouse’s presentation can be found at https://youtu.be/inRU_TPE3z4 .  All the conference materials \nand videos can be found at https://www.bostonfed.org/news -and-events/events/economic -research -\nconference -series/rethinking -full-employment.aspx . The conference provide d analysis of factors that likely \nprevent some people from participating fully in the labor market, even when the overall economy is \nthriving. Conference presenters explore d past and current thinking on measuring full employment, paying \nparticular attention to the role of long -term labor market trends as well as to more recent changes in labor \nmarket structure. Participants also discuss ed recent research on how monetary policy can be conducted \nto achieve full employment and price stability at the same time.  \n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery  \nEMBARGOED UNTIL 11:30 A.M U.S. Eastern Time,  \nWednesday, February 7, 2024 – OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n6 \n for granted, they represent tangible progress toward achieving a more broad -based and \ninclusive notion of full employment.5 \n \nThe Outlook  \n Given the positive economic news, what can we expect going forward?  And \nwhat can monetary policy do to achieve price stability at the 2 percent target, while \nmaintaining a healthy labor market?  \n An open question is how much longer supply -side progress will continue.  While \nwe may see some more labor force growth, the prospects for additional labor supply \nimprovements seem somewhat limited.  And although there may be some further effects \non consume r prices from the past resolution of supply chain bottlenecks, most of that is \nlikely behind us.  Also, productivity is always difficult to forecast.  Many businesses, \nespecially in the services sector, have learned to operate effectively with fewer worke rs \n– but there is likely a limit to how far this process can go.  \n So, while we may still get some positive supply -side news, a durable return to 2 \npercent inflation will likely require demand growing at a more moderate pace this year.  I \nexpect this slowdown will happen, but the timing is difficult to predict, and the ro ad may \nwell be bumpy.   \n To be clear, the current stance of monetary policy is consistent with achieving \nthis outcome.  However, the balance sheets of both households and businesses are \nstronger today than in prior periods when the Fed needed to restrain demand to achieve \nprice st ability.  I will not be surprised if demand remains fairly robust in the early part of \n2024.  Consumer spending could remain elevated in the near term, given income from \n \n5 As I pointed out in remarks at the Bank’s 67th Economic Conference (my remarks entitled “ Full \nEmployment: A Broad -Based, Inclusive Goal”) , no one statistic can adequately characterize the labor \nmarket because aggregate numbers can mask the wide range of experiences across people, sectors, and \nplaces.  Uneven labor market outcomes call for a full and focused exploration, motivated by the dut y to \npursue the Fed’s maximum employment mandate from Congress.  For some people, communities, and \nplaces, there are substantial and persistent gaps in economic outcomes – including but not limited to \nemployment.  This underutilization of the workforce adv ersely affects national productivity and prosperity.  \n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery  \nEMBARGOED UNTIL 11:30 A.M U.S. Eastern Time,  \nWednesday, February 7, 2024 – OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n7 \n the strong labor market and the wealth some households have accumulated in the \naftermath of the pandemic.  And many companies still have ample internal sources to \nfinance their expenditures, although increased credit costs are starting to affect capital \ninvestment decisions.  Further, the unexpected strength in recent GDP and labor market \ndata exemplifies the on -going resilience of demand, and highlights that the anticipated \nslowdown in activity may take some time.  \n However, I do see some signs consistent with an expected demand moderation.  \nDelinquencies on credit card and auto loans have risen briskly and are around pre -\npandemic levels.  And some consumers are becoming more reliant on revolving debt to \nfinance their  expenditures.  Orders for capital goods excluding aircraft are slowing, \nsuggesting that businesses are becoming increasingly sensitive to higher financing \ncosts.  \n And despite the recent hiring strength, there are indications of the labor market \nnormalizing at healthy levels.  In particular, job turnover rates have declined noticeably \nsince the first half of 2023, and job openings are down, especially in more cyclica l \nsectors.   \n Overall, these developments imply that the risks related to inflation and economic \nactivity are coming into better balance.  In addition to the points I’ve discussed, many \nmeasures of inflation expectations have returned to pre -pandemic levels.  This all \nsuggests to me that the risk of inflation running persistently above the Committee’s \ntarget, while still there, has receded.  \n \nPolicy Implications  \n In this context, I think that policy needs to reflect a steadfast commitment to \nrestoring price stability – following through on the progress we have made – while  also \naiming to preserv e the more -equitable economic outcomes seen in this recovery.  And I \nremain cognizant of the geopolitical and other risks around my baseline outlook.  \n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery  \nEMBARGOED UNTIL 11:30 A.M U.S. Eastern Time,  \nWednesday, February 7, 2024 – OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n8 \n  This brings me to what I plan to focus on going forward, as I monitor economic \ndevelopments and consider appropriate policy.  I certainly believe policy should remain \ndata dependent and that it is not appropriate to specify a pre -set path.  Given the \nprogr ess to date and the more balanced risk environment, my holistic assessment of \navailable data will focus on gaining additional confidence in the baseline forecast of \nsustained low inflation with a healthy labor market.  \n It is important to recognize that the path the economy takes toward the Fed’s \nmandated goals may continue to be bumpy and uneven, and we should not overreact to \nindividual data points.  To my thinking, that reflects the realities of a unique and \nchallengin g pandemic and the economic recovery from it.  Expecting all indicators to be \nwell aligned is too high a bar, but seeing sustained, broadening signs of progress \nshould provide the necessary confidence I would need to begin a methodical \nadjustment to our p olicy stance.  \n To this end, here are a few of the (many!) developments I will be watching \nclosely:  I continue to look at the components of inflation – not because the composition \nmatters for achieving our target, but because different components behave differently.  \nHousing as well as non -shelter service price inflation are taking longer to return to their \npre-pandemic trends, and I hope to see additional progress there.  \n I want to see evidence of wages evolving in a way that is ultimately consistent \nwith price stability.  Here I’ll note interesting work by Boston Fed economists, which \nsuggests that, given the increases in prices and labor productivity to date, there is roo m \nfor wages to catch up and continue increasing at a healthy pace for some time without \nnecessarily spurring inflationary pressures.6   \n It is also important that short - as well as long -term inflation expectations remain \nwell anchored.  And given the centrality of labor market developments to the outlook, I \nwill continue to look for signs of labor demand moderating in an orderly way, to a \nhealthy, sustainable balance with supply.  \n \n6 See Is Post -pandemic Wage Growth Fueling Inflation? - Federal Reserve Bank of Boston  \n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery  \nEMBARGOED UNTIL 11:30 A.M U.S. Eastern Time,  \nWednesday, February 7, 2024 – OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n9 \n  So, while heartened by the progress to date, I will need to see more evidence \nbefore considering adjusting the policy stance.  Indeed, I fully support last week’s \nFOMC policy statement.  It unambiguously reaffirms the Committee’s resolve to achieve \nand mai ntain our inflation target.  For the moment, policy remains well positioned, as we \ncarefully assess the evolving data and outlook.  \n That said, as we gain more confidence in the economy achieving the \nCommittee’s goals, and consistent with the last set of projections from FOMC \nparticipants, I believe it will likely become appropriate to begin easing policy restraint \nlater this year.  A m ethodical, forward -looking strategy that eases policy gradually will \nprovide the flexibility to manage risks, while promoting stable prices and maximum \nemployment.  \n Thank you for being here today, and best wishes for 2024.  Now I’m happy to \ntake some questions.",

Collins \nPresident & Chief Executive Officer  \nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston  \n \n \n \nFebruary 28, 2024 \nTuck School of Business at Dartmouth \nHanover, New Hampshire  \n \n \n \nThe views expressed today are my own, not necessarily those of my colleagues on the \nFederal Reserve Board of Governors or the Federal Open Market Committee.   \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   Remarks as Prepared for Delivery  \nEMBARGOED UNTIL 12:15 p.m. U.S. Eastern Time,  \nWednes day, February 28 , 2024 – OR UPON DELIVERY  \n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery  \nEMBARGOED UNTIL 12: 15 p.m. U.S. Eastern Time,  \nWednesday, February 28, 2024 – OR UPON DELIVERY  \n  \nKey Takeaways  \n1.  The U.S. economy overall performed remarkably well in 2023: inflation slowed notably, while \njob growth and output growth remained quite strong.  Importantly, the pandemic recovery has \nbeen unusually  equitable, with employment gains having been broadly shared across racial and \nethnic groups.  \n2. Recent economic data releases highlight that progress toward achieving the Fed’s mandated \ngoals  — price stability and maximum employment –  could continue to be bumpy .  And with the \nvolatility of monthly inflation remaining elevated, i t is important not to overreact  to individual data \nreadings .  More time is needed to discern whether the economy is sustainabl y on a path to price \nstability , amid a healthy labor market.  \n3.  Collins notes she will need to see more evidence that the disinflationary process will continue \nbefore starting to carefully normalize policy  – however  expecting all of the data to speak uniformly \nis too high a bar .  Some of the factors Collins plans to consider in assessing progress toward the \nFed’s dual mandate goals include inflation expectations remaining well anchored, as well as an \norderly moderation in labor demand.  She also wants to see continued evidence that wage growth \nis not adding inflationary pressures, consistent with the recent work by Boston Fed economists.  \n4. Collins  also wants to see continued declines in housing inflation and non- shelter services \ninflation — the two subcomponents of inflation that have been stickier and are taking longer to \nreturn to pre- pandemic levels.  T he focus on inflation components is not about adding additional  \nobjectives  – the Fed’s target is 2 percent year -over-year growth of  total PCE prices  – but rather \nabout gaining greater confidence in the overall inflation outlook .   \n5. Still, in Collins’ view, the threat of inflation settling persistently above the Committee’s 2 percent \ntarget has receded, and risks to the economy overall are moving into better balance.  However, a durable return to 2 percent inflation will likely require demand growing at a more moderate pace this year. Collins sees the current stance of monetary policy as consistent with achieving this outcome.  And while not on a preset path, she believes it will likely become appropriate to begin \neasing policy later this year.   \n6.  Collins also notes that overall, the strength of an economy has many dimensions.  In this \nregard, the Federal Reserve is involved in a breadth of activities to support a vibrant economy \nthat works for all: monetary policymaking, economic research, bank supervision, infrastructure \nand services for the financial system, and supporting collaborations that expand prospects for \nprogress in low - and middle- income communities.   \n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery  \nEMBARGOED UNTIL 1 2:15 p.m. U.S. Eastern Time,  \nWednesday, February 28, 2024 – OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n1 \n   \nIt is truly a pleasure to be with you today .  I appreciate the warm welcome , and \nparticular ly want to thank Dean Matthew Slaughter and Emily Weis of the Tuck School; \nthe Center for Business, Government & Society; and Dartmouth C ollege.  \n As always, I should mention that my comment s today  are my own views, not \nnecessarily those of colleagues on the Federal Reserve’s  Board of Governors or the \nFederal Open Market Committee (FOMC), the Fed’s interest rate setting committee. \n At the time  of the Tuck School ’s founding  – as the world's first graduate school of \nmanagement  – Dartmouth’s president  “recognized the need for ‘ training commensurate \nwith the larger meaning of business ’.”1  I mention this because it overlaps with the spirit  \nof my journey in New Hampshire today.   Our focus at the Boston Fed, which covers \nmost of New England,  is on support ing a vibrant economy that provides opportunities \nfor everyone to participate, contribute, and prosper .     \n A s I prepare for deliberations on interest rates and monetary policy at the F OMC , \nI consume a lot of statistical data and analysis .  I also listen to people i n the economy  – \nemployers, employees, entrepreneurs, those struggling to participate in the labor force \nfor one reason or another, and those helping to support and advance community \neconomic development .  Hearing how people are experiencing the economy is vital to \npolicymaking, and incredibly meaningful  to me and my team .   \n As a case in point, t oday I visited Hypertherm  Associates to learn about that \ncompany’s industrial cutting and shaping business  and its workforce .  Then I met  with \nthe Vital Communities Corporate Council – a group of business leaders that work  to \nimprov e lives for area residents.2  After this talk, I’ll meet with economic and community \ndevelopment practitioners  for the ir perspective on  challenges and opportunities in  the \n \n1  https://www.tuck.dartmouth.edu/about/facts -and-figures/history  \n \n2 https://vitalcommunities.org/corporate-\ncouncil/?doing_wp_cron=1708393268.5731968879699707031250  \n \n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery  \nEMBARGOED UNTIL 1 2:15 p.m. U.S. Eastern Time,  \nWednesday, February 28, 2024 – OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n2 \n regional economy .  And I’ll end the day  hosting  a business leader r oundtable \ndiscussion, in Concord . \n \nThe Federal Reserve  \n I like to say our work at the Fed is all about supporting a vibrant, inclusive \neconomy that works for everyone, not just for some people.  Of course , an economy’s  \nstrength and stability  has many dimensions – so the Fed has  a number of roles. \n We are entrusted with monetary policymaking – in particular, setting short -term \ninterest rates that ultimately affect the availability of money and credit for businesses \nand households.  In this, we are guided by our dual mandate from Congress: stable \nprices and maximum em ployment.  We carefully analyze  economic conditions – using \ndata, doing research, and listening to stakeholders.   \n We’re also supervisors of some of the nation’s financial institutions, and provide \nvital back -end infrastructure and services to the financial  system and the U.S. Treasury, \nranging from currency and coin circulation to various ways to transfer funds \nelectronically.  For many years , we have been involved in innovating to make payments \nsystems more efficient.3   Last July, the Fed launched a new instant -payments \ninfrastructure , called FedNow®.  When fully available, instant payments will provide \nsubstantial benefits for consumers and businesses, such as rapid access to funds when  \nuseful, and just-in-time payments helping  to manage cash flows.4   \n \n3  It wasn’t that long ago that paper checks had to be flown around the country to settle at the bank they \nwere drawn on – a slow, costly necessity.  The Boston Fed and others helped pioneer digital check \nimaging and expanded automated clearing.  \n \n4 For example, individuals can instantly receive their paychecks and use them the same day, and small \nbusinesses can more efficiently manage cash flows without processing delays.  Over the coming years, \ncustomers of banks and credit unions that sign up for the service should be able to use their financial \ninstitution’s interfaces to send instant payments quickly and securely.  Learn more about the FedNow® \nService at https://explore.fednow.org/about  \n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery  \nEMBARGOED UNTIL 1 2:15 p.m. U.S. Eastern Time,  \nWednesday, February 28, 2024 – OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n3 \n  In addition,  we examine factors that limit people’s  participation in the economy , \nand support collaborations that expand their opportunities.5  In that spirit, during my last \nvisit to New Hampshire , I explored the economic effects of limit ed child-care options  – \nwith providers, consumers, and advocates  – in Manchester.6     \n   \nThe National Economy and Monetary  Policy  \n I’ll focus the rest of my remarks on the economy, monetary policy , and my \noutlook .  As a Federal Reserve policymaker, I am resolutely committed to bringing \ninflation sustainably back to our 2 percent target in a reasonable amount of time.  And I \nremain optimistic – realistically optimistic , I like to say – that this can be accomplished \namid a healthy labor market .7    \n \nRecent Economic Performance  \n In elaborating on my views , I’ll refer to some charts to illustrate key points.   \nFigure 1  sets the stage, showing the history of inflation and unemployment – \nencapsulat ing the facets  of the Fed’s  dual mandate.  S haded bars indicate recessions.  \n The panel on the left depicts 12- month PCE inflation .8  The blue line is total (or \n“headline” ) inflation, while the red line – core inflation  – excludes the volatile, though \n \n \n5 One can learn more about the Bank’s work to s upport growth in smaller cities and rural areas at \nhttps://www.bostonfed.org/community -development/supporting- growth- in-smaller -industrial -cities.aspx . \nOur mandate and our concern for a vibrant, inclusive economy bring our focus to the challenges that \nprevent people from participating in the economy or the workforce – issues like childcare, housing, \ntransportation, and broadband.  Studying factors that limit people from participating, and disparities for \ngroups and places, can help expand opportunities, bring more people into the workforce, and strengthen \noverall economic growth and competitiveness.  \n \n6 See https://www.bostonfed.org/news -and-events/news/2023/05/boston- fed-president -heads -to-new-\nhampshire- to-talk-child-care- business -economic -barriers.aspx  \n \n7 This would achieve both goals of our Congressional mandate, price stability and maximum employment.  \n \n8 The Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index ( https://www.bea.gov/data/personal- consumption-\nexpenditures -price -index ) \n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery  \nEMBARGOED UNTIL 1 2:15 p.m. U.S. Eastern Time,  \nWednesday, February 28, 2024 – OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n4 \n obviously vital , categories of food and energy.   The chart clearly shows the recent surge \nin inflation, after many years of price stability.  It is important to remember  the \nchallenges that high inflation poses for households, firm s, and our economy.  \n While total inflation has come down significantly from its recent peak, it remains \nelevated, and progress returning it sustainably to our 2 percent target will likely continue \nto be bumpy .  Indeed, core inflation, which historically provides a good indication of \nfuture inflation trends, has further to go to return to our target.     \n The unemployment rate, shown on the right, rises during recessions, then \ntypically recovers gradually.  The pandemic -induced unemployment spike was \nparticularly severe, but the recovery was remarkably quick  — not spread over many \nyears.  And unemployment has remained below 4 percent since February 2022.  \n With the goal of restoring price stability in a reasonable amount of time, the \nFOMC began raising the federal funds rate in March 2022.  Figure 2 shows that the rise \nwas unusually rapid – an increase  of 525 basis points over just 16 months.  Roughly  80 \npercent of the increase came in the first nine  months – moving the Fed’s monetary \npolicy stance from highly accommodative to restrictive.  The FOMC has maintained the \nfunds rate at its current level of 5¼ to 5½ percent since July 2023,  and the Committee is \ncarefully assessing when it will be appropriate to begin reduc ing the target range.  \n Despite tighter policy, economic activity has been remarkably resilient.  Real \nGDP growth (the blue line in Figure 3 ) rebounded quickly and has recently been close \nto its pre -pandemic rate, when interest rates were much lower.  GDP growth in 2023, at \n3.1 percent,9 was considerably stronger than most forecasters expected at the end of \n2022.  \n The red line shows household consumption, which accounts for about two- thirds \nof GDP.  This has been a crucial driver of economic growth in the aftermath of the \npandemic and has continued to expand at a robust pace recently.  And I’ll note that \n \n9 This GDP figure is current at the time these remarks were finalized, but updated data for 2023:Q4 is \nscheduled for release at 8:30 AM on February 28, and could entail a revision.  \n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery  \nEMBARGOED UNTIL 1 2:15 p.m. U.S. Eastern Time,  \nWednesday, February 28, 2024 – OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n5 \n business investment growth – another key component of private domestic demand – \nhas also held up well, despite the higher cost of credit.  \n In the labor market, continued strong economic activity has translated into an \nunemployment rate near historic lows, and robust recent wage growth.  Importantly, \nthese positive labor market developments have been associated with an unusually \nequitable recovery.10 \n The panels in Figure 4  compare the evolution of employment  (relative to \npopulation)  during this labor market recovery ( the blue lines) with the average for the \npast three recessions ( the red lines) for different racial or ethnic groups.  The panels \nshow that job loss in the pandemic recession was sudden and sharp , but followed by a \nrapid recovery.  And this time around, the employment recovery did not take longer for minority groups.   Wage growth is not shown, but I’ll note that it has been relatively \nfavorable for lower -paying occupations, benefiting less advantaged groups.  While these \ndevelopments cannot be taken for granted, they represent tangible progress toward \nachieving a more broad- based and inclusive notion of full employment.   \n One of the reasons for the inflation surge was  demand outpacing supply, putting \nupward pressure on prices and wages.  So, the slowdown in inflation in the second half \nof 2023, in this context of strong growth, was remarkable.   Indeed, core PCE inflation \nfell to around 2 percent over the last six  months of 2023.  Substantial disinflation amid \nsustained real activity points to improvements in supply  having played an important role.  \n \n10 The fact that these positive economic developments have continued to be unusually equitable  is a point \nhighlighted by Cecilia Rouse, former chair of the Council of Economic Advisers and now president of the \nBrookings Institution, at the Boston Fed’s  economic conference last fall.  Dr. Rouse’s presentation can be \nfound at https://youtu.be/inRU_TPE3z4 .  All the conference materials and videos can be found at \nhttps://www.bostonfed.org/news -and-events/events/economic -research- conference- series/rethinking- full-\nemployment.aspx . The conference provided analysis of factors that likely prevent some people from \nparticipating fully in the labor market, even when the overall economy is thriving. Conference presenters \nexplored past and current thinking on measuring full employment, paying particular attention to the role of long-term labor market trends as well as to more recent changes in labor market structure. Participants \nalso discussed recent research on how monetary policy can be conducted to achieve full employment and price stability at the same time.  \n \n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery  \nEMBARGOED UNTIL 1 2:15 p.m. U.S. Eastern Time,  \nWednesday, February 28, 2024 – OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n6 \n  These developments can be traced largely to three factors: the resolution of \nsupply chain bottlenecks, a rebound in prime age labor force participation11 (driven in \npart by immigration), and notable labor productivity gains in some sectors.  Narrow ing \nthe gap between demand and supply has put downward pressure on inflation.  \n So far, tight monetary policy has had a limited overall impact on economic \nactivity.  This is likely due to factors specific to this recovery, which have strengthened \nhouseholds’ and businesses’ balance sheets  and made demand less interest sensitive.   \nIn particular, c onsumers have been able to finance expenditures by drawing on a buffer \nof savings built early in the pandemic.  And many businesses were able to refinance \nand extend their debt maturity when interest rates were very low.  \n \nThe Outlook  \n Given the evolution of economic conditions so far, what can we expect going \nforward , and what are the implications for conducting monetary policy  in such an \nenvironment ?  A key but open question is how much longer supply -side progress might \nreduce inflationary pressures amid strong  economic activity.   Figure 5 shows that the \nprime age  labor force participation rate is above its pre- pandemic level  — suggesting \nthat the potential for more workers to “ come off the sidelines ” may be limited.  However, \nthe Congressional Budget Office recently increased its forecast for population growth, \npartially based on higher – though highly uncertain – projections for net immigration.  \n And productivity is always difficult to forecast.  Many businesses, especially in \nservices, have learned to operate with fewer workers –  but this trend likely cannot \ncontinue indefinitely.  And while it is possible we will see further reductions in price \npressures from earlier supply improvements, firms’ willingness to pass on additional \ncost savings will likely require a slower pace of demand  going forward.   I believe the \n \n11 Defined as 25- 54 years of age.  \n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery  \nEMBARGOED UNTIL 1 2:15 p.m. U.S. Eastern Time,  \nWednesday, February 28, 2024 – OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n7 \n current policy stance should deliver the more sustainable rate of growth, while \npreserving a healthy labor market.    \n In fact, I do see some signs consistent with an expected demand moderation.   \nDelinquencies on credit card and auto loans have been rising and are at, or above, pre-\npandemic levels.  Some consumers are financing expenditures with revolving debt.   \nExcluding aircraft, capital goods orders are slowing, suggesting that firms are becoming more interest sensitive.   And despite recent hiring strength, there are indications the \nlabor market is normalizing at healthy levels.\n12   \n But there is considerable uncertainty about when, and by how much , activity is \nlikely to slow.  The January FOMC statement acknowledges this uncertainty and says, \n“the Committee does not expect that it will be appropriate to reduce the target of the \nfederal funds rate until it has gained greater confidence that inflation is moving \nsustainably toward 2 percent.”13 \n Some of the recent data illustrate the need for greater clarity that inflation is \nsustainably on a path back to the 2 percent target before adjusting the policy stance.   \nThe January jobs report showed much more hiring than expected, with job gains for \nDecember also revised up.   And the data we have for price growth in January was also \non the high side.   \n So, more time is needed to have greater confidence about the outlook.  My \nemphasis here is on “greater ,” because I do expect the economy will eventually slow as \nwe see the full effects of past monetary policy actions take hold.   But I also expect the \npath will continue to be bumpy, and we should not overreact to individual data readings.  \n Furthermore, I see the risks around the outlook as having come into better \nbalance.   It is essential not to ease policy too soon, to ensure price stability is restored.   \nAt the same time, waiting too long would run the risk of an excessive slowdown.  \n \n12 In particular,  job turnover rates have declined noticeably since the first half of 2023.  \n \n13 https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/monetary20240131a1.pdf  \n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery  \nEMBARGOED UNTIL 1 2:15 p.m. U.S. Eastern Time,  \nWednesday, February 28, 2024 – OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n8 \n Policy Implications  \n What would I need to see in the data to determine when it will be appropriate to \nease policy?  Expecting all data to speak uniformly is too high a bar.  Still, it will be \nimportant to see sustained, broadening signs of progress toward the Fed’s dual \nmandate goals  – while recognizing that progress may be uneven.  \n The higher -than-expected January CPI inflation numbers I just mentioned are an \nexample of this  unevenness .  Indeed, Figure 6  shows one measure of volatility in \nmonthly core inflation.14  While moderating, it remains elevated –  highlighting the \nimportance of not reading too much into one data point.  \n And in terms of inflation, I will continue to pay close attention to its main \nsubcomponents.   The three panels of Figure 7 decompose core PCE inflation into core \ngoods, housing,  and core services excluding housing.  In each panel, the blue line is the \n12-month measure, and  the red line shows 3 -month annualized averages .15 \n While goods inflation has returned to and moved below its pre- pandemic levels, \nthe other two subcomponents are more “ sticky”  and are taking longer.   So, I will want to \nsee continued declines in housing inflation , as well as  non-shelter services inflation.  \n To be clear, the Fed’s target is 2 percent year -over-year growth for total PCE \nprices  – there are no individual objectives  for the components.  However, if the effects \nof supply chain improvements that have helped lower core goods inflation below historic \nlevels wane, inflation in other components will need to decline  for our goal  to be met . \n It is also important that short - and long- term inflation expectations remain well \nanchored and that wages evolve in a way that is ultimately consistent with price stability.   \nAnd given the importance of labor market developments for wages and the overall \noutlook, I will continue to look for signs of an orderly moderation in labor demand.  \n \n14 Volatility is measured by the two -year trailing standard deviation of monthly inflation.  \n15 In addition, the recent CPI release for January showed continued elevation in shelter and non- shelter \nservices inflation.  \n \n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery  \nEMBARGOED UNTIL 1 2:15 p.m. U.S. Eastern Time,  \nWednesday, February 28, 2024 – OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n9 \n  I’ll end by saying a bit more about wages, which have been rising faster than \ninflation.  Recent work by Boston Fed economists, available on our website,16 alleviates  \nconcerns that wage increases are fueling inflation.  The blue line in Figure 8 highlights \nthat prior to the pandemic , wages (as measured by the Employment Cost Index or ECI) \nwere growing consistently faster than inflation (the red line) to reflect labor productivity \ngains.  Following the pandemic downturn, wage growth initially lagged price growth – \ndespite the fact that productivity continued to improve during this period.   Therefore, \nthere is room for wages to continue increas ing faster than the Fed’s 2 percent inflation \ntarget plus trend productivity growth, without necessarily being inflationary , but to make \nup for previous productivity gains and price increases.  \n In sum, I remain what I call a “ realistic optimist ” in thinking that the economy is on \na path to 2 percent inflation on a sustained basis, while maintaining a healthy labor \nmarket.  The economy is in a good place overall, and  policy is well positioned as \npolicymakers  carefully assess the evolving data and outlook.    \n I want to see more evidence of a sustained trajectory to price stability.  Still, \nconsistent with projections from FOMC participants,17 I believe it will likely become \nappropriate to begin easing policy later this year .  When this happens, a methodical, \nforward -looking approach to reducing rates gradually should provide the necessary \nflexibility to manage risks, while promoting stable prices and maximum employment.  \n \nConcluding Observations  \n In closing, t hank you for having me here today.

It is a great pleasure to welcome you to today’s Conference on \nthe Financial Stability Implications of Stablecoins , a gathering co- hosted by the Federal \nReserve Banks of Boston and New York. This event brings together researchers, \nregulators, and industry practitioners to better understand a rapidly evolving financial \ntechnology, including its costs and its benefits t o the financial system and the economy.     \nAs always, I’ll first mention that my comments today do not necessarily reflect the \nviews of my colleagues in Washington at the Board of Governors or at other Federal \nReserve Banks.  \nHere at the Boston Fed, working with the Fed’s Board of Governors, we have led \n– and are currently leading – quite a few technological innovations on behalf of the \nFederal Reserve System, including innovations related to payments.  I like to say that the Fed’s overarching mission is to foster conditions supporting a vibrant and inclusive \neconomy that works for ev eryone.  And, today, I very much look forward to hearing \nabout how developments in the stablecoin industry impact this important goal.  \nAs many of you know, stablecoins are crypto assets that seek to maintain a \nstable value – usually one dollar  – through several mechanisms.  Currently, the largest \ntype of stablecoin, typically called fiat -backed stablecoins, maintain their one- dollar \n“peg” by investing the cash they receive from stablecoin holders primarily into traditional financial assets, such as U.S. Treasury securities and commercial paper.   \nOne can think of stablecoins as a form of private money. Therefore, they should \nbe of interest, if not concern, to central banks, because, in all advanced economies, \ncentral banks are the “ultimate source of credibility in money,” as Chair Powell noted in \nremarks last year.\n1  However, stablecoin issuers are not prudentially regulated or \nsupervised.

Together, this research provides useful insights into how stablecoins interact with \nthe traditional financial system and the real economy.  \n \n• The Liu et al. paper describes the collapse of TerraUSD in 2022, which at the \ntime was the third largest stablecoin.2  One interesting finding is that less \nsophisticated investors experienced larger losses than their more sophisticated counterparts –  raising material questions about investor fairness \nand protection.  \n \n• Anadu et al. investigate the similarities and differences between stablecoins and money market funds.\n3  Their paper documents that, during periods of \ncrypto market stress, investors tend to redeem stablecoins they perceive as \nrisky and purchase those they view as less risky.  These runs exhibit flight -to-\nsafety dynamics that are remarkably similar to those observed in the money \nmarket fund industry.4   \n \n• Ma et al. study the arbitrage mechanism through which stablecoins can be \nredeemed for currency, noting that the operation resembles that of an Exchange- Traded Fund, and its “authorized participants.”\n5 The paper \nillustrates the value of delving into such intricacies by showing that the technical details can have important implications for financial stability.  \n \n2 Liu, Jiageng, Igor Makarov, and Antoinette Schoar, 2023.

Collins \nPresident & Chief Executive Officer \nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston \n \n \n \nApril 11, 2024 \n \n \nThe views expressed today are my own, not necessarily those of my colleagues on the \nFederal Reserve Board of Governors or  the Federal Open Market Committee.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   Remarks as Prepared for Deliver y\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 12:00 P.M U.S. Eastern Time,\nThursday, April 11, 2024 – OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery \nEMBARGOED UNTIL 12:00 P.M U.S. Eastern Time, \nThursday, April 11, 2024 – OR UPON DELIVERY \n \n  Key Takeaways  \n1. Collins expects inflation to return to  2% while the job market stays strong. \nCollins is committed to returning inflation to the Fed’s 2 percent target and expects this process to \nunfold over time, with the labor market remaining healthy. She notes that risks to the economy are \ntwo-sided (risks from cutting rates prematurely,  as well as from wa iting too long).  \n2. Collins continues to expect it will be appr opriate to begin easing policy later this year, \nbut more time is needed to gather informati on instilling greater confidence that progress \nwill continue.  \nPolicy decisions must be based on holistic da ta assessment, and the risks and uncertainties \nremain elevated. It may take longer to discern whether the economy is su stainably on a path back \nto 2 percent inflation, and thus less easing of policy this year than previously thought may be \nwarranted. Monetary policy is cu rrently well positioned for t he requisite patient, methodical \napproach, and to manage the risks.  \n3. Supply improvements have so far played a key role in rebalancing the post-pandemic \neconomy.  \nImproved supply chains, increased productivity, and growth in labor supply have resulted in \nbetter-than-anticipated outcomes in 2023. But we cannot count on these improvements to \ncontinue at the same pace, and dem and growth will need to moderate to achieve further progress \non inflation. \n4. The lower risk that conditions are overly ti ght supports taking a more patient approach \nto deciding when to ease. \nEconomic activity has remained robust despite high in terest rates. While th is resilience is good \nnews, it raises questions about the restrictiv eness of the policy stance and broader financial \nconditions. In this context and with less sign of labor market fragility, Collins believes there are \nnow fewer concerns about policy remaini ng too restrictive in the near-term.  \n5. Recent data haven’t changed the outlook, but  suggest patience rather than urgency.  \nData highlight the likelihood t hat disinflation will continue to be uneven. We should not be \nsurprised by some higher inflation readings a fter the low numbers in the second half of 2023. \nWhile expecting all indicators to be well alig ned is too high a bar, fu rther signs of progress \ntowards the 2 percent inflation target will be necessary. \n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery \nEMBARGOED UNTIL 12:00 P.M U.S. Eastern Time, \nThursday, April 11, 2024 – OR UPON DELIVERY \n \n \n1 \n  It is a pleasure to be at the Economic Club of New York – and to be back in the \ncity where I grew up. I want to thank my Federal Reserve colleague – your board chair, \nJohn Williams – for the suggestion to join you. My thanks as well to club president \nBarbara Van Allen and her team, and to Abby Joseph Cohen for moderating the \ndiscussion after my remarks.  \n I want to commend the Club for providi ng an important forum to present views \nand analysis and discuss complex matters – in a setting that is nonpolitical and \nnonpartisan. Thoughtful engagement is essentia l – thank you for nurturing it.    \n It is important for policymakers to rigor ously study data, for empirical insights – \nand to engage widely, explain what we are doing and why, and share perspectives.  \nThis is a key reason I am here today and, al so, why I reach out to stakeholders across \nthe economy, learning more about their economic conditions, challenges, and \nopportunities. \n Today I’d like to share my perspec tives on the U.S. economy and monetary \npolicy, as we at the Fed work to achieve our mandates from Congress and, as I like to \nsay, support a vibrant economy t hat works for all. Of course, my comments reflect my \nown views, not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market \nCommittee. \n In my remarks today, I’ll start with an overview, briefly discuss some supply- and \ndemand-side aspects of the economy, and e nd with comments about my outlook and \nmonetary policy.  \n Overview  By way of overview, my read of the economic data supports my continued stance \nas a “realistic optimist.” By this, I mean I expe ct to see further evidence that inflation is \ndurably, if unevenly, returning toward 2 per cent, and that the economy is coming into \nbetter balance, with demand and supply more closely aligned amid a healthy labor \n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery \nEMBARGOED UNTIL 12:00 P.M U.S. Eastern Time, \nThursday, April 11, 2024 – OR UPON DELIVERY \n \n \n2 \n market. As a result, I do expect it will be appropriate to begin lowering the federal funds \nrate later this year. \n However, in addition to that optimism,  I am also realistic – about risks and \nuncertainties, which remain elevated. Recent  data suggest it may take more time than I \nhad previously thought to gain greater confidence in inflation’s downward trajectory, \nbefore beginning to ease policy. A patient, me thodical, and holistic appr oach is required. \nI see the current stance of policy as well positioned to balance the risks, which are two-\nsided – meaning, there is risk of  easing too quickly, interrupt ing inflation’s return to \ntarget; and, on the other hand, risk of stayin g restrictive too long, causing a more-than-\nnecessary slowdown. \n A striking feature of 2023 was that in flation declined significantly, as many \nexpected – but instead of the widely foreca st growth slowdown, the economy expanded \nrobustly.1 Along with the decline in inflation, we  saw continued, well-anchored long-run \ninflation expectations, and a decrease in shor t-run inflation expectations to levels \nconsistent with the 2 percent target. Furthe rmore, when inflation is high, price changes \nacross sectors tend to become quite similar. In another we lcome development, sectoral \nprice changes showed much less synchroni city in 2023 than they had in 2021 and \n2022.2 \n Strong economic activity combined with m oderate inflation points to the key role \nof supply  improvements in helping to rebal ance the post-pandemic economy. Such \nimprovements are very good news – but as I’ll discuss, the extent to which they will \n \n1 GDP growth in 2023, at 3.1 percent on a Q4-ove r-Q4 basis, was consider ably stronger than most \nforecasters expected at the end of 2022. In addition, the Q4-over-Q4 core PCE inflation reading at 3.2 \npercent was roughly 2 percentage points lower than at the end of 2022.  \n2 For more details about sectoral price-change synchr onicity, see Claudio Borio, Marco Lombardi, James \nYetman, and Egon Zakrajšek, 2023, “The Two-Regi me View of Inflation,” BIS Papers No. 133, \nhttps://www.bis.org/publ /bppdf/bispap133.pdf .  \n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery \nEMBARGOED UNTIL 12:00 P.M U.S. Eastern Time, \nThursday, April 11, 2024 – OR UPON DELIVERY \n \n \n3 \n continue is unclear. This adds to the list of unc ertainties that are relevant in assessing \nthe data and evaluating the outlook.3 \n In addition to increased supply, demand has remained robust – despite higher \ninterest rates. Without ongoing supply im provements, we risk demand continuing to \noutpace supply and exacerbating pressure on prices. This implies that demand will \nneed to moderate for the Fed to achieve it s price-stability goal. So, while resilient \nactivity is good news, it also raises questions  about the extent to which the stance of \nmonetary policy is actually  restraining demand.  \n Supply Developments  Regarding supply, some of  the improvements last y ear were expected. Most \nnotably, we saw the unwinding of the pandemic supply-chain bottlenecks, which \ncontributed to a significant decline in core goods  inflation – now back within its pre-\npandemic range. Improvements in labor productivity and labor supply were more surprising.  \n The recent acceleration in labor productivi ty is still evolving. It could partly reflect \nfirms’ need to find efficiencies, giv en labor shortages and rising costs.\n4  Improved labor \nproductivity could also partly reflect gains fr om labor market reallocation earlier in the \nrecovery, when strong labor demand let m any workers change jobs, likely improving \nemployment matches overall.   \n \n3 For more on managing uncertainties in policymaking, see Susan M. Collins, 2023, “Reflections on \nPhasing Policy Amidst (Pandemic) Uncertainty,” 2023 Goldman Lecture in Economics at Wellesley \nCollege, October 11, https://www.bostonfed. org/news-and-events/ speeches/2023/refle ctions-on-phasing-\npolicy-amidst-pandemic-uncertainty.aspx .  \n4 From 2019:Q4 to 2023:Q4, labor productivity in the nonfarm business sector increased at an annual rate \nof about 1.6 percent, on average, roughly the pace of growth prevailing before the pandemic and going \nback to 2006. This improvement has occurred despit e challenges to firms from severe supply-chain \ndisruptions and high job turnover rates. Moreover , by 2023:Q4, labor productivity accelerated to 2.6 \npercent on a year-over-year basis, possibly reflecting some catch-up, and likely also ongoing changes in \nhow firms do business. \n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery \nEMBARGOED UNTIL 12:00 P.M U.S. Eastern Time, \nThursday, April 11, 2024 – OR UPON DELIVERY \n \n \n4 \n  Higher labor force participation among prime-age workers was another welcome \nsurprise. It recovered notably – especially fo r women, despite cont inued challenges with \nthe supply of childcare.5  \n I will also note that, so far, the robust labor market has allowed for remarkably \ninclusive  outcomes by historical standards, with employment gains spread across racial \nand ethnic groups. This represents important  progress towards a more broad-based \nnotion of “full employment.”6   \n In addition, increased immigration has ex panded the labor supply – by more than \npreviously thought.7 With a larger population, the pace of monthly payroll growth \nconsistent with a stable unemployment rate  is likely much faster than before the \npandemic.8  \n While I certainly hope to see further improvements in aggregate supply, there is \nconsiderable uncertainty around whether these changes will c ontinue at a pace or scale \nthat supports the rebalancing nee ded to achieve price stability.9 But to be clear, while \n \n5 As of March 2024, the 12-month average prime-age par ticipation rate for men was essentially the same \nas before the pandemic (in February 2020), while t he rate for prime-age women had surpassed its pre-\npandemic level by a noticeable margin. \n6 See the presentation by Cecilia Rouse at the F ederal Reserve Bank of Boston’s 67th Economic \nConference in November 2023, available at https://youtu.be/inRU_TPE3z4.  Conference materials can be \nfound at https://www.bostonfed.org/news-and-event s/events/economic-research-conference-\nseries/rethinking-full-employment . \n7 Higher immigration could help reconcile the large difference in job creation as measured in the \nestablishment and household surveys. Indeed, the hous ehold survey may be slow to capture changes in \nmigration from abroad – a sampling challenge that is less acute in the establishment survey. For more on \nthis topic, see Wendy Edelberg and Tara Watson, 20 24, “New Immigration Estimates Help Make Sense \nof the Pace of Employment,” Hamilt on Project at Brookings Institution, \nhttps://www.brookin gs.edu/articles/new-immigration-esti mates-help-make-se nse-of-the-pace-of-\nemployment/ .  \n8 The upward revision to population growth also alla ys some concerns that the establishment survey \nmight be portraying an overly optimistic picture of t he labor market and, by extension, of economic \nactivity. \n9 There are a number of reasons for this uncertainty . We may already have seen most of the benefits \nfrom resolution of global supply-chain bottlenecks. (It is  possible that the tragic accident that led to the \ncollapse of the Francis Scott Key Bridge and the part ial closure of the Port of Baltimore may impact \nregional and national supply chains, but it is too soon to tell what that may imply for future price \ndevelopments.) It is unclear whether the recent gr owth of labor productivity can be sustained.  \nImmigration flows are difficult to predict. And we cann ot count on additional increases in native-born labor \nsupply, though there could be scope for some older workers to remain in or reenter the workforce. \n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery \nEMBARGOED UNTIL 12:00 P.M U.S. Eastern Time, \nThursday, April 11, 2024 – OR UPON DELIVERY \n \n \n5 \n the economy’s productive capacity may not expand as quickly as it did in 2023, it should \nstill grow at a solid pace this year and next.10  \n Robust Demand  Turning to demand, the evidence also point s to it staying elevated, despite real \ninterest rates that are high by the standards of the last two decades. In particular, \nconsumption growth has remained robust, b uoyed by household balance sheets that \nhave remained strong.\n11 And faster population growth likely contributed to increased \nspending, as well.  \n It is worth noting that firms have likely been able to maintain relatively high profit \nmargins, not just due to productivity gains but also to robust demand. In turn, this \nprofitability has enabled firms to draw on internal funds to expand their productive \ncapacity – and hire more workers – rather than relying on the now more expensive sources of external finance – partly limiting the effects of higher credit costs.  \n Resilient demand could explain the increas e in inflation so far this year. In \nparticular, there are signs that household expenditures may be shifting away from \ngoods and toward services, where price pressu res are still high. Shelter inflation also \nremains elevated, with the moderation in mark et rents limited by c ontinued strength in \nthe labor market.  \n The Stance of Monetary Policy  Let me now turn to monetary policy. The intent is to help slow demand in a \nmanner consistent with inflati on sustainably returning to 2 percent, amid healthy labor \n \n10 I hear from contacts in the First District that  businesses continue to explore ways to find untapped \ntalent and seek efficiencies. And while forecasts of  future immigration are highly uncertain, it is \nreasonable to expect somewhat faster-than-normal labor supply growth will continue in the near term. \n11 Moreover, household net worth is still high by historical standards. \n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery \nEMBARGOED UNTIL 12:00 P.M U.S. Eastern Time, \nThursday, April 11, 2024 – OR UPON DELIVERY \n \n \n6 \n market conditions. But given the continued economic strength, the extent to which \nmonetary policy has been tempering growth is unc lear – as is the extent to which it will \ndo so going forward. \n In fact, the current level of interest  rates may provide less restraint than \nexpected. Strong balance sheets have likely r educed the interest rate sensitivity of \nhouseholds and firms. In addition, the current low household saving rate may indicate \nthat the return needed to incentivize savi ng may have increased. And for firms, the \nreturn to capital spending may be rising, due to the supply of additional workers and \nproductivity improvements.   \n These considerations – together with equity mark et gains, continued narrow \ncorporate bond risk spreads, and the growing availability of credit from nonbank \ninstitutions – suggest that cu rrent financial conditi ons may be only modestly restrictive. \nBut to be clear, moderately restrictive policy is consistent with demand ultimately \nslowing, and inflation returning to tar get. Furthermore, the supply improvements I \nmentioned imply that the ext ent of slowing required to rebalance the economy is less \nthan one might have thought, given t he strength in activity.   \n This assessment of the monetary policy stance implie s that the risks are two \nsided. On the one hand, there is the risk of  inflation not continuing on a downward \ntrajectory back to 2 percent – highlighting t he importance of not easi ng prematurely. At \nthe same time, the possibility of the econom y slowing notably should not be discounted. \nWe may not yet have seen the full effects of the FOMC’s past policy actions, given the \nconsiderable uncertainty about the lags with which monetary policy affects the \neconomy.12 Furthermore, higher interest ra tes could make the economy more \nvulnerable to the effects of adverse economic  or geopolitical shocks, should they occur. \n \n12 Some estimates put the maximum impact of monetary pol icy on economic activity in the range of four to \nsix quarters after a change in the policy stance – a nd I’ll note that the federal funds rate has been near \n5½ percent for about three quarters.  Furthermore, th ose estimates were calibrated from more gradual \ntightening cycles.  So, while it is not my baseline outlook, the economy could still slow abruptly, with \npolicy having stayed too re strictive in hindsight. \n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery \nEMBARGOED UNTIL 12:00 P.M U.S. Eastern Time, \nThursday, April 11, 2024 – OR UPON DELIVERY \n \n \n7 \n  However, in my view, the risks of m onetary policy being too tight have receded. \nEarlier this year, I was concerned about policy restrictiveness, given an apparent rise in \nlabor market fragility. At t hat time, data indicated that hiring was becoming concentrated \nin just a few, less-cyclical sectors. But rec ent payroll gains (and revisions to earlier data) \nhave been more diffused across sectors. Indi cators – including an unemployment rate \nthat remains below 4 percent and quit rates that are back to their pre-pandemic range – \npoint to a labor market that, while coming in to better balance, is still robust. A lower risk \nof overly tight conditions supports taking a more patient approach in deciding when to \nease policy.   \n Outlook and Policy Implications  Looking ahead, I remain realistically opt imistic that we can achieve our dual \nmandate goals. At the same time, the slowdow n in economic activity necessary for \nachieving price stability remains more in the forecast than in the ac tual data. But there \nmay be some early signs pointing towards a slowing of demand. For example, liquid \nsavings from pandemic-era stimulus programs dwindled in 2023, especially for lower-\nincome and younger households. There is evidence of rising credit card utilization rates and delinquencies. And growth in  business investment slowed in the second half of last \nyear.  \n However, the potential impact and timing of these indications of slowing are \nuncertain. In a sign of still r obust demand, payroll growth over the last quarter averaged \n276,000 jobs per month, a pace that is likely faster than needed to keep up with \npopulation growth, even accounti ng for increased immigration. And core inflation has \nmoved up relative to the low readings in the second half of last year.  \n The implications of these recent data fo r the evolution of in flation remain to be \nseen. For instance, we should not necessa rily have been surprised by some higher \n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery \nEMBARGOED UNTIL 12:00 P.M U.S. Eastern Time, \nThursday, April 11, 2024 – OR UPON DELIVERY \n \n \n8 \n inflation readings early this year, afte r the low numbers in the second half of 2023.13 \nOverall, the recent data have not materia lly changed my outlook, but they do highlight \nuncertainties related to timing, and the need fo r patience – recognizing that disinflation \nmay continue to be uneven. This also implies that less easing of policy this year than \npreviously thought may be warranted.  \n To gain greater confidence that progress remains on track, I’ll continue to monitor \na wide range of quantitative and qualitative data. Expecting all indicators to be well \naligned is too high a bar, but let me highlight five of the things I’ll be watching or looking \nfor: \n First, the evolution of the co mponents of inflation .  We do not have individual \ntargets for the components,  but the composition is informative, and dynamics \ndiffer. In particular, housing as well as non-shelter services price inflation, is \ntaking longer to return to  pre-pandemic trends. I’m l ooking to see additional \nprogress there. \n Second, further evidence of low synchronicity of price changes across \nsectors . This is a typical feature of low-in flation environments,  and it has been \nencouraging to see this indicator return to its pre-pandemic range.  \n Third, evidence that wages continue to evolve in a way that is consistent with \nprice stability .  In fact, given past price increases and ongoing productivity \ndevelopments, there is room  for wages to grow at a relatively sustained pace \nwithout necessarily generating ad ditional inflationary pressures.14  \n \n13 Moreover, the volatility of monthly inflation numbe rs, while declining, rema ins above pre-pandemic \nlevels, and readings can be more difficult to interpret at the beginning of the year, an issue that may be \ncompounded by changes to household and firm behavior since the pandemic. \n14 For more on wage dynamics and how they relate to prices and productivity, see Philippe Andrade, Falk \nBräuning, José L. Fillat, and Gustavo Joaquim, 2024, “I s Post-pandemic Wage Growth Fueling Inflation?” \nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston Current Policy Perspectives, 2024-1, https://www.bostonfed.org/publicat ions/current-policy-perspectives/ 2024/is-post-pandemic-wage-growth-\nfueling-inflation.aspx.  \n \n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery \nEMBARGOED UNTIL 12:00 P.M U.S. Eastern Time, \nThursday, April 11, 2024 – OR UPON DELIVERY \n \n \n9 \n  Fourth, seeing short- and long-term inflation expectations  remaining at levels \nconsistent with the FOM C’s 2 percent target.  \n And fifth, continued  signs of labor demand moder ating in an orderly way , to a \nhealthy, sustainable balance with supply. \n Concluding Observations  In sum, recent developments continue to  highlight the impor tance of a patient \nand methodical approach, as we holistically a ssess available information. Incoming data \nhave eased my concerns about an imminent need to reassess the stance of monetary \npolicy. It may just take more time than previo usly thought for activity to moderate, and to \nsee further progress in inflation returning dur ably to our target. Less concern about labor \nmarket fragilities, combined with the possibili ty that policy is only modestly restrictive, \nalso reduces the urgency  to ease. Ultimately, though, poli cy is not on a preset path, and \nit remains well positioned to manage upside and downside risks. \n Thank you, and I look forward to t he conversation with Abby and to your \nquestions.",

Collins \nPresident & Chief Executive Officer  \nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston  \n \n \n \nMay 8, 2024 \n \n \n \nThe views expressed today are my own, not necessarily those of my colleagues on the \nFederal Reserve Board of Governors or the Federal Open Market Committee.   \n \n  \n \n   \n \n   \n   Remarks as Prepared for Delivery  \nEMBARGOED UNTIL 11: 45 A.M U.S. Eastern Time,  \nWednesday , May 8, 2024 – OR UPON DELIVERY  \n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery  \nEMBARGOED UNTIL 11:45 A.M U.S. Eastern Time,  \nWednesday, May 8, 2024 – OR UPON DELIVERY  \n  \nKey Takeaways  \n1. Collins remains optimistic that inflation can be brought back to 2 percent in a \nreasonable amount of time and with a labor market that remains healthy. But she is realistic about the risks and uncertainties around that outlook. Uncertainty remains high in terms of the timing and full impact of monetary policy.   \n2. Stronger -than -anticipated inflation and economic activity suggest that achieving the \nFed’s dual mandate goals may take longer than previously thought, and progress may \nbe uneven. Monetary policymaking in the current context requires patience and methodical \nassessment of the available constellation of information.  \n3. There was noticeable progress last year towards price stability, driven largely by favorable supply developments (including labor productivity). But such rapid supply improvements may not continue, making demand moderation important. Collins expects that slower growth will be needed to achieve a better balance with supply and ensure the economy remains on a path towards price stability.   \n4. The current policy stance, which Collins views as being moderately restrictive, is \nappropriate for balancing the current two- sided risks (of easing too soon or holding too \nlong). Given the restrictive stance, Collins expects economic activity will eventually slow as \nneeded for inflation to durably return to target. And she believes policy is well positioned to \nrespond to incoming data, as the FOMC assesses the evolving outlook and risks.   \n5. Collins believes that the economy’s rebalancing also depends on demand and supply in the labor market coming into better alignment. Focusing on the relationship between \nwages and prices, she notes that labor productivity trends have been favorable and should ultimately be reflected in higher compensation for workers. In this context, she believes there is scope for wages to catch up to past price and productivity increases over time without \ngenerating additional inflationary pressures.    \n6. In assessing whether conditions are consistent with a potential easing of interest rates, \nCollins highlighted four areas of particular focus. She will be looking for short - and longer -\nterm inflation expectations remaining well anchored. And for further sustained disinflation – \nespecially in the components that remain most elevated. She’ll look for evidence that wages \ncontinue to evolve in a way that is consistent with price stability. And for ongoing indications \nthat labor markets are moderating in an order ly way that better aligns labor supply and \ndemand.  \n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery  \nEMBARGOED UNTIL 11:45 A.M U.S. Eastern Time,  \nWednesday, May 8, 2024 –  OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n1 \n  \n It is a pleasure to be with you today. My sincere thanks to Professor Kristin \nForbes for inviting me, and to her colleagues at the Sloan School for hosting, including \nEdward Golding of the Golub Center for Finance and Policy.  \n As a former educator, I always enjoy being with students on campus. And this \nvisit is particularly special since I earned my Ph.D. here at MIT. My time in the \neconomics department was excellent preparation for a varied career –  it involved lots of \nwork; lots of learning; genuine investment from remarkable faculty; and many wonderful, \nlong- lasting relationships.  \n Today I’d like to share my perspectives on the U.S. economy and monetary \npolicy, as the Fed works to achieve its dual mandate from Congress in support of a \nvibrant economy. These comments reflect my own views, not necessarily those of my \ncolleagues on the Federal Reserve’s Board of Governors or the Federal Open Market \nCommittee (FOMC), the Fed’s interest rate setting committee.  \n I’ll begin with a quick overview of the Federal Reserve and its varied roles in the \neconomy and financial system; then discuss the economy’s performance during the \npost-pandemic recovery, and monetary policy’s role in restoring price stability. Let me \npreview my core policy perspective: I’m committed to bringing inflation sustainably back \nto our 2 percent target. While realistic about the risks and uncertainties, I remain optimistic that this can be accomplished in a reasonable amount of time and with a labor \nmarket that remains healthy. But there is significant uncertainty around that outlook, and \nthe recent data lead me to believe this will take more time than previously thought.  \nThere is no pre- set path for policy –  it requires decisions based on a methodical, holistic \nassessment of wide- ranging information.   \n \nThe Boston’s Fed’s Portfolio and Mission  \n Congress established the Fed as the U.S. central bank more than 110 years ago. \nOur responsibilities all involve the strength and stability of the economy and the financial \n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery  \nEMBARGOED UNTIL 11:45 A.M U.S. Eastern Time,  \nWednesday, May 8, 2024 – OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n2 \n system, in the public interest. Economies have many dimensions , so the Fed’s work has \na broad range. I like to say the Boston Fed’s mission is supporting a vibrant, inclusive \neconomy that works for everyone, not just for some people.  \n There are 12 Federal Reserve Districts – and the Boston Fed’s district (the First \nDistrict) includes most of New England. We actively engage with stakeholders across \nthe six states  – to learn about economic experiences, challenges, and opportunities ; \nand to provide transparency about what the Fed does, and why.  \n The Fed is best known for monetary policymaking, and the analysis and research \nthat underpins it. We also supervise some of the nation’s financial institutions, and provide back -end infrastructure and services for payments and the financial system. \nAnd we examine factors that could limit people from participating in the economy – \nmotivated by our full -employment mandate – and support research and collaborations \nthat expand prospects for community economic development.   \n Since I’m at MIT, I’ll mention that the Federal Reserve – particularly the Boston \nFed – has helped encourage innovation in financial technologies and payments \nsystems, which we all rely on. We played key roles in the emergence of automated \nclearing, check imaging, and digitized procurement and payment tools for the U.S. \nTreasury. More recently, we worked – with MIT researchers – to explore the potential \nfor a central bank digital currency, deepening our understanding and preparation in case Congress asks f or one. And we recently built and launched FedNow, an instant -\npayments rail that enables all financial institutions to provide their customers with real -\ntime payments.\n1  \n I’ll turn now to the economy, my outlook, and monetary policy, referencing a few \ncharts along the way.   \n \n1 For example, FedNow enables individuals to instantly receive their paychecks and use them the same \nday, and small businesses to more efficiently manage cash flows without processing delays. Over the \ncoming years, customers of banks and credit unions that sign up for the service should be able to use \ntheir financial institution’s interfaces to send payments instantly and securely.

The left panel shows inflation, \nusing the Fed’s preferred PCE measure.2 The blue line is total  12-month inflation, while \nthe red line is core  inflation, which excludes the volatile though obviously important \ncategories of food and energy. The green line shows the FOMC’s 2 percent inflation \ntarget. The panel on the right depicts  the unemployment rate, which typically recovers \ngradual ly after rising during recessions. The post -pandemic recovery has been highly \nunusual. After spiking, unemployment fell quickly and has now been below 4 percent \nsince December 2021.  \n The chart further shows that, while significantly down from its peak, inflation \nremains above target. High inflation is like a tax that affects all of us. In my travels \naround New England, people share many examples of its challenges. Its toll is \nespeciall y large for lower -income households, struggling to make ends meet. High \ninflation also affects firms, complicating their budgeting and pricing decisions. A high inflation environment is not consistent with maximum sustainable employment, which \nhighlights the complementary  nature of the Fed’s dual mandate, over the medium and \nlonger term – and the reason my commitment to fight inflation is resolute.  \n The FOMC has been focused on bringing inflation back down to the 2 percent \ntarget, by raising the federal funds rate to slow demand and help realign it with supply in both product and labor markets. After the FOMC began tightening in March 2022, rate \nhikes  were unusually rapid – 525 basis points over just 16 months – moving the \nmonetary policy stance from highly accommodative to restrictive. We have kept the funds rate at its current level of 5¼ to 5½ percent since July 2023, and are patiently \nassessing ho w long it will be appropriate to maintain this target range.  \n \n2 The Personal Consumption Expenditures  Price Index ( www.bea.gov/data/personal -consumption-\nexpenditures -price -index ) \n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery  \nEMBARGOED UNTIL 11:45 A.M U.S. Eastern Time,  \nWednesday, May 8, 2024 – OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n4 \n  Before saying more about my outlook and implications for monetary policy, I’d \nlike to discuss some dimensions of this very unusual cycle. An underlying theme is that \nuncertainty  – both in the data and in key economic relationships – remains elevated, \nreinforcing the need for patience.3 \n \nThe Pandemic Shock, Rebound and Inflation Surge  \n As I already mentioned, the rebound in economic activity following the pandemic \nshock was surprisingly strong and rapid, relative to past recoveries, as depicted  in \nFigure 2 . Real output (GDP) is on the left, and payroll employment is on the right. For \neach chart, the blue line shows the pandemic drop and recovery, while the red line \nshows the average evolution of these measures over the previous three recessions.  \n The figure highlights the degree of disruption to economic output and \nemployment from the pandemic -related shutdowns, and the comparatively quick \nrecovery.4 Much of this rapid rebound can be attributed to the unique nature of the \npandemic -driven downturn, including highly accommodative monetary policy and an \nunprecedented degree of fiscal support.   \n However, the fast bounce- back came at a cost. Inflation surged, sparked by \ndemand outstripping supply. Pandemic -related global production challenges, limited \nlabor availability, transportation bottlenecks, and Russia’s war in  Ukraine, all worked to \nconstrain supply — a situation that was compounded by a shift in consumption patterns \n \n3 For more on managing uncertainties in policymaking, see my talk for the 2023 Goldman Lecture in \nEconomics at Wellesley College, “ Reflections on Phasing Policy Amidst (Pandemic) Uncertainty ”, \navailable at https://www.bostonfed.org/news -and-events/speeches/2023/reflections -on-phasing- policy -\namidst -pandemic -uncertainty.aspx .  \n \n4 These positive labor market developments have been associated with an unusually equitable recovery.  \nDespite deep initial employment losses, recovery to pre- pandemic employment levels did not take longer \nfor minority groups. Wage growth has also been relatively favorable for lower -paying occupations, \nbenefitting less -advantaged groups. These points were highlighted in the Boston Fed’s 2023 Economic \nConference and discussed in my recent speeches. Conference materials can be found at \nhttps://www.bostonfed.org/news -and-events/events/economic -research- conference- series/rethinking- full-\nemployment . \n \n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery  \nEMBARGOED UNTIL 11:45 A.M U.S. Eastern Time,  \nWednesday, May 8, 2024 –  OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n5 \n away from services towards goods. In this context, an essential part of restoring price \nstability entails realignment through a combination of supply improvements and demand \nmoderation.  \n The surge in inflation was widespread, as is highlighted in Figure 3 , which splits \ncore PCE inflation into its three main components. I find this decomposition informative, \nnot because the FOMC has sector -specific inflation targets, but because each \ncomponent has very different dynamics and determinants. The blue lines show inflation over a 12- month horizon, comparable to Figure 1, while the red lines show a three-\nmonth horizon, reflecting more recent data, but also more volatility (or “noise”).  \n The charts show that the run- up in core goods inflation ( the left panel) was \nparticularly fast, due to households’ pandemic -related shift from spending on services \n(such as entertainment and travel) to goods (such as food at home, appliances, and \nelectronics).  \n Housing inflation, and core services inflation excluding housing (the middle and \nright panels), also rose noticeably, but with a bit of a delay. The rise in housing inflation \nwas driven by a surge in rents during the pandemic recovery, in part due to short ages in \nhousing supply. And rapidly increasing labor costs contributed to the rise in inflation for other core services  — a big, diverse sector in which wages tend to comprise a large \nshare of firms’ expenses.   \n \nEvolving Progress toward Goals  \n While total core PCE inflation peaked in February 2022, sustained easing of price \npressures began later in 2022,  and was particularly notable in 2023, with core PCE \ninflation falling roughly 2 percentage points. This was the result of supply and demand \nmoving into better alignment. Much of the economy’s surprising performance last year, \nespecially in the second half , can be attributed to positive supply developments, \nincluding labor productivity.  \n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery  \nEMBARGOED UNTIL 11:45 A.M U.S. Eastern Time,  \nWednesday, May 8, 2024 – OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n6 \n  In particular, supply improvements fostered significant disinflation in the core \ngoods  sector. Similarly, housing inflation moved down – with rent growth for new leases \nreturning to near pre- pandemic levels, as additional supply of rental units came online. \nAnd inflation in other core services moderated as labor supply challenges and cost \npressures improved.5 \n Two additional developments in 2023 signaled progress. The first relates to \ninflation expectations being “anchored,” or in line with readings historically associated \nwith 2 percent inflation. Because expectations are a key determinant of current \nbehavior, they influence actual inflation and its evolution, and are high on my “watch-\nlist.” Figure 4  shows a variety of expectations indicators. Longer -term expectations (the \nright panel) have remained well anchored throughout the downturn and recovery, \nconsistent with credibility in the Fed’s commitment to 2 percent inflation. However, \nshort -term inflation expectations (the left panel), which jumped in 2021, decreased to \nlevels consistent with the Fed’s 2 percent inflation target by the end of 2023.   \n Second, price changes across narrowly defined industries were much less \ncorrelated in late 2023 than they had been in 2021 and 2022. This reduced \n“synchronicity” is consistent with large price gains being less common across sectors, \nand is a characteristic  of low -inflation regimes.6 \n While some decline in inflation had been widely anticipated, output growth was \nstronger than expected at the end of 2023 — increasing 3.1 percent over the previous \n \n5 Labor supply improvements included both increased labor force participation of prime- age workers \n(especially women, despite dependent care challenges), and a rise in immigration. As of April  2024, the \n12-month average prime- age participation rate for men was  essentially the same as before the pandemic \n(in February 2020), while the rate for prime- age women had surpassed its pre- pandemic level by a \nnoticeable margin. For more on immigration, see Wendy Edelberg and Tara Watson , \"New immigration \nestimates help make sense of the pace of employment,\" March 7, 2024, \nhttps://www.brookings.edu/articles/new -i mmigration- estimates -help-make- sense -of-the-pace- of-\nemployment/ . \n \n6 For more details about sectoral price- change synchronicity, see Claudio Borio, Marco Lombardi, James \nYetman, and Egon Zakrajšek, 2023, “The Two- Regime View of Inflation,” BIS Papers No. 133, \nhttps://www.bis.org/publ/bppdf/bispap133.pdf . \n \n \n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery  \nEMBARGOED UNTIL 11:45 A.M U.S. Eastern Time,  \nWednesday, May 8, 2024 –  OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n7 \n year. Given this robust growth, the realized decline in inflation was remarkable, and of \ncourse welcome.   \n It is now May 2024, and while economic activity has remained relatively robust, \nand the labor market healthy with signs of coming into better balance, we have not, \nunfortunately, seen further disinflationary progress. Figure 3  shows that, over shorter \nhorizons, inflation has picked up in both core goods and core services excluding housing, and is moving sideways for housing. But unevenness in the disinflation \nprocess is to be expected –  I am not surprised to see some less welcome news after \nsuch a string of positive inflation developments.   \n Going forward, we cannot necessarily count on continued supply side progress to \nreduce inflation amid strong economic activity. In particular, the core goods sector is unlikely to contribute much more to the disinflation process, though it is possible that  \nsome previous improvements are not yet fully reflected in prices. While new -tenant rent \ngrowth has generally returned to pre- pandemic levels, rents of existing tenants are still \ncatching up, and continuing to put pressure on housing inflation. And additi onal labor \nsupply and productivity gains are highly uncertain.\n7 \n Therefore, progress on inflation will very likely require lower growth in demand, \nparticularly to facilitate further slowing of core non- housing services inflation.   \n \nThe Adjustment Process Going Forward   \n Against this backdrop, a key question is how to think about the realignment of \nsupply and demand, going forward. While there are many dimensions to consider, I \nwant to focus on the relationship between wages and prices, which is especially \nimportant for core services excluding housing. In particular, let’s explore a common \nconcern that rapid wage growth may be fueling price pressures, preventing disinflation.   \n \n7 We may already have seen most of the benefits from the resolution of global supply -chain bottlenecks. It \nis also unclear whether the recent growth of labor productivity can be sustained. Moreover, immigration \nflows are difficult to predict, and we cannot c ount on additional increases in native- born labor supply, \nthough there could be scope for some older workers to remain in or reenter the workforce.  \n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery  \nEMBARGOED UNTIL 11:45 A.M U.S. Eastern Time,  \nWednesday, May 8, 2024 – OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n8 \n  Figure 5  shows the recent evolution of both wage growth (the blue line), \nmeasured by the ECI8 and PCE price inflation (the red line).9 Recent wage growth is \nabove its pre- pandemic range, and the current gap between wage growth and price \ngrowth is relatively large.   \n However, the chart also shows that inflation grew much faster than wages earlier \nin the recovery – so that wages are, in part, catching up to past price increases.  \nMoreover, real wages (or wages adjusted for inflation) should track growth in worker \nproductivity over the medium to longer run. But the real wage growth observed over the \ncourse of this recovery has yet to match measured productivity gains.10   \n Figure 6  illustrates this point by showing the gap between real wages and \nproductivity.11 Real wages (the blue line) fell during the pandemic and initial recovery, \nbefore retracing most of the decline. By contrast, labor productivity increased notably at the start of the pandemic, as production initially shifted from lower -productiv ity services \nto higher -productiv ity goods. It then decreased some during the unusual economic \nreopening and recovery , but has picked up again more recently.  \n The main takeaway from the evolution of wages, prices, and productivity is that \nlabor remains less expensive than it was before the pandemic. Importantly , this \nconclusion also holds when we consider wage and price indicators measured from the perspective of employers. Labor now accounts for a lower share of businesses’ costs \n \n8 Employment Cost Index ( https://www.bls.gov/eci/home.htm ). \n \n9 Of course, there are other possible measures of employee wages and of inflation. The ECI and PCE \nmeasures provide a helpful employee- level perspective, and these are used in Figure 6 and to construct \nreal wages in Figure 7.  A similar relationship would hold from an employer -level perspective using \nindicators that track labor costs and sales prices for firms.  \n \n10 On wage dynamics and how they  relate to prices and productivity, see Philippe Andrade, Falk \nBräuning, José L. Fillat, and Gustavo Joaquim, 2024, “ Is Post -pandemic Wage Growth Fueling Inflation?” \nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston Current Policy Perspectives, 2024- 1, \nhttps://www.bostonfed.org/publications/current -policy -perspectives/2024/is -post-pandemic -wage- growth-\nfueling- inflation.aspx . \n \n11 Real wages are measured as the ratio between the ECI and the PCE price index. Labor productivity is \nmeasured as output per hour for the whole economy.  \n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery  \nEMBARGOED UNTIL 11:45 A.M U.S. Eastern Time,  \nWednesday, May 8, 2024 –  OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n9 \n overall, which is reflected also in a declining portion of output going to compensate \nworkers. The labor share is now roughly 2 percentage points below its 2019 average for \nthe total economy. This pattern also holds for most industries.  \n Overall, firms appear well positioned to potentially absorb some faster wage \ngrowth without placing additional pressures on prices. I say potentially, because given \nrobust demand, firms may still try to pass higher wages fully through to prices, and such \ndynamics may have been at play in the first quarter of this year. That said, continued \nproductivity gains could allow further solid but non- inflationary wage growth.  \n Interestingly, other highly industrialized countries have not seen similar favorable \nlabor productivity developments, as shown in Figure 7 . Reasons for this difference are \nunclear, and warrant study. While productivity gaps were evident before the pandemic, \none possible explanation is that differences in the labor market reallocation process \nacross countries following the pandemic shock may have resulted in better matches \nbetween employers and employees in the United States.   \n Whatever the reason, it seems likely that recent U.S. productivity gains largely \nrepresent a level adjustment rather than a persistent increase in productivity growth. \nStill, my employer contacts around New England continue to mention ongoing \ntechnological  investments and process optimization efforts. This suggests there could \nbe more to come in this improvement in productivity.    \n Still, productivity’s future path is highly uncertain. A slowdown in activity will be \nneeded to ensure that demand is better aligned with supply for inflation to return durably to the Fed’s 2 percent target.   \n \nMonetary Policy’s Role  \n In this context, the role of monetary policy is to restrain demand, to help facilitate \nthe realignment process. The recent upward surprises to activity and inflation suggest \nthe likely need to keep policy at its current level until we have greater confidence that \ninflation is moving sustainably toward 2 percent. As emphasized in last week’s FOMC \n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery  \nEMBARGOED UNTIL 11:45 A.M U.S. Eastern Time,  \nWednesday, May 8, 2024 –  OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n10 \n statement, the committee’s decisions will remain data dependent, carefully assessing \nthe constellation of available information.   \n Policy needs to not only reflect a steadfast commitment to restoring price \nstability, but also aim to preserve a healthy labor market (the other facet of our dual \nmandate). There are risks from easing too soon, and from holding for too long, which \nwould le ad to unnecessary economic disruption. The current policy stance, which I view \nas being moderately  restrictive, may be appropriate for balancing risks that are two-\nsided.  \n I do expect that demand will eventually slow as needed to better align with supply \n— but the timing and magnitude of moderation remain uncertain. It is possible that \npolicy became restrictive more recently than thought, and we have not yet seen its full impact, especially if the economy becomes more interest -sensitive over time , as firms \nrefinance their existing low -cost debt and households exhaust their excess savings \naccumulated earlier in the pandemic.  \n The current situation requires methodical perseverance, recognizing that \nprogress will take time and continue to be uneven. Expecting all indicators to be well \naligned is too high a bar to start normalizing policy. Here are four of the many things I’ll be watching for:  \n• Short - and longer -term inflation expectations remaining well anchored.  \n• Further sustained disinflation – especially in the components that remain \nmost elevated.  \n• Evidence that wages continue to evolve in a way that is consistent with price stability.  \n• Ongoing indications that labor markets are moderating in an orderly way \nthat better aligns labor supply and demand.  \n Overall, policy remains well positioned to respond to incoming information, as we \nassess the evolving outlook and risks. And the unusual nature of this cycle, the \n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery  \nEMBARGOED UNTIL 11:45 A.M U.S. Eastern Time,  \nWednesday, May 8, 2024 –  OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n11 \n continued high degree of uncertainty, and still -elevated inflation, all highlight the \nimportance of patience, analysis, and a bit of humility.  \n \nConcluding Observations  \n I’ll end by saying again what a pleasure it is to be here at MIT. I’ll bring up Figure \n8 and say to the students, the Sloan School mission statement includes the phrase “to \ndevelop principled, innovative leaders who improve the world.” I encourage you to take \neach aspect of this to heart, knowing that you have much to offer our world.  \nExtraordinary things happen when we care, study issues, collaborate with purpose, and \nact. The slid e shows some of the people  I meet, as we try to  do just that.  \n My best wishes to each of you. And now I look forward to the conversation with \nProfessor Forbes, and your questions.",

Collins is encouraged by recent economic data  that suggests demand and supply are \ncoming into better balance. Still, the appropriate approach to monetary policy \ncontinues to require patience . Collins  says r ecent economic information is encouraging, \nafter the string of higher -than- expected inflation readings during the first quarter of 2024. The \ndata suggest an economy with demand and supply coming into better balance, as needed to \nrestore price stability. However,  she sa ys, this process may take more time than previously \nthought. It is still uncertain whether  inflation is durably on a path back to the 2 percent target. \nThe appropriate monetary policy approach continues to require patience, providing  time for a \nmethodical assessment of the evolving constellation of available data.   \n2. “Working Places ” is an example of how the Fed encourages economic progress on the \nlocal level . Collins says t he r esearch- based Working Places initiative is grounded in the \nBoston Fed’s  public service mission  to build  a vibrant and inclusive economy and the Fed’s  \nCongressional  mandate to achieve price stability and maximum employment. It ’s an example \nof a strategic partnership, she says,  that aims to improve New England’s economy. This  \ncommunity development effort complements the Reserve Bank’s  monetary policy, research, \npayments, and supervision work as it  seek s to fulfill its  mission and mandate.  \n3. In Lawrence, Massachusetts, c ollaborative leadership  and a shared vision  continue to \nimpact the resurgent city’s future. Lawrence is home to  one of the first success stories of \nWorking Places . Collins says t he efforts  here illustrate  how shared leadership and \ncollaboration between sectors can help spark economic progress and resilience through \nwaves of change and challenge.  \n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery  \nEMBARGOED UNTIL 11: 40 A.M U.S. Eastern Time,  \nTuesday , June 18, 2024 – OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n1 \n  Good morning.  Es un gran placer estar con ustedes para esta maravillosa \ncelebracion. ¡Felicidades!    \n I want to congratulate the Lawrence Partnership on its 10th year and all of \ntoday’s award recipients for their many contributions to the Lawrence community. \nCongratulations to all!   \n And my thanks  to the Lawrence Partnership’s Executive Committee and the \ndedicated team who organized today’s events , notably George Ramirez, Karina \nCalderon, and Genesis Duran.  \n S ince becoming president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston1 nearly two \nyears ago, I have made it a priority to get out and around New England to hear about local economic experience from communities like Lawrence. I am delighted by the \nopportunity  to learn  more about its history, its many strengths, and some of its  \nchallenges. Lawrence – and places like it – are critical to New England’s economy, and \nall of you are critical to helping  Lawrence continue to thrive.  \n Many of you may not know that the Boston Fed, and several of our key partners , \nare part  of Lawrence’ s recent history. In 2014, Lawrence was one of  the first \ncommunities in Massachusetts t o take  part in the Boston Fed’s  new grant -funded , \ncollaborative leadership competition , the “Working Cities Challenge,” which  aimed to \naddress local economic development challenges . Lawrence’s plan , and the people \ninvested in bring ing it to life , really stood out  as a strong example of what a community \ncan do when local leaders come together around a shared, urgent purpose.  \n At the Boston Fed, w e engage residents and leaders across the six New England \nstates to learn about  their economic experiences, challenges, and opportunities . We \nalso seek to  provide insight  into what the Federal Reserve does, and why.  These \nconversations are truly valuable,  and they compl ement the statistical data and analysis \nthat I, as a monetary policymaker, consider  as I develop  my views on the economy. \nThat’s why today, in addition to taking part in this celebration, I am meeting with \n \n1 See Home - Federal Reserve Bank of Boston (bostonfed.org)  \n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery  \nEMBARGOED UNTIL 11: 40 A.M U.S. Eastern Time,  \nTuesday , June 18, 2024 –  OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n2 \n business and community leaders to hear about their on-the-ground experiences  and to \ngain insight into the local economy here in the Merrimack Valley.   \n \nThe Boston’s Fed’s Broad Portfolio and Mission  \n I'll start by  saying a bit more about the Fed, and specifically  about the broader \nportfolio of work at the Boston Fed, which people often  find surpris ing.  \n We are one of 12 regional Reserve Banks that , along with the  Federal Reserve \nBoard of Governors in Washington, make up the U.S. central bank . I often say o ur \nmission is to create a vibrant, inclusive economy that works for everyone, not just for \nsome people.  We carry out this mission in support of the two primary objectives  – or \nmandates – that Congress has given  the Fed : to keep inflation low  and stabl e and to \nensure anyone who wants to work has opportunities to do so.  \n In pursuit of its so-called dual  mandate, the Fed sets a target  interest rate – the \nfederal funds rate – that influences  overall financial conditions . The Fed also  undertakes \na range of other activities  critical to helping achieve its mission and  mandate. They are:    \n• Conduct ing impactful research and analysis on a wide range of economic, \nfinancial, and behavioral topics and policies .  \n• Encouraging  economic opportunity in communities of all sizes through on- the-\nground initiatives . These  bring together the public, private, nonprofit, and \nphilanthropic sectors to develop solutions to economic challenges  that impact \nunderserved populations.  \n• Ensuring that the country's payments infrastructure meets the public's current \nand future needs. Our work contributes to a secure, reliable, and accessible U.S. \npayments system – from making sure financial institutions  have the cash they \nneed,  to modernizing how Americans send and receive funds .2 \n \n2 The Federal Reserve launched a new instant  payments infrastructure, called the FedNow ® Service  in \nJuly 2023.  Over the coming years, customers of banks and credit unions that sign up for the service \n \n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery  \nEMBARGOED UNTIL 11: 40 A.M U.S. Eastern Time,  \nTuesday , June 18, 2024 – OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n3 \n • Last and not least, w e maintain the safety and soundness of the nation's financial \nsystem by supervising certain financial institutions across New England. With the \nsupport of other federal and state regulators, we make sure these institutions \noperate effectively and provide fair and equitable access to credit, capital, and \nfinancial  services. \n \nSome Broader Economic Context  \nHaving covered some basics about the Federal Reserve, I’d like to shift to a brief \ndiscussion of U.S. economic conditions and monetary polic y – because it is important to \nconsider t his broader economic context as we take stock of  the progress at the \ncommunity level . First, a  disclaimer: these comments reflect my own views and not \nnecessarily those of other Federal Reserve policymakers.  \nAs our economy emerged from the COVID -19 pandemic’s deep recession, \noutput and labor markets recovered rapidly – but inflation surged, sparked by massive \nglobal supply  chain disruptions and compounded by strong demand and shifts in \nconsumption patterns. This configuration of economic forces led to demand outstripping \nsupply, putting significant upward pressure on prices and wages.  \nWe also saw the very harsh impact of high inflation, which is like a tax that \naffects all of us. The toll was especially severe for lower -income households  struggling \nto make ends meet. The surge in inflation also affected firms, complicating their \ninvestment , hiring,  and planning decisions – all in all, not an environment that fosters a \nhealthy economy or maximum employment that is sustainable. This is a key reason for my commitment to restoring price stability.   \nThe Federal Open Market Committee, or FOMC, is the Fed’s monetary policy -\nmaking body. It has focused on bringing inflation back down to its 2 percent target by \n \nshould be able to use their financial institution’s interfaces to send instant payments quickly and securely. \nLearn more at https://explore.fednow.org/about .  \n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery  \nEMBARGOED UNTIL 11: 40 A.M U.S. Eastern Time,  \nTuesday , June 18, 2024 – OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n4 \n raising the federal funds rate, its primary monetary policy tool . This has p ushed up \nborrowing costs, helping to cool the overheated economy and realign demand with \nsupply. The FOMC began raising the funds rate in March 2022 and has kept the target \nrate at its current level of 5¼ to 5½ percent since July 2023.   \nWe have made significant progress, and inflation has fallen substantially, though \nit remains stubbornly above the FOMC’s target. And despite higher borrowing costs, \neconomic activity has been remarkably resilient overall. In the labor market, strong \neconom ic activity has translated into an aggregate unemployment rate that has \nremained near historic lows, while wages have continued to grow solidly. However, it is important to recognize that aggregate data mask a wide range of experiences.\n3  In \nparticular, unemployment rates are notably higher in some communities, and higher interest rates are quite challenging for some households and businesses.   \nSo, the FOMC carefully assesses appropriate monetary policy – balancing the \nrisk of not getting inflation sustainably under control because policy was eased \nprematurely against the risk of a larger -than-needed slowdown associated with holding \nthe funds rate high for too long.  \nJust last week, the FOMC issued a statement explaining its recent decision to \nhold the funds rate steady.\n4 Importantly, it also noted that the inflation data received \nrecently showed some modest further progress towards our goals.  \nI see recent information as encouraging, after the string of higher -than expected \ninflation readings during the first quarter of 2024. In my view, the data suggest an \neconomy with demand and supply coming into better balance, as required to restore \nprice stability. However, this process may just take more time than previously thought.  \nIt is too soon to determine whether inflation is durably on a path back to the 2 \npercent target. Uncertainty remains high – and the volatility of monthly data remains \n \n3 See Full Employment: A Broad- Based, Inclusive Goal - Federal Reserve Bank of Boston (bostonfed.org)  \n4 See Federal Reserve Board - Federal Reserve issues FOMC statement  \n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery  \nEMBARGOED UNTIL 11: 40 A.M U.S. Eastern Time,  \nTuesday , June 18, 2024 – OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n5 \n elevated, including for inflation.5  We should not overreact to a month or two of \npromising news, just as it was not appropriate to take too much signal from the \ndisappointing data at the beginning of this year.   \n And so, as I have often said, I remain a realistic optimist – optimistic that we can \nrestore price stability in a reasonable amount of time amid a labor market that remains \nhealthy, while realistic about the risks and uncertainties to that outlook.  The appropriate \napproach to monetary policy continues to require patience, providing time for a methodical and holistic assessment of the evolving constellation of available data.    \n \nA Focus on Smaller Cities , As Key to the Bigger Economic Picture  \n As I have mentioned,  one of  the Fed ’s mandates focuses on what economists \ncall “ full employment. ” To achieve this goal , cities like Lawrence must thrive, and \ntogether  we must address barriers  to opportunity and participation in the larger \neconomy. For decades, Lawrence and other smaller cities have had unemployment \nrates two to three times higher than the overall rate in Massachusetts. We’ve been \npleased to see that gap decline recently, but there is still much work to do.  \n Lawrence and other so-called Gateway  Cities (where nearly 25 percent of the \nMassachusetts population resides ) are central  to the economic health and vibrancy of \nNew England. L ike Lawrence, many of these c ommunit ies are home to a young and \ngrowing immigrant population , which is important in a state that has a low birth rate , \nsignificant out -migration , and is  located in a region with  the nation’s  oldest  populations.\n6 \nAt the same time, Lawrence has faced major economic challenges , including  the loss of \nmanufacturing jobs  and disinvestment . Coming back from this is a long process  that \nrequires a  shared vision  for progress .  \n \n5 See Reflections on Phasing Policy Amidst (Pandemic) Uncertainty - Federal Reserve Bank of Boston \n(bostonfed.org)  \n6 Source:  U.S. Census Bureau. \"Age and Sex.\" American Community Survey, ACS 1- Year Estimates \nSubject Tables, Table S0101, 2022.  \n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery  \nEMBARGOED UNTIL 11: 40 A.M U.S. Eastern Time,  \nTuesday , June 18, 2024 – OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n6 \n Fifteen years ago, t he Boston Fed set out to understand if and how smaller cities \ncan turn their economies around after losing their manufacturing base. Researchers  \nstudied 25 similar cities nationwide and  found that 10  of those cities d id a lot better than \ntheir peers, even if they did n’t make it all the way back to their prior economi c strength .7 \nWhat ma de these cities special? A key factor was having strong leaders who \ncollaborate across organizations and sectors on shared priorities over a long period. But \nwhy does this matter ?  \n Well, t urning around an economy is complex and takes a long time. No single \ninstitution or leader can do all that’s needed on their own. Our smaller cities need their \ntalented leaders working together, sharing time and resour ces to achieve a common \ngoal. As I  have already seen today  during my visit , Lawrence is good at this – it is one \nof the drivers of the progress you are making  here.  \n We hope the Boston Fed has been a valuable partner on this  journey , which we \nhave taken with numerous other cities and towns since Lawrence became a so- called \nWorking City a decade ago . The Working Places initiative now includes 30 smaller cities  \nand rural  communities in five states .8  \n Like Lawrence, these places were once centers of the manufacturing and natural \nresource economies in New England. As jobs disappeared in those industries, many of \nthe communities struggled to reimagine and rebuild their economies. For example, \nparticipating communities such as East Hartford, Connecticut , or Lamoille County, \nVermont, face challenges  like aging housing stock and infrastructure, a dwindling tax \nbase, and often high rates of poverty.9 \n Working Places distributes  relatively limited monetary awards  – which are , \nimportantly, made possible by philanthropy, business, and state government. For \ninstance, at its inception,  the team in Lawrence received a three- year, $700,000 grant  to \n \n7 See Reinvigorating Springfield's Economy: Lessons from Resurgent Cities - Federal Reserve Bank of \nBoston (bostonfed.org)  \n8 See Working Places - Federal Reserve Bank of Boston (bostonfed.org)  \n9 See The National and Regional Economy: Navigating Near -term Changes and Long- term Challenges - \nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston (bostonfed.org)  \n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery  \nEMBARGOED UNTIL 11: 40 A.M U.S. Eastern Time,  \nTuesday , June 18, 2024 –  OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n7 \n focus on efforts to transform local workforce supports . Since the Boston Fed created \nWorking Places,  it’s been wonderful to see many of these grants  followed by substantial \nprivate and public investment  that has  capitaliz ed on new partnerships and creat ed new \nhubs of economic activity.  \n Indeed, t here are important lessons from Working Places. One is that c omplex \nissues cannot be solved by one sector, one organization, or one person. Successful \ncollaboration requires attention to process and new voices at the table to expand \ninsight. It requires the flexibility to seize opportunities and  change along the way  – \nincluding admitting when efforts need to be rethought. A neutral, trusted intermediary like the Boston Fed can help. The most successful Working Places teams have robust \ncommunity engagement, local government supporters, and an urgent shared purpose.  \nLawrence is an excellent example of this  work.   \n \nThe ‘Working City ’ of Lawrence  – Looking Back and Looking Ahead\n   \n In 2014 , the Lawrence community responded decisively  to the Fed’s invitation to \njoin its newly launched  competition. Leaders  from all over – city government, nonprofits, \nthe school public department, the community college, and local firms  – set out to build \non important work already underway in their city. T hey decided to focus on workforce \nsupport, specifically helping parents with children in the public schools  find jobs with \ngreater income potential . Lawrence became a Working City because an independent \nset of experts saw that it had exceptional vision, talented leadership , and a strong team \nthat was committed to work in new ways to improve the communi ty.  \n Over three years , that team  provided job training and support services for more \nthan 600 parents . It assisted 200 families with job placements  – with an average wage \nincrease of 25 percent . It created new training pipelines with employers and the local \ncommunity college, and it integrated some long- term interventions into the school \nsystem, aimed at improving family well -being.  \n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery  \nEMBARGOED UNTIL 11: 40 A.M U.S. Eastern Time,  \nTuesday , June 18, 2024 –  OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n8 \n  Those leaders  also became a strong team  that continued to thrive and \ncollaborate with the Boston Fed after the three -year grant  period ended. They  work ed \nwith community residents and strengthened  networks of trust and collaboration that \nhave been important in the city’s responses to challenges such as the natural gas \nexplosions  and pandemic .  \n Today, 10 years later, the Lawrence Partnership is composed of local leaders \nspanning the business, banking, nonprofit, government, education, and healthcare \nsectors. It  is united by an even broader commitment to build a dynamic  local economy  \nthat works for everyone in the community  by helping businesses grow . Lawrence should \nbe very proud of its energetic and growing immigrant population, its vibrant small \nbusiness community , and the signs of continued growth – including the new business \nand housing construction I have seen on many corners .   \n I applaud  the continued collaboration and creativity  of Lawrence civic and \ncommunity leaders as  you address persistent challenges  – and some new ones. The \nunemployment rate has been falling, but it’s not nearly as low as  the state rate. The high \ncost of housing is a newer  challenge for Lawrence, as it is many cities and towns across \nthe country. In my travels around the region , one of the most common issues I hear  \nabout  is a lack of affordable housing. Indeed, there will always be new challenges and \nsetbacks along the way.  \n But y our determination, resilience,  and creativity  are inspiring . Your progress in \nthe face of significant odds is a promising  indicator  of what is to come. T hank you to all \nthe leaders and community members that work  hard each day . We look forward to \ncontinuing to support and promote your efforts .   \n \nConcluding Observations  \n I’d like to thank you again for inviting me to participate in today’s celebration. It is \na pleasure to share a little bit about the work of the Federal Reserve –  and why it \nmatters to important regional centers, like Lawrence. And I hope it’s clear that the work \n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery  \nEMBARGOED UNTIL 11: 40 A.M U.S. Eastern Time,  \nTuesday , June 18, 2024 –  OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n9 \n taking place in Lawrence , and other  communities  like it , are absolutely  part of  our \nBank’s mission  to foster  a vibrant,  inclusive  economy .  \n New England’s economy is healthiest when it is providing opportunities for all to \nparticipate, contribute, and prosper, and not leaving some people and places behind. To \nachieve this, we need the contributions and capabilities of all communities and places \nacross the region.   \n The Lawrence Partnership continues to lead by example. You demonstrate the \npower of cross -sector collaboration and a shared vision. You should be proud of what \nyou have already accomplished. And the energy here today  highlights your strong \ncommitment to continue the hard work  ahead .  \n Thank you, and I look forward to the rest of the program . ¡Felicidades !",

Collins  \nPresident & Chief Executive Officer  \nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston  \n \n \n \nSeptember 30, 2024  \nBoston, Massachusetts  \n \n \nThe views expressed today are my own, not necessarily those of my colleagues on the \nFederal Reserve Board of Governors or the Federal Open Market Committee.   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Remarks as Prepared for Delivery  \n \n\n \n I am pleased  to welcome all of you to the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston. It is wonderful to \nsee so many thoughtful, public -spirited leaders , here to participat e in this forum and engag e with \neach other and  with important , timely topics . My thanks as well to the N ew York Fed for co -\nsponsoring t his event.  \nThe Boston Fed has a longstanding interest in helping people  from a range  of sectors convene , \nto discuss issues that affect the New England – and national  – economy. It is one of the ways \nwe try to serve the region and the public .  \nWith our focus on a vibrant economy and resilient financial system – and our nonpartisan, \nobjective, data -focused approach – the Boston Fed can be a place where experts from the \npublic, private, nonprofit, and financial sectors convene, with us, to explore a range of relevant \nmatters.  \nToday you’ve come together to discuss the intersection of community development and climate \nresilience, in smaller cities and rural New England , including sessions related to workforce and \nhousing .  \nNow when Fed leaders speak, you ’ll typically  hear some form of disclaimer  – usually about \nsharing only our own views, not those of  other officials. Today I’ll give a slightly different \ndisclaimer , by noting  that we at the Fed do not make  climate policy.  And, of course , we leave \nfiscal policy matters to elected officials.   \nCongress assigned t he central bank some very important responsibilities  – including supporting \nprice stability and maximum employment through monetary policymaking, supporting the safety \nand soundness of the banking system through supervision, and supporting the financial system \nwith effective  payment channels and services.  \nAt the same time,  and importantly, our public -serving mission involves supporting a vibrant \neconomy and financial system in which  everyone can participate.  Understanding how different \npeople and places experience the economy helps us achieve  our mission and our  mandates.  All \nthis motivates our c ommunity development activities , which  take a variety of forms including \nresearch, technical assistance, and convenings that support cross -sector collaboration.  \nWe find that a wide range of issues affect the economy and the ability of people, and places, to \nparticipate in it. For example, we see that the availability of affordable dependent care – or \npublic transportation, or broadband in rural areas, or education al and skill -building opportunities \n– are among the many critical factors that influence labor market participation .  \nSimilarly, c limate bears attention as an economic issue . As a backdrop, recent c limate \nconditions in New England have included multiple episodes of flooding in Vermont, more \nfrequent heat -index days in urban areas, and concerns about fisheries in the Gulf of Maine. So \nclimate  affects such things as the value of physical assets  like real estate , the riskiness of loans, \nthe cost and availability of insurance, costs and revenues for large and small businesses, shifts \nin tourism  spending , and – as recent Boston Fed research has highlighted, costs for local \ngovernments .1    \n \n1 See The Impact of Weather on Local Government Spending – by Bo Zhao, Federal Reserve Bank of \nBoston  \n\n \n1 \n I know you  have  gathered today to share expertise and explore integrating climate resilience \ninto economic - and community -development strategies. I’ll note that t he Boston Fed’s Working \nPlaces program – which many of you have been involved in – focuses on low -income \ncommunities and recognizes that people in such communities are particularly vulnerable to \neconomic change s.  \nWorking Places emphasizes cross -sector collaboration as an effective approach to support \neconomic resurgence and resilience.  We hope  this convening helps to foster such \ncollaboration .  \nMy best wishes for  a very engaging and illuminating day as you explore the se important  issues \nand ways for communities to be economically vital , even if conditions become more challenging.   \nI’ll now turn the podium over to Tamar Kotelchuck , Vice President for Regional and Community \nOutreach here at the Boston Fed.  She will  provide  some more in -depth observations , and \nframe t oday’s  discussions.  Thank you.",

And t hank you , Steve , for the  kind introduction. I’m delighted to join you \ntoday for the  Bank’s  23rd Annual Regional & Community Bankers Conference.   \nI’ll extend my  thank s to the Supervision , Regulation  & Credit  team here at the Boston \nFed for their work , and for hosting these important annual gatherings . I also want to thank  our \nNew England Public Policy Center’s Jeff Thompson  for his presentation  today  on the regional \neconomy.  And I’d like to recognize the Bank’s  First Vice President  and Chief Operating Officer  \nKaren Pennell, who joined the Boston Fed  this spring  after serving for decades in roles at the \nKansas City Fed and our National IT function . We’re glad Karen is  part of the Boston Fed , and I \nknow that bankers around New England will appreciate her expertise and commitment to \nexcellence .  \nAnd thanks to all of you for attending, and for your constructive engagement with us at \nthe Boston Reserve Bank . It takes all of us to support a safe and sound financial system, which \nis so essential to a vibrant economy that works for everyone. It was great to hear some of the \ndiscussions today , including the insightful panel on instant payments and the FedNow® Service .  \nToday , I’ll focus most of my brief remarks  on the national economy , and then touch on  \nbanking trends , and financial inclusion . Before I begin, let me note, as always, that my remarks \ntoday are my own views. I’m not speaking for any of my colleagues at other Federal Reserve \nBanks or at the Board of Governors.  \n \nThe Economy and Monetary Policy  \n  I like to share my “bottom line” up front and will begin by saying that, overall, the U.S. \neconomy is in a good place. Recent developments have increased my confidence that inflation \nwill return to the Federal Open Market Committee’s (FOMC’s) 2 percent target in a timely way – \nand, crucially, amid a healthy labor market.  \n  Looking ahead, preserving the current favorable economic conditions will require \nadjusting the stance of monetary policy, so as not to place unnecessary restraint on demand. A \ncareful, data -based approach to policy normalization will be appropriate as we b alance two -\nsided risks and remain highly attentive to both parts of our Congressional mandate – price \nstability and maximum employment. I’ll say a bit more about each of these points.  \n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery  \nEMBARGOED UNTIL 4:00 P.M U.S. Eastern Time,  \nTuesday, Octo ber 8, 202 4 – OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n1 \n   In other recent talks, I’ve discussed in more detail how we evolved to the current \njuncture in economic conditions .1 Very briefly, as we grappled with the COVID -19 crisis, a \nvariety of factors led to demand outstripping supply, including in the labor market. The resulting \nunsustainably tight conditions contributed to price and wage pressures that fueled a surge in \ninflation. High inflation affects all of us and is particularly challenging for those with lower \nincomes. Indeed, I continue to hear about the challenges from inf lation and high price levels as I \nspeak with people in communities across New England. Restrictive monetary policy was \nintended to help realign our economy to meet our mandated goals – and this has been working.  \n \nInflation  \nWhere is inflation now? I’ll focus, as I often do, on core inflation, using the Fed’s \npreferred PCE measure. While it excludes the obviously important  but very volatile categories of \nfood and energy, it tends to more reliably capture underlying inflation trends. This indicator has \ndeclined significantly but remains elevated. And importantly, the disinflationary progress has \nresumed after an unexpectedly large inflation jump at the beginning of this year. I see this \nresumed progress as driven by economic dev elopments that are broader and more solidly in \nplace than at the end of last year, increasing my confidence that inflation is firmly on a trajectory \nto 2 percent.  \nI’ll explain by considering the three components of core inflation – goods, shelter , and \nnon-shelter services. Separating them reveals important insights. In the second half of 2023, \ndisinflation was largely due to a rapid deceleration in core goods  prices, as many of the supply \nchain disruptions receded. Since then, the contribution of core goods prices to the overall \ndisinflation process has moderated, though inflation developments in this area continue to be \nfavorable and in line with pre -pandemic  trends.  \nThe contribution of services  inflation to the overall disinflation process  has resumed , \nalthough services inflation is still elevated . Indeed, after a big jump in early 2024, core services \nprices excluding housing  has been rising at a rate that is consistent with 2 percent overall \ninflation.   \n \n1 For example, see my May 8, 2024 remarks at M.I.T.: “Reflections on Uncertainty and Patience in \nMonetary Policymaking” available at Reflections on Uncertainty and Patience in Monetary Policymaking - \nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston (bostonfed.org) . \n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery  \nEMBARGOED UNTIL 4:00 P.M U.S. Eastern Time,  \nTuesday, Octo ber 8, 202 4 – OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n2 \n While housing  inflation has also moderated some more recently, this is the stickiest \ncomponent and remains above its pre -pandemic average. But there are good reasons to think \nthat this stickiness in current shelter inflation reflects existing rents still catching up to  new \nmarket rents. In fact, rent growth for newly signed leases has been at or below its pre -pandemic \nrange for many months. While these data do not suggest emergence of new inflationary \npressures, it is difficult to predict how long this rent  catchup process may take.  \nThe moderation in  new rent growth  also reflects a labor market that is normalizing and \nreducing price pressures in the services sector more generally. Labor costs are a main  driver of \nservices inflation, and a labor market with supply and demand in better balance is a key reason \nfor disinflation becoming more broad -based, and for my increased confidence that inflation is on \na sustained path back to 2 percent.  \n \nThe Labor Market  \nTurning to the labor market, the constellation of data point s to notable softening from the \nunsustainably tight conditions a year ago. As Chair Powell noted in his August remarks at \nJackson Hole , we do not seek  or welcome further cooling in labor market conditions .2 And the \nrecent data, including September’s unexpectedly robust jobs report, bolster my assessment that \nthe labor market remains in a good place overall – neither too hot nor too cold.  \nI will mention just a few of the many indicators that my team and I  review when \nassessing labor market health. First, the unemployment rate rose from very low levels over the \npast year – but has recently ticked back down and remains low by historical standards. Second, \nalthough job growth slowed notably in recent months, it remains relatively solid. Here, I’ll note \nthat recent job growth has been somewhat concentrated in a few sector s, which is one factor I \ncontinue to monitor. Furthermore, data adjustments  combined with uncertainties about labor \nsupply growth add to the difficulty of estimating the breakeven level of job creation. Finally, initial \nclaims for unemployment insurance remain low, indicating a quite healthy labor market. \n \n2 See https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20240823a.htm . Also see September 30 \nremarks where Chair Powell noted that “We do not believe that we need to see further cooling in labor \nmarket conditions to achieve 2 percent inflation” \n(https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20240930a.htm ). \n \n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery  \nEMBARGOED UNTIL 4:00 P.M U.S. Eastern Time,  \nTuesday, Octo ber 8, 202 4 – OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n3 \n Continuing U I claims are also muted, suggesting that unemployed workers can find jobs \nrelatively quickly.  \nWith the cooling of the labor market, wage growth is also moderating but remains above \nits pre -pandemic pace. However, I want to emphasize that the current, still -elevated wage \ngrowth also reflects robust gains in worker productivity and therefore, should not necessarily \nlead to additional price pressures.3   \n \nDemand  \nGoing forward, it will be important to preserve the currently healthy labor market \nconditions. In my view, this will require economic activity continuing to grow close to trend, \nwhich is my baseline outlook. Recent revisions to measures of economic growth paint a picture \nof an economy that is solid and resilient overall. Importantly, the fundamentals underpinning \nconsume r spending remain favorable, including job opportunities and the gradual recovery of \nreal wages. However, my continued “realistic optimism” includes recognizing that there are risks \non both sides of this outlook.  \nOn the one hand, household net worth remains quite elevated by historical standards, \nwhich could contribute to a faster -than-expected pace of growth in consumer spending . At the \nsame time, some strains have emerged, especially at the lower end of the income distribution. \nFor example, credit card delinquencies  have risen to above pre -pandemic levels, although they \nare still low by recent historical standards.  \n \nMonetary Policy  \nThe next phase of monetary policy must focus on preserving current favorable economic \nconditions. A sustainable return of inflation to target and a strong labor market are both critically \nimportant to the public we serve.   \nA restrictive monetary policy stance has played a key role in the disinflation progress so \nfar, and recent data on spending and production indicate that the effects of monetary policy are \nbeing felt, especially in interest -sensitive sectors of the economy.  Indeed, with the labor market \n \n3 For an analysis of wages, prices and productivity, see Is Post -pandemic Wage Growth Fueling Inflation? \n- Federal Reserve Bank of Boston (bostonfed.org) .

My confidence in the disinflation trajectory has increased – but so \nhave the risks of the economy slowing beyond what is needed to rest ore price stability.   \nFor these reasons, the FOMC began the process of normalizing the policy stance at its \nmeeting last month.4 Further adjustments of policy will likely be needed. Indeed, the median \nprojection from the FOMC participants’ Summary of Economic Projections , released at the end \nof last month’s meeting, includes an additional 50 basis points of cuts in the federal funds rate \nthis year. But I will stress that policy is not on a pre -set path and will remain carefully data -\ndependent, adjusting as the economy evo lves.  \n \nBanking Trends  \nI’ll turn now to a brief discussion  of community banking trends in New England. Despite \na challenging environment, the region’s community banking industry remains strong. A recent \nregional brief published by our New England Public Policy Center highlights the importance of  \nbanks classified as community banks here in the Fed’s First District.5  \nIndeed, the regional and community banking industry  is critical to the economic health of \nour communities – both households and businesses – across our six states . Just about two \nweeks ago , I was in Fitchburg, Mass achusetts , where I met with community leaders and learned \nabout their ongoing collaborative efforts to revitalize their city . I also heard from small \nbusinesses and bankers about local economic conditions  and what it takes to start and operate \na business . Not surprisingly, a key theme of the day was the importance of partnerships \nbetween community members and the local financial institutions to ensuring strong, resilient \nlocal economies . I have had similar conversations in my recent visits to other states in our \ndistrict.   \nI’ll say a bit about what we’re seeing as far as the industry in this part of the country. \nBanks across New England  have reported tighter liquidity positions and continued pressure on \nearnings, particularly a narrower net interest margin that has been largely driven by increased \nfunding costs. A higher interest rate environment and the increasing ease with which consumers \n \n4 See September 18, 2024 FOMC statement:  \nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20240918a.htm     \n5 See A Portrait of First District Banks - Federal Reserve Bank of Boston (bostonfed.org)  by J. Christina \nWang.  \n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery  \nEMBARGOED UNTIL 4:00 P.M U.S. Eastern Time,  \nTuesday, Octo ber 8, 202 4 – OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n5 \n can move their money have resulted in banks experiencing increased competition for deposits, \nleading to changes in balance sheet funding dynamics. Noncore funding  sources , such as \nFederal Home Loan Bank borrowings and brokered deposits, ha ve become a larger proportion \nof the overall funding mix. It’s perhaps not a surprise, then, that p rudent liquidity risk \nmanagement practices have become increasingly important in this environment.   \nWhile loan growth has slowed more recently, the loan portfolio, and thus the commercial \nreal estate category, remains a higher proportion of First District balance sheets relative to the \nrest of the country .6 To date, asset quality has remained resilient; nonperforming loans, while \ninching up, have remained at levels that are relatively low historically. The allowance for credit \nlosses remains adequate relative to nonperforming loans, although we have witnessed some \nreserve releases that requires heightened monitoring , given increasing loan balances. Capital \nremains satisfactory with an overall increasing trend but still below pre -pandemic levels, \nunderscoring the importance of continuing robust credit risk management.  \n  In summary, while New England community banks are well -positioned across the region, \nstrong risk practices for capital, liquidity, asset selection , and underwriting,  as well as  earnings , \nare needed to remain resilient in an evolving  environment . \n Before I conclude this portion of my remarks , I want to highlight an important way the Fed \nworks to support banks of all sizes. The discount window , one of  the Fed’s effective tool s to \nsupport the liquidity and stability of the banking system and the effective implementation of \nmonetary policy , provid es ready access to funding for banks to manage their liquidity in the \nnormal course of events , as well as under periods of stress.  \n  All of us will recall the market turmoil from March 2023 , when multiple banks \nexperienced significant challenges that ultimately led to their failure. While interest rate risk and \nliquidity risk management issues were the root cause of those failures, operational challenges \nrelated to those banks’ use of the dis count window amplified their shortcomings.  \n \n6 Residential and, to a lesser degree, c ommercial real estate represents a higher proportion of total \nassets in the First District  relative to the national community bank profile average. (CRE loans  are actually  \na slightly  lower share  of the overall loan portfolio for First District banks relative to other banks . However, \nFirst District banks tend to have higher share of loans in their overall asset portfolios.)  \n \n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery  \nEMBARGOED UNTIL 4:00 P.M U.S. Eastern Time,  \nTuesday, Octo ber 8, 202 4 – OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n6 \n   Just last week, we hosted a seminar here at the Boston Fed in which we brought \ntogether leaders  from banks and credit unions  in the First District , as well as representatives \nfrom state and federal financial regulatory agencies , to provide a foundation on the discount \nwindow.  Thank you to those of you in this room who were able to attend that session, and I \nencourage all of you to learn more about discount window readiness.  \n \nThe Importance of Financial Inclusion   \n  I’ll end with a brief discussion of financial inclusion. Last month, as part of a workshop for \nFed staff, I was please to sit down with  the Federal Reserve Board  of Governor’s Adriana \nKugler for  a “fireside chat ” to discuss  financial inclusion and bank supervision .7 Our \nconversation emphasized the importance of providing consumers and businesses access to the \nfinancial products and services they need to effectively and safely engage with the economy. I’ll \nmake two points here.  \nFirst, I relate financial inclusion to the Boston Fed’s overarching mission of “a vibrant \neconomy that works for all.” Our central bank has a public mission, to serve the entire public. \nThe ability to participate in the economy, job market, and financial s ystem is an important \ncomponent of vibrancy and consistent with the American ideal of widespread opportunity for \nthose who want to participate and contribute.     \nSecond, my perspective connects financial inclusion with an accessible and safe \nfinancial infrastructure . I’m referring to things like opportunities for credit and financing, secure \nand reliable payments systems, timely access to funds, and savings tools to address \nemergency needs as well as building wealth.  Careful experimentation, with quantitative and \nqualitative research, can deepen our understanding of what works, and what doesn’t - helping to \nadvance this work.  \nRegional and community bankers like yourselves understand the opportunities that can \nemerge from including more of the public in your financial services. You also understand some \nof the challenges, for example , around things like small -dollar loans to emerging businesses. I \ndo not want to minimize those challenges but do want to underline the importance of working \n \n7 See Collins, Kashkari host fireside chats on bank supervision and financial inclusion - Federal Reserve \nBank of Boston (bostonfed.org)  \n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery  \nEMBARGOED UNTIL 4:00 P.M U.S. Eastern Time,  \nTuesday, Octo ber 8, 202 4 – OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n7 \n together – and with other policymakers – to explore ways to make our financial infrastructure \nmore inclusive.   \nAs you know so well, this matters for your neighbors, your local economy, and overall \neconomic vibrancy. I greatly appreciate our community banks’ deep commitment to smaller \ncommunities across New England, and I look forward to engaging with you more on th is \nimportant work.    \n \nConcluding Observations  \nI consider it essential  to engage across  all six  New England state s, to hear about the \neconomic experiences of a wide range of stakeholders  – workers, entrepreneurs, small  and \nlarge  businesses, local employers, bankers, community development experts, civic leaders, and \nso many others. These engagements  make  clear that r egional and community banks are a \ncrucial, valued dimension  of our region’s financial and economic infrastructure , and vital to \neconomic vibrancy . \nThank you . I look forward to continuing the conversation with Steve , and to your \nquestions .",

Collins \nPresident & Chief Executive Officer \nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston \n \n \nOctober 9, 2024 \nWorcester, Massachusetts \n \n \n \nThe views expressed today are my own, not necessarily those of my colleagues on the \nFederal Reserve Board of Governors or  the Federal Open Market Committee.  \n          \n \n       Remarks as Prepared for Deliver y\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 5:30 P.M U.S. Eastern Time,\nWednesday, October 9, 2024 – OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 5:30 P.M U.S. Eastern Time, \nWednesday, October 9, 2024  \n Key Takeaways \n1. Collins said the U.S. economy is in a good place overall.  \n \nActivity continues to grow at a solid pace. Collins anticipates “that inflation will return to the \nFed’s 2 percent target in a timely way – and crucially, amid a healthy labor market.” \n2. On monetary policy, she said given the disinflation progress to date, further \nadjustments in the policy rate will likely be needed after the September initial rate cut.  \n \n“My confidence in the disinflation trajectory has increased – but so have the risks of the \neconomy slowing beyond what is needed to restore price stability.” Collins will remain highly \nattentive to both price stability and maximum employment, the two parts of the Fed’s \nCongressional mandate.   \n3. Collins said labor-market conditions are no longer too hot, nor too cold – softening \nfrom the unsustainably tight job-market conditions a year ago.  \n \nThe unemployment rate remains low by historical standards. Job growth has slowed on \nbalance in recent months but remains relatively solid. We continue to see a low level of initial claims for unemployment insurance, as well as muted levels of continuing claims. “A labor \nmarket with supply and demand in better balance is a key reason for disinflation becoming \nmore broad-based” said Collins, adding that the goal is not further cooling in the labor market. \n4. Inflation’s components show services prices (excluding housing) expanding at a rate \nmore consistent with 2 percent overall inflation, while housing inflation has moderated \nsome recently – but is the most “sticky.”  \n \nHousing inflation “remains above its pre-pandemic average despite some recent \nimprovements. However, there are good reasons to think that this stickiness in current shelter \ninflation reflects existing rents still catching up to new market rents,” she said. \n5. Current, elevated wage growth reflects robust gains in worker productivity and \ntherefore, should not necessarily lead to additional price pressures.  \n \nWhile nominal wage growth has exceeded inflation for the past year, this follows a period \nwhen inflation outpaced wage growth – so wages are in part catching up to past price increases. Also, real wage growth over this recovery has yet to match measured productivity gains; Collins noted Boston Fed research that concludes nominal wage growth could continue \nto exceed inflation for a while but remain consistent with the on-going disinflation process. \n6. Finding economic resurgence in the face of long-term challenges often involves local \npeople willing to collaborate across sectors on shared goals and strategies. Collins \nnoted the growing “playbook” of effective local strategies that New Englanders are \ndeploying.  \n \n“Some locales have focused on business retention and recruitment and strengthening \nneighborhoods. In others, local leaders have decided to focus on reducing impediments to \nparticipation in the labor force – addressing tangible problems like job readiness, childcare, \nand transportation. In others, people are focusing on entrepreneurship support.” Collaborative \nleadership across sectors can be “easy to say, difficult to do” – but is vital. \n \n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery \nEMBARGOED UNTIL 5:30 P.M U.S. Eastern Time, \nWednesday, October 9, 2024 – OR UPON DELIVERY \n \n1 \n Thank you for your warm welcome, and fo r the invitation to be with you this \nevening. I especially want to thank Paul Ma tthews, Executive Director and CEO of the \nWorcester Regional Research Bureau, for hel ping this wonderful event come together. \nIt is great to be in New England’s sec ond-largest city, incorporated 302 years ago \n– and as the Bureau points out, gr owing in population since 1980. \nIt is also my pleasure to congratulate the Bureau on its 39 years of service to the \npublic good – through impartial, empirical,  nonpartisan research, convening, and \neducating. I appreciate the Bureau’s focus, pr ominently displayed in your materials, on \n“Turning Data Into Insight.”1 This underlines a kindred spir it with the Federal Reserve \nBank of Boston, where we rigorously use data and models to shape our policymaking – \nand complement that analytic al approach by listening to  people’s experiences of \nchallenges and opportunities in the economy. My congratulat ions to all of you here \ntonight, for your engagement and commitment to this region’s  advancement, and \nprosperity. \nI will cover two things this evening. Firs t, most of my remarks will focus on my \neconomic outlook and monetary policy views, in cluding a look at some of the analysis \nwe do at the Boston Fed, as we cont ribute to U.S. monetary policy.   \nStarting with a national context will provi de a frame for my second topic – the \neconomies of New England, Massachusetts, and Greater Worcester. I will briefly share \nsome perspectives on the economic contributi ons of smaller cities and the areas that \nsurround them – and some thoughts based on t he Boston Fed’s efforts to support \nopportunities for everyone to participate in our economy, regardless of their background \nor geographic location.  \n  \n \n1 www.wrrb.org  \n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery \nEMBARGOED UNTIL 5:30 P.M U.S. Eastern Time, \nWednesday, October 9, 2024 – OR UPON DELIVERY \n \n2 \n The Economy and Monetary Policy \n  I’ll begin with the national economy. As always, my comments reflect my own \nviews; I do not speak for my colleagues at the other Reserve Banks or the Board of \nGovernors. \n  I like to share my “bottom line” up front , and will do so by sayi ng that, overall, the \nU.S. economy is in a good place, which mone tary policymakers are working to maintain. \nRecent developments have increased my confi dence that inflation will return to the \nFederal Open Market Committee’s (FOMC’s) 2 percent target in a timely way – and \ncrucially, amid a healthy labor market. Looki ng ahead, preserving t he current favorable \neconomic conditions will require additional adju stment to the stance of monetary policy, \nso as to not place unnecessary restraint on demand. A careful, data-based approach to \nnormalizing policy will be appropriate as we  balance the two-sided risks and remain \nhighly attentive to both t he price stability and the maximu m employment parts of our \nCongressional mandate. I’ll say a bit more ab out these points, referencing a few charts \nalong the way.  \n \nSome Historical Context   Figure 1  provides some historical cont ext on price stability and maximum \nemployment. The left-hand panel shows the F ed’s preferred measure of inflation, \ncalculated using the PCE price index\n2. The blue line shows that total (or headline) \ninflation is moving back towards the FOMC’s 2 percent target, shown by the green line. \nThe red line is core inflation, which excl udes the volatile, though obviously important, \ncategories of food and energy. And the grey  bars show recessions. In the right-hand \npanel, the unemployment rate path highlights how unusual this post-pandemic recovery \n \n2 The Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index ( https://www.bea.gov/dat a/personal-consumption-\nexpenditures-price-index ) \n \n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery \nEMBARGOED UNTIL 5:30 P.M U.S. Eastern Time, \nWednesday, October 9, 2024 – OR UPON DELIVERY \n \n3 \n has been. Instead of the typical gradual decli ne, unemployment fell very quickly after \nspiking, this time around.   \n  As I’ve discussed in other talks,3 a variety of factors led to demand outstripping \nsupply, including in the labor market; and these unsustainably tight conditions \ncontributed to price and wage pressures that fueled the surge in infl ation. High inflation \naffects all of us, and is particularly chall enging for those with lo wer incomes. Indeed, I \ncontinue to hear about the challenges from in flation and high price levels as I speak with \npeople in communities across New England.  \n Inflation  \nFigure 2  focuses on core inflation, which tends to  capture more reliably the \nunderlying inflation trend. In particular, the darker line shows that the 12-month measure \nhas declined, but remains elevated. Also s hown is a three-month measure, reflecting \nmore recent data but also more volatility (o r “noise”). It highlight s the unexpectedly large \njump in inflation at the beginn ing of this year, after the encouraging progress at the end \nof 2023. The good news is that this disinfla tion process has resumed, and I see it as \ndriven by economic development s that are broader and more solidly in place than at the \nend of last year – increasing my  confidence that inflation is firmly on a trajectory to the \nFOMC’s 2 percent target.  \nI’ll explain by breaking core inflati on into its three components, which have \nbehaved quite differently, as shown in Figure 3 . In the second half of 2023, disinflation \nwas largely due to a quite rapid deceleration in core goods  prices, shown in the first \npanel. Since then, the contribut ion of core goods prices to the overall disinflation \nprocess has moderated, though inflation dev elopments in this area continue to be \nfavorable and in line wi th pre-pandemic trends.  \n \n3 For example, see my May 8, 2024 remarks at M.I.T.: “ Reflections on Uncertainty and Patience in \nMonetary Policymaking” (bostonfed.org) . \n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery \nEMBARGOED UNTIL 5:30 P.M U.S. Eastern Time, \nWednesday, October 9, 2024 – OR UPON DELIVERY \n \n4 \n The contribution of services  inflation to the overall disinflation process has \nresumed, although services inflation is st ill somewhat elevated. The far right-hand panel \nshows that, after a big jump in early 2024, core services prices excluding housing  has \nbeen expanding at a rate that is more consis tent with 2 percent ov erall inflation.   \nThe middle panel shows that housing  inflation has also moderated more recently. \nThis component of inflation is the most “sticky,” and remains above its pre-pandemic \naverage despite some recent improvements. However, ther e are good reasons to think \nthat this stickiness in current  shelter inflation reflects existing  rents still catching up to \nnew market rents. In fact, rent growth for newly signed leases has been at or below its \npre-pandemic range for many months, as  shown in the right-hand panel of Figure 4 .  \n(The left-had panel in the figure shows PCE hous ing inflation again, for convenience). \nWhile the data do not suggest emer gence of new inflationary pressu res, it is difficult to \npredict how long this rent catch-up process may take. \nThe moderation in new rent growth also  reflects a labor market that is \nnormalizing and reducing price pressures in t he services sector more generally. Labor \ncosts are a main driver of services inflat ion, and a labor market with supply and demand \nin better balance is a key reason for disinflation becoming more broad-based, and for my increased confidence that inflation is  on a sustained path back to 2 percent.  \n The Labor Market \nIn the labor market, the constellation of  data point to notabl e softening from the \nunsustainably tight conditions a year ago. As Chair Powell noted in his August remarks \nat Jackson Hole,\n4 the goal is not further cooling in  the labor market. And the recent \n \n4 See https://www.federalreserve.gov/new sevents/speech/powell20240823a.htm  where Chair Powell \nnoted that we do not seek or welcome further coolin g in labor market conditions. Also see Sept. 30 \nremarks where he said “We do not believe that we need to see further cooling in labor market conditions \nto achieve 2 percent inflation” \n(https://www.federalreserve.gov/newse vents/spee ch/powell20240930a.htm ). \n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery \nEMBARGOED UNTIL 5:30 P.M U.S. Eastern Time, \nWednesday, October 9, 2024 – OR UPON DELIVERY \n \n5 \n data, including September’s unexpectedly r obust jobs report, bolster my assessment \nthat the labor market remains in a good plac e overall – neither too hot nor too cold. \nFigure 5  shows just three of the many indica tors that I and my team review when \nassessing labor market health. First, the unemploy ment rate rose from very low levels \nover the past year – but has recently ticked back down, and remains low by historical standards. Second, although the middle panel s hows that job growth slowed notably in \nrecent months, it remains relatively solid. He re, I’ll note that recent job growth has been \nsomewhat concentrated in a few sectors, which is one factor I continue to monitor.\n5  \nFinally, the third panel highli ghts the low level of initia l claims for unemployment \ninsurance, indicating a quite-healthy labor mark et, as well as muted levels of continuing \nU.I. claims, suggesting that unemployed work ers can find jobs relatively quickly.  \nI mentioned previously that this has been a highly unusual economic cycle, and \nI’d like to spend a moment on one dimension. Figure 6  compares the evolution of the \nemployment-to-population ratio in this cycl e (the blue lines) with the average pattern \nfrom the past three recession cycles (the red lines). Clearly , the employment drop was \nmuch more sudden and steeper this time. Wh ile that is true across age groups, there \nare notable differences in the employment patterns during this recovery. For workers \naged 25-54, the middle panel, the employment-to-population ra tio returned to the pre-\ncrisis level more rapidly than in prior episode s. In contrast, a persistently lower share of \npeople aged 55 and older are working pos t-pandemic (the right-hand panel), which \naccounts for the total employ ment-to-population ratio (in t he left-hand panel) still being \nsomewhat below its pre-pandemic peak.   \nThis pattern is quite different from prio r cycles, and points to a set of issues of \nparticular relevance for New England, the U. S. region with the ol dest population. Figure \n \n \n5 Furthermore, data revisions combined with uncertainties about labor supply growth add to the difficulty \nof estimating the breakeven level of job creation: 2024 Preliminary Benchmark Revision: U.S. Bureau of \nLabor Statistics (bls.gov) . \n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery \nEMBARGOED UNTIL 5:30 P.M U.S. Eastern Time, \nWednesday, October 9, 2024 – OR UPON DELIVERY \n \n6 \n 6 is also a reminder that aggregate data mask what are often signifi cant differences in \nexperience across demographic groups, sectors, and locations. \nWith the cooling of the labor market, wage growth is also moderating – but \nremains above its pre-pandemic pace. However,  I want to emphasize that the current, \nstill-elevated wage growth also reflects robust gains in worker productivity and therefore, should not necessarily lead to additional price pressures.  \nRecent analysis by Boston researchers makes this point in some detail. Figure 7  \nshows that nominal wage growth (measured by ECI, the employment cost index, the \nblue line) has exceeded PCE inflation (the re d line) for the past year. However, this \nfollows a period during which inflation outpac ed wage growth, so that wages are in part \ncatching up to past price increases.  \nFurthermore, real wages (or wages adjusted for inflation) should track growth in \nworker productivity over the medium to l onger run, and real wage growth over this \nrecovery has yet to match measured produc tivity gains. Given the developments in \nprices, wages and productivity to date, the “p rojections” part of t he chart illustrates how \nnominal wage growth could continue to exceed inflation for a while and still remain \nconsistent with the on-going disinflation process.\n6 In fact, recent data revisions that \nraise the level of GDP and point to lower em ployment suggest that productivity may be \nunderstated by current measures. \n Demand \nGoing forward, it will be vitally import ant to preserve healthy labor market \nconditions. In my view, this will require econom ic activity continuing to grow close to \ntrend, which is my baseline outlook.  \n \n6 For more details on the projected non-inflationary ECI range, see “ Is Post-pandemic Wage Growth \nFueling Inflation?” (bostonfed.org) . For additional analysis on this topic, see “ Productivity Improvements \nand Markup Normalization Can Support Further W age Gains without Inflationary Pressures” \n(bostonfed.org) . \n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery \nEMBARGOED UNTIL 5:30 P.M U.S. Eastern Time, \nWednesday, October 9, 2024 – OR UPON DELIVERY \n \n7 \n In this respect, recent dat a show activity continuing to grow at a solid pace  \noverall. Importantly, the fundamentals underpinning consumer spending remain \nfavorable, including job opport unities and the gradual recovery  of real wages. However, \nI call myself a “realistic optimist” and that includes recognizing that there are risks on \nboth sides of this outlook. \nFigure 8  shows two demand-related indicato rs. On the one hand, household net \nworth remains quite elevated by historical standards, as shown on the left, which could \ncontribute to a faster-than-expected pace of gr owth in consumer spending. At the same \ntime, strains are starting to emerge, es pecially at the lower end of the income \ndistribution. For example, credit card delinquencies, shown in the right-hand panel,  have \nrisen to above pre-pandemic levels, although t hey are still low by recent historical \nstandards. \n Monetary Policy \nThe next phase of monetary policy must focus on preserving current favorable \neconomic conditions. A sustainable return of inflation to target, and a strong labor \nmarket, are both critic ally important.   \nA restrictive monetary policy stance played a key role in the disinflation progress \nso far, and recent data on spending and production in dicate that the effects of restrictive \npolicy are being felt, especially in interest-s ensitive sectors of the economy. With the \nlabor market cooling, and economic growth  reverting to a more normal pace, the \neconomy is somewhat more vulnerable to adverse shocks. My confidence in the \ndisinflation trajectory has increased – but  so have the risks of the economy slowing \nbeyond what is needed to rest ore price stability.   \nFor these reasons, the FOMC began easing the policy stance at its meeting last \nmonth (see Figure 9 ). I saw an initial 50 basis point ra te reduction as prudent in this \ncontext, recognizing that monetary policy remains in restrictive territory.  \n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery \nEMBARGOED UNTIL 5:30 P.M U.S. Eastern Time, \nWednesday, October 9, 2024 – OR UPON DELIVERY \n \n8 \n Further adjustments will likely be needed. Indeed, the median projection from the \nFOMC participants’ Summary of Economic Projections,7 released at the end of last \nmonth’s meeting, includes an ad ditional 50 basis points of cuts  in the federal funds rate \nthis year. But I will stress that policy is not on a pre-set path and will remain data-\ndependent, adjusting as the economy evolves.  \n \nSmaller cities and Central Massachusetts  \nWith the national economy as context, I’ll now offer some brief perspective on \nsmaller cities and the areas that surround them – including a few observations about \nCentral Mass. and Greater Worces ter. Like the Bureau, the Federal Reserve serves the \npublic – all the public. So while “superstar” cities get a lot of well-deserved buzz, we \ncare deeply about smaller cities and rura l areas, and the economic experience for \npeople in them. In fact, a la rge portion of the Massachusetts population – more than a \nthird – lives outside the Boston me tro area. And about a third of that population live in \nWorcester County. \nPeople are of course fundamental to economic activity, and Figure 10  shows \npopulation trends since 2000. As you likely know, population growth in Worcester \nCounty has exceeded the state av erage, fueled in part by rapi d population growth in the \ncity of Worcester – quite a bit fast er than Boston in t he period since 2010. \n  New England’s smaller cities have of  course been buffeted by the crosscurrents \nof economic history, often driven by technol ogical change. Certainly, the decline in \nmanufacturing sector’s share of employment over time has been a powerful current \naffecting Worcester, the Commonwealth , and the entire U.S., as shown in Figure 11 .   \n \n7 September 18, 2024: FOMC Projections material s, accessible version (federalreserve.gov)  \n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery \nEMBARGOED UNTIL 5:30 P.M U.S. Eastern Time, \nWednesday, October 9, 2024 – OR UPON DELIVERY \n \n9 \n While the share of employment concentrat ed in manufacturing de clined nationwide, \nWorcester was particularly hard hit, given t he previous importance of the sector here.8  \n  Still, Worcester’s population growth speaks to its more recent and ongoing \nrevitalization, leveraging assets such as location, local leadership, and developing an \nimportant mix of sectors. Pa rticularly notable over the last decade has been very rapid \nemployment growth in professional and busi ness services, more than double the pace \nof growth in Massachusetts and the U.S.9   \n Resurgence and Vibrancy   I’d like to share some thoughts on how smaller cities and rural areas around the \ncountry, and in New England, find economic  resurgence in the face of long-term \nchallenges like the loss of m anufacturing jobs. Over the la st 10 to 15 years the Boston \nFed, motivated by our mandate to s upport maximum employment, has learned and \nshared a great deal.\n10 Our research and experience show s that an essential element is \nlocal leaders willing to collaborate across se ctors on shared goals strategies. (Easy to \nsay, difficult to do!). \n \n8 An extensive literature examines many dimensions  of the steep decline in manufacturing employment. \nFor an interesting recent exploration, with references to the prior literature, s ee “New Perspectives on the \nDecline of US Manufacturing Employ ment,” by Teresa C. Fort, Justin  R. Pierce, and Peter K. Schott, in \nthe Journal of Economic Perspectives , Volume 32, Number 2; Spring 2018; Pages 47–72 \n[https://pubs.aeaweb.org/do i/pdfplus/10.1257/jep.32.2.47 ] \n \n9 Professional and Business Services employment gr ew rapidly from 2013 to 2023. In Worcester County \nthe growth was 33 percent. In the City of Worceste r the growth was 57 percent, over that time. This \ncompares to 23 percent for the U.S. as a whole, and 25 percent for Massachusetts. Sources: Bureau of \nLabor Statistics, Quarterly Workforce Indicators, and the Massachusetts Executive Office of Labor and \nWorkforce Development ES-202. \n \n10 One can learn more about the Bank’s work to supp ort growth in smaller cities and rural areas at \nhttps://www.bostonfed.org/communi ty-development/supporting-growth-in- smaller-industrial-cities.aspx. \nOur mandate and our concern for a vibrant, inclusive ec onomy bring our focus to the challenges that \nprevent people from participating in the economy or  the workforce – issues like childcare, housing, \ntransportation, and broadband. Studyi ng factors that limit people from participating, and disparities for \ngroups and places, can help strengthen overall economic growth and competitiveness. \n \n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery \nEMBARGOED UNTIL 5:30 P.M U.S. Eastern Time, \nWednesday, October 9, 2024 – OR UPON DELIVERY \n \n10 \n Thoughtful experimentation can lead to new approaches that support economic \nvibrancy. Within our Working Places initiati ves, I would highlight the effort we called \n“LELE” or Leaders for Equitable Local Eco nomies – an 18-month experiment beginning \nin 2021, which had great success in Worcester.11  \nThe “Reimaging Civic Engagement in Worc ester, MA” LELE team worked with \nthe city to implement a participatory process for distribution of funds from the American \nRescue Plan Act of 2021 intended to suppor t communities hit hardest by COVID-19.12 \nUltimately, the group helped bump Worcester’s allocation from $10 million to $50 million \n– a good example of building civic infras tructure that engages and includes all. \nMore generally, we and our partners ar e exploring ways people can grow the \n“playbook” of effective local strategies. For instance, some locales have focused on business retention and recruitment, and str engthening neighborhoods. In others, local \nleaders have decided to focus on reducing im pediments to participation in the labor \nforce – addressing tangible probl ems like job readiness, childcare, and transportation. In \nstill others, people are focusi ng on entrepreneurship support, and access to information \nabout jobs being available wher e people go every day – like thei r kids’ schools. Again, a \nkey is local people coming together from vari ous sectors to determine and then work on \nshared objectives. \n Looking Ahead \nIn concluding, I hope it is evident that our  focus at the Boston Fed is on a vibrant \neconomy that works for everyone,  not just for some. That sp irit motivates me to study \n \n11 One can learn more about Working Places initiatives and LELE at \nhttps://www.bostonfed.o rg/workingplaces.aspx \n \n12 The Worcester team was led by Casey Burns, Gina Plata-Nino, and Etel Haxhiaj. Under their LELE \numbrella, five resident committees helped review and prioritize grant applications . Grant writing sessions \nwere held to support applicants from small, new, and diverse organizations. Resident ambassadors \nengaged more fully with the Worcester Housing Authority. \n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery \nEMBARGOED UNTIL 5:30 P.M U.S. Eastern Time, \nWednesday, October 9, 2024 – OR UPON DELIVERY \n \n11 \n and analyze the economic data and contribute in a rigorous manner to monetary \npolicymaking.   \nIt also motivates me to travel the r egion, hearing from stakeholders across our \neconomy – as shown in Figure 12 . That’s why I gathered with some Worcester leaders \nearlier this afternoon, and why I’m headed to Ve rmont this evening for a series of \nmeetings tomorrow. Hearing from New Engl anders with diverse perspectives about the \nchallenges and opportunities they  see in the economy helps me fulfil my responsibilities \nas a policymaker – and is a tr uly wonderful part of my job. \nIn addition to our monetary policy work , the Federal Reserve supports Main \nStreet economies in a variety of ways – often quietly and behind the scenes. Our \nsupport includes financial stability, most  directly through safety and soundness \nsupervision; providing payments and financial se rvices infrastructure such as through \nthe FedNow instant payments service;13 conducting objective research and analysis; \nand convening experts and community members around key topics. \nThere are no shortages of challenges in  our economy, but myriad opportunities \nas well. I believe we have real opportunities  to see central Mass., all of Mass., indeed all \nof New England thrive. The keys are engagement, cross-sector collabor ation, analysis, \ninnovation, and commitment. I know you have those things in Worcester and Central \nMass. I look forward to continued partner ships, and wish you continued great success. \n Thank you.  \n \n13 https://www.bostonfed.org/payments-innovation/fednow-service.aspx",

            "content": "Transcript\n00;02;04;05 - 00;02;35;16\nLee\nShe's the CEO of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, one of the 12 regional reserve banks in the Federal Reserve System, where the U.S. central, banking system. And so let me say a few words about her before I welcome her. And before we begin our conversation.  Not only does she oversee all of the Boston Fed's activities, which include economic research and community economic development and activity, to just name a few of her responsibilities.\n00;02;35;16 - 00;03;16;08\nLee\nBut she is also a widely published international macroeconomic economist with a lifelong interest in policy and its impact on living standards. Her research includes work on the determinants of economic growth and performance, and persistent macroeconomic imbalances, and the country's economic transformations. She will tell us more about her academic background, but I should share that before joining the fed, she was provost and executive vice president for the academic affairs at University of Michigan, and she began her academic career as a faculty member in the economics department at Harvard.\n00;03;16;10 - 00;03;42;14\nLee\nAnd before that, she divided her time as professor at Georgetown and a senior fellow in economic studies at the Brookings Institute. As you have heard, she is no stranger to Boston. In addition to her time on the faculty at Harvard, she spent time in Boston as a student, where she received her undergraduate degree at Harvard and her PhD in economics at MIT.\n00;03;42;17 - 00;03;57;00\nLee\nShe was born in Scotland, raised in New York, and she is a naturalized US citizen of Jamaican descent.\n00;03;57;02 - 00;04;08;06\nLee\nAnd is married with two adult children. I am truly, truly honored to share the stage with her today. And so, why don't we get started and welcome,\n00;04;08;06 - 00;04;23;28\nLee\nPlease give for a round of applause.\n00;04;24;00 - 00;04;48;25\nLee\nSo, you've been in this job for almost, two and a half years. After a long career in academia and can you talk a bit about how your leadership roles in academia prepared you for this role at the Federal Reserve as a Federal Reserve policymaker and as the CEO of one of its reserve banks?\n00;04;48;28 - 00;04;59;07\nSusan\nSure. But let me just start by saying what a pleasure it is to be here at the sixth Annual Expo for BECMA and to be.\n00;04;59;10 - 00;05;04;27\nSusan\nWith all of you here this morning.\n00;05;05;00 - 00;05;32;07\nSusan\nSo, yeah, it has been, two and a half years, almost. It's gone very quickly. And, a lot has happened. So both of those things are true. You know, at most of my career has been in academia, as you mentioned. Of course, you come from academia, too. You know, and as I think about it, there are actually a lot of things that were part of my earlier career that really do relate directly to my role at the Boston Fed.\n00;05;32;07 - 00;06;07;17\nSusan\nSo, you know, I've been an active researcher. I've been very engaged and really focused on policy as a way to make a difference in people's lives. And I've also been very focused on institutions, especially institutions that have a public mission. And all of those things really come together at the Boston Fed. So, you know, you mentioned some of my research as an international economist trying to understand, what helps countries to grow and to sustain growth and really improve living standards and how policy can make a difference in that.\n00;06;07;19 - 00;06;30;14\nSusan\nAnd, you know, that work relates directly to the role of monetary policy and the kinds of work that the fed does related to a vibrant economy. And I hope we talk a bit more about that. And then also, a complex organization with a public mission is very much what the Federal Reserve is, and it has a big impact on people's lives.\n00;06;30;15 - 00;07;01;06\nSusan\nThat's something I and my colleagues take very seriously the responsibility of the kinds of decisions that we make. And so, you know, all of that for me, comes together, and it's been, you know, I learn something new every day. And I'm so excited to be able to work with the really, committed experts and public servants at the Federal Reserve as part of a nonpartisan, really rigorous organization that is committed to a vibrant economy that helps make people's lives better.\n00;07;01;09 - 00;07;09;14\nLee\nThank you. Let me, I would just dig a little deeper here if I can.\n00;07;09;17 - 00;07;30;16\nLee\nYou know, being a professor and being in an academic setting where you can do research, and a lot of your work is independent. It's, determined by you, not by an institution. Why did you leave all that behind?\n00;07;30;18 - 00;07;57;26\nSusan\nSo, you know, I've always been somebody who's seen the power of collaboration and of working in teams. And so much of the work that I have done throughout my profession has really involved working with others as well as, you know, coming up with ideas and doing that research. But I would say over time, as my career developed, I probably worked more in partnerships and collaboration, working with groups of students, groups of faculty.\n00;07;57;29 - 00;08;11;27\nSusan\nCertainly as an administrator, it is helping to empower people to be successful in a variety of different kinds of contexts. And that's exciting and it's very rewarding, to be able to help people really be able to thrive.\n00;08;11;29 - 00;08;24;02\nLee\nOkay. So, I'm gonna dig a little deeper. What has most surprised you about your current role?\n00;08;24;05 - 00;08;51;16\nSusan\nSo, let me say two things about that. One is I have fought for a long time in my role as an international macroeconomist about monetary policy. You know, it's a huge, dimension of what influences economic performance, both in the U.S but also it has an international impact as well. But I will say, you know, it's different to be sitting at that table, than it is to be from the outside thinking about that.\n00;08;51;16 - 00;09;18;16\nSusan\nAnd, you know, I've been really, I won't say surprised, but really gratified by the, the serious commitment that, the conversations around the table, take, the, the extent to which but there are a range of views. They're really based on data, on research, on analysis. People take each other seriously and try to do the best work that we can.\n00;09;18;16 - 00;09;43;20\nSusan\nAnd then I'll also say that the people that I get to work with, you know, I knew a little bit about that from work I had done along the way. I was actually a director of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston while I was, in Michigan for a number of years, but actually being kind of on the ground as part of the Boston Fed institution and seeing firsthand the just, incredible expertise and commitment of the people who work at the fed.\n00;09;43;22 - 00;09;45;28\nSusan\nThat’s just been wonderful.\n00;09;46;01 - 00;10;05;26\nLee\nWell, thank you. We're all glad that you're here. You get high marks for your, you know, your economics, but you also get high marks because you are engaged in the community in a way that the CEO, is not normally engaged in, the communities in Boston. So, we want to thank you for that.\n00;10;05;28 - 00;10;23;14\nLee\nYou know, you made history, when you arrived, as the first black woman to hold such a position at the Federal Reserve. And what is the significance of this, of this role, especially for communities of color here in the region and across the nation?\n00;10;23;16 - 00;10;44;23\nSusan\nYeah. So, so let me say a couple of things about that. I mean, you know, first of all, it took a long time, but, you know, I see the role, as certainly a huge privilege. I see it as a responsibility, but also as an opportunity. And all of those things are very meaningful for me.\n00;10;44;23 - 00;11;27;03\nSusan\nI'm really proud, to be a president of the Federal Reserve Bank. And, you know, recognize that that's impactful in a lot of ways for many people. I talked a bit a moment ago about the responsibility of the decisions that we make, which really do impact people. I also think there's an opportunity, you know, I've spent a lot of time throughout my career trying to do what I can to help make the economics profession, make higher education, make the institutions I've been part of be open and have opportunities available, certainly to black people, but more broadly to women, to everybody.\n00;11;27;11 - 00;12;02;21\nSusan\nAnd I think in my role, there's an opportunity to do more engagement. You mentioned, being out in the community. That's really important to me. And it's something actually the Boston Fed has had a commitment to over time, I’m building on that. And so, you know, I think that it goes back also to partnership that perhaps, I may be well placed to be able to help build those partnerships and collaboration to really expand on the impact and the kind of importance. We all want a vibrant economy, that that works for everybody so that we can all thrive.\n00;12;02;21 - 00;12;05;27\nSusan\nAnd it's exciting to be part of that. Yeah.\n00;12;06;00 - 00;12;29;08\nLee\nSo, let me ask a question that's probably on the minds of a lot of people here, which is what is the Federal Reserve and what does it do? And I think is especially salient for all the, non-economists in the room. After all, it's not a well understood institution. And so can you tell us more  and illuminate for us.\n00;12;29;10 - 00;12;56;15\nSusan\nAbsolutely. Actually, that is a question I get asked a lot. I think, many people, even a lot of economists, really don't know that much about the fed and what it is, what it does, why it does what it does. That's a long conversation. But let me let me just say a few things. So, you know, I like to think that the overarching mission that we have is a vibrant economy that works for everyone, not just for some people.\n00;12;56;17 - 00;13;17;23\nSusan\nAnd I'll say a little bit more about that in a moment. But the Boston Fed is one of 12 reserve banks, and each of the Reserve Bank's actually is grounded in a district. Our district is most of New England. And then there's also the board of governors in Washington, D.C., and those 12 reserve banks, together with the board, make up the United States central bank.\n00;13;17;25 - 00;13;42;07\nSusan\nAnd we're charged by Congress with a dual mandate, a mandate for price stability and for maximum employment and price stability means low, stable inflation. I kind of like to think about it as an inflation dynamic so that no one's thinking about inflation, which obviously has not been where we have been recently. And so, getting back to price stability is important.\n00;13;42;10 - 00;14;17;08\nSusan\nAnd then maximum employment. And I think about that as ensuring that everyone has an opportunity if they want to work, to be able to do so. And so certainly as part of that mandate, we, conduct monetary policy. And in an environment where inflation has been really high and we've seen the real toll that it's taken on so many households, especially low- and moderate-income households struggling to make ends meet, and also a lot of businesses being, you know, facing those high prices and all of the implications of that.\n00;14;17;11 - 00;14;47;11\nSusan\nUsing our, our kind of key tool to be able to adjust interest rates to, change financial conditions and bring inflation down has been a real priority. And, you know, and that's something we're committed to as well as maximum employment. But that's only part of what we do. And, you know, just very briefly, you know, there's a lot of work that goes into understanding conditions for the national economy to make those policy decisions.\n00;14;47;14 - 00;15;11;18\nSusan\nData, statistical analyzes, understanding the experiences of real people. We also do a lot of research for the New England economy, trying to understand trends and conditions and make that available to people as a resource. We supervised some of the nation's banks and a sound financial system is an important part of what we do.\n00;15;11;20 - 00;15;41;17\nSusan\nWe also have community economic development initiatives and activities trying to foster vibrancy, especially in, low- and moderate-income communities across our region. So, the portfolio is actually a lot broader than most people think. And it all is in service of that public mission, the dual mandate that I mentioned from Congress and really fostering a vibrant economy that's inclusive as well.\n00;15;41;19 - 00;16;09;02\nLee\nYou know, there's a certain candidate running for office of the presidency who, when he doesn't get his way, rants. And one of his most recent rants is that the reserve Bank is political and partisan. Would you like to respond to that?\n00;16;09;04 - 00;16;30;16\nSusan\nSo, I will just say that we are rigorously and absolutely focused on the data and the analysis and doing what is, to our understanding, the best we can do to foster that vibrant economy and to fulfill our congressional mandate. And that will continue to be true.\n00;16;30;19 - 00;16;38;24\nLee\nThank you.\n00;16;38;26 - 00;17;03;06\nLee\nSo, for many folks in this audience, many of whom who represent Boston's, community of business and entrepreneurs, could you take it a little step further and maybe give us some examples of how they might see the impact of the Federal Reserve policies and initiatives on their businesses and work life?\n00;17;03;08 - 00;17;21;01\nSusan\nSure. I mean, some of the things I talked about are kind of high level, right? But a lot of the work that we do really does impact, people on the ground and businesses. And, and I want to say, I know that there are so many entrepreneurs and business leaders here in the audience. The work that you do is critical.\n00;17;21;01 - 00;17;34;21\nSusan\nWe would not have a vibrant economy without all of the things that you're engaged with. And so, thank you for everything that you do every day.\n00;17;34;23 - 00;18;02;13\nSusan\nSo, I talked briefly a moment ago about the implications of monetary policy to foster that price stability and maximum employment. Those are economic conditions that really create an environment that enables business to thrive. And that's something that I think is really important. You know, in addition, there's a range of other things we do. And let me just give maybe three concrete examples.\n00;18;02;16 - 00;18;29;27\nSusan\nThe Boston Fed working together with the 11 other Federal Reserve banks, we conduct an annual small business credit survey and that is intended to really understand better the financial, the experiences related to credit for small businesses across the country. What's going well? What are the challenges? What are the main concerns? What are the opportunities?\n00;18;29;29 - 00;19;02;00\nSusan\nYou know, fostering that deeper understanding really can help both us but also many others to do their jobs better and to try to address some of the barriers. And, you know, the reports are available online. So that's one example, that, that I would highlight. We also are actively engaged at the Boston Fed in a number of initiatives to support vibrancy in smaller cities and rural areas across, our district, through our regional community economic activities.\n00;19;02;00 - 00;19;31;22\nSusan\nAnd a lot of that work is actually in partnership with, people in the public sector, the private sector, philanthropic sector, nonprofits, to really identify some of the key challenges that are getting in the way and then developing strategies and trying to work them forward. And I'm talking about things like: challenges with accessible childcare, affordable housing, problems related to workforce development and workforce skills.\n00;19;31;24 - 00;20;03;03\nSusan\nAnd then the third one that I'd mentioned, just briefly, is related to some of our activities and payments and that's everything from more traditional payments opportunities to some of the, and I'll say responsible, experimentation in some of the more technological kind of, you know, cutting edge, GenAI, the idea of secure contracts and what are some of the things that might help to really support and enhance an efficient payment system?\n00;20;03;07 - 00;20;13;12\nSusan\nAnd those are things that, you know, businesses and households are actually using in different ways, every day and will continue to in order to facilitate their activities.\n00;20;13;14 - 00;20;39;18\nLee\nYeah. Thank you. You know, we've talked, this morning a bit about the racial wealth gap. And as Nicole said, it was the Massachusetts Taxpayers Association who said that if we could snap our fingers today, that we could close that gap, it would add about $25 to $26 billion in our economy over the next five years.\n00;20;39;21 - 00;21;19;21\nLee\nAnd it's also been estimated that the failure to close racial wealth gap has cost the American economy about $16 to $17 trillion over the last 20 years. So, closing that gap is not a zero sum game, as you well know. It's about increasing prosperity for everyone. It lifts all boats. And I know that, you know, the Boston Fed has been engaged in work focused on reducing wealth disparity and advancing more equitable economic outcomes for some time.\n00;21;19;21 - 00;21;32;14\nLee\nCan you tell us about how this work fits into the Fed's overall mandate from Congress, and why it matters to you as a president? Because I know it does.\n00;21;32;16 - 00;22;01;26\nSusan\nYeah. So, let me just step back a moment. The Boston Fed has actually had a long history of engagement as part of the range of things that we do in terms of trying to better understand and address in ways that, you know, appropriate ways, some of the gaps or disparities and those are gaps related to wealth related to employment, related to credit, across racial and ethnic lines, across gender lines.\n00;22;01;28 - 00;22;26;03\nSusan\nYou know, if you think about our mandate from Congress for maximum employment, as well as price stability and our focus on a vibrant, inclusive economy, when there are barriers and these gaps actually present barriers for full participation in the economy that actually limits the vibrancy of the economy. And so, I see understanding those gaps and helping to facilitate ways to address them.\n00;22;26;03 - 00;22;50;25\nSusan\nAnd of course, it's over time and it involves many, many partners. A lot of that is not work done directly by the fed. I see that is directly related to our mission and our mandate. You know, and as you note,  the Boston Fed, launched in 2015, so almost ten years ago, The Color of Wealth study, which is, of course, very well known.\n00;22;50;27 - 00;23;21;19\nSusan\nAnd we've already been talking about it this morning, that, you know, really highlighted just how stark the disparities are in wealth between black households, also Hispanic households and white households, and help to really focus attention on the importance of that, which is a bit of a silver lining. And again, from my perspective, that deeper understanding of those disparities can be helpful in a range of ways and directly relates to our mandate.\n00;23;21;19 - 00;23;39;04\nSusan\nSo, we're excited about some multi-year work that is now underway. And we're, you know, of course, partnering with the Boston Foundation and with other, key partners, you know, to really understand what the wealth gap situation in Massachusetts is at a deeper level.\n00;23;39;06 - 00;24;11;08\nLee\nThank you. Listen, you know, because I'm engaged in this, you know, this project updates the 2015 wealth report. And I talk a lot about, and we're doing a lot of work on TBF and trying to close the racial wealth gap. Sometimes, folks don't fully understand what wealth is and confuse it with income, which is something different.\n00;24;11;08 - 00;24;15;28\nLee\nAnd could you talk a little bit about that distinction and why it's important?\n00;24;16;00 - 00;24;37;05\nSusan\nYeah, absolutely. Now of course income is important as well. Income is what economists-- not to not to get a lecture mode-- but what economists think of as a flow. And so, income is the amount of, resources that are coming in in any period of time. So perhaps annually. But your wealth is the amount that has been accumulated.\n00;24;37;05 - 00;25;08;13\nSusan\nAnd, having accumulated wealth enables you to navigate uncertainties, emergencies and not to have that derail your plans and how you are able to care for your business, for your family. It enables you to make investment decisions, whether it's for your business or it's education for yourself, for your family members. So, it has both short term implications, but also long-term implications which can be transferred across generations.\n00;25;08;13 - 00;25;35;10\nSusan\nSo, it's fundamental really to economic vibrancy, security and financial health. And so, there's more to say, but perhaps that that is the immediate part. And that's one of the key reasons we think that this new study, which is called Mass Echoes, is so important. And Mass Echoes stands for Massachusetts, Economic Conditions and Household Opportunity Survey.\n00;25;35;10 - 00;25;58;24\nSusan\nAnd that's the new project, multi-year project, that we've launched to really better understand across all of Massachusetts what those disparities and wealth gaps are, so that we can also understand how we may collectively work together to try to continue addressing them and it's exciting to hear about some of the work already underway. And we heard about some of that this morning.\n00;25;58;26 - 00;26;39;18\nLee\nYeah. The other thing, you know, I studied, languages. And so wealth comes from, you know, this I know from the old English “weal”, W-E-A-L, which means well-being. So wealth and well-being, are synonymous, as we heard from Nicole today. And, you know, I think of communities like, you know, this game Jenga, where you everybody, you know that game, and you pull out a block creates a little bit of stress, pull out another block and it creates more stress.\n00;26;39;20 - 00;27;05;28\nLee\nIf you pull out too many blocks, you create trauma. And so many of our communities are traumatized communities because they don't have the building blocks that create wealth and well-being. And that's an important distinction here.\n00;27;06;01 - 00;27;29;20\nSusan\nYou know, and there are many different approaches that can matter. I think better understanding a problem and really drawing attention to it. I mean, one of the things that Color of Wealth study did is highlight the wealth disparities, that can be really foundational to making a difference and advancing towards solutions.\n00;27;29;22 - 00;28;01;00\nLee\nI want to go back to, you know, the conversations that you've been having and you've been having a lot you've really been, wonderfully present in a variety of communities. But how will this new study differ from the Color of Wealth study? It's almost biblical now, you know, $247,500 versus eight bucks. It's almost biblical.\n00;28;01;03 - 00;28;09;06\nLee\nAnd how will this study differ from that 2015 study?\n00;28;09;08 - 00;28;28;14\nSusan\nYeah. So it will differ in a few ways. Now, of course, it builds on the work that was done. And I think that's, that's important. And as I've mentioned a number of times, this is a collaborative initiative. But there are a couple of ways in which it's different. First of all, the earlier study was really focused on the Boston metro area.\n00;28;28;16 - 00;29;07;22\nSusan\nAnd this study is focused on all of Massachusetts, certainly greater Boston, but also the gateway cities collectively and some rural areas as well. It will be an enhanced, kind of data strategy and approach. So, it will be a larger study. And the, you know, the goal is to have a large and diverse enough sample coming from the survey to really be able to have, you know, kind of clear information about what the disparities are but also different dimensions of them in a more nuanced way.\n00;29;07;22 - 00;29;40;06\nSusan\nAnd so, the goal is a set of completed surveys of about 5000. And in order to do that, we’ll be, sending out surveys, once we get there, to perhaps 30,000 randomly selected households across the state. And, asking about people’s, households’, assets. And by assets, I mean things like bank accounts. But also, if you own a home, about that and also about their debts.\n00;29;40;09 - 00;30;25;21\nSusan\nAnd so that is things like a mortgage, things like, student loans that we were talking about this morning, car debt, auto debt, credit card debt. And, you know, it takes time to gather enough households who are willing to share that kind of financial information to be able to have that complete survey. So, we're currently in the, you know, preliminary phases of really completing design of the survey and understanding of the sample and importantly, working with communities about understanding what the goals of the survey are, to really help foster participation, understanding that, you know, people don't always like to be asked about their wealth and in order to have a\n00;30;25;21 - 00;30;47;13\nSusan\nrobust survey, you need people to be willing to complete, the questions and the information. And so, it's not yet in the field. It'll take some time to go in the field to gather the data, and then we'll need to do the analysis. And our expectation is that in 2026, we will have initial results to be sharing.\n00;30;47;13 - 00;31;11;02\nSusan\nAnd I know people want the results yesterday. But it's important enough that it's worth doing it right and doing it well. And hopefully people will understand that. And again, really appreciate the partnership with the Boston Foundation and so many others. Just, I guess one thing I should say. So, you know, the Boston Fed has been very, you know, it has led the study in a lot of key ways.\n00;31;11;02 - 00;31;31;13\nSusan\nDesigning the survey, we’ll be leading the analysis and some of the reporting, but we're not funding it. We, you know, we're not actually taking it into the field. We're working with a number of different partners to do that work. And we're excited about those partnerships and also how that deeper understanding can help to make a difference in this really important space.\n00;31;31;16 - 00;32;04;15\nLee\nYou know, I reached out to the to the fed, the Boston Fed, even before I came to TBF, I was still president at Emerson College because I was very much interested in the report. And I'm glad that you've taken on taking on this new study. It's very complicated. It's much more broad, in terms of outreach and who we're considering in the statistical data than in previous.\n00;32;04;15 - 00;32;33;17\nLee\nSo I want to give you credit and thank you for your leadership in that, in way. I'm going to ask you one more question and then give you a chance to, you know, follow up with any final comments. You know, you really are out there having a lot of conversations and with folks and in businesses and in communities.\n00;32;33;20 - 00;32;48;24\nLee\nCould you reflect a little bit for us on how and what you bring from those conversations to policymaking to the policymaking table and in D.C. at the Board of Governors?\n00;32;48;26 - 00;33;07;24\nSusan\nYeah, absolutely. So, you know, I was just in the past couple of weeks, I was in Fitchburg, I was in Worcester. I was in a number of areas in Vermont. I'm committed to visiting each of the six states in New England at least once, each year. And often it's quite a bit more than that.\n00;33;07;24 - 00;33;35;17\nSusan\nAnd I and I think those visits and the kind of, range of conversations that I have when I'm out and about are really they're critically important. It's also one of my favorite things, you know, of what I do to be able to, to really talk with people who are engaged in the economy in their part of the region, in their sector, to learn firsthand about what they see as the challenges, what they see as the opportunities.\n00;33;35;19 - 00;34;01;20\nSusan\nAnd, from my perspective, it's actually a key part of the data. You know, we often think of data as just all the statistics, and the statistics are hugely important. And I am a total data geek, and I spend a lot of time looking at, you know, labor market data and price data and economic activity data and, you know, all the financial markets data, all of it. At the same time, a lot of the data is telling you what was happening last month or last quarter or last year.\n00;34;01;22 - 00;34;27;02\nSusan\nAnd talking to people who are involved right now is, is, kind of a much better window into what current thinking is like and, and how people are thinking about the future also. And that to me really complements sometimes we go back and we look at the data a little differently, or we think of some new analyzes or it forces us to say, is what we were seeing in the data, is that similar or different?\n00;34;27;02 - 00;34;56;15\nSusan\nAnd sometimes what's happening in some regions is quite different from what's happening elsewhere. Right? I mean, the data, the national data-- and monetary policy is national-- but those aggregate figures can mask real variation across sectors, across regions. And a more nuanced understanding helps to understand where you know what might be fragile, where the real opportunities are. And so, it really does complement things.\n00;34;56;17 - 00;35;21;02\nSusan\nWhen I am at the FOMC table, I always do talk about a summary of some of the key things I've heard and what might be a little different and what I'm hearing this time than when I heard right before the last meeting. So things like, what's happening in labor markets? How hard is it to hire? what people are thinking about in terms of, you know, of wages.\n00;35;21;04 - 00;35;51;08\nSusan\nAnd I've heard a lot about challenges that we've talked about housing, the costs, the high prices, but also opportunities in terms of working together to create pathways into employment and workforce skills and, to address childcare challenges, and to develop supports for entrepreneurs who are, starting out. And it's complicated, right? And so, there are a lot of ways that different groups are helping each other.\n00;35;51;08 - 00;36;22;24\nSusan\nAnd then I've also heard a lot about productivity growth. So there are a lot of positive things to recognize and to study, as well as challenges that we need to be focused on and addressing. So those conversations are, you know, extremely helpful, informative, valuable. And I guess the last thing I'd say about that is that I also think it's really important for me as president of the Boston Fed, recognizing people don't really understand what we do and why.\n00;36;22;29 - 00;36;38;15\nSusan\nJust to always talk a little bit about our role and what we're doing, even if people don't agree, I think it's important to talk about that. And so that's one of my goals as well when I'm out and about. And again, I really look forward to all of those conversations and, look forward to continuing them.\n00;36;38;17 - 00;37;02;23\nLee\nThank you so very much. No, I and others are really inspired by your leadership. We're so glad that you are here. We're very fortunate to have you leading the way at the Boston Fed. And so I, I want to give you the opportunity to have the last word. If there's anything you would like to say before we close.\n00;37;02;25 - 00;37;37;25\nSusan\nSo, I'll just say it's been great to be back in the Boston area and in New England. This is a really vibrant community. There are so many opportunities here. There are also challenges, and we're talking about some of them. Certainly wealth, the wealth gaps, building wealth is a key one, but I really firmly believe that the way that we address those challenges and that we build on the vibrancy in the thriving economy is by collaborating and working together, and businesses of all sizes are absolutely critical to that vibrancy and to those partnerships.\n00;37;37;25 - 00;37;56;14\nSusan\nAnd so I just wanted to maybe wrap up by, going back to where I started, which is to say thank you for all the work that each of you are doing. I hope you continue to, engage and connect. And we at the Boston Fed look forward to finding ways that we can continue to learn from each other and also to work together.\n00;37;56;14 - 00;38;08;21\nSusan\nI really have no doubt that we have a set of shared goals and we want to see that vibrant economy. And so, I wish all of you all the best. Again. It's great to be here at BECMA.\n00;38;08;23 - 00;38;10;05\nLee\nThank you, thank you Susan. Thank you so much.\n00;38;10;08 - 00;38;12;21\nSusan\nAnd thank you, Lee.",

Collins  \nPresident & Chief Executive Officer  \nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston  \n  \nNovember 15, 2024 \nBoston, Massachusetts  \n \nThe views expressed today are my own, not necessarily those of my colleagues on the \nFederal Reserve Board of Governors or the Federal Open Market Committee.   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Remarks as Prepared for Delivery  \nEMBARGOED UNTIL 9 AM U.S. Eastern Time , \nFriday, Nov. 15, 2024 – OR UPON DELIVERY  \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 9 AM U.S. Eastern Time,  \nFriday, Nov. 15, 2024 – OR UPON DELIVERY  \n1 \n Good morning. It is a pleasure to welcome everyone participating in this \nconference, and those viewing the livestream.  \nThis is the Boston Fed’s 68th Economic Conference, and, per tradition, we’ve \norganized it to feature expert analysis and engaged discussion around a topic with real -\nworld implications and relevance to economic vibrancy and the financial system on \nwhich we all rely.   \nI would like to thank Egon Zakrajsek, our Director of Research, and his team for \norganizing another special conference. My thanks also to those presenting research \nand insights today and tomorrow, as well as to the discussants and moderators.   \nI’ll be brief in these introductory comments; but first, my standard disclaimer: T he \nviews I express are my own and may not reflect views of other Federal Reserve \npolicymakers.  \nOur goal for the next day and a half is exploring the transformative impact of \ninnovation in finance. Recent technological advances (for example in the F inTech \nspace, in machine learning, and in Generative AI) have the potential to transform financial markets and the financial system. So, it is easy to see the importance of this \ntopic for institutions and the public. And with the Fed’s roles in the U.S. monet ary and \nfinancial systems, it is essential that we explore both the opportunities and the \nassociated risks.  \nThere are many promising opportunities from financial sector innovation. For \nexample, innovation could make financial markets more efficient, expand the types of \nservices available, and help reduce barriers to participation. But one must also be highly \ncognizant of potential downside risks –  including risks to security, privacy, and financial \nstability.  \nChanges are occurring very rapidly. The technology discussed here will not stand \nstill and, in all likelihood, will only grow in importance. So, we want to understand its current effects and anticipate its future effects. We want to explore the potential i mpacts \non traditional and nontraditional financial intermediaries, and,  more broadly , on the \npublic’s access to financial services.  \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 9 AM U.S. Eastern Time,  \nFriday, Nov. 15, 2024 – OR UPON DELIVERY  \n2 \n I will note that the Fed – and specifically, the Boston Fed – has been a force for \ninnovation in the financial and payments systems. Many years ago, we built and helped \npopularize the automated clearing house network and then pushed for digital imaging \nand electronification of checks. Some of that happened right here, in this building – as \nbefits a Reserve Bank in a region blessed with high technology, financial services, and innovative people.  \nA more recent example of Fed innovation is FedNow, the instant payments \ninfrastructure we launched in July 2023. It’s  the first new payments pl atform built by the \nFed in more than four decades.  In our “always -on” digital world, expectations about \ntransferring money have changed, and FedNow is bringing the immediacy we expect in \nother aspects of our lives to payments. Individuals and businesses whose fi nancial \ninstitutions adopt the service can send and receive instant payments any time, with immediate funds availability. Over time, we expect instant payments to be used \nroutinely for many everyday payments.\n1 \nOf course, at the Fed we think about technological innovation broadly, not just in \nthe finance space. The innovations we are all assessing – like generative AI – have the \npotential to impact the economy, labor markets, and prices in a variety of ways.2  \nLet me step back, for a moment, and comment on opportunities to participate in \nthe financial system. My starting point is always the Fed’s mandates from Congress, \n \n1 Businesses and consumers are starting to benefit from use cases such as account -to-account transfers, \nbill pay, earned wage access, digital wallet funding/defunding and many others. Workers completing their \nshifts can get access to their wages immediately when it’s deposited into their account  at a participating \nfinancial institution. Insurers can instantly disburse claim- related funds to people impacted by a natural \ndisaster. Small businesses can use instant proceeds from sales or services to ensure steady cash flow and avoid the need for short -term credit. Account holders can move funds from a brokerage account to a \nchecking account with no delay in accessing transferred funds. Digital wallet holders can fund or defund \ntheir wallets with immediate funds availability.  \n \n2 For those who are interested, I recommend the annual “technology enabled disruption” conference co-\norganized by the Atlanta, Boston and Richmond Reserve Banks and available online at Technology -\nEnabled Disruption: Implications of AI, Big Data, and Remote Work - October 1- 2, 2024 - Federal \nReserve Bank of Atlanta . Among the issues we discussed at the recent gathering were the abrupt shift, \naided by technology, in how we worked during and after the pandemic - and the need to balance the \npotential of these technologies with appropriate cautions and risk management.   \n \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 9 AM U.S. Eastern Time,  \nFriday, Nov. 15, 2024 – OR UPON DELIVERY  \n3 \n which are price stability and maximum employment, and our very framing and structure. \nThe federated system that makes up the U.S. central bank touches every part of the \ncountry, underlining our public service mission. Fed policymakers look to support an \neconomy and financial system that works for all the publ ic, consistent with those \nmandates – and opportunities to participate in the economy and financial system are \nvital. \nParenthetically, the broad opportunity to participate, a form of financial inclusion, \nis a key dimension of the FedNow S ervice. FedNow is available to financial institutions \nno matter their size and location, and offers  access to instant payments for their \ncustomers. Such access could, for instance, be attractive to people using expensive \nnon-bank services for transactions.3 And other technological innovations in finance can \nalso play roles in expanding access to financial services.  \nGiven the Federal Reserve’s roles in the U.S. monetary and financial system, we \nmust be attuned to the frontiers of technological advances and explore their implications. In addition to payments systems, as already mentioned, this includes \nthinking through  the potential impacts to:  \n• the transmission of monetary policy (including new channels for credit provision);  \n• financial stability (for example, understanding how technology builds or reduces risks); and  \n• supervision and regulation of financial institutions (including understanding how the financial institutions we supervise use technology -rich data models).  \n \nIn an economic context, I’ve long referred to myself as a “realistic optimist.” \nToday, I’ll extend that moniker to finance, and its future. On the realistic side, we must \nall be attuned to the very real risks and challenges. The optimist sees potential for  a \n \n3 For example, businesses  can leverage FedNow to offer benefits such as earned wage access for those \nin the gig economy or field workers in the agricultural industry ; and financial institutions could offer their \ncustomers the ability to pay bills in the moment, which could help avoid late fees or reduce risk of \ndamaged credit scores.  \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 9 AM U.S. Eastern Time,  \nFriday, Nov. 15, 2024 – OR UPON DELIVERY  \n4 \n virtuous cycle, with the financial system benefiting from technological advances enabled \nby innovations, and adapting to changes in the economy –  while a more efficient \nfinancial system, in turn, can boost economic growth.  \nThis conference will explore two major themes in this space, around which the \nsessions are organized: financial inclusion broadly defined; and the implications of new technologies – on payment systems, on the transmission of monetary policy, and on \nfinanci al stability. These topics are complex , and evolving rapidly –  and there is much to \nlearn from the emerging research. I am excited to bring together people across sectors \nto share insights and perspectives, and to enhance collaboration. I look forward to t he \nactive participation of everyone here.  \nNow it is my pleasure to turn things over to Jeff Fuhrer, who will moderate our \nfirst session.",

            "content": "Perspectives on the Economy  \nand Policy \n \nRemarks at the University of Michigan’s  \nGerald R. Ford School of Public Policy \n \n \nSusan M. Collins \nPresident & Chief Executive Officer \nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston \n \n \nNovember 20, 2024 \nAnn Arbor, Michigan \n \n \n \nThe views expressed today are my own, not necessarily those of my colleagues on the \nFederal Reserve Board of Governors or  the Federal Open Market Committee.  \n          \n \n       Remarks as Prepared for Deliver y\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 4:00 P.M U.S. Eastern Time,\nWednesday, November 20, 2024 – OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 4:00 P.M U.S. Eastern Time, \nWednesday, November 20, 2024  \n  \nKey Takeaways \n \n1. Collins sees the economy “in a good place over all, with inflation heading back to the 2 \npercent target amid a healthy labor market.” The primary job for monetary policy in this context \nis sustaining these favorable conditions going forward.  \n“I expect additional adjustments will li kely be appropriate over time, to move the policy rate gradually \nfrom its current restrictive stance back into a more neutral range. However, policy is not on a pre-set \npath.”  \n2. Overall, Collins sees the inflation picture as encouraging – especially with inflation \nexpectations well-anchored – and she cautions agai nst overreacting to any one data release.   \n“The volatility in inflation highlight s the need to assess the data holistica lly, to separate the signal from \nthe noise, and not overreact to any one monthly reading.” Anchored inflation expectations make \nreturning to 2 percent inflation “feasible without the economy staying below capacity for a time, as \nwould be the case if expectati ons had risen and needed to be re-ancho red.” The stability of long-run \nexpectations speaks to the credibility of the Fed in fighting inflation. \n3. Separating core inflation into three com ponents illustrates that “most of the remaining \nelevation comes from shelter.” Wh ile shelter inflation has come down some, progress has been \nslow and uneven.  \nThe key question is whether elevated housing inflation reflects the e ffects of ongoing price pressures \nfrom new leases, or simply the catch-up of existi ng leases to current mark et rents. The good news is \nthat the data show little ev idence of price pressures fr om current market rents.  \n4. A normalizing labor market and solid labor  productivity growth have been important \ncontributors to the disinflation process.  \nOther advanced economies hav e not experienced similar favorable pr oductivity gains. Given the labor \nproductivity and price deve lopments to date, Collins sees little scope for wages to disrupt the ongoing \ndisinflation progress, even if wages continue to grow at a somewhat faster pace than before the \npandemic.  \n5. Collins believes “some additional easing of poli cy is needed, as policy currently remains at \nleast somewhat restrictive.” \nThe intent is not to ease too quickly or too much, hindering the disinflation progress to date. At the \nsame time, easing too slowly or too little could unnecessarily weaken the labor market. She added that \nat this stage, any further slowing in hiring would be undesirable. Policy is well-positioned to deal with \ntwo-sided risks and achieve the Fed’s dual mand ate goals in a reasonable amount of time. \n6. Collins emphasized how the Fed’s design, structure, and breadth of portfolio make the \ncentral bank “representative of the country, a ppropriately accountable, and also independent \nenough to make hard choices in the longer-term public interest.” \nShe described the Fed’s work in research, supervi sion, financial stability, payments transactions and \ninfrastructure, liquidity, and support for economic de velopment as reflecting data-driven analysis. She \nalso discussed how the Fed acts as a convener and catalyst for collaboration across sectors.  \n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery \nEMBARGOED UNTIL 4:00 P.M U.S. Eastern Time, \nWednesday, November 20, 2024 – OR UPON DELIVERY \n \n1 \n Thank you, Dean Watkins-Hayes – Celest e – for such a warm welcome, or I \nshould say, welcome back . Michigan’s Ford School is truly a special place, and it has \nbeen wonderful to be back on campus, here in Weill Hall, spending time with students, \nfaculty and staff, including some dear fri ends, as well as many new faces. I have \nenjoyed learning about the exciting new developments and initiatives underway – and am thrilled, but not at all su rprised, to see the Ford Sc hool continuing to thrive. So, \nthank you for hosting me – it is a pleasure to be her e with you.   \nToday, I’d like to share my perspec tives on the U.S. economy and monetary \npolicy, focusing more on where we are than how we got here, and offering some \nthoughts looking ahead. I also know that the Federal Reserve is a bit of a mystery to \nmany people. So, I’ll take the opportunity, at t he end of my remarks, to talk briefly about \nthe Fed itself, and, focusing on the Boston Fed,  will give some examples of the breadth \nof work we do in support of our mission an d our mandate from Congress. Then, I look \nforward to your questions. \n \nThe National Economy – Some Context \nI’ll begin with my perspective on the nat ional economy – but first, my standard \ndisclaimer. My comments re flect my own views, not necessarily those of my \npolicymaker colleagues on the Fed’s Board of Go vernors, or at other Reserve Banks.  \nI like to provide a bit of context before diving into a topic, use a few charts to \nillustrate key points, and give my “bottom-li ne up front.” For context: Congress has given \nthe Fed a mandate to maintain price stab ility and maximum employment. The FOMC (or \nFederal Open Market Committee, which is the Fed’s monetary policymaking body) \ndefines price stability as 2 percent inflation.  Maximum employment is less specifically \ndefined, but I think of it as a broad, inclus ive goal of job opportuniti es for all Americans \nin a context of price stability. \nFigure 1  provides some history. The le ft-hand panel shows the Fed’s preferred \nmeasure of inflation calculated using t he personal consumption expenditures (PCE) \n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery \nEMBARGOED UNTIL 4:00 P.M U.S. Eastern Time, \nWednesday, November 20, 2024 – OR UPON DELIVERY \n \n2 \n price index. The blue line is 12-month total ( headline) inflation, t he green line is the 2 \npercent target, and the red line is “core” in flation, which excludes the volatile though \nobviously important categories of food and energy. The right-hand panel shows the \nevolution of the unemployment rate – a good indicator of overall labor market \nconditions, though, of course, I and my team follow a wide range of indicators to gauge \nthe state of the labor market. \nWhen I began my role as Boston Fed Pr esident and FOMC member in July \n2022, the U.S. economy was coming out from the worst of the pandemic. \nUnemployment was way down from its CO VID-19 shutdown peak. In fact, the chart \nshows that unemployment fell very rapidly,  instead of the more gradual decline that \nhistorically has followed recessions (shown in  the figure by the gray shaded bars). This \nis one of many ways in which the recent cycl e has been unusual. At the time, firms were \nstruggling to find workers – which was one factor fueling upward pressure on wages \nand prices. Supply bottlenecks were still ext ensive, exacerbated by Russia’s war in \nUkraine. Demand outstripping supply had caused a surge in inflation, and higher prices \nwere already very challeng ing for firms, and for households (especially those with low \nand moderate incomes).    \nGetting inflation back under control was the clear policy priority for the Fed, and \nthe FOMC responded by rapidly raising the federal funds ra te (the FOMC’s main policy \ntool), to the range of 5¼ to 5½ percent by July 2023.  This shift from a very \naccommodative policy stance to a quite restrictive one helpe d realign demand and \nsupply, relieving wage and price pressure s and thus reducing inflation.      \nSo where are we today? As Figure 1 shows, inflation has come down \nsignificantly – though core inflation is still somewhat elevated. The unemployment rate \nis higher than it was a year ago, but it rema ins low by historical standards. And as I’ll \ndiscuss shortly, economic growth remains robust.   \nMy bottom line is that I see an economy that is in a good place overall, with \ninflation heading back to the 2 percent target  amid a healthy labor  market. The primary \n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery \nEMBARGOED UNTIL 4:00 P.M U.S. Eastern Time, \nWednesday, November 20, 2024 – OR UPON DELIVERY \n \n3 \n job for monetary policy in this context is sustaining  these favorable conditions over time, \nfocusing on both sides of our dual mandate. Pa st experience teaches that this is the \nenvironment which enables t he benefits from a vibrant ec onomy to be shared widely. \nGiven the significant progress towards our goals, it was appropriate for the FOMC to \nbegin recalibrating policy, easing rates in September, and again when we met earlier \nthis month.   \nBefore saying more about my outlook, t he balance of risks, and implications for \npolicy, I’ll go into some additional detail on economic conditions, starting with inflation.   \n \nInflation  \nThe left chart in Figure 2  shows core PCE inflation at the 3- and 12-month \nhorizons. The progress on inflation since 2022 is apparent, with the most recent values \nfor the three-month gauge close to 2 percen t. The figure also makes it clear that \nprogress has been uneven. The favorable re adings in the second half of 2023 were \nfollowed by an increase in inflation early th is year. As the right panel shows, monthly \ninflation volatility remains elevated relati ve to pre-pandemic levels. This volatility \nhighlights the need to assess the data holistica lly, to separate the signal from the noise, \nand to not overreact to any one monthly reading.  Overall, I see the inflation picture as \nencouraging. However, we should not be surp rised if measured progress on a 12-month \nbasis slows a bit in the near term, as the low readings at the end of la st year drop out of \nthe 12-month computation window. This will lik ely continue until we are past the higher \nnumbers from early this year.     \nSeparating core inflation into three components, as shown in Figure 3 , illustrates \nthat most of the remaining elevation comes from housing. Core goods inflation, in the \nleft-hand panel, has been back down in its pr e-pandemic range for many months. The \n3-month annualized measure of services infl ation excluding housing, in the right-hand \npanel, has also returned to its pre-pandemic range. If that cont inues, the 12-month \n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery \nEMBARGOED UNTIL 4:00 P.M U.S. Eastern Time, \nWednesday, November 20, 2024 – OR UPON DELIVERY \n \n4 \n measure will decline over time. However, wh ile housing price inflation has come down \nsome, progress has been slow and uneven. \nHere, the good news, as shown in Figure 4 , is that the data s how little evidence \nof new price pressures from market rents, an  important driver of shelter inflation. All \nthree measures of the change in rents asso ciated with new leases are back down from \ntheir 2021-22 surge. Shelter inflation is high because rents for existing tenants are still \ncatching up to this past surge. While this catch-up process may continue to be slow and \nuneven, it does not raise concerns for me about  the durability of inflation’s trajectory \nback to 2 percent – as long as new tenant  rent inflation remains subdued and overall \ninflation expectations stay well-anchored. \nAs Figure 5  highlights, the situation regarding inflation expectations is favorable. \nShort-run expectations are near their pre- pandemic range (as shown in the left panel). \nMore importantly, long-run expectations (in the right panel) have stayed well-anchored \nthroughout the inflationary episode. This makes returning to 2 percent inflation feasible \nwithout  the economy staying below capacity for a time, as would be the case if \nexpectations had risen and needed to be re-anchored. The stability of long-run \nexpectations during this period further speaks to the credibility of  the Fed in fighting \ninflation.1  \n \nThe Labor Market and Supply Developments \nWhat about the labor mark et? The three panels in Figure 6  show just a few of \nthe many indicators I follow – the unemploy ment rate remaining near 4 percent, low \nunemployment claims, and declines in both job openings and quit rates. These indicators are also near levels seen ar ound 2018, when labor market conditions were \n \n1  This credibility is also rooted in the Federa l Reserve’s independence from other branches of \ngovernment. For further discussion of the importance of central bank independence in delivering low and \nstable inflation and anchored inflation expect ations see, for example, the recent speech by Governor \nKugler on central bank independence and the condu ct of monetary policy - Federal Reserve Board . \n \n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery \nEMBARGOED UNTIL 4:00 P.M U.S. Eastern Time, \nWednesday, November 20, 2024 – OR UPON DELIVERY \n \n5 \n arguably consistent with full employment. In  other words, the labor market has \nnormalized from unsustainably tight conditions a year or two ago and is consistent with \ninflation durably returning to the 2 percent  target. This healthy picture of the labor \nmarket is also reflected in conversations with employers across the Boston Fed district, \nwhich encompasses most of New England. Howe ver, I’ll note that payroll growth has \nslowed over the past year, and job creation has become more concentrated in a few sectors.   \nThe combination of disinflation with a labor  market near full employment is taking \nplace amid robust output growth, as shown in Figure 7 . The blue line depicts the \nevolution of real GDP, wh ich has been growing considerably faster than estimates of \ntrend output growth from 2015 to 2019 – the dashed blue line.\n2 An economy near full \nemployment entails GDP near trend – and, as suggested by the dashed red line, in the \ncurrent context this implies a notably high er trend growth rate since the pandemic.   \nStrong growth with no meaningful signs of  new price pressures highlights the \nimportant role favorable supply  developments have played so far in the recovery. One \nof these developments has been an expansion of  labor supply, which came, in part, \nfrom a larger than expected in crease in labor force participation. Interestingly, as Figure \n8 shows, this rise has occurred across gender (as shown on the left) and racial/ethnic \ngroups (as shown on the right).  Although not shown, increased immigration was also a \nmajor contributor to this expansion in labor supply. There is work underway – and to be \ndone – to better understand these developments, their implications and the extent to \nwhich they are likely to persist.   \nAnother positive supply development has been a notable rise in labor \nproductivity. Figure 9  shows one such measure – r eal output per hour for the \nnonfinancial corporate se ctor. The initial surge in labor productivity reflected the sharp \ndrop in employment early in the pandemic , which was followed by severe labor \n \n2 Trend output growth from 2015-19 is assumed to be 1.9 percent based on the median longer-run \nprojection for GDP growth from the December 2019 FOMC Projection materials. \n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery \nEMBARGOED UNTIL 4:00 P.M U.S. Eastern Time, \nWednesday, November 20, 2024 – OR UPON DELIVERY \n \n6 \n shortages that were partially reversed when firms were able to replenish their \nworkforces. Still, even after the catch-up in employment, productivity remains on a \nhigher trend than it was before the pandemic. Notably, other advanc ed economies have \nnot experienced the same favorabl e productivity developments.   \nA number of reasons have been cited to pot entially explain the strength in U.S. \nlabor productivity. First, so me firms learned to do more wit h fewer workers by investing \nin labor-saving technologies and re structuring aspects of production. Figure 10  \nhighlights some sectors where this seems likely to have occurred. For professional and \nbusiness services, productivity gains do not seem  to be slowing much. But it is possible \nthat some of these level improvements are now behind us , so that productivity may \nrevert to previous trends. This could be t he case in sectors such as healthcare and \nleisure and hospitality, s hown on the right.     \nHowever, other developments could prove more persistent. In particular, there \nhas been a surge in new business formation since 2020, as shown in Figure 11 . This is \na promising development that is in stark contrast to what has been described as the \n“broad-based slowdown in U.S. business dynamism from 1970 to 2020.” Indeed, the \nentry and dynamics of new firms has been show n to be a “significant driver of job \ncreation, innovation a nd productivity growth.”3 Finally, A.I. could be behind some of \nthese improvements. In my view , however, the overall impact of A.I. at this point is still \nlikely to be small but could incr ease meaningfully going forward.4  \nImportantly, given the labor productivity improvements to date, I see little scope \nfor wages to disrupt the ongoing disinflati on progress. Indeed, analysis by my staff \nshows that labor remains relatively inexpens ive, given recent productivity gains and \n \n3 See “The Recent Rise in US Labor Productivity” by Luke Pardue, published by the Aspen Economic \nStrategy Group of the Aspen Institute ( Labor Productivity In Brief)  \n4 For a discussion of the potential impact of A.I. on the economy see the proceedings from the recent \nAtlanta Fed Conference on Technology Enabled Disruption, available at \nhttps://www.atlantafed.org/news/c onferences-and-e vents/conferen ces/2024/10/01/technology-enabled-\ndisruption/agenda . \n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery \nEMBARGOED UNTIL 4:00 P.M U.S. Eastern Time, \nWednesday, November 20, 2024 – OR UPON DELIVERY \n \n7 \n price developments. Ther efore, even though wages are gr owing faster than they were \nbefore the pandemic, this is not plac ing additional pressures on inflation.5  \nWith many workers still grappl ing with the effects of hi gh prices, preserving the \ncurrent favorable conditions also means main taining an environment in which they can \ncontinue to see increases in the purchasing power of their wages and improvements in \ntheir economic well-being. This is one r eason why restoring and sustaining price \nstability is so important.    \n \nMonetary Policy and the Balance of Risks  \nAgainst this backdrop, it was appropriate  to begin recalibrating monetary policy \nthis fall. I expect additional adjustments will like ly be appropriate over time, to move the \npolicy rate gradually from its current restri ctive stance back into a more neutral range. \nHowever, policy is not on a pre-set pat h. The FOMC will need to make decisions \nmeeting-by-meeting, based on t he data available at the time and their implications for \nthe economic outlook and the evolving balance of risks. I will close this section of my \nremarks by saying a bit mo re about my thinking here. \nFigure 12  shows the path of the federal funds rate, with the left side giving \nhistorical context. The panel on the right fo cuses on the recent period, in which the \nFOMC increased the rate rapidly, from essent ially zero in 2022 to 5½ percent in July \n2023, then held the rate at that level for 16 months before cutting by 50 basis points in \nSeptember, and another 25 ear lier this month.   \n  Restrictive monetary policy has clearly been one factor helping to rein in inflation.  \nCombined with the supply improvements I have already mentioned, it has played a role \n \n5 For recent analyses on this topic, see Is Post-pandemic Wage Growth Fueling Inflation? - Federal \nReserve Bank of Boston (bostonfed.org) , and Productivity Improvements and Markup Normalization Can \nSupport Further Wage Gains without  Inflationary Pressures - Federal Reserve Bank of Boston \n(bostonfed.org) . \n \n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery \nEMBARGOED UNTIL 4:00 P.M U.S. Eastern Time, \nWednesday, November 20, 2024 – OR UPON DELIVERY \n \n8 \n in rebalancing demand with suppl y, reducing pressure on wages and prices. However, \nas I have also discussed, the overall effects from restrictive policy on the labor market \nand real economic activity have been relatively modest so far.   \nOne reason for this has to do with factor s unique to the pandemic recovery that \nstrengthened the financial positions of households and firms. The left panel of Figure \n13 shows how pandemic-era household suppor t programs, combined with limited \nspending opportunities when much of t he economy was shut down, led to the \naccumulation of significant amounts of extr a savings, as shown by the red line. In \naddition, many firms were able to lock in longer-term debt at  very favorable rates. As \nshown in the right-hand panel, corporate ca sh holdings increased notably. These \ndevelopments likely provided some cushion from the full effects of high interest rates.   \nBut Figure 13 also makes clear that thes e special buffers have waned. Most of \nthe excess household savings are now deplet ed. And though still elevated, corporate \ncash holdings have fallen notably.   \nGiven these developments, monetary policy needs to adjust in order to achieve \nour dual mandate goals. While the final desti nation is uncertain, I believe some \nadditional policy easing is needed, as poli cy currently remains at least somewhat \nrestrictive. The intent is not to ease too quickly or too much, hindering the disinflation \nprogress to date. At the same  time, easing too slowly or too little could unnecessarily \nweaken the labor market. \nImportantly, there are risks to achievin g both our inflation and our employment \ngoals. On the inflation side, demand has been surprisingly resilient, and we could see \nmore consumption growth than anticipated, putting upward pressure on prices. Indeed, \nhousehold net worth remains quite elevat ed, and equity prices have generally moved \nhigher recently. Households may also be more  inclined to access the equity in their \nhomes as interest rates decline.    \nOn the other hand, as I have mentioned, jo b growth is moderating, with recent \ngains concentrated in just a few sectors. At  this stage, any further slowing in hiring \n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery \nEMBARGOED UNTIL 4:00 P.M U.S. Eastern Time, \nWednesday, November 20, 2024 – OR UPON DELIVERY \n \n9 \n would be undesirable. In addition, an ec onomy growing near trend may be more \nvulnerable to adverse shocks – and geopolitical risks remain elevated.  \nAll told, I see the risks to my quite fa vorable baseline outlook as roughly in \nbalance. Inflation is returning sustainably, if  unevenly, to 2 percent, and to date, labor \nmarket conditions are healthy overall. Poli cy is well-positioned to deal with two-sided \nrisks and achieve our dual mandate goals in a reasonable amount of time. The policy \nadjustments made so far enable the FOMC to  be careful and deliberate going forward, \ntaking the time to holistically assess implic ations of the availabl e data for the outlook \nand the associated balance of risks. \n The Federal Reserve: Serving the P ublic in a Variety of Ways   \n  As noted at the outset, I would like to  round out my discussion of the economy \nand monetary policy with some perspectives on the Fed itself – focusing on the Boston \nReserve Bank.  \n  I know that the Federal Reserve – and central banking more generally – can \nseem a bit mysterious. In fact , my colleagues and I are eager for the American public to \nknow about and have confidence in the work we do. So, I’ll say a bit about our structure, \ngrounding, roles, and the breadth of work in our portfolio. \n  The Federal Reserve’s design is unique, emphasizing the wide range of \nstakeholders and regions in our economy, and the range of perspectives needed to \nsupport it. As you see in Figure 14 , our federated structure has 12 regional Reserve \nbanks, representing every par t of the country, and the Board of Governors in \nWashington. And our senior policym akers are appointed to their roles\n6 in different ways. \n \n6 The seven Governors are nominated by the Presiden t of the United States subject to the advice and \nconsent of the Senate. One governor is additionally nominated to be chair, one to be vice chair, and one \nto be vice chair for bank supervision. The 12 presid ents of the regional Reserve Banks are selected by \nthe non-banker members of the boards of directors of each Reserve Bank , with the approval of the Board \nof Governors. The Federal Open Market Committee, or FOMC, sets U.S. monetary policy. The 12 voting \n \n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery \nEMBARGOED UNTIL 4:00 P.M U.S. Eastern Time, \nWednesday, November 20, 2024 – OR UPON DELIVERY \n \n10 \n All of this makes the Fed r epresentative of the country, appropriately accountable, and \nalso independent enough to make hard choice s in the longer-term public interest. \n  Congress created the Feder al Reserve and gave us the mandates to guide our \nmonetary policy responsibilities,  as I noted earlier. One of t he things my colleagues and \nI find inspiring about our Congressional mandat es, and more broadly our role in serving \nthe public, is the fact that our mission and mandate are for the public – for all the \nAmerican public. At the Boston Fed, our vision is “A vibrant economy that works for all.”7  \n  To do all of this, we have a variety of  roles and responsibilities. I’ve discussed \nmonetary policy, where our contributions are rooted in extensive, and very rigorous, \nresearch and analysis. Our researchers also do important work on various aspects of \nthe economy. I have already mentioned our analysis concluding that, given recent \nproductivity Improvements, t here is room for further wa ge gains without inflationary \npressures. A second example is our resear ch on aspects of the housing challenges so \nprevalent in New England, and across the nation.8 A third is reflected in the topic of our \n68th Economic Conference, held just last week , on the future of finance. The conference \nlooked at the implications of  technological innovation fo r small businesses, financial \ninclusion, financial stability and more; and considering both the promise and the \nchallenges.9  \n  In addition to rigorous work with quantitat ive data, we also put a strong emphasis \non understanding how different people and pl aces experience the economy. Pursuing \n \nmembers include the seven members of the Board of Governors; the president of the Federal Reserve \nBank of New York; and four of the remaining 11 Reserve Bank presidents, who serve one-year terms on \na rotating basis. The remaining seven Reserve Bank presidents attend FOMC meetings and participate in \nFOMC deliberations.

Pursuing the mandate for maximum \nemployment requires us to understand not just national aggr egates (such as aggregate \nunemployment, and national job openings), but al so the different outcomes for various \npeople and places. \n  While I always immerse myself in economic data, I complement this with \nconversations across the economy’s stak eholders, and some examples of these \ninteractions are shown on Figure 15 . It is very valuable to hear how people are \nexperiencing the economy, so I meet with business owners, entrepreneurs and \ninnovators, workers, advocates, bankers, educ ators, and a host of others. We meet in \nrural New England, suburbs, downtowns, fo rmer mill towns – in areas where former \nengines of the local economy have declined or  gone away, as well as areas that are \nthriving. \n  The Fed has other roles in its portfo lio, reflecting the importance banks and the \nfinancial system have to the economy’s health and the public good. We supervise some \nof the region’s financial instit utions for safety and soundness.10 In addition, our team \nresearches and analyzes financial stability pre ssures, and it extends credit to depository \ninstitutions to promote t he smooth functioning of the payment system and help relieve \nliquidity strains in the banking system. \n  The Fed also supports the infrastructu re for the payments transactions we all \nmake and receive, and that fi rms and financial institutions rely on to be secure, reliable, \nand resilient.

It’s the first new payments \nplatform built by the Fed in nearly 50 years, bringing the immediacy we all now expect in \nour lives to payments. Indi viduals and businesses whose fi nancial institutions adopt the \nservice can send and receive instant pay ments any time, with immediate funds \navailability.12 \n  Finally, I’ll mention the Fed’s suppor t for community economic development. We \nconduct research to help illuminate cha llenges and opportunities, and we help as a \nconvener and catalyst for collaboration across sectors.13 We’ve found that local people \nand institutions, collaborating on shared ch allenges, holds the best potential for \nprogress in addressing challenges to local economic resurgence. \n  One of the things we’re proud of is illuminating, in a rigorous and nonpartisan \nway, issues that have a profound effect on people’s experience of the economy and \ntheir ability to participate in it.

U.S. Eastern Time , \nThursday, January 19, 202 3 – OR UPON DELIVERY  \n\n \n   \nKey Takeaways  \n1. Restoring price stability remains the imperative for monetary policymakers, and there is more \nwork to do.   I anticipate the need for further rate increases, perhaps at a slower pace, depending on \nincoming data, before holding rates at a sufficiently restrictive level for some time.  More measured rate \nadjustments will better enable us to address the competing risks that monetary policy now faces.  \n2. While realistic about the risks and uncertainties, I remain reasonably optimistic that the re is a \npathway to reducing inflation without  a significant economic downturn. I see ongoing resilience in \nthe economy, evidenced by many firms’ continued hiring plans , and household and business spending that \nis holding up relatively well.   \n3. New England’s economy has many strengths to nurture, and some key challenges to address. \nThis is an opportunity to take stock , look ahead, and assess long- term trajectories, opportunities, and \nimperatives – especially related to the availability of both work ers and housing.  \n4. The Fed’s mandate and mission involve an economy with opportunities for all – but outcomes \npersistently  differ in certain places, and for certain people or groups. The region’s economy is \nhealthiest when it’s providing opportunities for all to contribute and prosper, not leaving some people and \nplaces behind. Today’s  conference will explore the challenges – and opportunities – presented by the post -\npandemic economy for New Englanders . \n5. Since 2014, the Boston Fed has been  leading  promising work focused on encouraging local \nefforts to find economic resurgence  – in smaller cities where manufacturing once flourished, and rural \nareas facing challenges. We call it the Working Places Challenge  – and the model is proving effective.  \n6. “Working Places” is based on research that showed a key to resilience , through waves of \neconomic change and challenge , is cross- sector collaboration among local individuals  willing to \ntake on shared leadership. The program  is structured as a competition for grant money (not from the Fed \nbut from the private sector, philanthropy, and states). Local leaders are building cross -sector vision  and \npriorities , and working on them together . It helps communities weave together many small individual \napproaches into one, coherent system – and then improve the system. The Fed hosts, convenes, and \nsupports  these efforts . \n7. Working Places helps the Fed encourage economic progress in local economies, grounded in \nour mission of a vibrant and  inclusive economy, and our mandate to achieve price stability and \nmaximum employment – for all not just some.  It is one example of strategic partnerships the Boston \nFed creates to improve New England’s economy. Like other community development efforts of the Boston \nFed, it complements our monetary policy, research, payments, and supervision work as we seek to fulfil l \nour mission and mandate.   \n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery  \nEMBARGOED UNTIL 9:10 AM on Thursday, January 19, 2003 – OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n1 \n  Good morning, and thank you for joining us. I want to thank  our organizers : my \ncolleagues at the Boston Fed’s New England Public Policy Center – part of our Research \ndepartment  – as well as our partners at the New England Economic Partnership, and the \nDonahue Institute  at the University of Massachusetts.  \n  This gathering provides an opportunity  to explore key aspects of the future of the N ew \nEngland economy, especially given the pandemic effects that are still with us , and still evolving.  \nIt is important to  study  the shifts we  are seeing – in work, commuting, housing, and economic \nactivity  – with an eye to navigating them  effectively , and ensuring a vibrant regional  economy \nwith opportunities for all.  \n  In my remarks , I’ll speak briefly about monetary policy, then touch on what I’ve seen in \nthe N ew England economy during my first six months in this role, and finally talk about an  \napproach we at the Fed have found helps local community efforts to coalesce around  \nchallenges , in support of  economic resurgence.  \n \nThe National Context: The Macroeconomy and Monetary Policy  \n  My comments about monetary policy and the national economy focus on recent \ndevelopments related to the Fed’s dual mandate of maximum sustained employment and price \nstability.  Of course , these comments are my own; I’m not speaking for my fellow  policymakers.   \n  With the inflation  rate well above the 2 percent target, the Federal Open Market \nCommittee (or FOMC) has been resolute in its  goal of restoring price stability  – raising interest \nrates aggressively  since last March . High inflation takes a toll on households, especially the \nmost vulnerable ones . And it complicates investment and planning decisions for firms. Price \nstability is essential for a well- functioning inclus ive economy that works for all, and for healthy \nlabor market conditions that are sustainable over time.  \n  We are starting to see some effects of the cumulative policy  actions the FOMC has \ntaken so far. Less demand ( from higher interest rates ), combined with lower input costs (from \neasing supply bottlenecks ), are contributing to notic eably  slower  inflation  for goods  – with the \nprice s for some goods  actually declining. These  development s, together with decreas ing energy \nprices, are at the root o f the inflation improvement  we saw in the last quarter  of 2022 . But \nhouseholds  consume far more services than goods , and services  inflation remains persistently \nhigh.  \n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery  \nEMBARGOED UNTIL 9:10 AM on Thursday, January 19, 2003 – OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n2 \n   A key piece of this has been s izeable increases in shelter costs. However , monetary \npolicy tightening has slowed new rent growth considerably, which should lead to a moderation in \nshelter inflation starting in the spring of this year. For services o utside of shelter, labor tends to \nbe the most important input  – so developments in this component of services inflation are \nultimately tied to the behavior of wages.  \n  Bringing labor market conditions into better balance will therefore be critical to achieving \nour inflation target . While labor market activity has show n some signs of moderating, there is \nstill a long way to go. Indeed, high job vacancies and “quit rates ” are signs that labor demand \nremains  strong.  And while the latest average hourly earnings data  suggest some softening of \nwage pressures, labor costs continue to grow more rapidly  than is consistent with 2 percent \ninflation.  (I’ll note that  workers  do not benefit from nominal wage gains  that are eroded by too -\nhigh inflation.  What matters for workers are gains in real wages. ) \n  While it is promising to see  the effects of higher rates starting to spread from the most \ninterest -sensitive sectors to the broader economy , more is required to ensure a steady path \ntoward our inflation  target . As monetary policymakers,  restoring price stability remains our \nimperative. Thus, I anticipate the need for  further rate i ncreases, likely to just  above 5 percent, \nand then holding rates at that level for some time.   \n  Now that rates are  in restrictive territory  and we may (based on current indicators) be \nnearing the peak , I believe it is appropriate to have shifted from the initial expeditious pace of \ntightening to  a slower pace – though appropriate policy  will, of course,  depend on a holistic \nreview of available data. More measured  rate adjustments in the current phase will better  \nenable us to  address the competing risks monetary policy now fac es – the risk that our actions \nmay be insufficient to restore price stability , versus the risk  that our actions may cause \nunnecessary losses in real activity and employment. I am well aware that, as with inflation, the \ncosts of higher unemployment are disproportionately borne by people of color and economically \nvulnerable groups.  \n  I’ll conclude my comments about monetary policy by noting that I continue to be what I \ncall a “realistic optimist.” The ongoing resilience of our economy –  from many firms continuing to \nincrease their payrolls, to business and household spending still holding up relatively well \ndespite an uncertain economic environment –  make me reasonably optimistic that there is a \npathway to reducing inflation without a significant economic downturn.  But I also recognize risks \n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery  \nEMBARGOED UNTIL 9:10 AM on Thursday, January 19, 2003 – OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n3 \n and uncertainties to that outlook, including the possibility of a more substantial downturn driven \nby a self -fulfilling loss of confidence in the economy.  \n  These are among the many considerations for both determining and communicating \nmonetary policy. I’ll shift now from national policy to some of the longer run opportunities and \nchallenges with a focus on New England – the Fed’s First District, which the Boston Fed serves .  \n \nNew England’s Economy… and the Issue of Gaps  \n  New England’s economy has many strengths to nurture, and some key challenges to \naddress. The conference  today provides  an opportunity to take stock , to look ahead, and to \nassess long- term trajectories, opportunities, and imperatives – especially around the availability \nof both work ers and housing.  \n  Some of the greatest strengths of New England can be found in our workforce,  and the \ninnovative institutions located here. Our workforce is among the most highly skilled and \neducated in the world.1 The region also hosts many organizations leading in healthcare, \ntechnology (including biotechnology ), clean energy, and higher education.2  \n  These enviable characteristics suggest  New England is favorably positioned for the \nfuture . I see the Fed’s mandat e and mission, however, as encompassing an economy with \nopportunities for all – not just those with advanced degrees , and not just the cities and towns \nthat are thriving. When we look across New England, we see places and communities that are \nnot fully participating in the region’s  overall  prosperity. For example,  some small cities , and rural \nareas with dwindling employment , struggle to sustain local schools and services.   \n  And we see some demographic groups –  particularly when looking by  race and ethnicity \n– with lower levels of income, wealth, and educational achievement  than their white and Asian \npeers.  For instance, students in New England perform better on math and reading tests than \nmost other states, but there are large gaps by race and income.3,4 And household incomes \ndiffer widely by race.5  \n  The region’s economy is healthiest when it is providing opportunities for all to participate, \ncontribute , and prosper , not leaving some people and places behind. As we head into a future of \nslowing population growth and likely continued labor challenges , we need the contributions  and \ncapabilities  of all communities and places across the region.  So this confe rence is timely and \n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery  \nEMBARGOED UNTIL 9:10 AM on Thursday, January 19, 2003 – OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n4 \n important, as we think together about the challenges – and opportunities – presented by the \npost-pandemic economy for people and places.  \n \nWorking Places: Local Successes from a Productive Model  \n  I’ll turn now to an effort the Boston Fed has been involved with for nearly a decade, \nbegun under the leadership of my predecessor, Eric Rosengren. Since 2014, staff here have \nfocused on encouraging local efforts to find economic resurgence in smaller cities and rural areas facing long- term struggles. We call it the Working Places Challenge.  \n  These places were once centers of the manufacturing and natural resource economies \nin New England. With the employment decline in those industries, many of these communities have st ruggled to reimagine and rebuild their economies. They face m yriad  challenges: aging \nhousing stock and infrastructure, a dwindling tax base, and often high rates of poverty. Of course, they also have strengths and potential.  \n  “Working Places” is based on research that showed the key to economic resilience, \nthrough waves of change and challenge, is cross -sector collaboration among local individuals \nwilling to take on shared leadership.\n6 This collaborative leadership seems to be the “secret \nsauce” in resurgent communities. The Working Places  model  helps it blossom.  \n  The program is structured as a competition for relatively modest grant money (not from \nthe Fed but rather from the private sector, philanthropy, and states). Local leaders –  now in 30 \ncommunities across 5 states –  are building cross -sector vision and prior ities, and working on \nthem  together . The Fed hosts, convenes, and supports  these efforts .  \n  It starts with teams choosing a shared goal for improving the economy that benefits low -\nincome people. Many teams focus on improving conditions and capabilities fo r the local \nworkforce, or  for locally owned businesses. If the independent jury  (not the Fed!)  selects a \ncommunity in the competition, that team receives several hundred thousand dollars over  three \nyears  (again, not from the Fed) , to use in  coordinat ing efforts and creat ing new interventions.  \n  I’ll share some examples :  \n The team in rural Lamoille County in northern Vermont is  newly focused on \nresponding to the need for housing voiced by low - and moderate -income residents \nand the employers in need of work ers. The county has low-income  areas of poverty  \n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery  \nEMBARGOED UNTIL 9:10 AM on Thursday, January 19, 2003 – OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n5 \n alongside higher income  and second- home communities associated with ski ing. The \nneed for housing is  made more acute by the influx of new residents –  many working \nelsewhere, remotely – and the growth of the short -term rental market, which \nsqueezes out long- term renters. Local s from a variety of sectors are working together \nto move the needle on housing,  by experimenting with novel approaches  such as \nextending water and sewer  infrastructure  to enable new development, and creating a \nlandlord liaison to facilitate  rental housing for local residents.    \n \n In East Hartford , Connecticut,  people across sectors saw the need to align job \nopportunities for local residents  with local employers ’ workfor ce needs . East Hartford \nis a diverse community . Compared to nearby towns and the state as a whole, it has  \nhigher poverty rates, more working poor, fewer with college degrees , and more \nfemale- led single -parent households. The Working Places team  focused on local-\nresident job training,  local recruiting and placement with major  employers, and \nsummer jobs for high school  student s.7  For example, the Professional Skills \nAcademy has now trained three cohorts of local residents for placement with local \nemployers,  in cooperation with a local college – including relatively well paid, career -\nladder jobs.  \n \n Lawrence, Massachusetts, once a textile manufacturing powerhouse, has been \none of the lowest -income cities in the Commonwealth for decades, with deteriorating \nservices and high rates of poverty. People in city government, nonprofits, the school \ndepartment, the community college, and local firms decided to focus on rais ing the \nincome prospects of parents with children in the public schools.  They provided job \ntraining and wraparound services for more than 600 parents , assisted 200 families \nwith job placement s (with  an average wage inc rease of 25 percent ), created new \ntraining pipelines with employers and the local community college,  and integrated \nsome long-term interventions into the school system, aimed at improving family well -\nbeing.8  \n   \n  In sum, w e see progress , and promise . Working Places  helps communities weave \ntogether many small individual approaches into one, coherent system  – and then improve the \n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery  \nEMBARGOED UNTIL 9:10 AM on Thursday, January 19, 2003 – OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n6 \n system.  It has been wonderful to see  relatively  limited  awards be followed by substantial private \nand public investment, capitalizing on new  cross- sector frameworks and creating new hubs of \neconomic activity. For example,  in Fitchburg, Massachusetts, work  by the  local team was a key \nfactor in  now more than $100 million in new investment downtown and in  surrounding \nneighborhoods. In Massachusetts, the  Executive Office of Economic and Housing Development \ncreated the Urban Agenda grant program , modeled partially on Working Places , which has now \ninvested in collaborative economic growth projects in over 50 communities over 5 years, \nincluding Lawrence – and a national funder9 created a small -city investment fund for follow -on \ninvestment.  \n  Independent outside evaluations cite progress such as  heightened involvement of \nanchor  institution s like educational  and health care organizations,  and other private employers ; \nevaluations also find city government spending more aligned with local  priorities.10 And from \n2011 to 2016, poverty dropped and high school graduation rates improved faster and more \ndramatically in our Round 1 winning “ working cities ” (Lawrence, Fitchburg, Holyoke, Chelsea) \nthan in the state as a whole a nd other similar cities.  \n   There are important lessons from Working Places. Complex issues cannot be solved by \none sector, one organization, or one person. Successful collaboration requires attention to \nprocess, and new voices at the table to expand insight . It requires the flexibility to seize \nopportunities – and to change  along the way, including admitting when efforts need to be \nrethought . A neutral, trusted convener can help.  The most successful Working Places teams \nhave robust community engagement, local government supporters , and an urgent shared \npurpose.  \n  While still unfolding, i t’s a great story  that deserv es to be told – and hopefully  replicated \nas well as studied.  \n \nConcluding Observations \n  The Working Places initiative helps the Fed encourage progress in local economies . It is  \ngrounded in our mission of a vibrant and inclusive economy, and our mandate to achieve price \nstability and maximum employment for all , not just some. Like other community development \nefforts of the Boston Fed, it complements our monetary policy, research,  payments, and \nsupervision work , as we seek to fulfil our mission and mandate.   \n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery  \nEMBARGOED UNTIL 9:10 AM on Thursday, January 19, 2003 – OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n7 \n   If we are to move toward a more inclusive economy over time,  the capacity for low -\nincome places to adapt to economic change, which Working Places supports, is ever more \nimpo rtant. This is particularly true in the context of the kinds of changes in housing and work we \nare discussing at today’s conference.  \n  I’ll conclude my remarks there. We have important topics to cover today, and some \nterrific experts to share their perspectives. I look forward to hearing from our panelists about shifting economic conditions , and invite moderator John Ballantine to begin that session. \n  A gain, thank you all for joining us  today.    \n \n \n \n1 Forty -seven percent of Massachusetts residents 25 and older hold a bachelor’s or advanced degree, the highest among states \n(although bested by Washington, D.C.).

Collins \nPresident & Chief Executive Officer \nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston \n \n \n2023 U.S. Monetary Policy Forum  \nsponsored by the Initiative  on Global Markets at the  \nUniversity of Chicago Booth School of Business \n \n \nFebruary 24, 2023 \n \nThe views expressed today are my own, not necessarily those of my colleagues on the \nFederal Reserve Board of Governors or  the Federal Open Market Committee.  \n \n                         \n   EMBARGOED UNTIL 1:30 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time,\nFriday, February 24, 2023 – OR UPON DELIVERY\n\n \n   \n  Key Takeaways:  \n1.  Inflation remains too high.  I anticipate further rate increases to reach a sufficiently restrictive level, then \nholding there for some, perhaps extended, time.  My views will continue to be based on a holistic assessment of available information.  And while aware of the risks and uncertainties, I remain optimistic there is a path to restoring price stability without a significant downturn. \n2.  The root of the inflation surprise was an imbalance between demand and supply.  During 2021-22, \nrealized demand exceeded supply, and forecasters were ov erly optimistic about supply recovering to meet \nthe increase in demand as the economy reopened.  The interaction of supply chain bottlenecks and \nconstraints to labor supply compounded the forecasting misses.  Supply chains were under strain due to \ncontinued bouts of COVID variants; and later, Russia’s war in Ukraine.  \n3.  My view is that, in 2021 – in the aftermath of the deep pandemic downturn, in the face of significant \ncontinued uncertainty, and with inflation expectations in a reasonable range – supporting the economy versus pre-empting an inflation surge that few were forecasting seemed a reasoned decision.   \n4.  Policy lessons from this still-evolving episode in clude that capacity constraints can lead to a less \nfavorable trade-off between inflation and unemployment – and this potentially has implications for the \nfuture conduct of monetary policy, as we at the Fed fulfill our dual mandate. Furthermore, I’ll observe that \nadditional wide-ranging indicators can be especially helpful for evaluating policy options in unusual \ncontexts. \n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery \nEMBARGOED UNTIL 1:30 PM on Friday, February 24, 2003 – OR UPON DELIVERY \n \n1 \n  \n It is a pleasure to be part of the 2023 Forum.  I’ll begin by noting that, of course, I speak \nonly for myself, not for colleagues at the Board of Governors or other Reserve Banks.  After some brief remarks about current monetary policy, I’ll turn to the important topic of this panel.   \nInflation remains too high, and recent data – including several strong labor market \nindicators, as well as faster than expected retail sales and producer price inflation – all reinforce my view that we have more work to do, to bring inflation down to the 2 percent target.  While optimistic there is a path to restoring price stability without a significant downturn, I am also well aware of the many risks and uncertainties, including the risk of a self-fulfilling loss of business \nand consumer confidence.   \n  Policy actions to date continue to demonstrate the committee’s resolve – and it is helpful \nto see further declines in longer term inflation expectations, consistent with the credibility of our commitment.  I anticipate further rate increases to reach a sufficiently restrictive level, and then \nholding there for some, perhaps extended, time.  My outlook and policy decisions will continue \nto be based on a holistic assessment of available information and rooted in pursuit of the Fed’s Congressional mandate for price stability and maximum employment. \nFew forecasters inside or outside the Fed anticipated the inflation surge that began in \nthe first half of 2021, as the economy reopened from the pandemic.  Indeed, for months, many – \nincluding the Fed – miscast how high, broad, and recalcitrant inflation would prove to be.  Fed \nactions to remove accommodation began in late 2021, with winding down asset purchases.  As this shifted to an asset run-off (from our balance sheet) that is still underway, the FOMC began raising rates in March 2022.  Since then, our unusually aggressive actions increased the federal \nfunds rate by four and a half percentage points in just nine months. These actions, along with \nthe ones I expect will be taken going forward, should bring inflation back down to target in a reasonable amount of time.   \nWhile I’ll say a bit more about recent policy, my remarks focus on the topic of this panel \n– why were the inflation forecast misses so large and persistent?  Examining the nature of the \nerrors is important and will help us improve policy going forward.  The following are key aspects \nof my current perspective, recognizing that this complex episode is still unfolding.   \n  \n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery \nEMBARGOED UNTIL 1:30 PM on Friday, February 24, 2003 – OR UPON DELIVERY \n \n2 \n The Miscast Inflation Forecast \nInflation has several determinants, but unsurprisingly, the root of the inflation surprise \nwas an imbalance between demand and supply.  Over the course of 2021 and 2022, realized \ndemand exceeded expectations while the opposite was true for supply, causing significant price \npressures and much higher-than-expected inflation.  I’ll highlight a few important factors. \nThe first relates to the behavior of consumption and gross domestic product (GDP), \nrelative to pre-pandemic trends.  Output fell suddenly and sharply in the pandemic, prompting \nstrongly accommodative monetary and fiscal policy actions (from the central bank and the \nfederal government, respectively). \nAs shown in Figure 1 , the rebound in demand was also quick, and especially so for \nconsumption.  Perhaps more focus on consumption rather than GDP would have helped forecasters better assess the implications of demand for consumer price inflation dynamics.\n1 \nBy early 2021, both GDP and consumption were above trend.  But although notable at \nroughly 3 percent, even the consumption gap was not that large by historical standards.  By itself, such a gap cannot account for most of the inflation surge. \nUnanticipated supply shortfalls that lowered capacity relative to pre-pandemic trends \nclearly had to play an important role in the supply-demand imbalance and in miscasting inflation.  \nMonetary policy, of course, cannot remedy supply disruptions.  But an understanding of supply conditions is central to assessing the economic context, developing the outlook, and \ndetermining appropriate policy.  And the FOMC does need to respond to supply-driven inflationary pressures that have the potential to un-anchor longer-run inflation expectations.\n2  \nThe errors in assessing the speed of the supply recovery were, for most policymakers \nand observers, large and persistent. There were certainly efforts then, which continue today, to better understand constraints on global supply chains and their impact on inflation.  The New \n \n1 The consumption basket includes domestic and impo rted goods and services so that both domestic and \ninternational developments will impact consumer pric e inflation dynamics.  However, much of the \nspending in the early stages of the recovery was on  imported goods, likely somewhat mitigating the initial \neffects on domestic prices.   \n2 See “Inflation levels and (in)attention,” by A nat Bracha and Jenny Tang, Federal Reserve Bank of \nBoston Working Paper 22-4 (2022), for details on how the relationship between inflation news and \ninflation expectations becomes stronger when inflation rates are high. \n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery \nEMBARGOED UNTIL 1:30 PM on Friday, February 24, 2003 – OR UPON DELIVERY \n \n3 \n York Fed’s Global Supply Chain Pressure Index ( Figure 2 ) is an example.3  Still, it is difficult to \nassess the extent and duration of supply challenges in real time – especially if they depend on pandemic developments and unexpected shocks such as Russia’s war in Ukraine.     \nAnother factor to consider is that the consumption recovery after the initial phase of the \npandemic was disproportionately concentrated in goods, rather than on service sector spending that required face-to-face interactions.  This pattern by itself was bound to create supply pressures, which were in turn amplified by pandemic-related constraints.  This dynamic is \nreflected in the chart ( Figure 3 ) showing the large increase in goods consumption and the surge \nin goods price inflation.  \nPerhaps equally notable is the fact that, despite the large drop in services consumption, \nthere was little decline in services price inflation ( Figure 4 ).  Here, the contrast with the \nexperience from the Great Recession – w hen the mild slowdown in consumption was \naccompanied by a noticeable deceleration in inflation – is instructive, and again suggests a key \nrole for supply constraints this time. \nSurprises on the inflation front continued in late 2021 and into 2022.  The expectation \nwas that, as the economy reopened, demand would shift back from goods to services, and \ngoods inflation would subside without a significant rise in service-sector inflation.  Supply – and \nmost notably labor  supply, since services tend to be labor intensive – would increase to meet \ndemand.  \nReality was a bit different.  Services consumption rose somewhat, without a material \ndecline in goods consumption.  This meant little relief to supply chains, which were also under \nsignificant strain due to continued global bouts of COVID variants and, later, Russia’s war in \nUkraine – thus keeping pressure on inflation.  \nMost importantly, the expected pickup in labor  supply to meet the increased services \ndemand has been taking much longer to materialize than expected, creating a demand-supply \ngap in the labor market that fueled wage and price inflation. \n \n \n3 See https://libertystreeteconomics.ne wyorkfed.org/2022/01/a-new-baro meter-of-global-supply-chain-\npressures/ . More broadly, there was an expansion of type s of information considered by policymakers, \nincluding an effort to better understand consumer behavior as the economy re-opened by using high-\nfrequency data on mobility and foot traffic, transportation,  dining, and hotel occupancy, among others.    \n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery \nEMBARGOED UNTIL 1:30 PM on Friday, February 24, 2003 – OR UPON DELIVERY \n \n4 \n There are several ways to think about the labor market imbalance.  One is illustrated in \nthis chart ( Figure 5 ), which compares the GDP recovery to the employment recovery, again \nusing pre-pandemic trends as benchmarks.  Although fast by historical standards, the \nemployment recovery was noticeably slower than the GDP recovery.4  Only near the end of \n2022 did the cyclical position of employment become more in line with GDP.  \nThe fact that employment took more time to recover than aggregate demand reflected a \nslower than expected recovery in labor supply, which caused fierce competition among firms for \navailable workers.  Given these unusual patterns, the unemployment rate has clearly not been a \nsufficient statistic for gauging labor market conditions.       \n Just before the pandemic, infl ation was seemingly stuck below  the 2 percent target, with \nan unemployment rate at similarly low levels.  Perhaps more weight should have been placed on indicators such as quits and vacancies – but their possible superiority as measures of labor \nmarket tightness relative to the unemployment rate was not clear from past experience. \nAgain, the pandemic was uncharted territory for forecasters and policymakers alike, and \nthere was little reason to expect an accurate real-time read on how much, for example, fear of Covid and remote education arrangements would affect labor supply decisions, especially given \nall the uncertainty associated with the pandemic’s evolution.\n5     \nIn sum, an important reason for underpredicting inflation was that forecasters were \noverly optimistic about supply recovering to meet the increase in demand as the economy \nreopened.  The fact that both supply chain bottlenecks and constraints to labor supply were \noperating at the same time compounded the forecasting errors.   \n \nMonetary Policy in Real Time \nMy comments so far have highlighted the importance of supply constraints in generating \nhigh, unexpected inflation during the pandemic recovery.  I’ve noted that there is little the Fed \n \n4 On this point, see also “A new interpretation of pr oductivity growth dynamics in the pre-pandemic and \npandemic era U.S. economy, 1950-2022” by Robert J. Gordon and Hassan Sayed, NBER working paper \n30267 (2022). \n \n5 Incidentally, I will note here that it was also difficult  to predict that the pandemic would lead to increased \ndemand for residential space, stemming from remote work, which in turn resulted in higher house prices \nand rents.  \n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery \nEMBARGOED UNTIL 1:30 PM on Friday, February 24, 2003 – OR UPON DELIVERY \n \n5 \n can do to alleviate supply challenges, but that policy should lean against supply-driven inflation \nthat risks un-anchoring longer-run inflation expe ctations.  In particular, a temporary but \npersistent  dislocation can increase such a risk.    \nIt is also clear from my previous comments and charts that demand played a role in the \ninflation rise as well.6  One question, then, is whether monetary policy should have tightened \nearlier to reduce the risk of un-anchoring inflation expectations and to offset the demand increase.  \nSome may say that policy was too accommodative in the first place.  In my view, such a \nstatement ignores the real time concerns created by the pandemic; the associated risk \nmanagement required; and the difficulty of inferr ing, in real time, how quickly adverse supply \nshocks would unwind. \nWhile not involved in policy decisions until becoming Boston Fed President in July 2022, \nI was a keen policy observer.  I agree with Chair Powell and other colleagues who have stated \nthat, with the benefit of hindsight, policy could have been tightened sooner.  But to me in 2021, in the aftermath of the deep pandemic downturn, in the face of significant continued uncertainty, and with inflation expectations in a reasonable range, supporting the economy versus pre-\nempting an inflation surge that few were forecasting seemed a reasoned decision.  I’ll note that \nmy view was not predicated on the 2020 revisions to the Fed’s policy framework.  \nWould earlier rate increases have significantly helped reduce inflation pressures?  That \ndepends on how early and how quickly the Fed would have moved.  In my view, given the significant uncertainty that continued to surround the pandemic, earlier action by the Fed may \nhave been less aggressive, taking longer to reach a restrictive range.  \n Where Are We Now?   \nWhile the misses in inflation were large, key aspects of prior forecasts are playing out, \nalbeit with a lag.  With improvements on the supply side – both in terms of supply chains and, to \n \n6 For a decomposition of inflation into demand- and supply-driven components, see “How much do supply \nand demand drive inflation?” by Adam H. Shapiro, Fe deral Reserve Bank of San Francisco Economic \nLetter (June 21, 2022) and “Are the Demand and Supply Channels of Inflation Persistent? Evidence from \na Novel Decomposition of PCE Inflation” by Viache slav Sheremirov, Federal Reserve Bank of Boston \nCurrent Policy Perspectives (2022).   \n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery \nEMBARGOED UNTIL 1:30 PM on Friday, February 24, 2003 – OR UPON DELIVERY \n \n6 \n some degree, labor supply – we are now seeing initial signs of deceleration in goods-price and \nwage inflation. These improvements took longer than expected to materialize but do appear to be providing some relief to inflation.  \nIn addition, despite the risk of longer-run inflation expectations becoming un-anchored, \nthey have remained in check throughout this period.  And now that policy is in restrictive territory, the process of realigning demand with supply is underway.   \n \nSome Policy Lessons \nThere are several important policy issues to be studied from this still-evolving episode.  I \noffer a partial list and reiterate that these are my views alone. \nThe belief that inflation dynamics during the pandemic recovery would remain similar to \nthe 1996-2019 period was too optimistic.  Thus, forecasters likely underestimated implications of \nexcessively strong labor markets for wages and prices.  And especially when unemployment is \nlow, it is clear that labor market tightness is best assessed with a broad range of indicators.   \nReliance on a small trade-off between inflation and unemployment – that is, on a linear \nand flat Phillips curve even at low unemployment rates – implied more willingness to risk \nprobing down on the unemployment rate than may have been warranted.  Recent experience \nsuggests that capacity constraints can lead to a nonlinear Phillips curve with a higher slope at low unemployment rate levels. This less favorable trade-off between inflation and unemployment has implications for how best to probe going forward, as we at the Fed fulfill our dual mandate.  \nUltimately, the nature of the pandemic represented unchartered waters for policymakers, \nand as I have argued, supply factors played an important role.  Indeed, there may be a somewhat stronger case than previously thought for taking out insurance against adverse inflation outcomes, with policy tightening, when there is the risk of supply constraints being \nbinding.  Moreover, we have learned that additional, wide ranging, indicators may be helpful for \nevaluating if there is a need for preemptive policy in these contexts.     \nIn sum, I believe a collective dose of humility and openness is appropriate, as we focus \non all we can learn from studying this episode.  I am pleased to see that work well underway, including at the Fed and through discussions such as this panel.",

Collins  \nPresident & Chief Executive Officer  \nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston  \n  \nAt the 39th Annual NABE Economic Policy Conference  \n  \n \nMarch 30, 2023 \n \nThe views expressed today are my own, not necessarily those of my colleagues on the \nFederal Reserve Board of Governors or the Federal Open Market Committee.   \n \n                         \n   Remarks as Prepared for Delivery  \nEMBARGOED UNTIL 12:45 P.M U.S. Eastern Time,  \nThursday, March 30, 202 3 – OR UPON DELIVERY  \n\n \n   \n  Key Takeaways  \n1. Financial stability : The banking system is strong and resilient, with well -capitalized \ninstitutions and ample liquidity. Recent difficulties, and the decisive actions taken in \nresponse, demonstrate commitment to use all our tools to ensure the financial system \nremains safe and sound, and to take action as needed. The lessons learned from the \nreview underway will be welcome, and instructive.  \n2. Monetary policy and the macroeconomic outlook : Recent data show that inflation is still \ntoo high, continuing to take a toll on households and firms. I anticipate that some additional \npolicy tightening will be needed as we follow through on our commitment to price stability. \nHowever, while recognizing the risks and uncertainties to the outlook, I remain optimistic \nthere is a path t o bringing inflation down without a significant downturn, because of the \nresilience I see in the economy.   \n3. Financial infrastructure and payments services:  The Fed provides essential financial \ninfrastructure the economy depends on – and innovates to meet evolving needs and \npreferences. In today’s world, people want quick and easy ways to make payments \ninstantly, with immediate access to those funds. To help financial institutions offer instant payment services to their customers around the clock, we will launch the FedNow\nSM \nService in July.  \n4. Community economic development and opportunity:  While the Fed’s activities are \nbroad, they all relate to supporting a vibrant and inclusive economy, consistent with our \nmandates – stable prices and maximum employment. That’s why, for example, we have for \ndecades studied the gaps and disparities behind the aggregates. It is also why the Boston \nFed is helping spark collaboration among the private, public, nonprofit, and philanthropic \nsectors, to find local solutions to complex economic problems in urban and rural areas.  \n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery  \nEMBARGOED UNTIL 12:45 P.M U.S. Eastern Time,  \nThursday, March 30, 2023 –  OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n1 \n Good afternoon. It is truly a pleasure to be with you today. I thank NABE for the \ninvitation, and Elaine Buckberg for moderating the discussion.  \nMy thanks to all of you, for being here, and for the work you do – using the tools \nand insights from economics  to support your organizations, and our economy.  \nBy way of introduction, I am honored to serve as an economic policymaker at the \nFederal Reserve. It is a privilege, a responsibility, and an opportunity –  and I am \ncommitted to an inclusive approach to serv ice in the public interest.  \nBefore turning to questions, I will share some perspectives from my first nine \nmonths as a Fed president and Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) participant. I’ll \ncover some obvious topics (financial stability, monetary policy , and the macroeconomy). \nI’ll also touch very briefly on some things about the Fed that get less attention (including payments infrastructure and supporting economic resurgence). When you think about \nthe economy – as those in this room do, all the time –  recognizing the breadth of the \nFed’s work is important, because it all connects to our mandate and mission, and to our overarching goal of a vibrant, inclusive economy with opportunities for all.  \nFirst, I’ll give my standard disclaimer: These perspectives are my own. I am not \nspeaking for any other Federal Reserve policymakers.  \n Monetary Policy, and the Macroeconomic Outlook  \nInflation remains too high, and recent indicators reinforce my view that there is \nmore work to do, to bring inflation down to the 2 percent target associated with price \nstability. I’ll say more about why  this is so important, in a moment.  \nOur banking system is strong and resilient, with well -capitalized institutions and \nample liquidity. The banking industry plays an important role in the economy –  banks of \nall sizes are important for meeting saving and credit needs across communities. However, recent bank failures underscore how difficulties in just a few institutions have \nthe potential to undermine confidence in the entire banking sys tem.   \nThe Federal Reserve, in concert with the Treasury and FDIC, took decisive \nactions to strengthen the public’s confidence in the U.S. banking system and to protect \nthe U.S. economy. I note that while these actions assisted depositors of the failed \n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery  \nEMBARGOED UNTIL 12:45 P.M U.S. Eastern Time,  \nThursday, March 30, 2023 – OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n2 \n banks, shareholders and certain unsecured debt holders were not protected, and the \nbanks’ senior management were removed. Vice Chair Barr has a comprehensive review \nunderway to determine what went wrong and whether changes are needed. We will \ntake what is lea rned to heart and strengthen practices accordingly – consistent with our \nmission to ensure a safe, sound, and stable banking system supporting a healthy economy for all.\n1 \nThe Federal Reserve continues to monitor financial conditions closely, and is \nprepar ed to use all tools at its disposal in keeping the banking system safe and sound.  \nI will now turn to monetary policy, mindful of course that challenges to financial \nstability – and credit conditions generally – have implications for the macroeconomy and \nby extension, for policy.  \nIn March of last year, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) began \nraising interest rates to bring inflation down. But despite progress, inflation remains too high, and there is more work to do to restore price stability.  \nWhy is the inflation fight so important? The starting place is the Fed’s dual \nmandate from Congress, for price stability and maximum employment – representing \nstrong and stable economic conditions that benefit everyone.  \nHigh inflation creates hardship for all, particularly those at the lower end of the \nincome distribution who can least afford price increases – especially for essentials such \n \n1 See the Joint Statement describing “actions enabling the FDIC to complete its resolution of Silicon \nValley Bank…in a manner that fully protects all depositors,” emphasizing “No losses associated with the \nresolution of Silicon Valley Bank will be borne by the taxpayer”, and continuing “We are also announcing a similar systemic risk exception for Signature Bank … which was closed today by its state chartering authority. All depositors of this institution will be made whole. As with the resolution of Silicon Valley Bank, no losses will be borne by the taxpayer. Shareholders and certain unsecured debtholders will not be protected. Senior management has also been removed. Any losses to the Deposit Insurance Fund to \nsupport uninsured depositors will be recovered by a special assessment on banks, as required by law. \nFinally, the Federal Reserve Board on Sunday announced it will make available additional funding to eligible depository institutions to help assure banks have the ability to meet the needs of all their depositors.” ( https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20230312b.htm\n). Also \nnote the announcements that Vice Chair for Supervision Michael Barr is leading a review of the supervision and regulation of Silicon Valley Bank, in light of its failure \n(\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/bcreg20230313a.htm ), and of coordinated \ncentral bank action to enhance the provision of U.S. dollar liquidity \n(https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20230319a.htm ). \n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery  \nEMBARGOED UNTIL 12:45 P.M U.S. Eastern Time,  \nThursday, March 30, 2023 –  OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n3 \n as food, housing, and transportation. Inflation also complicates investment and planning \ndecisions for firms throughout the  economy.  \nI lead the Fed’s First District, which covers most of New England, and as I meet \nwith constituents, many highlight the challenges they face from inflation. In Vermont \nearlier this month, I heard from small business owners ending projects due to cost \nincreases, parents having to take on second jobs given rising prices on necessities, and \npeople unable to accept attractive jobs because living costs are rising too fast where the \njob is located.    \nImportantly, the two dimensions of the Fed’s mandate – price stability and \nmaximum employment –  are intertwined. Low, predictable inflation is an important \nprecondition for maximum employment that is sustainable over time. Price stability is essential for a well -functioning economy and labor market.  \nInflati on reflects a gap between demand and supply, resulting in pressures that \nfuel wage and price increases. In raising interest rates, the Fed intends to slow demand, \ncool a still- hot labor market, and bring demand and supply back into sustainable \nalignment.   \nSince March, the FOMC raised rates from near zero to the range of 4.75 to 5 \npercent. After initial, expeditious moves, recent increments have been small and deliberate – which in my view is appropriate as we approach a level that is sufficiently \nrestricti ve.    \nThe recent data show signs of more underlying strength in the economy than \nmany anticipated. The unemployment rate remains at historically low levels, job growth remains robust, and spending indicators through February were stronger than expected. \nThis strength might reflect the fact that policy did not enter fully restrictive territory until \nthe second half of 2022, and it may be too soon to see its full effects on real activity.  \nBut special factors may also have limited the impact of policy action s thus far, \nrelative to historic norms. On the household side, a sizable amount of “excess” savings accumulated during the pandemic remains – although this is less evident at the lower \nend of the income distribution, where some signs of stress are emerging. On the firm \n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery  \nEMBARGOED UNTIL 12:45 P.M U.S. Eastern Time,  \nThursday, March 30, 2023 –  OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n4 \n side, balance sheets also remain quite strong overall, limiting the need for external \nfinance.  \nSustained household and business spending, and limited pickup in labor supply, \nhelp explain why the labor market remains robust. But there are some emerging signs \nof slowing labor demand. In particular, a large portion of the recent strength in payrolls \ncomes from sectors that were hit especially hard early in the pandemic –  such as leisure \nand accommodation, and health care – and faced significant hiring challenges in the \nrecovery. As this “catching up” process ends, I expect more moderation in hiring, which \nshould help to relieve wage pressures.2 Here, it is important to note that workers do not \nbenefit from nominal  wage gains that are eroded by too -high inflation –  what matters for \nworkers are gains in real  wages.  \nWhile we may be seeing some initial signs of wage moderation, more will be \nneeded for a sustained improvement in price inflation. In determining whether inflation is \nmoving toward tar get in a reasonable amount of time, it is informative to look separately \nat three key components.  \n First, core goods  price inflation has slowed, but a full passthrough of supply chain \nimprovements and lower input costs to goods prices will take more time.  \n Second, shelter  inflation remains quite high. Slowing growth in new rents (with \nactual declines in some areas for rents and house prices) should feed through into lower shelter inflation in the coming quarters.  \n But, third, services inflation excluding shelter, which tends to be closely tied to \nlabor costs, remains particularly elevated and will require wage pressures  to \nease more.   \n \n2 The recent slowdown in job quits is another potential sign of slowing labor demand. In addition, cross -\nstate data suggest that wage inflation tends to be more strongly correlated with quits than vacancies, \nimplying that the slowdown in quits may help to ease wage pressures despite vacancies remaining \nelevated.  Wage inflation, however, also continues to be highly correlated with unemployment, suggesting \nthat at least some rise in unemployment rate will be needed to bring about a more significant decline in \nwage growth.   \n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery  \nEMBARGOED UNTIL 12:45 P.M U.S. Eastern Time,  \nThursday, March 30, 2023 – OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n5 \n In all, the challenge ahead lies in determining the level and path of the federal \nfunds rate to bring inflation back to target in a reasonable amount of time, without undue \nlabor market disruptions.  \nAs I noted earlier, recent financial sector stress has added to this challenge by \nincreasing the uncertainty around appropriate monetary policy. While the banking \nsystem remains strong and resilient, recent developments will likely lead banks to take a \nsomewhat more conservative outlook and tighten lending standards, thus contributing to \nslowing the economy and reducing inflationary pressures. These developments may \npartially offset the need for additional rate increases.  \nWhile recognizing the heightened uncertainty, I believe staying the cours e with a \none-quarter -percent increase in the policy rate at last week’s FOMC meeting was \nappropriate. Similarly, given current information, I see the median federal funds rate path for 2023 in last week’s Summary of Economic Projections  from Fed policymakers \n(the SEP)\n3 as reasonably balancing the risk of monetary policy not being restrictive \nenough to bring inflation down, and the risk that activity slows by more than needed to \naddress elevated price pressures.  \nSimilar to the SEP median, I currently anticipate some modest additional policy \ntightening, and then holding through the end of this year. Of course, I’ll be carefully \nwatching a range of indicators including data on inflation, spending, labor markets, and \nfinancial conditions.  \nOverall, I continue to be what I call a “realistic optimist.” I am well aware of the \nmany risks and uncertainties facing our economy – including the risk of a self -fulfilling \nloss in business and consumer confidence.  However, I’ve also mentioned reasons to be optimistic the economy may prove more resilient to tight financial conditions than in \nthe past – including business and household fundamentals that remain relatively strong. \nSo, I am still optimistic there is a path to bringing down inflation without a significant economi c downturn.   \n \n3 https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/fomcprojtabl20230322.pdf  \n \n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery  \nEMBARGOED UNTIL 12:45 P.M U.S. Eastern Time,  \nThursday, March 30, 2023 – OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n6 \n A Range of Activities in Support of a Vibrant Economy  \nAs I mentioned at the outset, I want to touch briefly on some things the Fed does, \nthat get less attention. In my view, understanding the breadth of the Fed’s work is \nimportant because I see the Fed’s mission as fostering a vibrant, resilient, inclusive \neconomy; and we do that in a wider range of ways than most people realize – from \nmonetary policy, to economic research, financial stability efforts, community \ndevelopment activities, and initiatives related to payments, technology, and finance. I \nwill be happy to elaborate during the discussion, but for now I’ll just mention two \ninitiatives that show the breadth and depth of the Boston Fed’s commitment to a strong, \ninclusive economy with opportunities for all.  \nFirst, the infrastructure for making and receiving payments is a foundation of \neveryone’s economic lives and our financial system. In today’s world, people \nincreasingly want quick and easy ways to make payments and immediate access to \nthose funds.  \nOn behalf of the Federal Reserve System, the Boston Fed has been leading the \nbuild of a new, real -time payments service, referred to as the FedNowSM Service .  \nLaunching in July, the infrastructure will provide access to instant paymen ts for \nparticipating financial institutions and their customers.  \nFedNow will offer real economic benefits to the American public, who will be able \nto send and receive instant payments safely and efficiently through participating \ninstitutions – giving greater flexibility to manage money at any time of the day or night, \n365 days  a year. We encourage financial institutions across the country join in the \nservice, so their customers can broadly enjoy the benefits of instant payments.4 \nSecond, for decades we have studied gaps and disparities in economic \noutcomes. This relates directly to our mandates from Congress, which include \nmaximum employment. Because unemployment rates that are persistently higher by \n \n4 Learn more at FedNowSM Explorer – Instant Payments Learning & Resources . \n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery  \nEMBARGOED UNTIL 12:45 P.M U.S. Eastern Time,  \nThursday, March 30, 2023 – OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n7 \n race, or by place – as they have been for a long time – reflect underutilization of our \ncountry’s labor resources, adversely affecting productivity and prosperity.  \nOne effort proving important in this regard is the Boston Fed’s Working Places \nprogram, which touches 30 urban and rural areas across New England. Research \nshows that the “secret sauce” in economic resurgence seems to be cross -sector \ncollaborative leadership from local people, working together to identify issues and solutions. The Fed’s role is to provide a framework for convening and for increasing \ncollaboration among the private sector, philanthropy, local organizations, state \ngovernment , and residents. The program supports efforts by local leaders to help their \nareas address challenges such as workforce development and affordable housing – and \nthe results are promising.\n5  \nI’ll conclude with a final observation. As I travel and hear about peoples’ \nexperiences, I’m struck by the opportunities and strengths in our economy, as well as \nthe challenges. Hearing from a wide range of  voices rounds out the economic data, \ndeepens our understanding, and helps us all make progress. My Fed colleagues and I will continue to prioritize this type of engagement, which is essential to our work.  \nWith that, I’ll be happy to discuss some questions , with Elaine.\n   \n \n \n5 In a January speech, I discussed the Working Places framework and local efforts to find economic \nresurgence in smaller cities and rural areas facing challenges. https://www.bostonfed.org/news -and-\nevents/speeches/2023/the- national -and-regional -economy -navigating- near-term- changes -and-long- term-\nchallenges.aspx",

Collins wanted her first visit to an educational institution as Boston Fed president to be at a \ncommunity  college  – because they provide affordable, accessible higher education to learners \nfrom all backgrounds.  Community colleges play a crucial role in helping students develop the \nnecessary skills to contribute in the economy of today and of the future.  It is essential that our \neconomy has opportunities for everyone to thrive, and that makes community colleges particularly important.   \n2. High inflation impacts everyone – and we need to make sure it does not become entrenched.  \nAn inflation rate that is low and predictable is needed for fostering conditions that promote a \nvibrant, resilient, and inclusive economy – and for maximum employment that is sustainable over \ntime. This is why it is so important to remain resolute in bringing inflation back down to the Fed’s 2 \npercent target in a reasonable amount of time.  \n3. While inflation is still too high, there are some promising signs of moderation.  Colli ns believes \nwe may be at, or near, the point where monetary policy can pause raising interest rates.  This will provide an opportunity to more fully assess the impact of the actions taken to date and the general tightening of credit conditions on economic activity.  However, it is important to make each policy decision based on a wholistic assessment of information available at the time.  \n4. Collins noted the breadth of ways the Fed advances its mission – e.g., providing back -end \ninfrastructure that underpins the financial system that people and organizations depend on; \nsupervising banks for safety, soundness, fair lending, and community reinvestment and serving \nas a “lender of last resort”; working to support community economic development and identify \nimpe diments to participation in the job market and economy; and conducting economic research \nand analysis to support monetary policymaking, in  pursuit of the dual mandate from Congress to \npromote price stability and maximum employment.  \n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery  \nEMBARGOED UNTIL 10:30  A.M U.S. Eastern Time,  \nThursday, Ma y 25, 2023 –  OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n1 \n  \nGood morning.  It is truly a pleasure to be here with you today, at CCRI, the \nCommunity College of Rhode Island.   \nSince I started in this job about 10 months ago, being out and meeting with \nstakeholders has been a key focus.  I like to say that the Fed’s overa rching mission is to \nfoster conditions supporting a vibrant, inclusive economy that works for all.  So it is \nessential for us to connect with and learn from people across the Boston Fed’s district \n(which is essentially New England) – about their experiences, challenges , and \nopportunities.    \nMy initial remarks today revolve around what we at the Fed are doing, and you at \nCCRI are doing, to support a vibrant and inclusive economy that works for all.  \nGiven my background as a professor, dean, and provost, I’ve been fortunate to \nreceive speaking invitations at a number of educational institutions.  But this is the first \ntalk at an educational institution that I am giving as p resident of the Boston Fed, \nbecause I wanted my first visit with students, and faculty to be at a community  college.   \n \n \nOverview  \n \nI would like to touch briefly on three things – and then look forward to a \nconversation with President Hughes, and to questions from all of you:   \n \n• First, I want to highlight why I wanted to prioritize speak ing at a community \ncollege like CCRI ; and why com munity colleges, and all of you engaged with \nthem, are so important to our economy and society.  \n• Then, I’ll talk briefly about the range of things we do at the Federal Reserve, to \nadvance our mission.  \n• And finally, I’ll share some of the lessons I’ve learned from my own career path,  \nin case my experiences may be helpful to you.  \n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery  \nEMBARGOED UNTIL 10:30  A.M U.S. Eastern Time,  \nThursday, Ma y 25, 2023 –  OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n2 \n  \nBut before I begin, let me note, as always, that my remarks today are my own \nviews; I’m not speaking for any of my colleagues at other Federal Reserve Banks or at the Board of Governors.  \n  \nThe Importance of Community Colleges  \n \nCommunity colleges provide affordable, accessible higher education to millions \nof learners from all  backgrounds.  They support a wide range of needs for students, \nemployers and communities, and provide opportunities for upward mobility.\n1   And \ncommunity college students  exemplify working hard, juggling multiple responsibilities, \nand developing additional skills to contribute to the economies of today and the future.   \nI would especially like to acknowledge the cohort of entrepreneurs and owners of \nsmall businesses who ar e here today.  You play such an important role in a vibrant \neconomy.   \nAs I travel around New England and talk with employers, one of the most \nprevalent themes is the need for skilled personnel, to power their organizations and \nindustries.  Indeed, our region’s labor market provides opportunities for good jobs, \nenabling people to prosper and thrive.  But those jobs require evolving sets of skills and \nexpertise.  So I congratulate all of you for investing in yourselves and your skills here at \nCCRI.  Doing so  is not only good for you; it also helps the organizations, households, \nand communities that make up our economy.  \nAs a policymaker, it is critical to me that our economy provides opportunities for \neveryone, not just for some.  This makes community colleges , like CCRI, particularly \nimportant in the broader higher education and skill -development landscape.   \n \n1 See the recent study by Jack Mountjoy, “Community Colleges and Upward Mobility,” American \nEconomic Rev iew, 2022, 112(8): 2580 –2630.  \n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery  \nEMBARGOED UNTIL 10:30  A.M U.S. Eastern Time,  \nThursday, Ma y 25, 2023 – OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n3 \n At the Fed, part of our mandate from Congress is to use our tools to maximize \nemployment.  So if things like a lack of childcare, or insufficient housing, prevent some \npeople from participating in the job market and economy, we need to study those \nimpediments.  We need to deepen our understanding of the obstacles  and help explore \nways, locally and more broadly, that progress can be made to address them.  T he \nBoston Fed has been doing this through our research- based Working Places program, \nin locations across New England – including Cranston, Newport, and Providence here in \nRhode Island.2  Working Places encourages and fosters local, cross -sector \ncollaborat ion to identify issues and work on solutions to address complex economic \nproblems.  \n  \nOur Roles at the Federal Reserve  \n \nIn fact, the Federal Reserve’s portfolio of activities is much more extensive than \nmany realize – and I’d like to speak briefly about the breadth of ways we, at the Fed, \nwork to achieve our mission.  \nThe Fed, which is the U.S. central bank, was created almost 110 years ago by \nCongress.  I’ll mention four of our key roles:  \n \n• We provide a lot of back -end infrastructure that underpins the financial system, \nsupporting stable and reliable payments that people and organizations \nthroughout the economy depend on. Think cash, direct deposits, wire transfers, \nand a new service we’re about to unveil, FedNow\nSM instant payments.3  It is the \nfirst new payments “rail” the Fed has built in 50 years, and it will allow individuals \n \n2 Learn more about these efforts at https://www.bostonfed.org/workingplaces.aspx  \n \n3 Learn more about the FedNow  service  at https://explore.fednow.org/  \n \n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery  \nEMBARGOED UNTIL 10:30  A.M U.S. Eastern Time,  \nThursday, Ma y 25, 2023 –  OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n4 \n and businesses to send and receive instant payments and have access to the \nfunds immediately.  \n• Second, we supervise some of the country’s banks for safety, soundness, fair lending, and community reinvestment.  And we serve as a “lender of last resort” \nto the financial system, to ensure liquidity and t o support financial stability.  \n• Third, we work to support community economic development initiatives, like the \nWorking Places program I just mentioned.  \n• Fourth, and importantly, we conduct monetary policy in the pursuit of our dual mandate from Congress to promote price stability and maximum employment.   I’ll \nsay a bit more about this area of our work.  \n \nTo me, maximum employment refers to the broad, inclusive goal of job \nopportunities for all.  Price stability means inflation that is low and stable enough th at it \nis not on people’s minds.  Inflation at 2 percent, the target the Fed has defined, accomplishes that goal.  But as you all know, prices have been rising more rapidly than \nthat, so much attention has been focused on inflation.  In my conversations wit h people \nacross the region, I have heard from small business owners ending projects due to cost \nincreases, and from workers having to take on additional jobs given rising prices on \nnecessities.  \nThese and other discussions are a constant reminder that inflation impacts \neveryone, and is particularly challenging for those with lower incomes.  The Federal \nReserve has been responding forcefully to make sure that high inflation does not \nbecome entrench ed.   \nI’ll note that wage increases that are simply chasing higher prices do not make \nworkers better off, they just fuel more inflation.  What matters for workers are gains in \ninflation -adjusted, or real wages.  \nThus, I see the two dimensions of the Fed’s m andate – stable prices and \nmaximum employment –  as intertwined, especially over the medium and longer term.  \nLow, predictable inflation is needed for fostering conditions that promote a vibrant, \n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery  \nEMBARGOED UNTIL 10:30  A.M U.S. Eastern Time,  \nThursday, Ma y 25, 2023 –  OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n5 \n resilient, and inclusive economy – and for maximum employment  that is sustainable \nover time.  This is a key reason why it is so important for us to remain resolute in \nbringing inflation back down to the 2 percent target in a reasonable amount of time.  \nThere are several factors behind the inflation we’ve been experiencing, but \nultimately it reflects demand outpacing supply, resulting in pressures on wages and \nprices that fuel inflation.  The Fed raising interest rates is intended to slow spending, \ncool t he labor market, and bring demand back into alignment with supply.   \nSince March 2022, the Fed has raised rates from near zero to just over 5 percent \n– with the most recent increase occurring just a few weeks ago.  And recent stresses in \nthe banking system  are likely to  further  tighten credit conditions for businesses and \nconsumers, also cooling demand.    \nWhile inflation is still too high, there are some promising signs of moderation.  I \nbelieve we may be at, or near, the point where monetary policy can pause raising  \ninterest rates.  This will provide an opportunity to more fully assess the impact of the actions taken to date and the general tightening of credit conditions on economic \nactivity.  However, I also believe it is important to make each policy decision based on a \nwholistic assessment of information available at the time – and the next policy meeting \nwill be in mid -June.  In the meantime, we continue to monitor a wide range of data –  \nabout price developments, labor markets, financial conditions and more – to evaluate \nhow the economy is doing.  \n \n \nMy Own Path, and Some Lessons Along the Way  \n \nLet me turn, for a moment, to my own career path.   I’ll just mention a few \ndimensions of my journey, and then wrap up.  \nFirst, I was inspired to be a lifelong learner by my parents and relatives.  While I \nrealize that not everyone has that support, I hope you will be inspired by those you meet here at CCRI, to never stop learning and developing your skills.   The pace of change in \nour economy, and the sk ills it requires, make that essential.  \n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery  \nEMBARGOED UNTIL 10:30  A.M U.S. Eastern Time,  \nThursday, Ma y 25, 2023 –  OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n6 \n During my studies, I encountered instructors who were inspiring, challenging … \nor both.   It was the challenging ones who taught me the most.  I encourage you to seek \nout opportunities to stretch yourself – maybe by as king questions, to be sure you have \nmastered a subject, or taking a class here at CCRI that will push you.  I know many \npeople around you at CCRI care about your success –  so, seek out those who will \ninspire and challenge you.  \nAnd throughout my career, I have been fortunate to have encouragement from \nfriends and family – especially my husband and (now adult) children.   Again, I realize \nnot everyone is so fortunate.   I’ll just say that it is vital to have allies and supporters as \nyou do the hard work of juggling everything, both while attending CCRI and in the future.   So I encourage you to seek out allies … and perhaps most importantly, to be an \nally.  I’ve found that working together, building networks and partnerships, is a key to success – whether in school, or in a new job, or as President of the Boston Fed.   \n  \nConcluding Observations  \nLet me close by encouraging you to keep at what you are doing here at CCRI, \nand to embrace being a lifelong learner.   I have such respect for all of you, who are \nworking so hard to broaden your skills.   You’re building a more prosperous future for \nyourselves, and also for our economy.  \nIndeed, as someone who thinks about and works on our economy all the time, I \nwant to thank you, students –  and your instructors and supporters  as well as the staff \nhere at CCRI –  for helping to build a vibrant, high- skill, inclusive economy –  in Rhode \nIsland and beyond.  \nWith that, thank you again for having me here today.   I look forward to questions \nand conversation.",

Collins  \nPresident & Chief Executive Officer  \nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston  \n   \nMay 31, 2023 \nBoston, Massachusetts  \n \n \nThe views expressed today are my own, not necessarily those of my colleagues on the \nFederal Reserve Board of Governors or the Federal Open Market Committee.   \n \n                         \n Remarks as Prepared for Delivery  \nEMBARGOED UNTIL 8: 50 A.M U.S. Eastern Time,  \nWednesday, May  31, 2023 – OR UPON DELIVERY  \n\n \n Opening Remarks  \n \nGood morning. I am Susan Collins, president of the Boston Fed, and it’s my \npleasure to welcome you –  whether here in person or online -- to the Federal Reserve \nBank of Boston for this half -day forum on several aspects of the post -pandemic \neconomy.  \nThank y ou all for joining us today. Special thanks to Fed Governor Michelle \nBowman for coming to the Boston Fed for our FedListens event. Before I invite \nGovernor Bowman to give some opening remarks, I’ll just say a few things about our \nevent today.  \nAs you may know, it is part of a series the Federal Reserve began a few years  \nago, and the second we’ve hosted here in Boston.1   The FedListens series is an \nimportant opportunity for Fed policymakers, at both the regional banks and the Board of \nGovernors in Washingt on, to expand the ways we hear from participants in the \neconomy.  \nThat’s why, today, we’ve brought together panelists and audience members who \nreflect the diversity of the New England region.  For some of you, this may be your first \nopportunity to engage w ith the Boston Fed – we look forward to your participation.   \nThere are a number of Fed leaders in the room today, including those \nresponsible for economic research and for community development, among other key \nareas. Our goal today, as leaders at the Fed eral Reserve, is that we really listen to you,  \nto help us deepen our understanding of post -pandemic experiences, and of the \nchallenges and opportunities facing each of you, and our region.  \nOur conversations today focus on three key topics -  labor markets, housing, and \nstate and local fiscal health.  We’ve distributed some background materials on each, \nand hope you’ve found them informative and helpful.  \nAnd as you’ll hear more about shortly,  we have ensured a variety of ways for you \nto share your views with us, whether you are on a panel, in the room or online.  \nSo, I want to welcome you all again  – and i t’s now my pleasure to invite Governor \nMichelle Bowman to the podium.  \n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery  \nEMBARGOED UNTIL 8 :50 A.M U.S. Eastern Time,  \nWednes day, Ma y 31, 2023 –  OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n1 \n Governor Bowman has  served as a member of the Board of Governors of the \nFederal Reserve System since 2018. Before joining the Board in Washington, she \nserved as the state bank commissioner of Kansas, and prior to that, as vice president of \nFarmers & Drovers Bank in Kansas. A t the Federal Reserve, Gov. Bowman has been a \nleader and a proponent of these FedListens gatherings, and we’re thrilled to have her here with us today.  \n### \n \nClosing Remarks  \n \nLet me close out our gathering by first offering my sincere thanks to our \nmoderators, panelists, attendees.  We greatly appreciate today’s robust discussion, and \nyour valuable insights – in the panel sessions, around the tables, and from input shared \nby those online.  \nThanks as well to Governor Bowman and the other members of the Board of \nGovernors for promot ing events such as this one. It is so important for policymakers to \nhave windows like this, into regional experience and perspectives.  \nI want to say j ust a few things about how I believe we can use the insights gained \ntoday to advance the work we are charged with doing here at the Fed.  First, I will give \nmy standard disclaimer, which is that the views I share today are my own and not the views of my co lleagues on the Board or at other Reserve Banks.   \nI like to say that the Fed’s overarching mission is to foster conditions that support \na vibrant, inclusive economy that works for all –  not just for some people.   \nThat is why it is essential for us to conn ect with and learn from people across the \nBoston Fed’s district, which encompasses most of New England, about their \nexperiences, challenges, and opportunities.   \nThe Boston Fed prioritizes engaging with the community in a variety of ways, \nfrom collaborations, to serving as a nonpartisan resource, to convenings such as this \none.  And since I started in this job nearly 11 months ago, being out and meeting with \nstakeholders across the region has been a key focus.   \n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery  \nEMBARGOED UNTIL 8 :50 A.M U.S. Eastern Time,  \nWednes day, Ma y 31, 2023 –  OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n2 \n The perspectives you’ve all shared today augment what I have heard from my \ntravels. Community leaders in Connecticut, Rhode Island, Maine, Vermont, \nMassachusetts, and just last week, New Hampshire, have raised many recurring \nthemes – in particular, the tol l from high inflation, challenges related to worker \navailability and retention, and barriers to full participation in the region’s economy and job market, such as the availability and cost of housing, and childcare.  \nYour input today helps to us to flesh out what we learn from the statistical data, \nand to connect quantitative analyses to the real -world experiences of people.  \nThis is particularly relevant as we, at the Fed, focus on our dual mandate from \nCongress: price stability and maximum employment.  We  are intent on reducing inflation \nthat is simply too high and impacting everyone, with particular challenges for those with lower incomes.  I’ll note that price stability is a foundation for maximum employment that \nis sustainable -  a robust job market with opportunities for all.  \nOur next monetary policy meeting is in mid- June.  And as I shared in remarks \nlast week to an audience at the Community College of Rhode Island, I believe it is \nimportant to make each policy decision based on a wholistic assessment of all the \navailable information.\n2   \nPolicymakers continue to monitor a wide range of data –  about price \ndevelopments, labor markets, financial conditions and more.  And we will continue to \nhave conversations such as these with business and community leaders, in order to \ncomplement the economic data and to help us more comprehensively assess how the \neconomy is doing.  \nHere at the Boston Fed, the insights we’re gathering today will broadly help to \ninform the wide range of work we do to advance our commitment  to promoting a strong \nand equitable economy.  \nAgain, I want to thank you for your active participation. We have enjoyed this \nFedListens event and look forward to continuing these conversations with many of you over lunch, and to future opportunities to engage.  \n \n### \n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery  \nEMBARGOED UNTIL 8:50 A .M U.S. Eastern Time,  \nWednes day, Ma y 31, 2023 – OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n3 \n  \n1 For more about the FedListens series, see https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/review -of-monetary -policy -strategy -\ntools -and-communications -fed-listens -events.htm  \n2 See May 25, 2023 remarks by Susan M.

Collins  \nPresident & Chief Executive Officer  \nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston  \n \n \n \nAugust  31, 2023 \n \n \n \n \nThe views expressed today are my own, not necessarily those of my colleagues on the \nFederal Reserve Board of Governors or the Federal Open Market Committee.   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   Remarks as Prepared for Delivery  \nEMBARGOED UNTIL 9:00 A.M U.S. Eastern Time,  \nThurs day, August  31, 202 3 – OR UPON DELIVERY  \n\n \n   \n Key Takeaways  \n1. To build a vibrant, inclusive economy, we need the best ideas, energy, and participation \nfrom everyone. Community colleges play a critical role in this important work by providing \naffordable, accessible higher education and essential skill devel opment – ultimately \nstrengthening our economy and society.  \n2. Collins said we can and should do much more to discover and nurture the potential in \npeople with a range of experiences and backgrounds – including individuals who may be \nthe first in their family to attend college and individuals who may look different in \nappearance from those who’ve traditionally held particular roles.    \n3. Reflecting on her first 14 months as Boston Fed president, Co llins said she’s been \nimpressed and encouraged by the leaders and residents she’s met who are working to \nensure everyone has a chance to participate and thrive in the economy. The Boston Fed \nbelieves in the power of collaborative leadership to make local e conomies stronger and \nmore inclusive. The Bank knows from experience that tangible, practical, community -based \nefforts serve to strengthen our region.   \n4. Collins commended community college students for having resilience, determination, and \nthe ability to overcome challenges. These traits, she added, give them the potential to be \nhighly capable contributors to economy. She also shared her appreciation for t he faculty \nand staff supporting those students.   \n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery  \nEMBARGOED UNTIL 9:00 A.M U.S. Eastern Time,  \nThursday, August  31, 2023 – OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n1 \n It is truly a pleasure to join you this morning for the 2023 Bunker Hill \nConvocation!  It’s always wonderful to be among faculty and staff, and I am delighted to \nknow many students are here as well. I want to thank President Eddinger and Provost \nCaniff for  inviting me to be with you today.    \nThe start to a new academic year is a very exciting time – and I know, also an \nextremely busy one.   Having spent most of my career in academi a, your convocation \nreminds me of so many starts to the academic year – initially as a student, then for \nabout 25 years as a faculty member , and for nearly another 15 as a university  \nadministrator.  I have  many wonderful memories of meet ing students ; launching \nprograms ; and welcoming , and welcoming back , faculty and staff – who are the \nessential pillars  in every higher education institution.   \nIn my current role , I lead an institution that , like yours,  has a public mission .  At \nthe Federal Reserve , we work to  foster  a vibrant, inclusive economy  – characterized by \nour congressionally mandated goals  of price stability and maximum employment  – an \neconomy that works for everyone, not just for some people.  However, w e know that \neconomic outcomes for some people , some communities, and some places have \ndiverged – despite bes t efforts – and therefore, many  have been unable to  fully \nparticipat e in the econ omy.  A healthy economy needs the best ideas, energy , and \nparticipation from everyone  – with the opportunity to work hard, contribute, and prosper.   \nIn that context, I have a particular appreciation for the critical role that Bunker Hill \nCommunity College plays in the greater Boston region .  More  broadly, I’m thinking \nabout the essential ways  community colleges serve  our educational system in New \nEngland , and nationally .  Simply put, c ommunity colleges a re foundational to  higher \neducation in this country .  They  enroll nearly half of all first-time undergraduate \nstudents1 and provid e an affordable, accessible opport unity for investing in essential \nskills .  Here at Bunker Hill, you are supporting students of all ages and backgrounds , \n \n1 See “Community Colleges and Upward Mobility” by Jack Mountjoy, American Economic  Review,  Vol. \n112, N o. 8, A ug. 2022 (pp. 2580 -2630) : https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.20181756 . \n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery  \nEMBARGOED UNTIL 9:00 A.M U.S. Eastern Time,  \nThursday, August  31, 2023 – OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n2 \n many  who are the first generation in their families to attend college .2  Your students are \nwonderfu lly diverse, and you’ve earned the designation of a Hispanic -Serving \nInstitution , and a n Asian American and Native American  Pacific Islander -Serving \nInstitution , from the U.S. Department of Education.   I want to express my  admiration and  \nappreciation for a ll that you do to support and invest in your students .  You are \nstrengthen ing our economy and our society.  \n In my remarks this morning, I’ d like to talk about t wo things.  First, I’ll briefly discuss  \nmy own career trajectory , with a bit of reflection on lessons and takeaways that I hope \nyou will find helpful.  Then  I’d like to share my perspective on the importance of a \nvibrant , inclusive economy and mention some of the ways  we at the Fed , community \ncolleges like yours , and people across the region  are working  to achieve that goal.  In \nthis discussion, I have a few key themes , including : the vital role of community colleges , \nespecially your work here at Bunker Hill.   I’ll also touch on the importance of \npartnerships and collaboration  – since s uccess  in my work, and yours,  require s all of us \nworking together.   And finally , since this is a convocation beginning a new academic \nyear, I’ll offer a thought on beginning, persisting, and finishing.  \n \nMy Own  Path  \nI’d much prefer to  talk about the work  of the Boston Fed , or Bunker Hill \nCommunity College,  than about myself .  But I am often asked how I got to be  in this \nrole, and whether I have advice for others  – especially since  I am the first woman of \ncolor to lead a Federal Reserve Bank .  I see this as an honor, a privilege,  and a \nresponsibility.  So, I’ll share some brief reflections based on  my own path.  \nLike many of your students, I have a n international background .  I was  born in \nScotland to Jamaican parents, and raised in New York City with frequent visits to \n \n2 See “Community Colleges and the Future of Higher Education” by Michael Patrick Rutter and Ste ven \nMintz in Inside Higher Ed  (March 2019): https://www.insidehighered.com/blogs/higher -ed-\ngamma/community -colleges -and-future -higher -education . \n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery  \nEMBARGOED UNTIL 9:00 A.M U.S. Eastern Time,  \nThursday, August  31, 2023 – OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n3 \n Jamaica.  I see exposure to different cultures as something to joyfully embrace  and \nlearn from  – and a source of strength for naviga ting the inevitable challenges each of us \nencounters.  \nMy parents certainly passed on their love of learning , and  I see myself as  a \nlifelong learner .  I hope you see yourselves that way, too.  While many things interested \nme early on, I took courses in econ omics in college , and found it really appealed to me  \n– including a fascination with  how analyzing data could help us understand the complex \neconomy.  Studying economics i n grad uate school, my experience s visiting Jamaica  \nand other countries  led me to speci alize in  the international aspects of \nmacroeconomics , with a focus on econometrics, or data analysis .   \nLike my father, I began my career in academia as a  professor, engaged in \nresearch and teaching, and becoming increasingly interested in using my experti se to \nhelp improve public policies .  I eventually moved to academic administration – as dean \nof a public policy school , and then provost.  Then f ourteen  months ago , I started in this \nposition, giving me the opportunity to use my background and experiences now as a \npolicymaker , serving the public interest.    \nI know many Bunker Hill students are the first in their families to attend college , \nand recognize  how helpful  it was for me to have parents and other family members with \nadvanced degrees .  Observing the m made it easier for me to see myself as a \nprofessional , possibly in a  leadership position  one day .  But while my family saw m y \npotential, I can tell you that not everyone in society s aw a small, very young -looking \nblack woman as likely to become an econom ist, a professor, a dean, a provost, or \npresident  of a Federal Reserve Bank .   \nThere is much more we can , and should,  do to look for  and nurture  the potential \nin people from all background s, including – perhaps especially – people  who look \ndifferent from those  traditional ly seen in particular roles .  We should avoid making \nassumptions about  the capabilities and possibilities that lie behind mere appearance.   \nThis mi ndset influenced my work as a faculty member , and is one factor that led me to \n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery  \nEMBARGOED UNTIL 9:00 A.M U.S. Eastern Time,  \nThursday, August  31, 2023 – OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n4 \n academic administration.  It is also critical for the Fed  – as I’ve said , a healthy economy \nneeds ideas, energy , and  participation from everyone.   \nI also recognize that I’ve been blessed with considera ble support throughout my \neducation and career.  I’ve benefitted from having a family – parents, as well as a \nhusband and now adult children  – who supported and encouraged me along the way.  I \nhad instructors , advisors , and mentors too; and the best ones w ere those who \nchallenged me the most.   I am very grateful to each of them . \nBut not everyone has that level of support , which  makes the work you do here at \nBunker Hill all the  more important.  People like to talk about trailblazers opening doors, \nbut a n image that resonates with me  involves  the responsibility , once through  that door, \nto hold it open  for excellent, high -potential  people.  I want to congratulate and commend \nyou for opening doors – and holding them open – for your students.   \nThis is a con vocation, a gathering to mark a beginning of a new school year.  \nBeginnings are important, but I suspect you and your students are focused on the entire \njourney – including its resolution.   I’m reminded of the extraordinary Jamaican sprinter \nUsain Bolt, wh o said “There are better starters than me, but I’m a strong finisher.”   A \nchallenging start to a journey – whether a sprint or a career – does not determine the \noutcome.  What matters is staying the course and finishing .  And to be clear, I do not \nsee the most important journeys in life as races.  I wish you great success in your own \njourneys as you support your students throughout this school year and beyond.   \n \nCreating a Vibrant, Inclusive Economy – Together  \nThe Fed  works  to foster a vibrant, inclusive economy, and we do that i n a much \nwider range of ways than most people realize – monetary policy , economic research, \nfinancial stability work and bank supervision , community and economic development \nactivities , and ini tiatives and infrastructure related to payments, technology, and finance.  \n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery  \nEMBARGOED UNTIL 9:00 A.M U.S. Eastern Time,  \nThursday, August  31, 2023 – OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n5 \n Today I want to mention a few aspects of the Boston Fed’s work that show the \nbreadth and depth of our efforts to  support a strong economy  characterized by equitable \nopportunity .   \nThe Boston Fed has a reputation for analytical rigor  and analysis of current \necono mic data.  This is absolutely vital for policy work – as is our long -term research on \na variety of empirical and theoretical topics.  We hope our nonpartisan, unbiased \nresearch is a public service.  Of course, we study a range of topics related to credit, \nemployment, and inflation.  But our work is much broader than that.   \n Unfortunately, we can see through our own research that not everyone has the \nsame opportunities to contribute to our economy  – which limits i ts strength and \nvibrancy .  We are committed to doing our part to help address this challenge  by \nfostering inclusion.  Key  ways we do this are by examining factors that could limit  \npeople participating in  the economy going forward , and by collaborati ng with other \norganizations.  \nAs part of that work, the Boston Fed has a decades -long history of studying \nwealth disparities  for groups and places .  We believe better understanding these gaps \ncan expand opportunities, making them more equitably available, help bring more \npeople into the workforce , and stren gthen economic growth and competitiveness.  \nIn this context , the Boston Fed recently launched a multi -year research initiative \nto explore wealth disparities in Greater Boston and across Massachusetts.   It’s a \ncomplex issue, and we aren’t taking it on oursel ves.  Our community partners include \nthe Boston Foundation, the Barr Foundation, Eastern Bank Foundation, and the Greater \nBoston Chamber of Commerce.3 \n \n3 See Federal Reserve Bank of Boston press release , “Federal Reserve Bank of Boston and community \npartners laun ch research effort to explore wealth divides ” (April 2022 ): https://www.bostonfed.org/news -\nand-events/press -releases/2022/boston -fed-and-community -partners -launch -research -effort -to-explore -\nwealth -divides.aspx    \n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery  \nEMBARGOED UNTIL 9:00 A.M U.S. Eastern Time,  \nThursday, August  31, 2023 – OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n6 \n The initial priorities for this work include measuring family wealth and exploring \nwealth differences between racial -ethnic groups and across geographies .  We want  to \nbetter understand why certain disparities persist .  We hope the  findings  will be used by \na broad group of public, p rivate, and nonprofit organizations to develop solutions that \npromote equity in wealth – which is a key foundation for greater economic opportunity.  \nI’d also briefly mention the Boston Fed’s work to support community economic \ndevelopment, expanding opportu nities for everyone to participate in the economy.  \nSince 2014, our staff have focused on encouraging local efforts to find economic \nresurgence in smaller cities and rural areas facing long -term struggles.   We call it \n“Working Places .”4   \n This initi ative , started in 2014, is based on research that showed that an essential \nelement of place -based economic resilience is cross -sector collaboration among local \nindividuals willing to take on shared leadership.  Now in 30 communities across 5 \nstates, t eams of lo cal leaders  choose a shared goal for improving the economy that \nbenefits low -income people , and then develop and implement strategies to address \nthem .  They  focus on issues such as  workforce development, poverty reduction, \naffordable housing, and removing barriers to entrepreneurship. This initiative  has helped \nfoster collaboration among state government, the private sector, philanthropy, local \norganizations, and residents. The Fed hosts, convenes, and supports these efforts.  \nThis ongoing work demonstrates  our belief in the power of collaborative networks .   \nAs I talk to people in all parts of our region, I hear that people really do want to \ncollaborate and work together to solve problems.  Efforts large and small are essential, \nand in combination they can make a real difference and build resilience.  In this, I’m \nreminded of the Kenyan proverb, that  “Sticks in a bundle are unbreakable.”  \nI think about all the working people, leaders, and organizations I’ve visited with \nover the 14 month s I’ve been in this job.  And in addition to being so impressed with \n \n4 Learn more about the  Federal Reserve Bank of Boston ’s “Working Places ” initiatives : \nhttps://www.bostonfed.org/workingplaces.aspx   \n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery  \nEMBARGOED UNTIL 9:00 A.M U.S. Eastern Time,  \nThursday, August  31, 2023 – OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n7 \n what they are doing, I’m also incredibly encouraged that local, tangible efforts are \nadding up to real strength in our region.  I’d like to tell you about a few of them , and  \nhope  you find  them inspiring and motivating, as I do.  \nOften these efforts focus on the basic, practical things that get in the way of \nparticipation in the job market and economy – whether skillsets and training, or reliable \nand affordable childcare, or transportation, or the ability to find housing that’s affordable \nin the vicinity of a job or school.  It is important for us to celebrate these sorts of efforts, \nlearn from them,  and build on them!  \n• A first, obvious example would be right here – the way community colleges give \npeople options to affordably develop skills to lead better lives. I note in your \nmission statement that “The College provides inclusive and affordable access to \nhigher education, supports the success of all students, and forges vibrant \npartnerships an d pathways...”  And I know you work so hard to provide \n“wraparound” services that help smooth the issues that may be getting in the way \nof students continuing to progress.  I also note the range of partnerships with \norganizations you’ve built, to give your  students options and opportunities.  As \nsomeone who thinks about the economy’s health all the time, I just want to thank \nand commend you for that vital work.  \n• Another  example – another stick strengthening that bundle – is in Connecticut, \nwhere East Hartfor d CONNects has launched a Professional Skills Academy with \nthe goal of connecting residents with local employers – in the words of their \ndirector, trying to fill the gap between folks saying, “We need training,” and \nemployers saying, “We will hire anyone a s long as they’re career -ready.”  A \nrelated effort recruits underrepresented groups into manufacturing with training, \nand stipends that make it possible for people to take time for that  training.  \n• Other examples touch on the critical economic issue of chil d care, which gives \noptions to parents who want or need to participate in the workforce .  To that end, \n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery  \nEMBARGOED UNTIL 9:00 A.M U.S. Eastern Time,  \nThursday, August  31, 2023 – OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n8 \n Leaders for Equitable Local Economies5 is an outgrowth of our Working Places \neffort , and in Fitchburg, the team has implemented a bilingual child  care \nentrepreneur training program to help support individuals in opening up their own \nsmall businesses in childcare.  The program has 80 graduates and started its fifth \ncohort this month!  Similarly, the Waterbury, Connecticut  Working Places  team \nhas provided training for residents looking to open licensed , home -based child  \ncare facilities.   So far, 15 new facilities have opened.  \nThere are so many other examples I could mention, from longstanding initiatives \nsuch as the public -private partnership facilitated by the Boston Private Industry Council \nfor the Boston Fed and many other employers to hire summer interns  from Boston \nPublic Schools , to very recent  ones such as the Boston Fed ’s Economic Research \nImmersion pilot p rogram this past summer  for a small number of community college \nstudents – most from here at Bunker Hill.6  As I go around the region and meet with the \nwide range of the Fed’s stakeholders, people I talk to cite many challenges in our \neconomy in New England,  and also many  strengths and opportunities.  I find the se \nstories of people and organizations making a difference to be inspiring and so gratifying . \nWhat you do, what your students do , what we at the Boston Fed are doing , and \nwhat people are doing across N ew England are all part of making our economy resilient , \nvibrant,  and inclusive .  Efforts like these are adding to that Kenyan proverb ’s bundle and \nhelping to make it unbreakable . \n \nConcluding Observations  \nIn conclusion, I’ll just say tha t it is so essential that all in society have \nopportunities to enhance skills.

            "content": "“Perspectives on the Economy \nand Policymaking” \n \n  \nSusan M. Collins \nPresident & Chief Executive Officer \nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston \n \n  \nSeptember 6, 2023 \n \n  \nThe views expressed today are my own, not necessarily those of my colleagues on the \nFederal Reserve Board of Governors or  the Federal Open Market Committee.  \n \n                        \n   Remarks as Prepared for Deliver y\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 8:30 A.M U.S. Eastern Time,\nWednesday, September 6, 2023 – OR UPON DELIVERY\n\n \n   \nKey Takeaways  \n1. Holistic Assessment:  Collins reviews a wide range of information to assess the evolving \neconomy.  She looks for patterns and trends showing sustained reductions in inflation, and progress \non the underlying goal of bringing demand and supply back into better balance.  She notes that price \nstability is essential for a well-functioning econ omy and an important precondition for maximum \nemployment that is sustainable over time.  \n2. Current Indications:  Strong demand relative to supply has been a key factor driving higher \ninflation.  While we are seeing some signs of moderation, demand continues to outpace supply, \ncreating price pressures.  Core inflation shows modest and relatively recent moderation.  There are \npromising developments, but given continued strength in  demand, Collins’ view is that it is just too \nearly to take the recent improvements as evidence that inflation is on a sustained path back to the 2% \ntarget.  \n3. Patience and Data Dependence:  This phase of monetary policy calls for patience and holistic \ndata dependence.  One reason is the difficulty of extrac ting signal from noise in the data.  Another is \nincreased uncertainty about the timing and ultimate impact on the economy of policy tightening to date \n– including some reasons to expect longer lags than normal due to some unique aspects of the \npandemic recovery.    \n4. Staying Resolute:  Importantly, patience does not mean indecision, or a change in commitment to \nthe 2 percent target and to achievi ng price stability in a reasonable amount of time.  Collins expects \nwe’ll need to hold rates at restrictive levels for so me time.  And while we may be near, or even at, the \npeak, further tightening could be warranted, depending on incoming data.  We are well positioned to \nproceed patiently, carefully, yet deliberately; re cognizing the risks while remaining resolute.  \n5. Optimistic While Realistic: Continued restrictive monetary policy should temper demand further, \nto bring it into better balance with supply – however,  Collins does not believe a significant slowdown is \nrequired.  She remains realistic about the risks and uncertainties around the outlook, while optimistic \nthat price stability is achievable with an orderly  slowdown and only a modest unemployment rate \nincrease – ideally preserving some of the cu rrent favorable labor market dynamics.  \n6. Engagement and Collaboration: The Fed’s mandate and concern for a vibrant, inclusive economy \nlead us to study economic issues that prevent people from participating in the economy or workforce, \nas well as the gaps in wealth accumulation and prosperity.  Collins will continue to prioritize hearing \nfrom those in a wide range of roles, who make up and shape our region’s economy.  The Boston Fed \nwill continue working to support a vibrant, inclusive economy full of opportunity, working \ncollaboratively with organizations across the region to understand and address challenges.    \n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery \nEMBARGOED UNTIL 8:30 A.M U.S. Eastern Time, \nWednesday, September 6, 2023 – OR UPON DELIVERY \n \n1 \n Good morning.  It is a pleasure to be with you, at this podium where the New \nEngland Council hosts so many distinguished leaders.  I’d like to thank Jim Brett for \ninviting me, early on, to speak with you.   \nI have been looking forward to this, because of my great appreciation for the \nCouncil, and its members, working to k eep New England’s economy vibrant.  As a \nmacroeconomist and former dean of a public poli cy school, I appreciate your focus on \nthe ways policymakers, and organizations ac ross New England, can collaborate in the \npublic interest.  \nI also appreciate the New England Council’s non-partisan nature, and the \nbreadth of industries and sector s you work in.  This an extraordinary region, in part \nbecause of that range – and t he brainpower, innovation, and character New Englanders \nbring to the table. \nMy thanks as well to Jim, for contributi ng his insights over many years to an \nadvisory council made up of sm all- and medium-sized busine sses we convene at the \nFed every quarter. \nToday, I’ll start with a bit of  context about our work at the Fed.  Then, I’ll share \nsome of my current views on the economy and monetary policy.  Finally, I’ll comment on \nsome of the challenges and opportunities  ahead, and the roles the Boston Fed and \nothers can play.  Then, I’ll be happy to take ques tions.  But first, my standard disclaimer: \nThese perspectives are my own; I’m not speaking for any other Federal Reserve policymakers.  \n Context: Roles and Responsibilities Entrusted to the Fed  \nI like to say our work at the Fed is all about supporting a vibrant, inclusive \neconomy that works for everyone, not just so me people.  As you know, the strength of \nan economy has many dimensions – so the Fed is involved in a number of activities, all \nin the public interest.   \nBut let me underline an important dist inction, which is not always well-\nunderstood.  The Federal Reserve’s activities are in monetary – not fiscal – policy.  At \nthe Fed, we’re entrusted with monetary  policymaking – in particular, setting short-term \ninterest rates that ultimately  affect the availability of  money and credit for businesses \nand households.  In this, we are guided by our dual mandate from Congress: stable \nprices and maximum employment.  So we spend a lot of time analyzing economic \nconditions – using data, doing research, and listening to stakeholders locally and \nnationally.  \nThe economy also needs reliable credit, and payment systems.  The Fed is \nentrusted with responsibilities regarding th e safety, soundness, and stability of the \nbanking and financial systems; and we serve as  a lender of last resort to financial \ninstitutions.  We also provide back-end infrastructure to the banking system and the U.S. Treasury, ranging from currency and coin circulation, to various ways to transfer \n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery \nEMBARGOED UNTIL 8:30 A.M U.S. Eastern Time, \nWednesday, September 6, 2023 – OR UPON DELIVERY \n \n2 \n funds electronically.  For many years we  have been involved in innovating to make \npayments systems more effective and efficient.   \n The Economy, the Outlook, and Monetary Policy \nI’ll turn, now, to sharing some of my cu rrent views on the ec onomy, the outlook, \nand monetary policy.  Our focu s at the Fed remains bringi ng inflation down to our 2 \npercent target.\n1  Price stability is essential fo r a well-functioning economy and an \nimportant precondition for maxi mum employment that is sustainable over time – so \nreducing inflation relates to both parts of our dual mandat e from Congress.  And I \ncontinue to hear, in travels around New Engl and, about the toll from high inflation on \nhouseholds – especially those with lower income s, struggling to make ends meet – and \non businesses, often as they grapple with higher costs and more co mplex planning and \ninvestment decisions. \nI like to give my bottom-line up front, and in my view, this phase of our policy \ncycle requires patience, and holistic data asse ssment, while we stay the course.  I \nexpect we’ll need to hold rates at restrictive le vels for some time.  And while we may be \nnear, or even at, the peak for policy rate s, further tightening could be warranted, \ndepending on the incoming data.  Pa tience will give us time to better separate “signal” \nfrom “noise” as we assess available data; and to balance risks, as t he effects of tighter \npolicy continue to work through the economy.  \nLet me briefly explain my  rationale. Since I see holistic data assessment as \nparticularly important in t he current context, I’ve s hared a handout with some charts \nshowing just a few of the m any data series I review, as  part of the wide range of \ninformation I use to assess t he evolving economy.   \n Current Economic Conditions \nIn reviewing economic data, I look  for patterns and trends that show both \nsustained reductions in inflation, and pr ogress on the underlying goal of bringing \ndemand and supply back into better balance.  I’ll start there, because strong demand \nrelative to supply has been a key factor driv ing higher inflation.  While we are seeing \nsome signs of moderation, demand cont inues to outpace supply, creating price \npressures.  \nThe black line in Figure 1  shows how the level of real  GDP (or the production of \ngoods and services adjusted for inflation) has evolved relative to trend , shown by the \n \n1 “The FOMC judges that low and stable inflation at the rate of 2 percent per year, as measured  by the annual \nchange in the price index for personal consumption  expenditures,  is most consistent  with achievement  of both \nparts of the dual mandate.”  https://www.federalreserve.g ov/monetarypolicy/monetary ‐policy‐what‐are‐its‐goals‐\nhow‐does‐it‐work.htm  \n \n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery \nEMBARGOED UNTIL 8:30 A.M U.S. Eastern Time, \nWednesday, September 6, 2023 – OR UPON DELIVERY \n \n3 \n dotted line.  The trend is an estimate of su stainable output for the economy over time.2   \nA key takeaway is that GDP remains abov e trend — a sign of demand continuing to \noutstrip supply.  Many forecasters expect continued above-trend grow th this quarter.  \nGDP growth has been supported, important ly, by resilient household consumption \nexpenditures – shown by the light blue lin e – which is the largest component of \naggregate demand.  \nWhat about inflation, in this context of demand still outpacing supply?  There are \nmany inflation indicators to watch, of  course.  Focusing on the Fed’s preferred \nmeasure,3 Figure 2,  Panel A  shows that on a year-over-year  basis, total inflation (the \ndark blue line) has come down significantly  from its peak but remains somewhat \nelevated.  However, core inflation (the light  blue line) shows considerably less progress, \nalthough with some improvement in recent m onths.  While the core measure excludes \nthe important but volatile f ood and energy components,  it tends to bette r predict future \ninflation.     \nI’m showing these two panels side by side so you can see how the monthly \ninflation data – including core inflation, shown in Figure 2, Panel B  – tend to be more \nvariable than measures on a year-over-year bas is.  This variability has increased since \nthe pandemic, a point I’ll return to in a mo ment, and is one reason for being patient in \nassessing the data.  \nFigure 3 Panels A, B, and C  show the three main components of core inflation.  \nSince the components behave quite differently, looking at them se parately helps to \nbetter assess price pressures.  These charts  include 3- , 6-, and 12- month annualized \nchanges. The shorter horizons highlight recent  developments – but are typically more \nvariable, or “noisier.”  Lookin g at multiple time horizons c an help paint a fuller picture of \nhow inflation is evolving.   \nPanel A shows that the moderation in co re inflation has come mainly from a \nsignificant decline in the core goods  sector, where the resolution of supply chain \nbottlenecks has helped to better align dem and with supply.  Panel B shows that shelter  \ninflation, though still high, has slowed recently  as well: the 3-month change is below the \n6-month.  As moderati on in new market rents continues to pass through, this decline will \nlikely continue.  However, as shown in Panel C, core services  price inflation, excluding \nshelter, has slowed only modestly so far.   This component accounts for about 55 \npercent of core inflation as measured by the price index for personal consumption \nexpenditures (PCE).        \n \n2 This trend assumes real GDP growth of 1.8% per year. The shaded bar in the chart represents  the pandemic  \nrecession.  \n \n3 The Personal Consumption  Expenditures  or PCE index.  \n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery \nEMBARGOED UNTIL 8:30 A.M U.S. Eastern Time, \nWednesday, September 6, 2023 – OR UPON DELIVERY \n \n4 \n So, there are promising developments, but given the continued strength in \ndemand, my view is that it is  just too early to take the recent improvements as evidence \nthat inflation is on a sust ained path back to 2 percent.  \nI’ll next turn briefly to the labor market.  There too, demand continues to outstrip \nsupply overall – a very familiar refrain in much of New England and across the country, \nfor some time now – but we are s eeing evidence of improved alignment.  Panel A of \nFigure 4  shows that payroll employment conti nues to grow above trend, but has been \nslowing.  Lower voluntary quits and lower, though still high, job vacancies (not shown) \nare also consistent with a cooli ng but resilient labor market.  \nOn the labor supply side, we’ve seen some recent increases in labor force \nparticipation, especially for prime-age workers (those aged 25-54) as shown in Panel B.    \nIt is encouraging that more people are entering the labor force, which is the reason why \nthe unemployment rate ticked up to 3.8 percent in August — notably, a level that is still \nvery low by historical standards.  \nI also review disaggregated labor ma rket data, recognizing that aggregate \nnumbers do not show the wide range of experi ences across groups of people, sectors, \nand places.  For example, Figure 5 shows the persistent dispar ities in unemployment – \nfor different racial and ethnic groups in panel A, and for people with different education \nlevels in panel B.  I’ll have more to say about such disparities, in a moment. \nOverall, then, rebalancing demand and supply in the labor market has some way \nto go.  In particular, Figure 6 shows wage inflation, measur ed here by the Employment \nCost Index or ECI on a quarterly and yearly  basis.  Wage growth remains elevated in \nthe current high inflat ion environment.  Recognizing that  workers benefit from increases \nin their real wages, or purchasing power, I look fo rward to returning to an environment \nwith wage growth consistent with the 2 percent inflation target.4 \nContinued restrictive monetar y policy should temper demand further to bring it \ninto better balance with supply – however, im portantly, I do not believe a significant \nslowdown is required.  I have described myself  for some time as a “realistic optimist” – \nrealistic about the risks and uncertainties around a baseline outlook, while optimistic \nbecause the resilience I see leads me to believe  price stability is achievable with an \norderly slowdown and only a modest unemploym ent rate increase – ideally preserving \nsome of the favorable labor supply dynamics.  \nMonetary Policy Lags and My Outlook \nI’ll shift now to a brief assessment of the impact of monetary policy actions to \ndate, and my outlook.   \n \n4 Fed Chairman  Jerome Powell has noted, “To be clear, strong wage growth is a good thing. But for wage growth to \nbe sustainable,  it needs to be consistent  with 2 percent inflation.”   (see \nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newse vents/speech/powell20221130a.htm ). \n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery \nEMBARGOED UNTIL 8:30 A.M U.S. Eastern Time, \nWednesday, September 6, 2023 – OR UPON DELIVERY \n \n5 \n As Figure 7 shows, starting in March 2022, we raised the federal funds rate \ntarget by five and a quarter per centage points in just 18 mont hs, the fastest policy rate \nincrease in 40 years.  While t he effects of higher interest ra tes were almost immediately \nevident in the housing sector, they have been slower to show through to broader \nindicators of activity, such as GDP and labor market statistics.  \nTypically, monetary policy actions are es timated to meaningfully affect broader \nmeasures of economic activity with a lag of four to six quarters.5  But there is \nconsiderable variation around this estima te, and special factors in the pandemic \nrecovery are likely making t hese lags longer than usual.  \nIn particular, policy tightening ha s occurred amidst sound business and \nhousehold fundamentals, compar ed to previous hiking cycles – likely implying a longer  \ntime for tighter credit conditi ons to work through the economy.   For example, many firms \nhad refinanced when interest rate s were very low, somewhat insulating their investment \nplans from higher rates.  And households th at accumulated excess savings during the \npandemic have needed to borrow less than usual so far, to finance expenditures.    \nSo monetary policy may take longer than no rmal to affect the broader economy.  \nBut given that policy is clearly in restrictiv e territory, I do expect to see slowing growth \nby the end of this year and throughout 2024.   And there are already some signs \nconsistent with this outlook.  Firms’ cash levels are returning to pre-pandemic trends, \nand households’ excess sa vings are declining.6  Demand should slow as spending \nbecomes more interest sensitive.   \nThe goal is an orderly slowdown that be tter aligns demand with supply, which is \nessential to ensure that inflation is on a sustainable trajectory back to target.  \n \nImplications for Monetary Policy in an Uncertain Environment \nI’ll conclude my discussion of the economy by highlighting some considerations \nthat underpin my outlook.  The economic ci rcumstances surrounding the pandemic and \nrecovery have been, and continue to be, highly unusual, with implications for monetary \npolicy.  This complex topic is likely to be a long-term focus for anal ysis and research.   \nI’ve flagged two key dimensions:  First, we’r e in a period where it is difficult to \nextract the signal from the noise  in the data.  As I noted, some data, such as monthly \n \n5 These lags appear in various estimates  of the effects of monetary  policy, for instance those surveyed by Ramey \n(Ramey, V.A., 2016; \"Macroeconomic  Shocks and Their Propagation,\"  in: J. B. Taylor & Harald Uhlig [ed.], \nHandbook  of Macroeconomics , edition 1, volume 2, chapter 2, pages 71‐162, Elsevier). A more recent study \nconfirming  significant  lags in the effects is Romer and Romer (Christina  D. Romer & David H. Romer, 2023; \"Does \nMonetary  Policy Matter? The Narrative  Approach  after 35 Years,\" NBER Working Papers 31170, National Bureau of \nEconomic  Research,  Inc.). \n \n6 Some households,  including those at the lower end of the income distribution,  have likely already depleted any \nexcess savings.  \n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery \nEMBARGOED UNTIL 8:30 A.M U.S. Eastern Time, \nWednesday, September 6, 2023 – OR UPON DELIVERY \n \n6 \n PCE inflation, are unusually volatile.7  Second, there is increased uncertainty about the \ntiming and ultimate impact on the economy fr om policy tightening to date.  Reasons \ninclude the unusually sound initial business and househ old fundamentals, and the \nunusually rapid initial pace of tightening.   \nThe risk of inflation staying higher fo r longer must now be weighed against the \nrisk that an overly restrictive stance of moneta ry policy will lead to a greater slowdown in \nactivity than is needed to restore price stab ility.  This context calls for a patient and \ncareful, but deliberate, approach to policy, al lowing time to assess the effects of policy \nactions to date, and then acting appropria tely.  Importantly, patience does not mean \nindecision, or a change in the commitment to the 2 percent target, but rather time to \nensure that the economy is on a clear tr ajectory to achieve price stability. \nOverall, we are well positioned to proceed ca utiously in this uncertain economic \nenvironment, recognizing the risks while re maining resolute and data-dependent, with \nthe flexibility to adjust as conditions warrant. \n A Vibrant, Inclusive Economy  \nI started with comments about t he strengths of Ne w England.  I’d like to close by \nalluding to some of the challenges  I hear about, too – and some of the things \norganizations like yours, and mine, are doing about them.  \nThe privilege and respons ibility of policymaking make engagement with \nstakeholders essential.  So I will continue to pr ioritize taking cross-sector visits to each \nNew England state, and heari ng from those in a wide range of roles, who make up and \nshape our region’s economy (see Figure 8 ). \nAgain, our domain at the F ed is monetary, not fiscal,  policy.  But our mandate \nand our concern for a vibrant, inclusive econom y bring our focus to the challenges that \nprevent people from participat ing in the economy or the workforce – real economic \nissues like childcare, housing, climate, and infrastructure, such as transportation and \nbroadband.  And like many of you, we worry about the gaps in wealth accumulation and \nprosperity by group and place.\n8   \n \n7 Month‐to‐month consumer  spending patterns have also been somewhat  unusual and continue to evolve, \ncomplicating  seasonal adjustment.    \n \n8 The Boston Fed has a decades‐long history of studying wealth disparities  for groups and places.  We believe \nbetter understanding  these gaps can expand opportunities,  making them more equitably  available,  help bring \nmore people into the workforce,  and strengthen  economic  growth and competitiveness.   A healthy economy \nneeds the best ideas, energy, and participation  from everyone  – with the opportunity  to work hard, contribute,  \nand prosper. In this context, the Boston Fed ‐ working with community  partners ‐ recently launched a multi‐year \nresearch initiative to explore wealth disparities  in Greater Boston and across Massachusetts.  Initial priorities for \nthis work include measuring  family wealth and exploring  wealth differences  between racial‐ethnic groups and \n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery \nEMBARGOED UNTIL 8:30 A.M U.S. Eastern Time, \nWednesday, September 6, 2023 – OR UPON DELIVERY \n \n7 \n These are very real challenges.  But I remain optimistic about what we all, \ntogether, can accomplish when we care, co llaborate, study, and act.  Here are a few \nexamples.   \nMany parts of New England that were onc e centers for manufac turing or natural \nresources have faced long-term challenges.  Ou r Working Places initiative, started in \n2014 under my predecessor Eric Rosengren, is based on research showing that an \nessential element of place-based economic resurgence is local, cross-sector  \ncollaboration.  Now in 30 communities across 5 states, teams of local leaders choose a \nshared goal for improving the economy t hat benefits low-inco me people, and then \ndevelop and implement strategies.  The Fed hosts, convenes, and supports these efforts – but not financially.  The real wo rk is in local ingenuity and commitment.\n9  \nLack of affordable childcare is a very real economic issue across New England \nand nationally.  Childcare gives options to par ents who want or need to participate in the \nworkforce.  As an outgrowth of our Worki ng Places effort, a team in Fitchburg has \nimplemented a bilingual chil dcare entrepreneur training program to help support \nindividuals in opening up their own small businesses in childcare.  It has 80 graduates \nand just started its fifth cohort.10   \nClimate change is on many business and government leaders’ minds, and the \nFed’s responsibilities make it important and prudent for us to study the issues.  For \nexample, our recent research examines pot ential costs related to climate change for \nMassachusetts cities and towns – and ultimate ly taxpayers.  We find that per capita \nlocal spending could grow significantly in  the decades ahead, with hotter and stormier \nweather increasing the cost of public works,  government administrat ion, operation of \nschools, and other public services.11 \nLast but not least, I mentioned earlier the F ed’s work on payments.  It wasn’t that \nlong ago that paper checks had to be flown around t he country to settle at the bank they \nwere drawn on – a slow, costly  necessity.  The Boston Fed and others helped pioneer \ndigital check imaging, and ex panded automated clearing – and more recently, creation \nof an entirely new instant-payments infrastr ucture to help banks of all sizes meet \n \nacross geographies.  We want to better understand  why certain disparities  persist, and hope the findings will be \nused by a broad group of public, private, and nonprofit  organizations  to develop solutions.  \n \n9 Learn more about Working Places at https://www.bostonfed.org/workingplaces.aspx  \n \n10 Learn more at https://www.bostonfed.org/work ingplaces/news/2022/tackling ‐the‐child‐care‐crisis‐lele‐\nteammates ‐see‐child‐care‐training‐need‐fill‐it.aspx .  And similarly, the Waterbury,  Connecticut  Working Places \nteam has provided training for residents looking to open licensed, home‐based childcare facilities, opening 15 new \nfacilities so far.  The vision and effort is local, but organizations  like ours can help spark or support the progress. \n \n11 See the summary  by Larry Bean and the study by Bo Zhao: https://www.bostonfed.org/news ‐and‐\nevents/news/2023/01/price ‐tag‐on‐climate‐change‐bo‐zhao‐report‐boston‐fed‐massachusetts.aspx  \n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery \nEMBARGOED UNTIL 8:30 A.M U.S. Eastern Time, \nWednesday, September 6, 2023 – OR UPON DELIVERY \n \n8 \n customer needs.  In July, we launched t he FedNow instant payments service – and the \nnational program leader  is the Boston Fed’s C.O.O., Ken Montgomery.12 \n Concluding Observations \nAcross New England, I hear t hat people from all sectors want to collaborate and \nwork together to solve problems like these.  Efforts large and small, in combination, can \nmake a real difference.   \nWe will continue, at the Boston Fed, work ing to serve the public interest and \nsupport a vibrant, inclusive economy full of  opportunity.

Collins  \nPresident & Chief Executive Officer  \nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston  \n \n \nSeptember 22, 2023 \nBoston, Massachusetts  \n \n \n \nThe views expressed today are my own, not necessarily those of my colleagues on the \nFederal Reserve Board of Governors or the Federal O pen Market Committee.   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   Remarks as Prepared for Delivery  \nEMBARGOED UNTIL 10:00  A.M U.S. Eastern Time,  \nFriday, September 22, 202 3 – OR UPON DELIVERY  \n\n \n    \nKey Takeaways  \n1. Price stability is essential for a well -functioning economy , and an important precondition for \nmaximum employment that is sustain able over time.   \nCollins  continue s to hear about the challenges households and firms face related to too -high inflation. The \nfocus at the Fed remains bringing inflation down to the 2 percent target.  \n2. While r ecent inflation readings have been encouraging , inflation remains too high. Some \nimportant components of inflation  have yet to show sustained improvement.   \nAlthough still elevated , inflation is down from its earlier peak. However, m ost of the moderation in core \ninflation has come from a decline in goods  inflation. Shelter  inflation has also moderated recently , and will \nlikely ease further . However, inflation in core  services excluding shelter  (over half of the Fed’s  preferred \ninflati on measure ) has yet to show improvement  consistent with price stability.   \n3. Collins fully supports the FOMC’s attentiveness to inflation risks and commitment to price \nstability .  \nSustained reductions in inflation will require demand coming into better balance with supply across the \neconomy.  While t here is some evidence this realignment is underway, especially in the labor market, \neconomic activity continues to be above trend  and it is too soon to be confident that inflation is on a \nsustainable tr ajectory back to target . Collins  agree s with the policy guidance in the median SEP projections  \nwhich show rates  staying higher, and for longer, than previous projections had suggested ; and further \ntightening is certainly not off the table.  \n4. This phase of policymaking requires considerable patience, to extract the signal from noisy  data \nand to allow some  temporary  factors to play out. Collins is realistic about risks , but optimistic \nabout restoring price stability with an orderly realignment of demand with supply .  \nThe economic circumstances surrounding the pandemic and recovery have been, and continue to be, \nhighl y unusual. This phase of monetary policy requires patience. Collins is a “realistic optimist ” – realistic \nabout the uncertainties, but optimistic that price stability can be restored with only a modest increase in the \nunemployment rate. She believes  the pathway to achieving this outcome has widened.  \n5. Across Maine  (and New England) , local leadership efforts are addressing economic challenges \nand promoting resurgence.   \nThere are many dimensions to economic prosperity  – so the Fed has a broad  portfolio , including \nencouraging local initiatives  to foster  economic resurgence  in areas facing long -term struggles . An \nessential element  is cross -sector collaboration among local individuals. In Maine, there are six such  \n“Working Places”  efforts , and t he Fed  simply helps the local network s emerge and flourish. Collaborating \nto improv e opportunities for people and places to not be left behin d – but rather join in the economy – is \ngood economics, good citizenship, and good business . \n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery  \nEMBARGOED UNTIL 10:00 A.M U.S. Eastern Time,  \nFriday, September 22, 2023 – OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n1 \n Good morning. It is a pleasure being with you. I am always grateful for the \nopportunity to meet with Mainers, no matter the location, and have been to Maine \nmultiple times. In fact, I’ve made a point of visiting all the New England states in this role \n– and will continue to do so.  \nI’ll start by thanking two people. First is Jim Roche, president of the Maine \nBankers’ Association. We appreciate his continued engagement with us at the Boston \nFed, as we all work to support a safe and sound banking system, whic h is so essential \nto a vibrant and inclusive economy. Second, I want to thank Jeanne Hulit, president and \nCEO of Maine Community Bancorp. Jeanne is of course a member of your association’s \nexecutive committee. She’s also a member of the Boston Fed’s board of directors. We \nso appreciate the insights into Maine and New England business conditions she shares \nas a member of our board.  \nIn the time we have today, I’ll make some initial remarks, before taking a few \nquestions. Of course, I’ll share my views about t he economic outlook and monetary \npolicy. Then I’ll provide a few perspectives on banking in New England and in particular \nMaine – highlighting the importance of banks of all sizes to a vibrant, inclusive \neconomy. I’ll end with a few points about the Fed’s work across the region, and our \nshared opportunities to collaborate in the public interest.  \n \nThe Economic Outlook and Monetary Policy  \nI’ll start with some of my current views on the economy, the outlook, and \nmonetary policy – especially given the Federal O pen Market Committee’s (FOMC’s) \ndecision on policy rates this week.1 But first, my standard disclaimer: the views I \nexpress are my own; I’m not speaking for any other Fed policymaker.  \nOur focus at the Fed remains bringing inflation down to our 2 percent t arget.2 \nPrice stability is essential for a well -functioning economy, and an important precondition \n \n1 https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20230920a.htm  \n2 “The FOMC judges that low and stable inflation at the rate of 2 percent per year, as measured by the \nannual change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures, is most consistent with \n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery  \nEMBARGOED UNTIL 10:00 A.M U.S. Eastern Time,  \nFriday, September 22, 2023 – OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n2 \n for maximum employment that is sustainable over time – so reducing inflation relates to \nboth parts of our dual mandate from Congress. And as I travel around  the district, I \ncontinue to hear about the challenges households and firms face related to too -high \ninflation. On one of my trips to Maine I recall hearing about residents who were unable \nor unwilling to move within the state to take job offers, due in pa rt to the rising costs of \nfuel, shelter, transportation, and other necessities.  \nHowever, there has been some promising news. Although still too high, inflation \nis down from its earlier peak. And there is some evidence demand and supply are \nrealigning, espe cially in labor markets, which is needed to reduce the upward pressure \non prices. Importantly, the current policy phase requires patience , allowing time to better \nseparate the signal from the noise in the data.  \nI’d like to say a bit about the FOMC’s decis ion earlier this week, and the related \neconomic projections from policymakers. As widely expected, the FOMC left interest \nrates unchanged. However, the policy statement makes clear that this decision need not \nimply having reached the peak federal funds rat e in this tightening cycle. Future \ndecisions will depend on a holistic assessment of incoming data.  \nThe FOMC also released an updated Summary of Economic Projections (SEP) \nprepared by all the Fed Board’s governors and Reserve Bank presidents, which \ncertainly reinforces the statement’s message. The median expectation for the federal \nfunds rate in the SEP features one more 25 basis -point increase this year and, relative \nto the June projections, a more gradual process of policy normalization in 2024 and ’25.   \nThis federal funds rate projection underscores the Committee’s focus on \nrestoring price stability w hile also recognizing the other part of our mandate: maximum \nsustainable employment. Indeed, the median SEP forecast expects a normalization of \nlabor market conditions that contributes to inflation running at levels consistently close \nto target by 2025 to ‘26.  \n \nachievement of both parts of the dual mandate. ” \nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/monetary -policy -what -are-its-goals -how-does -it-work.htm  \n \n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery  \nEMBARGOED UNTIL 10:00 A.M U.S. Eastern Time,  \nFriday, September 22, 2023 – OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n3 \n I fully support the FOMC statement and agree with the policy guidance in the \nmedian SEP projections. I expect rates may have to stay higher, and for longer, than \nprevious projections had suggested, and further tightening is certainly not off the tabl e. \nPolicymakers will stay the course to achieve the Fed’s mandate.    \n My views on policy reflect my assessment of current conditions and the outlook \nfor inflation and real activity. I noted earlier that there are some promising signs that \ninflation is mod erating and the economy rebalancing. But progress has not been linear \nand is not evenly distributed across sectors.  \nStarting with inflation, I’ll focus on so -called core inflation, which excludes the \nimportant but volatile food and energy components, beca use it is typically a better \ngauge of underlying trends than total inflation. Recent readings have been encouraging \n– but disaggregating the key components provides valuable insight into recent pricing \npatterns. In particular, doing so highlights that most  of the moderation in core inflation \nhas come from a noticeable decline in core goods  inflation, as supply bottlenecks have \nresolved. A second key component, shelter  inflation, has also moderated recently, and \nwill likely ease further as slower growth in n ew market rents is reflected in the overall \nindex. However, inflation in core  services excluding shelter , which accounts for over half \nof our preferred core inflation measure, has yet to show the sustained improvement that \nwould be consistent with price st ability.  \nSo while there have been promising developments, it is too soon to be confident \nthat inflation is on a sustainable trajectory back to the 2 percent target. I’ll also note the \nimportance of caution in reading too much from individual data points, or even from a \nfew months of information. The monthly inflation data, for example, have always been \nnoisy. But the variability of core inflation has increased since the pandemic. \nConsiderable uncertainty remains around underlying inflation conditions. Extr acting \ntrends and patterns from noisy incoming data will take patience.  \nI’ve also noted that sustained reductions in inflation will require demand coming \ninto better balance with supply across the economy. Some signs that a broad \nrebalancing process is und erway can be found in the labor market – which is still \nresilient overall, but cooling. In particular, the pace of hiring has slowed, although it \n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery  \nEMBARGOED UNTIL 10:00 A.M U.S. Eastern Time,  \nFriday, September 22, 2023 – OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n4 \n remains above trend. Job vacancies have declined and quit rates are nearly down to \npre-pandemic levels. Also c ontributing to the labor market rebalancing is an \nimprovement in supply. Indeed, we’ve seen some encouraging recent increases in labor \nforce participation, especially for prime -age workers (those aged 25 -54).  \nOver time, labor market rebalancing should res ult in wage growth that reflects, in \naddition to productivity gains, cost -of-living increases consistent with the Fed’s 2 \npercent target. Such rebalancing should contribute to a moderation in inflation in the \ncontext of maximum sustainable employment.    \nThis brings me to my outlook for the economy. Monetary policy has tightened \nconsiderably to date, but economic activity has been resilient – and it may be taking \nlonger than usual to see the broader economic impact of monetary policy actions.  \nIn particular, demand may have been less sensitive to higher interest rates so \nfar, because policy tightening has occurred amidst business and household \nfundamentals that are sound compared with previous cycles. Many firms have been \ninsulated from the rate hi kes by extending the maturity of their debt when rates were \nlow, and because of higher profit margins. But cash levels are returning to pre -\npandemic norms and debt -market activity is picking up. In addition, households’ excess \nsaving accumulated during the  pandemic is declining, while reliance on credit card \nspending is rising. This all suggests that business and household spending are likely to \nbecome more interest sensitive, helping to temper demand growth and realign it with \nsupply.  \nI continue to expect that the full effects of monetary policy will eventually show \nthrough and place inflation on a sustainable trajectory back to 2 percent. But I’ll note \nthat the timing and ultimate impact of policy tightening to date remain uncertain. \nHistorical evidence is  largely based on experiences in which policy rates moved more \nslowly than in the current cycle.   \nIn all, the economic circumstances surrounding the pandemic and recovery have \nbeen, and continue to be, highly unusual, with important implications for polic y setting. \nAs I’ve said before, this phase of policy requires considerable patience, enabling \npolicymakers to better extract the correct signal from the incoming data, and allowing \n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery  \nEMBARGOED UNTIL 10:00 A.M U.S. Eastern Time,  \nFriday, September 22, 2023 – OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n5 \n some factors that have been supporting near -term activity to play out. The risk of \ninflation remaining persistently high must be weighed against the risk that activity will \nslow more than expected. I also recognize the potential for higher short -term rates to \nplace more pressure on some banks' balance sheets and reduce bank credi t provision \nmore than I anticipate.  \nI continue to be a “realistic optimist” – realistic about the uncertainties and risks \nto my baseline outlook, but optimistic that price stability can be restored with an orderly \nslowdown in activity, and only a modest un employment rate increase associated with \nsupply and demand in labor markets coming into better balance. Importantly, the \nongoing resilience I see in the economy and the progress on inflation so far lead me to \nbelieve that the pathway to achieving this desi rable outcome has widened.  \nPolicy remains well positioned to proceed cautiously in this uncertain economic \nenvironment, recognizing and balancing the risks while remaining resolute and data -\ndependent, with the flexibility to adjust policy appropriately as conditions warrant.  \n \nMaine’s Economy and Banking Sector  \nI’ll turn now from the national economy to Maine’s.  In my recent visits to your \nstate, I spoke with a range of people, and learned about some of the unique challenges \nand economic strengths. Challeng es include the fact that Maine has a population that is \nolder, and aging faster, than the New England region and the rest of the nation. That \nreality tends to reduce the availability of labor, which is something businesses large and \nsmall mentioned often.  \nAccess to affordable housing also remains a major issue. Maine employers told \nme about their difficulties finding and hiring workers for needed roles, in part because \nprospective employees are unable to find affordable housing in the area. And I know \nthat expanding access to broadband in Maine’s rural counties has been challenge, but \nremains a priority.  \nI’ve also learned about Maine’s many wonderful economic strengths. Among \nthem are the state’s rich natural resources – on land and in the Gulf of Maine – as well \n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery  \nEMBARGOED UNTIL 10:00 A.M U.S. Eastern Time,  \nFriday, September 22, 2023 – OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n6 \n as strong retail and healthcare industries, robust tourism and hospitality sectors, \nabundant small businesses, and a strong sense of community and pride of place.  \nAnother strength, of course, is Maine’s banking industry. Your banks employ as \nmany a s 9,000 Mainers, serving households and businesses across the state in \ncommunities large and small. Of course, banks face challenges, in addition to those in \nthe current interest rate environment. Evolving customer preferences require increasing \ninvestment  in technology, and you’re seeing increased margin pressure related to \ncompetition for deposits, and competition from new market entrants.    \nToday I want to recognize the critical role that banks of all sizes play in creating \nvibrant, inclusive economies. Community banks, like those in Maine, have remained \nresilient and continue to leverage the close working relationships they have within \nsmall er cities, towns, and rural areas. Community banks provide a critical source of \nfunding for small businesses. This was demonstrated, for example, during the \nimplementation of the federal government’s Paycheck Protection Program, as \ncommunity banks played a  major role in ensuring those funds reached businesses.   \nFed Chair Jerome Powell has noted that a robust and dynamic banking system, \nalong with effective and efficient regulation and supervision, helps to ensure that banks \nof all sizes can meet the needs of households and businesses in every community \nthroughout our country, in good times and in bad. And I fully agree that we must \npreserve and build on these strengths, and that diversity.  \n \nThe Federal Reserve and the New England Region  \nFinally, let me say a bit about the Fed’s activities. I like to say that our \noverarching mission at the Boston Fed is supporting a vibrant, inclusive economy that \nworks for everyone. As you know, an economy’s strength has many dimensions – so \nthe Fed has a broad portfolio of activities and engagements – all in the public interest – \nincluding monetary policymaking, economic research and analysis, bank supervision, \nfinancial stability work, serving as lender of last resort for banks, community and \neconomic development activities , and initiatives and infrastructure related to payments, \ntechnology, and finance. They all support our mission and our mandate.  \n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery  \nEMBARGOED UNTIL 10:00 A.M U.S. Eastern Time,  \nFriday, September 22, 2023 – OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n7 \n I’ll very briefly mention some of our work to support economic vibrancy in all \nareas of New England, with a goal of expanding o pportunities for everyone to \nparticipate in the economy. Since 2014, we have focused on encouraging local efforts to \nfind economic resurgence in smaller cities and rural areas facing long -term struggles – \nwe call it “Working Places.” It’s based on research  showing that an essential element of \nplace -based economic resilience is cross -sector collaboration, among local individuals \nwilling to take on shared leadership. In Maine, there are such local efforts in six areas: \nGreater Bangor, the Katahdin region, Lew iston -Auburn, Maine Highlands, Sagadahoc \nCounty, and in Washington County with the Passamaquoddy Tribe.   \nThe Fed’s work helps the local, collaborative networks emerge and flourish. We \nfind that people really do want to work together to solve problems. I s uspect that’s \nbecause improving opportunities for people and places to not be left behind – but rather \njoin in the economy – is good economics, good citizenship, and good business! I’m \nencouraged that local, tangible efforts like these are adding up to rea l strength in our \nregion. I know Maine’s bankers work to provide the services and credit that help \ncommunities prosper, and at the central bank we look forward to continuing to \ncollaborate with you in the public interest.  \n \nConcluding Observations  \nIn conclu sion, I’ll say that the privilege and responsibility of a policymaking role \nlike mine makes frequent engagement with stakeholders essential. So I will continue to \nprioritize taking cross -sector visits to each New England state, and hearing from those \nin a wide range of roles, who make up and shape our economy and the financial \nsystem.  \nSince its inception 110 years ago and by its very design, the U.S. central bank \nhas deep and varied interactions with banks and bankers; ranging from safety and \nsoundness to payments infrastructure, to credit access and economic development. I \nlook forward to continuing to work with you to support the people and places of Maine, \nNew England, and the nation with a vibrant, inclusive economy and financial system.  \nThank you  again  for having me join you today .",

Collins  \nPresident & Chief Executive Officer  \nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston  \n  \nOctober 11, 2023 \nWellesley , Massachusetts  \n \n \n \nThe views expressed today are my own, not necessarily those of my colleagues on the \nFederal Reserve Board of Governors or the Federal Open Market Committee.   \n \n   \n \n   \n \n  \n \n   \n \n   \n \n \n   Remarks as Prepared for Delivery  \nEMBARGOED UNTIL 4:30 P .M U.S. Eastern Time,  \nWednesday , Octob er 11 , 2023 – OR UPON DELIVERY  \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 4:30 P.M U.S. Eastern Time,  \nWednesday, October 11, 2023  \n Key Takeaways  \n1. Collins highlighted three main forms of uncertainty that monetary policymakers confront, all present in the \npandemic era.  The first relates to data and measurement  – how accurately statistics describe the variables they \nintend to measure.  The second relates to relationships between key economic variables  that influence policy \ndecisions – examples include the links between a tight labor market and inflation dynamics .  The third is related to \nunforeseen events,  such as pandemics, natural disasters, or geopolitical developments.     \n2. For policymaking, the appropriate response to uncertainty depends on its type as well as the context.  \nUncertainty can call for policy  to move unusually rapidly –  or to take a more wait -and-see approach.   In the current \npolicy cycle, this has contributed to different policy phases, starting with a period of holding rates low when pandemic -\nrelated risks were still high, followed by a peri od of aggressive moves, and then the current more gradual, patient \napproach to policy.  \n3. Some special factors have impacted the pandemic recovery that make it difficult to compare to previous business cycles, adding to the uncertainty.  Despite many expecting a slowdown this year, demand has remained \nremarkably resilient to date.  Household balance sheets have been solid, partially due to savings accumulated during \nthe pandemic, and corporate cash holdings have been elevated due in part to locking in fina ncing at previously low \nrates.  Factors like these have likely made the economy less interest sensitive than during past tightening cycles, to \ndate.   \n4. With progress on inflation and continued elevated uncertainty, the FOMC appropriately shifted to a ne w, \nmore gradual and “patient” policymaking phase.   Though inflation levels are still too high, taking the time to \nholistically assess incoming information is warranted.  It reflects the fact that we are likely close to the peak of this \ntightening cycle, wi th the risk of inflation remaining persistently high more closely balanced with the risk of slowing \nactivity more than needed to achieve price stability.  Still, Collins expects we’ll need to hold rates at restrictive levels \nuntil we see evidence that infl ation is on a sustained path back to 2 percent.  \n5. Collins remains realistic, but optimistic, about restoring price stability without a significant economic \ndownturn.  Overall, she continues to be realistic about the economic uncertainties and risks, but optimistic that price \nstability can be restored with an orderly slowdown in activity and only a modest increase in the unemployment rate – \nan outcome consistent with both parts of the Fed’s dual mandate.  \n6. One key policy lesson, Collins suggests with th e benefit of hindsight, relates to risks from supply \nshocks.   The pandemic represented uncharted territory for policymakers; and risk assessments, however difficult to \nmake, had to be made.   But Collins observes that the risk of widespread, binding supply constraints may suggest a \nstronger case than previously realized for insuring against too- high inflation by removing policy accommodation more \nquickly.   \n7. Collins also offered some takeaways to students about learning and careers.  She recommended a mindset \nof lifelong learning and seeking out thoughtful, capable people with diverse perspectives.  In working environments, \nshe also underlined the importanc e of gathering information broadly –  quantitative and qualitative – and intentionally \nhearing from a wide range of stakeholders, including voices that have not traditionally been “in the room.”  \n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery  \nEMBARGOED UNTIL 4 :30 P.M U.S. Eastern Time,  \nWednes day, Octo ber 11, 2023 –  OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n1 \n   Thank you for inviting me to be with you today.  It is such a pleasure to be on the \nWellesley campus with students, faculty, and community members.   \nBefore my remarks, there are a few people I would like to acknowledge.  First, \nthe late Marshall Goldman, whose legacy of insightful inquiry is rightly commemorated \nwith this annual lecture.  Second, the Wellesley economics department and your chair, \nCourtney Coile, for the invitation to deliver this year’s Goldman lecture.  Over the years, members of Wellesley’s economics faculty have had many substantive connections with \nme and also with the Federal Reserve System, and I want to express my appreciation \nfor your commitment to excellence, your intellectual curiosity, and your dedication to \nyour students.  I really must commend Wellesley as a whole, and certainly the \neconomics department, for sending into the world thoughtful, prepared, and very able \nwomen who have made an impact in so many fields –  not least, in economics and \nfinance.   \nLast but certainly not least, I want to acknowledge your president, Paula \nJohnson, and thank her for her leadership and, on a personal level, her friendship.  \nPaula and I got to know each other as undergraduates –  a few miles from here, and a \nfew years ago – and it has been so wonderful to see her many distinguished \ncontributions to societ y in the years since then, during her remarkable career in \nmedicine, public health, and higher education.  \n \nBrief Context  \nAllow me to preview what I’d like to cover today.  As you know, I’ve come to \nWellesley to speak about my role, and the Fed’s responsibi lities, in making policy –  in \nparticular, amidst uncertainty , and with a focus on the different phases  of monetary \npolicy during the pandemic.   \nI’ll start with a bit of context, to level set about the Fed’s policymaking and other \nroles.  Then I’ll turn to monetary policy and explore the important matter of uncertainty in \npolicymaking through the lens of the recent pandemic and ongoing economic rec overy.  \nI’ll discuss the evolution of the economy over this period and the corresponding phases \n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery  \nEMBARGOED UNTIL 4 :30 P.M U.S. Eastern Time,  \nWednes day, Octo ber 11, 2023 –  OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n2 \n of policy –  bringing the essential element of time and changing conditions into the \nanalysis.  I’ll conclude with some very brief connections to thinking about careers in \neconomics and policymaking.  \nOf course, I offer my standard disclaimer –  these comments are my own, and \nmay not reflect the views of any other Federal Reserve policy maker.   \nSo first let me set the stage with a bit of context, in particular for the students who \nare learning about macroeconomics and the role of the central bank.  Created by \nCongress nearly 110 years ago, and refined over time, the Fed’s duties support the \nfunctioning of the U.S. economy, in the public interest.  We do a variety of  things, \nstarting with monetary policy.  For me and my colleagues at the Boston Fed, the overarching vision is a vibrant economy that works for all.  I see our mission as serving \nthe public in New England and the nation by promoting a strong, resilient, and inclusive \neconomy and financial system.  \nBeyond monetary policy, we have other duties – which I won’t have time to \ndiscuss today.  They include\n1: \n supporting the safety and soundness of the nation’s financial institutions, by supervising some of the count ry’s banks and serving as a “lender of last resort” \nto the financial system;  \n mitigating financial stability risks;  \n supporting safe and reliable payment and settlement systems –  back -end \ninfrastructure and services to the banking system and the U.S. Treasury (ranging \nfrom currency and coin circulation to various electronic channels); and  \n promoting community economic development in a variety of ways.  \n \nMost of my remarks today will be about our monetary policymaking, but I’d like to \ntake a moment, with many economics students and professors in the audience, to \nhighlight the variety of research we do – which is wide -ranging, because the economy is \n \n1 Learn more in “ The Fed Explained: What the Central Bank Does ,” a publication of the Board of \nGovernors of the Federal Reserve System.  \n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery  \nEMBARGOED UNTIL 4 :30 P.M U.S. Eastern Time,  \nWednes day, Octo ber 11, 2023 –  OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n3 \n so multifaceted.  Our economists and their research assistants and analysts do \nfascinating, data- driven, nonpartisan, policy -relevant work, and I’ll mention just two (of \nmany!) recent examples.  Some of our researchers have studie d the attention –  or \ninattention – that consumers give to inflation, demonstrating that the absolute level of \ninflation is important.  When inflation is low and stable, consumers don’t really think about it; but when inflation is higher, consumers are much  more aware of it, and \npossibly more likely to change their behavior.\n2  Another recent study looked at the \npotential causes of racial wealth gaps and found that inheritances and other types of \nwealth transfers from one generation to the next play only a s mall part –  the main \ncontributors to the gap, the authors find, are differences in lifetime earnings and pension assets.  Therefore, policies that successfully increase human capital can potentially help \nreduce this gap.\n3, 4 \n Monetary Policy  \n Let’s turn to monetary policy, and the core of my talk today.  It’s important to note \nthat at the Fed we are entrusted with monetary , and not fiscal, policy.  This involves \nactions that ultimately affect the cost of borrowing for businesses and households.     \nThe Fed spends a lot of time analyzing economic conditions –  using data, doing \nresearch, and listening to stakeholders locally and nationally.  Having prepared in great depth, I join the other 11 regional Reserve Bank presidents and the seven members of \nthe Board of Governors in Washington eight times a year to discuss appropriate \nmonetary policy.  After taking in substantive staff analysis, and multiple go- arounds by \ncommittee participants, there is a vote on policy actions by the current voting member s, \nsome of whom rotate year -to-year.  The committee’s decision and summary of \nappropriate policy is released in a statement, and then the Chair holds a press \n \n2 See Bracha and Ta ng (2022) . \n3 See Sabelhaus and Thompson (2022) . \n4 Additionally, the Boston Fed, in collaboration with a coalition of community partners, is launching a \nmultiyear research initiative to explore wealth disparities across Massachusetts. Our findings intend to  \ninform policy and will hopefully be used by public, private, and non- profit organizations to develop \nstrategies that promote equity in wealth, a key foundation for greater economic opportunity.  \n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery  \nEMBARGOED UNTIL 4 :30 P.M U.S. Eastern Time,  \nWednes day, Octo ber 11, 2023 –  OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n4 \n conference to explain the committee’s decisions, which are then implemented in the \nmarket.   \nThe F ederal Reserve is charged, by Congress, with a “dual mandate” of price \nstability and maximum employment.  We currently define price stability as 2 percent \ninflation – a low level, where consumers and businesses do not see eroding purchasing \npower as a pres sing concern.5  Maximum employment, the other pillar of the dual \nmandate, is less specifically defined, but refers to the broad and inclusive goal of job \nopportunities for all Americans.  It's important to note that while often characterized as \ncompeting,  history has shown that price stability is essential for a well -functioning \neconomy, and an important precondition for maximum employment that is sustainable over time.  \n      Figure 1’s left panel  shows the evolution of the inflation rate since the 1960s, \nwith grey bars indicating recessions.\n6  While there are many inflation measures, I focus \nhere on the 12- month change in the price of personal consumption expenditures (or \nPCE), excluding the important but volatile food and energy components –  also known \nas “core” inflation7 and generally a good predictor of overall inflation’s path.   \nAs the figure shows, achieving price stability hasn’t always been an easy task \nover this period.  An inflationary buildup started in the mid- 1960s and persisted until the \ndisinflation achieved under Fed Chairman Paul Volcker in the early 1980s.  This was \nfollowed by an extended period of inflation moderation, with inflation typically near or below 2 percent since the 2008 financial crisis and Great Recession, lasting until th e \nrecent pandemic -related inflation flare- up.  \n \n5 While this argument holds even more strongly for a zero- inflation rate, one reason to target a positive \nbut low inflation rate is that it can be difficult for firms to cut wages. A positive inflation rate helps to \nachieve real wage declines that facilitat e adjustment when the economy faces a contractionary shock, \nthus alleviating the downward nominal wage rigidity constraint. For additional context see Bewley (1999).  \n6 See U.S. Business Cycle Expansions and Contractions , produced by the National Bureau of Economic \nResearch.  \n7 While this measure can be a better indicator of underlying inflation trends, the Fed’s inflation target is \nexpressed in terms of total PCE inflation. Salwati and Wessel (2021) is a helpful summary of different \ninflation measures . \n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery  \nEMBARGOED UNTIL 4 :30 P.M U.S. Eastern Time,  \nWednes day, Octo ber 11, 2023 –  OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n5 \n Figure 1’s right panel  shows the unemployment rate along with inflation, further \nillustrating the challenges monetary policymakers face in trying to stabilize economic \nactivity at a level consistent with both aspects of the Fed’s dual mandate.8    \nBy raising or lowering interest rates, monetary policy affects aggregate demand \nin the economy –  and Figure 2  shows how the stance of policy has evolved over time.  \nPolicy tightening – an increase in the Fed’s policy  rate, the federal funds rate – raises \nthe cost of borrowing for firms and households, with the effect of slowing demand for \ncapital, labor, goods, and services, which in turn relieves price pressures, tempering \ninflation.  Conversely, lowering the federal  funds rate, or easing policy, reduces the cost \nof borrowing, thus supporting an expansion of aggregate demand and employment.  This tends to increase price pressures, raising inflation.\n9  \nIt is important to note that many of the deviations of inflation and unemployment \nfrom levels consistent with price stability and full employment have resulted from \nunanticipated events requiring the Fed to react.  The COVID -19 pandemic is a prime \nexample – a shock originating outside of the economic system and resulting in a \nsubstantial disruption to the economy, requiring a response from the Fed in pursuit of its \ndual mandate.    \nSo, I will now offer some reflections on conducting monetary policy during a time \nof heightened uncertainty stemming from the unprecedented nature of the C OVID -19 \npandemic.  I will note that, while a keen observer of monetary policy for many years, I \nwas not involved in policy decisions until joining the Boston Fed in July of 2022.   \nA key takeaway for me is that the elevated uncertainty, and the risk management \nconsiderations associated with that uncertainty, played an important role in policy \nsetting since the pandemic began, and appropriately so.  I see the most salient types of  \n \n8 Fed actions typically are not intended to cause a recession, possibly with the exception of the Volker \ndisinflation. The Fed’s limited ability at times to stabilize the economy could be due to events that are \nbeyond the control of monetary policy.  For further reflections on these topics see Blinder (2023).    \n9 The Fed can also affect interest rates through instruments other than its policy rate, such as by buying \nor selling government -backed securities. These so- called large- scale asset purchases have occ urred at \ntimes when the federal funds rate hit the zero- lower -bound. The Fed also provides information about \nfuture policy (so- called forward guidance) with its meeting statement and quarterly Summary of Economic \nProjections.  \n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery  \nEMBARGOED UNTIL 4 :30 P.M U.S. Eastern Time,  \nWednes day, Octo ber 11, 2023 –  OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n6 \n uncertainty as having shifted, with somewhat different policy implications, as the \nsituation evolved – and will explore that with you today.   \nOf course, with the benefit of hindsight, some may argue that different policy \ndecisions would have been preferable.  However, I think it is too soon to judge how well \nthe Fed has managed the challenges of stabilizing the economy during this very \ncomplex p eriod.  We will have much to learn from the in- depth analysis that this period \nwarrants.  And much will depend on whether inflation returns to target in a reasonable amount of time with only modest effects on employment.   \nI will highlight that I remain a “realistic optimist,” based on my assessment of \ncurrently available information.  The ongoing resilience I see in the economy, and the \nprogress on inflation so far, lead me to believe there is a pathway to achieving this \ndesirable outcome.  In fact, that path seems to have widened recently –  although \nconsiderable risks remain.  \n \nUncertainty and Monetary Policy   \nFormer Fed chairman Alan Greenspan once noted that uncertainty is not just a \n“pervasive feature of the monetary policy landscape; it is the defining  characteristic of \nthat landscape.”10  So, I’ll next highlight three main forms of uncertainty that monetary \npolicymakers must confront.11  \nThe first is uncertainty related to data and measurement .  This refers to how \naccurately available statistical data describe the variables they intend to measure, and \nto the fact that some variables are not directly observable.  Two examples are maximum sustainable employment, and the underlying “neutral” interest rate, above which policy \nbecomes restrictive (or below w hich policy becomes accommodative).  Both are \nimportant economic concepts that are certainly affected by uncertainty.  \n \n10 See Greenspan (2004).   \n11 Accessible and thoughtful discussions about the different forms of uncertainty and how they affect the \nconduct of monetary policy can be found in, for example, Bernanke (2004) and Mendes et al (2017).  \n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery  \nEMBARGOED UNTIL 4 :30 P.M U.S. Eastern Time,  \nWednes day, Octo ber 11, 2023 –  OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n7 \n The second form is uncertainty related to the relationships between key \neconomic variables  that influence policy decisions.  Examples of this type, in the current \ncontext, include the links between a tight labor market and inflation dynamics, and the \nsize and timing of the effects of monetary policy –  the proverbial “long and variable lags” \nwith which policy exerts its effects on the econom y.  \nThe third form is uncertainty related to unforeseen events , such as pandemics, \nnatural disasters, or geopolitical developments.  While statistical methods can use past experiences to help quantify the first two types of uncertainty, these types of shoc ks \nresist prediction.  \nFor policymaking, the appropriate response to increased uncertainty depends on \nits type as well as the context.\n12  In many situations, uncertainty calls for a gradual and \ncautious approach to policy.  This can arise in periods of inc reased uncertainty about \nthe data, or the effects of policy actions on the economy.  Allowing time for the “signal” to emerge from the “noise” in the data, or to fully assess the economy’s response to \npast policy actions, can help –  leading to more informe d policy decisions, and balancing \nthe risks of doing too much versus not doing enough.  \nHowever, in some circumstances, uncertainty calls for policy to move \naggressively.  Examples often involve contexts where doing nothing or moving too slowly exacerbates the economic circumstances that policymakers are trying to \naddress.  For instance, too- small or too- slow actions to make monetary policy more \naccommodative at the outset of a major crisis could lead to severe labor market \ndisplacements that persistently lower employment, with significant pain for many.  On \nthe flip side, when there are risks of higher inflation expectations becoming entrenched, \na gradual inflation- fighting approach may limit policymakers’ ability to restore price \nstability without a significant downturn.\n13    \n \n12 See Brainard (1967).  \n13 For further discussions on this topic see, for example, Ball (1999), Friedman (1968 and 1977) and \nPhelps (1967).  \n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery  \nEMBARGOED UNTIL 4 :30 P.M U.S. Eastern Time,  \nWednes day, Octo ber 11, 2023 –  OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n8 \n The C OVID -19 pandemic was uncharted territory along all these dimensions of \nuncertainty, due to the size and speed of the economic disruptions it induced.  Figure 3 \nplots the severity of the pandemic in terms of hospitalizations and deaths.  This \nunforeseen public health event quickly moved the world to an eco nomic situation unlike \nany in the post -World War II period, with policymakers trying to decipher whether the \nusual rules governing the behavior of the economy still applied.  The pandemic also \naffected segments of the economy very unevenly, and in non- standard ways relative to \nprevious economic crises, making it more difficult to interpret incoming data and assess the effects of monetary policy on the economy.  And as time passed and the economy \nevolved, so did the nature of the pandemic -induced uncertainty .   \nThe nuances in how uncertainty influences policy decisions contributed to distinct \nphases  of monetary policy, which I will now discuss in more detail.  \n Background: The e conomy before early 2020  \nTo set the stage, I suspect it is helpful to highlight so me key features of the pre-\npandemic economy.  \nOverall, in early 2020 the economy was doing quite well, as can be seen earlier \nin Figure 1B .  Despite an unemployment rate that had fallen to near 50- year lows, core \ninflation remained below the Fed’s 2 percent target.14  Absent clear indications of \ninflationary pressures, the Fed was not actively restricting economic growth.  \nImportantly, this monetary policy strategy of letting the labor market “run hot” with \ninflation still below target was successfully draw ing more people into the labor market, \nbenefiting groups that traditionally endured higher than average unemployment rates, \nand fostering a broader -based and more inclusive notion of maximum employment.  \n \n \n14 Wage inflation was rising some but still relatively subdued.  It is possible that, given more time, wage \nand price pressures would have pic ked up.  Still, these pressures were potentially limited because output \ngrowth was moderate and relatively stable.    \n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery  \nEMBARGOED UNTIL 4 :30 P.M U.S. Eastern Time,  \nWednes day, Octo ber 11, 2023 –  OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n9 \n COVID -19 [March 2020 to  November 2020]  \nIn March 2020, the C OVID -19 pandemic struck, and almost overnight much of \nthe U.S. (and global) economy shut down.  Economic activity plummeted, and by April \n2020, the unemployment rate had spiked to 14.7 percent –  an extraordinary jump in \nspeed and magnitude.  \nIn addition to enormous public health uncertainty, the C OVID -19 shock created \nunprecedented uncertainty about the extent and length of the economic shutdown.  It \nwas unclear how consumers and firms would react to social distancing requirements, \nand limits on mobility.  Concerns also emerged about an extended period of depressed \neconomic activity, and with that, the possibility of falling prices potentially resulting in a \ndeflationary spiral.  And there were worries about very high unemployment leaving a \nmore permanent labor market imprint, despite the hope that many of the layoffs would \nbe temporary.  \nThe pandemic also laid bare and exacerbated labor market inequalities, as \nlower -paid, customer -facing occupations were affected the most by the shutdowns while \nmany of the higher -paying occupations could be performed remotely.  The left panel of \nFigure 4 s hows the disparities in unemployment by race, and the right panel by \neducational attainment.  Separately, closures of schools and daycares forced some \nindividuals – especially women –  who could not work from home to drop out of the labor \nforce at least tem porarily.  \nSo the situation involved considerable uncertainty about the possible extent of \nthe economic damage brought on by the pandemic, and the potential for significant negative feedback loops.  This called for large and decisive monetary and fiscal policy \nactions to avoid a worst -case scenario.\n15  The Fed cut its policy rate to essentially zero, \n \n15 A description of the fiscal and monetary policy measures taken in response to the C OVID -19 pandemic \ncan be found, for example, in Romer (2021), and Milstein and Wessel (2021). See also Alicia Parlapiano, \nDeborah B. Solomon, Madeleine Ngo, and Stacy Cowley, “Where $5 Trillion in Pandemic Stimulus Money \nWent,” New York Times , March 11, 2022.  \n. \n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery  \nEMBARGOED UNTIL 4 :30 P.M U.S. Eastern Time,  \nWednes day, Octo ber 11, 2023 –  OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n10 \n and provided forward guidance on the future path of interest rates, indicating that rates \nwould remain near zero until the achievement of certain economic conditions.16  The \nFed also launched an array of programs to support the flow of credit to businesses, households, and state and local governments.\n17  The Fed gathered additional sources \nof information18 as well, in an effort to reduce uncertainty and better u nderstand the \nextremely unusual economic developments.  \nElected officials provided extraordinary fiscal assistance to the economy, and its \neffects are still reverberating.  The extent of the support to households, for example, is \ncaptured in the large rise  of disposable income above pre- pandemic trends, as show n in \nFigure 5  – something that had never occurred to such an extent in previous downturns.  \nThe timeliness and magnitude of these fiscal and monetary policy measures \nultimately succeeded in preventing the most -feared economic risks from materializing.  \nThe unemployment rate dropped rapidly, and inflation did not decline much from its low, \npre-pandemic level.  Of course, containing the virus and the swift development of \nvaccines were crucial to avoiding a broader crisis.  \n \nThe reopening of the economy and the  inflation surprise [Dec . 2020 to Nov. 2021]  \nAfter the acute phase of the pandemic, there was a noticeable rebound in GDP \nand its largest component – personal consumption expenditures – in the second half of \n2020.  This is shown in Figure 6 , where both ser ies are plotted relative to an estimate of \nlong- run trend.   \n \n16 Initially, the guidance in the FOMC statement affirmed that rates would stay near zero until \npolicymakers were “confident that the economy has weathered recent events and is on track to achieve \nits maximum employment and price stability goals.” In September 2020, guidance was strengthened to \nindicate that rates would stay low until “labor market conditions have reached levels consistent with the \nCommittee’s assessment of maximum employment and inflation has risen to 2 percent and is on track to \nmoderately exceed 2 percent for some time.”  \n17 In addition, the Fed resumed purchases of Treasuries and government guaranteed mortgage- backed \nsecurities, first to restore market functioning and later to support the economy with low interest rates across the maturity spectrum.  \n18 For an overview of these sources see Cajner et al (2022) . \n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery  \nEMBARGOED UNTIL 4 :30 P.M U.S. Eastern Time,  \nWednes day, Octo ber 11, 2023 –  OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n11 \n However, despite this progress, there were worries heading into 2021 that \neconomic activity could stall.  The real -world effectiveness of vaccines, which first \nbecame available in December 2020, was still uncertain.  Another wave of the virus was \nunderway.  And so consumers’ willingness to resume normal activities was quite \nunclear.  \nAmidst this backdrop of continued high uncertainty, monetary policy remained \nhighly accommodative, even as inflation  started to pick up in the spring of 2021, as \nshown in the lighter line in Figure 7 .  At the time, the rise in inflation was believed to be \nmainly tied to supply chain constraints that would resolve quickly.  Expectations of \nfuture price increases remained  low19, reinforcing the idea that inflation could rise \ntemporarily without leaving a persistent imprint on the economy.  And although the unemployment rate had improved considerably, it was still around 6 percent in the first \nhalf of 2021, above levels considered consistent with full employment.  This state of \naffairs did not suggest an immediate need to remove monetary policy accommodation \nand tighten financial conditions.  \n In such a context of heightened uncertainty, it is crucial to assess the costs \nassociated with each risk to the economic outlook and devise the best strategy to \nachieve the Fed’s dual mandate goals.  And in the early stages of the pandemic \nrecovery, given the still uncertain public health situation, risks of demand setbacks \noutweighed the risks of inflation.  \nWith the benefit of hindsight, one could argue for removing policy \naccommodation sooner.\n20  But to me at the time, given the continued significant \n \n19 After dropping sharply with the start of the pandemic, market -based inflation expectations rose through \nmuch of 2020 and into 2021, but by mid- 2021 had risen enough to only equal their long- run average. \nShort -term survey -based expectations measures, while up a bit in early 2021, did not rise sharply until \nMay and longer -term survey -based measures edged higher but remained in a fairly narrow range.   \n20 Chair Powell commented at the March 2022 FOMC press conference: \"… if we knew now that these \nsupply blockages [and] the inflation resulting from them, in collision with … very strong demand, if we \nknew that that was what was going to happen, then in hindsight, yes, it would have been appropriate to \nmove earlier.\"   \n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery  \nEMBARGOED UNTIL 4 :30 P.M U.S. Eastern Time,  \nWednes day, Octo ber 11, 2023 –  OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n12 \n uncertainty, it seemed prudent for the Fed to support the economy versus pre- empting \nan inflation surge that few were forecasting.21   \nUltimately, the economy evolved quite differently than anticipated.  In particular, \ndemand exceeded expectations, while supply fell short, resulting in a large demand-\nsupply gap that fueled inflation.  By early 2021, GDP and consumption were already \nabove trend (see Figure 6) and subsequent waves of the virus did little to slow demand, \nwhich was unusually tilted toward consumption of goods, and away from services.  \nHowever, supply -chain constraints persisted as highlighted by the New York Fed \nGlobal Supply Chain Pressure Index in Figure 8.  While efforts were underway to \nunderstand the supply bottlenecks, including development of new indicators like the New York Fed index, it proved very difficult to assess the extent and duration of supply \nchallenges emanating from an atypical pandemic shock in real time.  Russia’s war in \nUkraine in early 2022 was yet another unanticipated event, adding to supply -chain \npressures and firms’ costs.  \nImportantly, there was  also the expectation that, as the economy reopened more \nfully, spending would shift from goods (which people could consume while sheltering at home) back to services, and ease price pressures for goods.  And given the expectation \nthat supply in the servic e sector could sufficiently meet demand, service- sector inflation \nwas not expected to rise significantly.  \nAgain, reality was different.  Households had accumulated substantial savings \nduring the early stages of the pandemic, thanks to the fiscal support and limited \nopportunities to spend.  So services consumption rose, but without a material decline in \ngoods consumption. Thus, there was little relief from supply chain bottlenecks.  And, \nmost crucially, labor supply did not rise as anticipated to meet servic e sector demand.\n22  \n \n21 See Collins (2023) .  \n22 The labor force participation rate collapsed when businesses shut down early in the pandemic. As firms \nreopened, the participation rate retraced some of its initial decline, but many workers stayed on the \nsidelines due to several factors , including fears of contracting C OVID -19, childcare problems and extra \nsavings built up during the pandemic. Participation was also held down by lower immigration (Peri and Zaiour 2022). Participation began to recover more robustly in the fall of 2021, the same time that the \n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery  \nEMBARGOED UNTIL 4 :30 P.M U.S. Eastern Time,  \nWednes day, Octo ber 11, 2023 –  OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n13 \n This led to a noticeable pickup in labor costs and services inflation.  Given that services \nare a significant portion of the consumption basket, inflation became very broad based.    \n Monetary policy tightening [December 2021 to May 2023]  \nWith broad- based wage and price pressures by late 2021, it was increasingly \nclear that elevated inflation would be more persistent than initially thought.  \nPolicymakers therefore began the process of r emoving monetary accommodation in \nhopes of slowing economic activity and bringing demand into better balance with supply.\n23  \nIn March 2022, the FOMC raised the federal funds rate by 25 basis points.  \nFinancial conditions had already started to tighten — especially in the mortgage market \n— owing in part to the Fed’s statements about its policy direction, or forward guidance.  \nAfter March, policy rate increases were swift, with a 50 basis points hike in May, \nand then 75 basis points at the four subsequent meetings, followed by another 50 basis points increase (see Figure 7 ).  By the end of 2022, the FOMC had raised rates \ncumulatively by 425 basis points —a very rapid pace, relative to the other tightening \ncycles that have occurred since the Volcker disinflation 40 years ago.   \nPolicymakers judged that high, unexpectedly persistent inflation, combined with a \ntight labor market, required rapid policy rate adjustments to fulfill the Fed’s mandate.  \nRates were increased an additional 25 basis points at each of the next three meetings, \nto over 5 percent in May of this year.  \nI will note that high inflation takes a toll on all of us.  In my travels around New \nEngland, I’ve heard repeatedly about the challenges households face from rapid price \n \nshare of foreign- born workers in the working- age population began to increase. As of August 2023, \nparticipation had increased by about one percentage point relative to August 2021, despite the \nlongstanding downward trend in participati on caused by population aging (Cooper et al. 2021).  \n23 In its December 2021 statement, the FOMC announced it was slowing the pace of long- term asset \npurchases and signaled that the end of such purchases was near. The Summary of Economic Projections \nthat acc ompanied this statement also showed an upward shift in policymakers’ expectations for the path \nof the federal funds rate over the next year.  The process of reducing asset holdings (so- called \nquantitative tightening) commenced in March 2022.  \n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery  \nEMBARGOED UNTIL 4 :30 P.M U.S. Eastern Time,  \nWednes day, Octo ber 11, 2023 –  OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n14 \n increases, parti cularly those with lower incomes struggling to make ends meet.  Inflation \nis challenging as well for businesses forced to grapple with higher costs and more \ncomplex planning and investment decisions.  So this battle against inflation was and is \nimportant, in the public interest.  \nUncertainty also played an important role in policy setting as the Fed sought to \ncombat high inflation.  By late 2021 and early 2022, the source of uncertainty had \nshifted from implications of the public health situation to uncertai nty about key economic \nrelationships – most notably the inflation process.  In particular, persistently high levels \nof inflation led to concerns about a possible rise in longer -term inflation expectations, \nwhich had it occurred would likely have made it more difficult for policymakers to restore price stability.  This type of uncertainty also argued for aggressive rate increases.  \nThe focus on bringing inflation down and containing longer -run inflation \nexpectations in turn created additional uncertainty about the economy’s ability to \nwithstand a rapid tightening of financial conditions.  The banking stresses caused by the \ncollapse of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank in early March 2023 added to this \nconcern, as many expected the banking turmoil to rest rict consumer and business credit \nbeyond the typical impact of policy tightening.\n24  \nDespite many forecasters expecting a slowdown this year, demand has remained \nremarkably resilient to date.  Indeed, since the beginning of the tightening cycle, the econom y has remained in a relatively strong position.  Household balance sheets have \nbeen solid, partially due to savings accumulated during the early stages of the \npandemic, and corporate cash holdings have been elevated, due in part to firms’ ability \nto lock i n financing at low rates early in the pandemic.  These factors have likely made \nthe economy less interest sensitive than during past tightening cycles.  \nMore recently, however, there is evidence that firms’ cash holdings are declining, \nand households’ stock s of accumulated excess savings are diminishing.  Therefore, the \n \n24 To address the banking stress, the Fed in conjunction with the Treasury Department enacted the Bank \nTerm Funding Program (BTFP) , which helped relieve banking strains and likely limited additional credit \ncontraction.  \n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery  \nEMBARGOED UNTIL 4 :30 P.M U.S. Eastern Time,  \nWednes day, Octo ber 11, 2023 –  OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n15 \n need for credit is rising.  These developments will eventually make demand more \nresponsive to high interest rates.  \n The most recent policy phase, and looking ahead  \nWith interest rates firmly  in a range that will restrict the economy, we are starting \nto see promising signs of policy having the desired effects.   \nIn particular, the darker line in Figure 9 shows that total PCE inflation (which \nincludes the volatile food and energy prices) is dow n considerably from its peak.  Core \nPCE inflation has also moderated some, but has some way to go to return to 2 percent, and it is too soon to tell whether recent progress will be sustained.  \nDisaggregating core PCE inflation into its three main component s, as shown in \nFigure 10, provides valuable insight into the different drivers of inflation.  Inflation for \ngoods  (the dark blue line) has decreased noticeably with the improvement in supply \nconditions.  And as lower market rents are starting to pass through, housing or shelter  \ninflation (the lighter blue line) is moderating as well.   But core inflation for non -hous ing \nservices (orange line) remains elevated, and this accounts for over half of core \nconsumption.  Bringing this component down will likely require labor market conditions \nto cool more, since labor represents a large share of costs in the services sector.   \nWhile the unemployment rate remains near historic lows, there is some evidence \nof demand becoming better aligned with supply in the labor market.  Despite the \nSeptember jump in employment, growth in payrolls this year has slowed relative to last \nyear though it is still significantly above trend (see Figure 11 ).  The previously very high \nvoluntary quit rate has fallen to pre- pandemic levels.  Lower, though still high, job \nvacancies are also consistent with a gradually cooling labor market.  We are also seeing promising developments in terms of labor supply as labor force participation has \nincreased, especially for prime- age workers (those aged 25 to 54), as also shown in \nFigure 11.   \nIn this context, the FOMC shifted to a new, more gradual, policymaking phase \nthis summer –  holding rates constant in June and again September, after a 25 basis \npoint hike in July.  \n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery  \nEMBARGOED UNTIL 4 :30 P.M U.S. Eastern Time,  \nWednes day, Octo ber 11, 2023 –  OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n16 \n In my view, this transition to a more patient, approach –  taking the time to \nholistically assess incoming information –  was warranted for a number of reasons.  In \nparticular, it reflects the fact that we are likely close to, and possibly at, the peak of this \ntightening cycle, with the risk of inflation remaining persistently high more closely \nbalanced with the risk of slowing activity more than needed t o achieve price stability.   \nOnce again, appropriate policy in this phase is importantly influenced by \nuncertainty and related risk assessments.  With inflation expectations well anchored, the \nuncertainty now relates more to difficulty assessing the ultimate impact of our policy \nactions to date25 and to extracting signal from data that are noisier than usual.26  In \nreviewing incoming economic data, I avoid focusing on individual data points, looking instead for trends that show both sustained reductions in inflation, and progress on the \nunderlying goal of realigning supply and demand.   \nPatience will give us tim e to better separate “signal” from “noise” in the data and \nto balance risks, as the effects of tighter policy continue to work through the economy.  \nI expect we’ll need to hold rates at restrictive levels for some time – until we see \nevidence that inflation is on a sustained path back to 2 percent.  And while we are likely \nnear, and could be at, the peak for policy rates, further tightening could be warranted depending on incoming information.  \nOverall, I continue to be realistic about the economic uncertain ties and risks, but \noptimistic that price stability can be restored with an orderly slowdown in activity and \nonly a modest increase in the unemployment rate –  an outcome consistent with both \nparts of the Fed’s dual mandate.  \n \n \n \n \n25 Estimates of the peak effect of monetary policy on activity and inflation vary considerably in terms of \ntiming and magnitude. For a review see,  for example,  Havranek and Rusnak (2013).  \n26 For instance, monthly inflation readings have been more volatile than usual since the beginning of the \npandemic.  Co nsumers’ spending patterns have also changed, creating issues with seasonal adjustment, \nand with inferring the underlying strength of demand.  \n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery  \nEMBARGOED UNTIL 4 :30 P.M U.S. Eastern Time,  \nWednes day, Octo ber 11, 2023 –  OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n17 \n Some closing policy thoughts  \nLooking ahead, there will be many important policy -relevant issues to be studied \nfrom the still -evolving business cycle induced by the pandemic. That said, I hope I have \nconveyed the important role for uncertainty considerations in setting monetar y policy.    \nThere are different types of uncertainty.   And depending on type as well as \ncontext, uncertainty can call for policy to move unusually rapidly –  or to take a more \nwait-and-see approach.   In the current policy tightening cycle, this has contribu ted to \ndifferent policy phases, with a period of aggressive moves followed by the current more \ngradual approach to policy.  \nThe pandemic represented uncharted territory for policymakers, and risk \nassessments, however difficult to make, had to be made.   One lesson I’ll offer, with the \nbenefit of hindsight, relates to risks from supply shocks.   In particular, the risk of \nwidespread, binding supply constraints may suggest a stronger case than previously \nrealized for insuring against too- high inflation by removi ng policy accommodation more \nquickly.   More generally, I look forward to the extensive research and debate to come, \nas we endeavor to draw additional lessons, deepen understanding and improve policy.  \nStill, despite the evolving uncertainties about the econ omy and appropriate \npolicy, I hope that you, like me, are encouraged by the economy’s resilience and the \nprogress on inflation to date.  \n \nConcluding Observations  \nI’ve shared a lot with you today, including about the need for reflection, learning, \nand humili ty for policymakers, especially in extraordinary times.  The backdrop has \nbeen uncertainty –  that will remain and be elevated at times.  In this context, I’ll end by \noffering some concluding thoughts from my own career journey, which I hope you may \nfind helpful.   \n First, lifelong learning is essential -  for individuals and for institutions.  I see this \nas more than an activity –  it is a mindset.  In an uncertain, evolving world, drawing \nlessons from past experiences will help us do better and improve outco mes.  \n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery  \nEMBARGOED UNTIL 4 :30 P.M U.S. Eastern Time,  \nWednes day, Octo ber 11, 2023 –  OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n18 \n Developing new skills and expanding knowledge positions us for future opportunities.  I \nhope you also agree that it is great fun.  For me, learning is one of life’s joys.  \n Second, seeking out thoughtful, capable people with diverse perspectives –  \nincluding those you may disagree with – is a valuable practice, for policymaking, for \nwork, and in life.  Listen well so that you can learn.  Hopefully, you’ll also develop strong partners and collaborators who can assist and support you in navigating uncertain \ncontexts.  And I encourage you to share your own perspectives –  smart, capable \nWellesley women have a lot to contribute!  \nA third, related, point is the importance of gathering information broadly.  This \ndeepens understandings and can help moderate uncer tainty.  By information, I mean \nboth quantitative data, which is core to empirical economics, and  qualitative information, \nsuch as from case studies and narratives.  I’m excited to see technology leading to new data sets we can parse for insights.  I also see intentionally hearing from a wide range \nof stakeholders as complementary to the collection and analysis of statistical data –  \nincluding hearing from voices that have not traditionally been in the room.  \nThat brings me to where we started: economics.  It  is a field that opens doors –  \nthough there is important work, for those of us in this field, to ensure that economics \nitself is open and inclusive.  For me, the discipline that intrigued me as a teen has been \na great foundation for a decades -long (still u nfolding!) varied and fascinating \nprofessional career.  Time and again, I’ve valued the structured approach economics brings to analyzing complex contexts and to drawing inference from data sets.  Its \nframeworks are extremely useful for making decisions under uncertainty.  And so, I \ncongratulate, and hope to encourage and even inspire, those of you who are studying, \nand teaching economics.   \nThank you for having me here to discuss this period of extraordinary uncertainty \nand challenge ushered in by the COVI D-19 pandemic, and its implications for current \nand future monetary policy.  Of course, uncertainty is everywhere and a fact of life.  Learning, data, frameworks and flexibility can help us address it and can also enrich our \nlives professionally and personally.   \nIt has been a pleasure to share my views, and I wish each of you the very best.   \n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery  \nEMBARGOED UNTIL 4 :30 P.M U.S. Eastern Time,  \nWednes day, Octo ber 11, 2023 –  OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n19 \n References  \n \nBall, Laurence. 1999. “ Aggregate Demand and Long- Run Unemployment .”  Brookings \nPapers on Economic Activity  No. 2: 189– 251.  \nBernanke, Ben S. 2004.  “ Gradualism .” Speech delivered at an economics luncheon co-\nsponsored by the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco (Seattle Branch) and the \nUniversity of Washington.

Collins  \nPresident & Chief Executive Officer  \nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston  \n   \nOctober 12, 2023 \nBoston, Massachusetts  \n \n \n \nThe views expressed today are my own, not necessarily those of my colleagues on the \nFederal Reserve Board of Governors or the Federal Open Market Committee.   \n \n   \n \n   \n \n  \n \n   \n \n   \n   Remarks as Prepared for Delivery  \nEMBARGOED UNTIL 4:00 P .M U.S. Eastern Time,  \nThursday , October 12, 202 3 – OR UPON DELIVERY  \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 4: 00 P.M U.S. Eastern Time,  \nThursday, October 12 , 2023  \n    \n \n Key Takeaways  \n1. Collins knows inflation is still taking a toll across New England, but inflation is moderating.  \nIn her travels around New England, Collins has spoken with residents and business owners who are \ncontinuing to struggle with higher prices.  But she sees the  Fed making progress in its efforts to lower \ninflation, as some signs are emerging that demand and supply are realigning.  \n2. Despite some favorable indicators, Collins says it’s too soon to be confident that inflation is on a \nsustained trajectory back to  the Fed’s 2 percent target.   \nCollins says much of the recent moderation in the core inflation measure is due to declines in core goods \ninflation, which can be traced to improvements in supply chain conditions.  But she adds that firms’ \nincentives to pass on these costs savings may be short -lived unless demand slows.  Meanwhile, core \nservices inflation remains elevated.   \n3. The recovery from the pandemic has been unusual, and Collins says that in this highly uncertain environment, policymaking requires pat ience.  \nCollins says that policymakers need time to draw conclusions about the data and allow special factors that have been supporting near term activity to play out.  She adds it’s unlikely we’ve yet seen the full effects of \nthe Fed’s actions to date, so patience is critical as policymakers weigh the risk of inflation remaining persistently high against the risk of activity slowing more than expected.  \n4. Recent increases in long- term interest rates reinforce Collins’ view that we’re very near or \nperhaps at the peak of the current tightening cycle.  \nCollins noted the 10- year Treasury yield has moved up since mid- September, and that increase has been \naccompanied by higher corporate bond yields and mortgage rates.  Collins says the rise in these rates \nimplies s ome tightening of financial conditions, which if persistent could reduce the need for further \nmonetary policy tightening.  It also reinforces her view that we are very near or perhaps at the peak of this \ntightening cycle.  \n5. Collins’ travels around New England have given her insight into its strengths and challenges and shown her again how important community banks are to regional economic health.  \nShared concerns include childcare, housing, and infrastructure.  At the same time, the region benefits from \nits collective brainpower, a diverse and skilled workforce, and relatively high job opportunity.  Collins says \nthe region’s banking industry plays an essential role everywhere, serving communities of all sizes and providing households and businesses with the funding they need for economic health and growth. \n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery  \nEMBARGOED UNTIL 4 :00 P.M U.S. Eastern Time,  \nThursday, Octo ber 12, 2023 –  OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n1 \n Good afternoon.  I’m delighted to join you today, for the 22nd Annual Regional & \nCommunity Bankers Conference.   I’d like to thank the team here at the Boston Fed –  including \nthe Supervision, Regulation & Credit group , and our New England Public Policy Center –  for \ntheir contributions to this year’s conference.   \nAnd I’d like to thank all of you for attending.  It’s wonderful to have banking -sector \nmembers from all parts of New England here today.  In my visits to each New England state, to \nlearn from a range of stakeholders, I hear from workers, entrepreneurs, small businesses, local \nemployers, bankers, community development experts, civic leaders, and many others.  It’s clear \nfrom those conversations that regional and community banks are a crucial, valued element of \nthe financial and economic infrastructure of the region.   \nAnd we appreciate your constructive engagement with us at the Boston Fed.  It takes all \nof us to support a safe and sound banking system, which is s o essential to a vibrant and \ninclusive economy.  \nIn our time today, I’ll provide some remarks before sitting down for a discussion with my \ncolleague Mike Ravid from the Fed’s regional and community supervisory team.  For the most \npart, I’ll share my views about the economic outlook and monetary policy.  I will also provide \nsome perspectives on banking, and talk briefly about the Fed’s work across the region and in payments innovation.  \nBefore I begin, let me note, as always, that my remarks today are my own v iews. I’m not \nspeaking for any of my colleagues at other Federal Reserve Banks or at the Board of Governors.  \n The Economic Outlook & Monetary Policy  \n \nI’ll start with the economy , and highlight the impact of some of the recent data on my \nviews about the out look and appropriate monetary policy – recognizing that some readings have \nbeen a bit surprising, such as the stronger than expected September payroll employment. The \nConsumer Price Index or CPI report for September was released this morning,  and I’ll desc ribe \nrecent trends in inflation a bit later in my remarks.  \nAs you know, the Fed has a dual mandate from Congress, for price stability and \nmaximum sustained employment –  and our current focus remains on bringing inflation down to \nour 2 percent target in a r easonable amount of time.  Price stability is essential for a well -\n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery  \nEMBARGOED UNTIL 4:00 P .M U.S. Eastern Time,  \nThurs day, Octo ber 12, 2023 – OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n2 \n functioning economy , and is an important precondition for maximum employment that is \nsustainable over time.  So, reducing inflation relates to both  parts of our mandate.  \nHigh inflation takes a toll on everyone.  As I travel around New England, I continue to \nhear about the challenges people face related to too- high inflation.  Households with lower \nincomes are struggling to make ends meet and businesses are grappling with the higher costs \nand added complexity that elevated inflation brings, for planning and investment decisions.  \nSo the battle with inflation is important, and in the public interest.  As a result, the \nFederal Open Market Committee (FOMC) raised rates rapidly, relative to prior m onetary policy \ntightening cycles, before shifting to a more gradual approach this summer.  We have made \nsome progress on inflation, as I’ll discuss, but it is still too high.  And given the persistent strength in economic activity, it is too soon to determine whether the slowdown in price growth will continue.   \nOverall, I continue to believe that the current phase of policy requires patience, allowing \nus time to review available information holistically, to separate the signal from the noise in the \ndata, and to balance competing risks.   \n \nOutlook  \nA few weeks ago, the FOMC released its Summary of Economic projections or SEP, \nreflecting the outlook of participants (the Fed Governors and Reserve Bank presidents).1  The \nmedian SEP forecast is for inflation to near our target by 2025 -26, as still -hot labor market \nconditions normalize.  Further, the median forecast sees the appropriate monetary policy to \nachieve such an outcome involving an additional 25 basis points increase in the federal funds rate this year, and then holding rates in restrictive territory for an extended period.  \nThis outlook in the SEP remains similar to my own.  I believe we may be at, or very near, \nthe peak for this cycle, although I would not take further tightening off the table yet.   And looking \nbeyond the “how high” discussion to focus on the “how long” part of this tightening cycle, I will say I expect rates may have to stay higher for longer than previous  SEP forecasts had \nsuggested.    \nLet me add that I continue to be a “realistic optimist,” and I think that perspective is \nimportant to emphasize.  I’m realistic about the uncertainties and risks to my baseline outlook.  \n \n1 Summary of Economic Projections, September 20, 2023 (federalreserve.gov)  \n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery  \nEMBARGOED UNTIL 4:00 P .M U.S. Eastern Time,  \nThurs day, Octo ber 12, 2023 – OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n3 \n But I am optimistic that price stability can be restored with an orderly slowdown in activity, and \nonly a modest increase in the unemployment rate to cool the mismatch in labor demand and supply.   \n \nProgress Realigning Demand and Supply  \nAs you know, recent reports on real economic activity have been strong, and overall \ndemand remains resilient.  Payroll growth jumped in September, with upward revisions to job gains for July and August.  And although the average pace of job gains has slowed this year relative to 2022, it remains well above trend.   \nSince demand outstripping supply in the labor markets has been a key factor driving \nwage pressures, and hence price pressures, some further rebalancing will be required for the deceleration we have seen in inflation to be sustained.  With rates in restrictive territory, I do expect that payroll growth and economic activity more generally will slow in the coming months.   \nThere is already some evidence of demand and supply realigning in the labor market, \neven though it remains strong overall, with unemployment still near historic lows .  On the \ndemand side, the previously very high voluntary quit rate has fallen to pre -pandemic levels.  Job \nvacancies have also been trending down overall, and are a good bit below their peak – though \nthey remain elevated, and posted a surprising increase in August.   \nWe are also seeing promising developments in terms of labor supply.  Labor force \nparticipation has increased, especially for prime -age workers (those aged 25 to 54), and since \nthe second half of 2022, there has been a noticeable pickup in empl oyment of foreign- born \nworkers, helping to alleviate labor shortages in some areas.  \nAnd importantly, despite the tight labor market, average hourly earnings growth \ncontinued to slow through September — especially on a 3 -month annualized basis.  This is \nconsistent with increased supply helping to alleviate some of the wage pressures.  These developments are promising, but to be sure demand and supply are coming into better alignment, we will need to see the recent labor market trends continue and broaden, including a moderation of hiring to a near -trend pace.  This would be evidence of the sustained cooling in \nthe labor markets needed to bring inflation to 2 percent in a reasonable amount of time.   \nIn addition, strong job growth and the overall tight labor market continue to support \nconsumption, which was quite solid in July and August.  High frequency data suggest spending \n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery  \nEMBARGOED UNTIL 4:00 P .M U.S. Eastern Time,  \nThurs day, Octo ber 12, 2023 – OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n4 \n may have slowed in September, but we will have to see whether this is borne out in the official \nretail sales release next week. \nIndeed, household expenditures have remained remarkably resilient to date, even in the \nface of tighter financial conditions.  This continued strength is also likely due in part to healthy household balance sheets from savings accumulated during the pandemic.   These stockpiles \nare diminishing, but recent data revisions suggest the possibility of somewhat higher remaining excess saving than previously thought – which could support household spending a bit longer, \ngoing forward.   Still, we are seeing some signs  of consumers becoming more financially \nconstrained as credit usage is rising and delinquency rates are increasing.  So faced with high interest rates, it is unlikely that consumption will remain as resilient going forward.  \n \nInflation  \nTurning to inflation, I will focus on the core measure, which excludes the important but \nvolatile food and energy components, since it is typically a better gauge of underlying trends \nthan total inflation.  Core inflation, whether measured by the CPI or the PCE price index, has \nmoderated but a key question is whether the recent progress will be sustained.  Today’s CPI \nrelease is a reminder that restoring price stability will take time.     \nDisaggregating the key components of this measure provides valuable insight into the \ndrivers of recent movements.  Much of the positive news comes from declines in core goods  \nprice inflation, helped by the improvement in supply conditions.  But firms’ incentives to pass the costs savings from supply chain improvements through to prices may be short -lived, unless \ndemand slows.  \nHousing or shelter inflation is moderating overall, but the September pickup in CPI \nshelter inflation – driven in part by the volatile “lodging away from home” category – highlights \nthat progress may prove uneven. In par ticular, we will have to see whether the recent pickup in \nhouse price growth will put further pressure on new rents, slowing the deceleration in measured inflation in this sector.  \nThat brings me to core services excluding housing, which accounts for a significant \nportion of the consumption basket.  Inflation for this component remains elevated and overall \nprogress has been limited.  Bringing core non -housing services inflation down will likely require \nlabor market conditions to cool more, as labor accounts  for a large share of costs in this sector.  \n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery  \nEMBARGOED UNTIL 4:00 P .M U.S. Eastern Time,  \nThurs day, Octo ber 12, 2023 – OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n5 \n Overall, it is too soon to be confident that inflation is on a sustainable trajectory back to \nthe 2 percent target we associate with price stability.  I’ll also note that it is important not to read \ntoo much int o individual data points, or even from a few months of information.  The monthly \ninflation data, for example, have always been noisy.  But the variability of core inflation has increased since the pandemic.  Extracting underlying patterns from noisy incoming data will take \nsome time.  \n \nPandemic Uncertainties  \nI’ll say that the mixed signals we are getting from the recent data highlight the need to \nfocus on trends and take a holistic approach to interpreting incoming information and determining the implications for appropriate policy.  Here I will highlight that the economic circumstances surrounding the pandemic and recovery have been, and continue to be, highly unusual.  \nYesterday I spoke at length at Wellesley College about the role of uncertainty in \npolicym aking, notably after an episode like the pandemic.\n2  While the nature of the uncertainty \nhas evolved, there is currently a high degree of uncertainty about economic indicators, including around underlying inflation conditions and employment growth.  \nAs a result, this phase of policy requires considerable patience.  Policymakers need time \nto draw correct conclusions from the incoming data and to allow some special factors that have been supporting near -term activity – and perhaps limiting the impact of higher interest rates on \nthe economy – to play out.  This includes households’ excess savings that I mentioned earlier, \nas well as firms’ elevated cash holdings and debt previously refinanced at low rates.  As consumers’ savings and firms’ cash holdings decline further, and more corporate debt needs to \nbe refinanced, tight credit conditions should act to restrain activity.  We will need to continue \nmonitoring these trends carefully. \nSince it is likely that we have yet to see the full effects of our past policy actions, \npatience is also needed in order to best weigh the risk of inflation remaining persistently high against the risk of activity slowing more than expected.  I recognize that higher short -term rates \nmay place additional pressure on some banks' balance sheets and reduce bank credit provision \n \n2 Reflections on Phasing Policy Amidst (Pandemic) Uncertainty  – 2023 Goldman Lecture at Wellesley \nCollege.  \n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery  \nEMBARGOED UNTIL 4:00 P .M U.S. Eastern Time,  \nThurs day, Octo ber 12, 2023 – OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n6 \n more than anticipated.  I’ll also note that, before the FOMC meeting at the end of this month, we \nwill receive additional, important data on inflation and real activity that will help me, and the \ncommittee , in maki ng an informed policy decision.  \n \nLonger -Term Rates  \nFinally, as we consider appropriate policy, it is important to take movements in long -term \ninterest rates into account.  Since mid- September, the 10- year Treasury yield has moved up \nnoticeably, though it r etreated a bit this week. However, on net, this yield is now somewhat \nhigher, as are corporate bond yields and mortgage rates.  Several factors may be driving these overall gains in long- term yields, and it will be important to see whether the increase is \nsustained, especially given the rate volatility in recent days.  \nImportantly, the rise in long- term yields implies some tightening of financial conditions.  If \nit persists, it likely reduces the need for further monetary policy tightening in the near term.   This \nreinforces my view that we are very near, and perhaps at, the peak federal funds rates for this \ntightening cycle.  \nIn sum, I believe the current phase of the monetary policy requires patience and a \nholistic assessment of available data, while we stay  the course to restore price stability.  I \nexpect we’ll need to hold rates at restrictive levels for some time – until we see evidence that \ninflation is on a sustained path back to 2 percent.  \nPatience will give us time to carefully separate signal from noise as we assess the \nincoming data.  It will also allow us to balance risks, as the effects of tighter policy continue to \nwork through the economy.  \n \nNew England’s Economy and Banking Sector  \n  \nI’ll now turn from the national economy to the regional economy, building from my \ncolleague Jeff Thompson’s remarks earlier today.  In my travels around New England, I’ve learned about unique challenges and economic strengths, as well as common threads that exist across much of the region.  The challenges I hear about that prevent people from participating in the economy or the workforce include real economic issues like childcare, housing, and infrastructure such as transportation and broadband.  In addition, pockets of the region face \npersistent social and economic challenges.  Those gaps for people and places are essential to \nrecognize, and can be hidden by overall aggregates that are quite favorable. \n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery  \nEMBARGOED UNTIL 4 :00 P.M U.S. Eastern Time,  \nThursday, Octo ber 12, 2023 –  OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n7 \n I also hear about and see New England’s many economic strengths.  Among them: the \nregion’s collective brainpow er, a diverse and skilled workforce, and an ecosystem of innovation.  \nNew England is home to world- class institutions and organizations in many fields.  Additionally, \nwe are fortunate that job opportunities have historically been plentiful in this region –  though \nwith some variation by area.  \nAnother strength is the region’s unique regional and community banking industry. Your \nbanks serve households and businesses in communities large and small.  Of course, banks \nface challenges apart from those linked to the current interest rate environment.  Evolving \ncustomer preferences require increasing investment in technology, and you’re seeing increased \nmargin pressure related to competition for deposits and competition from new market entrants.    \nI want to recognize the critical role that banks of all  sizes play in creating vibrant, \ninclusive economies.  Community banks have remained resilient as they continue to leverage \nthe close working relationships they have within smaller cities, towns, and rural areas.  \nCommunity banks provide critical sources of funding for small businesses.  This was \ndemonstrated, for example, when the federal government’s Paycheck Protection Program was \nimplemented, and community banks played a major role in ensuring those funds reached \nbusinesses.   \nFed Chair Jerome Powell has noted that a robust and dynamic banking system, along \nwith effective and efficient regulation and supervision, helps ensure that banks of all sizes can \nmeet the needs of households and businesses in every community, in good times and bad.  I \nfully agree that we must preserve and build on these strengths, and that diversity.  \n The Federal Reserve and the New England Region  \n \nAs I conclude, I’ll say just a bit about the Fed’s activities.  I like to say that our \noverarching mission at the Boston Fed is support ing a vibrant, inclusive economy that works for \neveryone.  As you know, an economy’s strength has many dimensions, so the Fed has a broad \nportfolio of activities and engagements, all in the public interest.  It includes monetary \npolicymaking, economic research and analysis, bank supervision, financial stability work, and \nserving as lender of last resort for banks.  We’re also involved in community and economic \ndevelopment activities and initiatives and infrastructure related to payments, technology, and \nfinance.  All of it supports our mission and our mandate.  \n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery  \nEMBARGOED UNTIL 4 :00 P.M U.S. Eastern Time,  \nThursday, Octo ber 12, 2023 –  OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n8 \n I’ll briefly mention some of our work to expand opportunities throughout New England so \nthat everyone can participate in the economy.  Since 2014, we have focused on encouraging \nlocal efforts to bring economic revitalization to smaller cities and rural areas that have faced \nlong- term struggles.  We call this initiative “Working Places.”  Our approach is based on \nresearch that shows that an essential element of place- based economic resilience is \ncollabor ation among local individuals from different sectors who are willing to share leadership.  \nIn nine years, Working Places has expanded to 30 communities in five New England states.  \nThe Fed’s work helps local, collaborative networks emerge and flourish.  Com munities \nparticipating in Working Places report solving problems, making changes that create \nopportunities and jobs, and enlisting new voices and partners to shape progress.  Local teams \ndevelop goals and strategies in areas including workforce development , poverty reduction, \naffordable housing, and removing barriers to entrepreneurship.  Local, tangible efforts like these \nare adding up to real strength in our region.  \nAdditionally, I’d like to mention the Fed’s work in payments innovation.  Since its \nfounding, the Federal Reserve has played a role in ensuring the country’s payments \ninfrastructure can effectively meet the public’s needs.  We demonstrate this commitment \nthrough continuous improvements to our financial services, and by taking accountability for safe, accessible, and efficient payments.  As everyone in this room knows, the U.S. payments system – the way consumers, workers, and employers make and receive payments –  has evolved \nmightily over time.  Not that long ago, the Fed was helping move check s around the country.  \nBut we worked with the banking industry to digitize check clearing, and create other automated channels.  In July, the Fed launched the FedNow\n® Service, a new payments “ rail” to make \ninstant payments secure and convenient.  FedNow enables instant payments to be processed \nat any time of day, on any day of the year , for a broad array of transactions.  The FedNow \nService is core payments infrastructure available to all depository institutions.  \n  \nConcluding Observations \n \nIn conclusion, I’ ll note that since its inception 110 years ago, and by design, the U.S. \ncentral bank has deep and varied interactions with banks and bankers.  These range from \npreserving safety and soundness, to managing and improving payments infrastructure, to \npromoting access to credit that facilitates economic progress.  I look forward to continuing to \n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery  \nEMBARGOED UNTIL 4 :00 P.M U.S. Eastern Time,  \nThursday, Octo ber 12, 2023 –  OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n9 \n work together to support the people and places of New England – and the nation – with a \nvibrant, inclusive economy and financial system.   \nWith that, thank you for the opportunity to be with you today.  I look forward to sitting \ndown with Mike for some questions.",

            "content": "Full Employment:  \nA Broad -Based, Inclusive Goal  \nOpening Remarks at the  \nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston’s  \n67th Economic Conference,  \n“Rethinking Full Employment”  \nSusan M. Collins  \nPresident & Chief Executive Officer  \nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston  \nNovember 17, 2023 \nBoston, Massachusetts  \nThe views expressed today are my own, not necessarily those of my colleagues on the \nFederal Reserve Board of Governors or the Federal Open Market Committee.  Remarks as Prepared for Delivery  \nEMBARGOED UNTIL 8: 45 A.M U.S. Eastern Time,  \nFriday, Novemb er 17, 202 3 – OR UPON DELIVERY  \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 8: 45 A.M U.S. Eastern Time,  \nFriday, Novem ber 17 , 2023  – OR UPON DELIVERY  \n    \n  Key Takeaways  \n1.  Collins emphasized that the two aspects of the Fed’s dual mandate are complementary.   \nWhile there often is a tradeoff between inflation and employment in the short run, history has \nshown that price stability is essential for a well -functioning economy – it is an important \nprecondition for maximum employment that is sustainable over time.  So, both aspects of the dual mandate are interrelated and complementary.  \n \n2.  A challenge for the Fed, explored at this conference, is how to operationalize a broad \nconcept of full employment when setting monetary policy.   \nFull employment  has often  been defined by referencing an unemployment  rate. But no one \nstatistic can adequately characterize the labor market, since aggregate numbers do not show the \nwide range of experiences across people, sectors, and places.  \n3. Collins emphasized the connection between the full employment goal and the Fed’s role \nin fostering a vibrant economy that works for everyone.  \nFor some people, communities, and places, there are substantial and persistent gaps in economic outcomes – including but not limited to employment. This underutilization of the workforce \nadversely affects national productivity and prosperity. \n \n4.  A better understanding of the behavior of labor force participation is important if the \nFed is to meet both its full -employment and price -stability goals, said Collins.  \nThe aggregate unemployment rate becomes an inadequate indicator of full employment when the \nlabor force participation  rate is changing. If participation increases in a tight labor market, labor \nsupply expands, and higher levels of economic activity may not generate additional price \npressures requiring tighter monetary policy. And the higher levels of activity and participation can \nbenefit those drawn into the labor market.  \n5.  It is essential to examine factors that could limit people from participating in the \neconomy, and to support research and collaborations that promote economic progress.  \nThe Fed’s mandate and the concern for a vibrant, inclusive economy bring our focus to participation in the workforce, and the challenges that can prevent people from doing so (for example child care, housing, and infrastructure). Often these impediments are long- run, structural \nfactors that cannot be resolved with monetary policy. However, to assess the productive capacity of the economy, the Fed needs to know how such barriers to employment are evolving. And a better understanding can lead to expanded opportunities for more people.\n \n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery  \nEMBARGOED UNTIL 8: 45 A.M U.S. Eastern Time,  \nFriday, Novem ber 17, 2023 – OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n1 \n  It is truly a pleasure to be opening my second Boston Fed economic conference, \nthe Bank’s sixty- seventh.  I’m especially pleased to be doing so with Egon Zakrajšek , \nour new Director of Research and chief economic advisor.   \n  Along with the entire economic research team, Egon and I are committed to \nmaintaining all that is special about the Boston Fed economic conferences .  Over the \nyears, these conferences have engaged a wide range of participants on complex issues \nwith practical policy relevance.  These conferences, and the learnings they yield, help \nus at the Boston Fed pursue our vision of a vibrant economy that works for all; and our \nmission to serve the public by supporting a strong, resilient, and inclusive economy.  \n  This year, we focus on full employment – one pillar of the Fed’s dual mandate.  \nAnd we build on last year’s conference, which addressed the potential effects of the \nCOVID -19 pandemic on the labor market.  Of course, our conferences do not always \ncover labor market issues; however, these topics have been especially critical lately.  \n  We have much to do over the next day and a half – so, let’s begin.  My role today \nis not only to welcome you and kick things off, but also to set the stage by providing a bit of my own perspective as a monetary policymaker.  Of course, I’ll add my standard \ndisclaimer – the views I express are my own, and I’m not speaking for any other Federal \nReserve policymaker.  \n \nFull Employment in Context  \n  I’ll begin with some historical context on full employment as a policy \nresponsibility.  In the wake of the Great Depression and World War II, Congress \ndeclared – in the Employment Act of 1946 – that the federal government was \nresponsible for fostering “conditions … to promote maximum employment.”  However, a Federal Reserve mandate for full employment was not formally adopted until the late \n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery  \nEMBARGOED UNTIL 8: 45 A.M U.S. Eastern Time,  \nFriday, Novem ber 17, 2023 – OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n2 \n 1970s.1  The Federal Reserve Reform Act of 1977 added the goal of “maximum \nemployment” to the Fed’s responsibility for price stability — leading to the dual  \nmandate.  This legislation was part of a broader effort in Congress to reaffirm the role of \ngovernment entities in promoting full employment, which culminated in the Humphrey -\nHawkins Act of 1978.2,3 \n  Of course, the Fed is not the only central bank that tries to balance price stability \nand full employment.  However, our legislative history has made the Fed one of the few central banks where a full -employment mandate is on an explicit equal footing wit h a \nprice -stability goal.  \n  In this context, I’ll reiterate my perspective on the dual mandate.  While there \noften is a tradeoff between inflation and employment in the short run, history has shown that price stability is essential for a well -functioning economy.  In particular, it  is an \nimportant precondition for maximum employment that is sustainable over time.  So, in a very real sense, both aspects of the dual mandate are interrelated and complementary.  \n \nFull Employment and a Vibrant Economy  \n  I want to emphasize the connection between full employment and the Fed’s role \nin fostering a vibrant economy that works for everyone, not just for some people.  This is \ncentral to the questions we will explore at this conference.  \n \n1 Earlier legislation had referenced a role of the Federal Reserve,  but it was not until 1977 that such a role \nwas codified. See then- Fed Chair Ben Bernanke’s 2013 speech “A Century of U.S. Central Banking: \nGoals, Frameworks, Accountability ”: \nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bernanke20130710a.htm .  \n \n2 Humphrey -Hawkins stated  the government’s responsibility to “use all practicable programs and policies \nto promote full employment, production, and real income, balanced growth, adequate productivity growth, \nproper attention to national priorities, and reasonable price stability.”  The act expired in 2000, though the \nFederal Open Market Committee is still mandated to present semi -annual reports to Congress assessing \nthe state of the economy and monetary policy.  \n \n3 For more on the history and evolution of the dual mandate, see Aaron Steelman’s Economic Brief for the \nRichmond Fed: https://www.richmondfed.tv/publications/research/economic_brief/2011/eb_11- 12 \n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery  \nEMBARGOED UNTIL 8: 45 A.M U.S. Eastern Time,  \nFriday, Novem ber 17, 2023 – OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n3 \n   We know that aggregate data show average economic conditions, and not \nnecessarily the experiences of specific subsets or groups.  But we also know that, for \nsome people, communities, and places, there are substantial and persistent gaps in \neconomic outcomes – including but not limited to employment.  A truly healthy economy \nneeds the best ideas, energy, and participation from everyone – with ample \nopportunities to work, contribute, and prosper.  \n  The Fed’s mandate and our concern for a vibrant, inclusive economy bring our \nfocus to participation in the economy and the workforce, and the challenges that can \nprevent people from doing so.  These include real economic issues like child care, \nhousing, and infrastructure such as transportation and broadband.   \n  The Boston Fed has a decades ‐long history of studying disparities for groups and \nplaces.4  We believe better understanding these gaps can lead to expanded \nopportunities for more people – and to those opportunities being more equitably \navailable.  This helps bring more people into the workforce, and strengthens economic \ngrowth and competitiveness.  We are committed to examining factors that could limit \npeople from participating in the economy, and where possible, to supporting research \nand collaborations that expand prospects for progress.  \n  This work relates directly to our mission and mandate.  And in that context, it is \nimportant to remember that the Fed’s portfolio of activities is considerably broader than \njust our core monetary policy work.  In our supervisory, payments, and community -\noutreach efforts, we promote financial stability and economic inclusion, access to credit for firms and households, and an efficient and reliable payments system.  Community \n \n4 We conduct research, and have hosted conferences , explor ing disparities in economic opportunities.  \nExamples include the 199 0s Boston Fed work  on discrimination in mortgage lending (see \nhttps://www.bostonfed.org/news -and-events/news/2020/10/landmark -boston- fed-hdma- paper -\nrecapped.aspx ), an d the Boston Fed’s 2019 research conference, which explored the growing geographic \ndisparities in economic outcomes (see https://www.bostonfed.org/news -and -\nevents/news/2019/10/boston- fed-economic -conference -on-reducing- inequality -between- places.aspx  and \nhttps://www.bostonfed.org/housedivided2019.aspx ). \n \n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery  \nEMBARGOED UNTIL 8: 45 A.M U.S. Eastern Time,  \nFriday, Novem ber 17, 2023 – OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n4 \n development activities, including our Working Places initiatives5, provide examples of \nhow to encourage local partnerships in New England’s smaller cities and rural areas, to \nincrease economic opportunities and progress.  Our roles and responsibilities in the \npublic interest also include rigorous, nonpartisan research on key economic issues, \nalong with convening stakeholders, policymakers, and experts around issues of \nimportance – such as in conferences like this one.   \n \nAssessing and Measuring Full Employment  \n  Turning now to the relationship between full employment and monetary policy, a \nchallenge for the Federal Reserve is how to operationalize a broad concept of full \nemployment.  I’d like to highlight some of the issues we face when translating the broad \ngoal of full employment into specific monetary policy decisions.   \n  Full employment  has often been defined by referencing an unemployment  rate.  \nSpecifically, the economy has been thought to be at full employment when the \nunemployment rate equals the natural rate of unemployment – the rate of \nunemployment consistent with a normal pace of economic growth in the medium to longer run.  The aggregate  unemployment rate is a useful summary indicator for broad \noverall labor market conditions.\n6  But no single statistic can easily characterize a \ncomplex and evolving labor market.  \n \n \n5 The Boston Fed’s Working Places  programs are based on research into resurgent post -manufacturing \ncities, and support the Fed’s full employment mandate. Research suggested smaller -city economic \nresurgence depends on a city’s ability to mobilize its civic infrastructure — leaders, organiz ations, \nnetworks, and resources — to pursue a shared economic vision. So the programs support cross -sector, \nlocal leadership teams (with public, private, nonprofit, and community members) with shared goals. Team \ngoals and strategies are chosen locally, based on need and opportunity. Winning communities receive grants provided by partners (not the Fed) including states, the private sector, and philanthropy. See https://www.bostonfed.org/workingplaces/initiatives.aspx\n. \n \n6 In particular, the unemployment rate has proven helpful in modelling the short -run tradeoff between real \nactivity and inflation that is summarized by the Phillips C urve.  The Bureau of Labor Statistics also \npublishes multiple measures of unemployment that try to capture different dimensions of labor \n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery  \nEMBARGOED UNTIL 8: 45 A.M U.S. Eastern Time,  \nFriday, Novem ber 17, 2023 – OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n5 \n   Since aggregate numbers do not show the wide range of experiences across \ngroups of people, sectors, and places, we also review disaggregated labor -market data.  \nFor example, one sees persistent disparities in unemployment for different racial and \nethnic groups, and across education levels.  \n  Unemployment rates that are persistently higher by race, or by place – as they \nhave been for a long time – reflect underutilization of our country’s labor resources, and \nthat adversely affects national productivity and prosperity.  Indeed, in the past – even \nwhen the unemployment rate was at what was considered the natural rate – many \npeople, groups, and places were excluded from full labor market participation.  That is, labor market conditions at “full employment” have not served as a rising tide that equally \nlifts all boats.  That had negative consequences for the affected people, as well as for \noverall economic performance.  \n  Recent history provides some important insights.  First, looking back at labor \nmarket developments during and after the 2007- 2009 Great Recession, we can see \nhow an aggregate unemployment  rate becomes an inadequate indicator of full \nemployment  when the labor force participation rate is changing.  After the Great \nRecession, the aggregate participation rate fell dramatically.  Some of this decline stemmed from long -run structural forces beyond the Fed’s control, such as population \naging.  But some of the decline resulted from the large drop in labor demand during the recession, which led to many workers becoming discouraged and dropping out of the \nlabor force.  To meet its full -employment mandate, the Fed had to determine how much \nof the participation decline was structural and how much was cyclical and could potentially be addressed by accommodative monetary policy.  \n  More recently, we’ve seen another example of how labor force participation \nmatters for full employment.  Since the acute phase of the pandemic ended, labor \ndemand has been outstripping the supply of available workers.  A goal of current \n \nunderutilization. For more detail, see https://www.bls.gov/opub/btn/archive/the- unemployment -rate-and-\nbeyond- alternative- measures -of-labor -underutilization.pdf . \n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery  \nEMBARGOED UNTIL 8 :45 A.M U.S. Eastern Time,  \nFriday, Novem ber 17, 2023 –  OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n6 \n monetary policy is, of course, to restore a better balance in the labor market, with higher \ninterest rates working to slow labor demand in this realignment process.  \n  But recently, part of the move toward a better balance has come through an \nincrease in labor supply .  The labor force participation rate for prime- aged workers \n(ages 25- 54) is higher today than it was just before the pandemic –  a development that \nfew expected even a year ago.  And some of the larger gains in participation have \noccurred among women and m inority groups.  \n  A better understanding of the behavior of labor force participation is important if \nthe Fed is to meet both its full -employment and price- stability goals.7  If labor supply \nexpands to meet demand in tight labor markets, then higher levels of economic activity \nin such times may not generate additional price pressures requiring tighter monetary \npolicy.  And the higher levels of activity and participation can benefit those brought into \nthe labor market, contributing to a vibrant economy that works for all.  \n \nA More Inclusive Perspective on Full Employment  \n  This process was at work in the late 2010s, when the aggregate labor force \nparticipation rate stopped falling as labor markets became progressively tighter.  \nMembers of some disadvantaged groups were drawn into the labor force as this \noccurred.  And the gains to those groups – and to the overall economy –  were \nsubstantial.8  \n  Fed Chair Jay Powell highlighted these significant and beneficial effects on \nseveral parts of the population in his August 2020 Jackson Hole speech announcing the \nnew monetary policy framework.  He recognized that “the robust job market was \n \n7 Other factors impacting full employment, not discussed here, are also important, such as the \nrelationship between job vacancies and unemployment.  \n \n8 After bottoming out in 2015, the labor force participation rate of prime age workers rebounded by about \n1.5 percentage points, roughly equivalent to 3 million additional workers.  Employment increased by an \neven larger amount – about 4.3 million –  given that the unemployment rate was falling over this period.  \n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery  \nEMBARGOED UNTIL 8: 45 A.M U.S. Eastern Time,  \nFriday, Novem ber 17, 2023 – OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n7 \n delivering life -changing gains for many individuals, families, and communities, \nparticularly at the lower end of the income spectrum.  In addition, many who had been \nleft behind for too long were finding jobs, benefiting their families and communities, and \nincreasing the productive capacity of our economy.” 9,10 \n  Consistent with the recognition of the different labor market experiences across \nindividuals and groups, the Federal Open Market Committee, or F OMC , noted as part of \nthe 2020 framework review that full employment is a “broad- based and inclusive goal.”  \nThe new framework also removed references to the FOMC’s longer -run estimates of the \nunemployment rate in assessing progress toward full employment.  These changes de-emphasized the use of a natural or long- run rate of unemployment as the key metric for \nasse ssing full employment.  \n  In my view, the revised framework reflects the complexity of assessing full \nemployment in a rapidly evolving economy.  And, by moving away from a definition of full employment that is based primarily on aggregate unemployment, the new \nframework encourages Fed policymakers to better understand potential barriers to \nparticipation for some workers during “normal” times.   \n  In many cases, these impediments are long- run, structural factors that cannot be \nresolved with monetary policy.\n11  Government policies designed to reduce skills gaps or \nameliorate child care problems over the long run will be fiscal, not monetary, policies.12   \n \n \n9 See https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20200827a.htm . \n \n10 In 2019 and 2020 the System held several “Fed Listens” meetings to gain a better understanding of the \nlabor market experiences of different groups that were an important part of the monetary -policy \nframework review process. Fed Listens: Perspectives from the Public (federalreserve.gov) . The System is \ncontinuing these “Fed Listens” meetings.  See https://www.federalreserve.gov/fedlistens.htm . \n \n11 These barriers often reflect structural impediments such as lack of child  care options, lack of \ninformation about job opportunities, or lack of appropriate skills.  \n \n12 Improvements in technology and changes in business practices can also reduce barriers without policy \ninterventions. As an example, the growth of working- from- home is thought to be a key reason why the \nparticipation rates of persons with disabilities have risen so much since the pandemic.  Our conference \n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery  \nEMBARGOED UNTIL 8 :45 A.M U.S. Eastern Time,  \nFriday, Novem ber 17, 2023 –  OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n8 \n   However, to assess the long- run productive capacity of the economy, the Fed \nalso needs to know how such barriers to employment are evolving over time.  And the \nlabor force participation increases during the late 2010s and after the pandemic indicate \nthat the impediments could be less problematic when labor markets are tight.  As a \nresult, understanding these barriers from both the long- run and short -run perspectives is \nessential, if the F ed is to fulfill its dual mandate.  And of course, as I noted earlier, this \nalso aligns with our broader portfolio of work, including our role as a nonpartisan \nresource, convener, and partner to support a vibrant economy for our region and the \ncountry.  \n \nOur Conference  \n  In that spirit, over the next day -and-a-half we’ll hear from paper authors, \npanelists, and discussants on many of the issues surrounding full employment, \nincluding how best to measure it.  Two panels will explore the challenge of assessing \nfull employmen t in real time, and whether the Fed should probe for full employment late \nin expansions.  These topics relate to the types of data that the Fed should use to \nevaluate full employment, as well as to the potential benefits and costs of tight labor \nmarkets.  \n  We will also learn more about potential barriers faced by some groups — \nincluding women, racial minorities, and people with criminal histories.  Other sessions \nwill review the evidence on programs designed to increase workers’ skills and will \ndiscuss the  growth of “gig” work in the economy.  Our keynote speaker, Cecilia Rouse, \nwill explore the roles that a strong labor market and supportive government policies may have played in generating the rapid and remarkably equitable recovery from the \npandemic.  \n \nlast year discussed potential long- run changes in labor markets brought on by the pandemic, so we won’t \nfocus as closely on those issues this year.  \n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery  \nEMBARGOED UNTIL 8 :45 A.M U.S. Eastern Time,  \nFriday, Novem ber 17, 2023 –  OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n9 \n Concluding Observations  \n  In closing, I want to express my sincere thanks to our keynote speaker, the paper \nauthors and discussants, and the panelists for their contributions to this conference.  I \nknow we will also have excellent comments and questions from the floor and during the \nbreaks, so my thanks to each of you for joining us.  I also warmly welcome those tuning \nin to the live stream.  \n  Now it is my pleasure to turn things over to my colleague Chris Foote, who will \nmoderate our first panel.",

Collins  \nPresident & Chief Executive Officer  \nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston  \n \n \nPublic remarks hosted by the  \nGreater Boston Chamber of Commerce  \n \n \nSeptember 26, 2022  \n \nThe views expressed today are my own, not necessarily those of my colleagues on the \nFederal Reserve Board of Governors or the Federal Open Market Committee.  Remarks as Prepared for Delivery  \nEMBARGOED UNTIL 10 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time , \nMonday, September 26, 2022 – OR UPON DELIVERY  \n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery  \nEMBARGOED UNTIL 10 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time, Monday, September 26, 2022 – OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n \n \n 2 Key Takeaways:  \n1. Policymaking  in the public interest : My Fed colleagues and I are \ncommitted to price stability and maximum  employment, our core mandates.  \nWe are tighte ning monetary policy, to bring supply and demand into better \nbalance and  reduce inflation to the 2% target before  high inflation rate \nbecom es entrenched in expectations  – for the long -term good . \n2. How I’ll lead: I’m committed to following data without presumption or \nbias as we study the economy .  I’ll complement data with outreach , to \ngather insights from stakehold ers in different regions and sectors  \nthroughout New England . I embrace  the breadth of our work at the Boston \nFed, all of it rooted in helping to support an economy and financial system \nthat works for  everyone .  \n3. Behind the scenes:  There is exciting work at the Fed to ensure the \ncountry’s payments infrastructure can meet the public’s needs.  Reserve \nBanks underpin many of the ways Americans make and receive payment, \nand the Fed is in the process of launching a new, real -time payments  “rail” \nthat will improve payments for all – called the FedNowSM Service.   \n4. In the region:  In support of a strong, resilient inclusive economy for New \nEngland, the Boston Fed mak es a unique impact through our “Working \nPlaces” initiatives, now in 30 com munities in five states.  The Fed does not \ndirect this research -informed work; it is truly local.  Collaboration across \nsectors and  working toward a common long -term vision generated at the \nlocal level, is the key.    \n5. A unique role and opportunity:  I am excited to be back in New \nEngland and work ing to  help the region’s economy flourish.  Many \nchallenges are not for the Fed to solve, given our toolkit and roles.  But our \ncommitment to a vibrant , inclusive  economy and financial system mean  we \ncontribute as nonpartisan, data -driven researchers, and as conveners \nhelping cross -sector efforts.  \n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery  \nEMBARGOED UNTIL 10 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time, Monday, September 26, 2022 – OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n \n \n 3 Good morning , and w elcome to everyone joining us .  It is wonderful to be \nwith you  for my first public talk as president of the Boston Fed.   My thank s to Jim \nRooney for his kind introduction, for inviting me to speak, and for opening the \nevent to all who wished to attend or tune in.  \nBefore we begin, my warmest wishes to those who are observing Rosh \nHashana h, and reflecting on the year past and the new year ahead.  We have \nmade sure the video will be available online for any who could not attend today.  \nI’d also like to  congratulate the Greater Boston Chamber for its focus on \nlong-term issues related to our eco nomic environment , such as  expanding \nopportunities for people in our region  to contribute and prosper , regardless of \ngender, race, age, or background.  Such opportunities are key elements of a \nvibrant economy.  And we appreciate the Chamber, and others, pa rticipating in \nthe work  underway t o assess, and address , barriers to creation of generational \nwealth in communities of color.   \nMy comments  today will touch on  monetary policy and the national and \nregional economy.  I’ ll also share some early observations about this very special \norganization with a public mission – the many ways we help foster a vibrant, \ninclusive economy that works for all . After my remarks, I’ll look forward to Jim’s \nquestions  and those from the audience . \n \nBy Way of Introduction  \nFirst, I’ll say a little more about me, by way of introduction.  My parents \nwere both from Jamaica ; however , I was born in Scotland and grew up in New \nYork City.  So perhaps it’s no surprise that I became an international \nmacroeconomist.   \nAfter grad school, I  work ed as a professor, researcher, and policy advisor \n– both here in Boston and in Washington, D.C.  As Jim mentioned, I then spent \nten years as  dean of the Ford School of Public Policy at the University of \n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery  \nEMBARGOED UNTIL 10 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time, Monday, September 26, 2022 – OR UPON DELIVERY  \n4 \n Michigan, eventually becoming provost, the chief academic and budget officer for \nthe University.   \nI had the opportunity to serve on the Chicago Fed’s boards for nine years .  \nThis really broaden ed my u nderstanding of the Federal Reserve and the many \nways it can help improve people’s lives.   \nThis role  at the Boston Fed combines three things about me – my \nbackground as a policy -focused macroeconomist, my  commitment  to educat ion, \nand my experience lead ing complex organizations with a public purpose.   \nI also recognize that I am the first Black woman to lead one of the Federal \nReserve Banks.  I see that as a privilege, a responsibility, and an opportunity.  In \nparticular, it is an opportunity to engage even  more broadly with constituents  – to \nexpand understanding of how our economy works , and how it could work better.  \nI am excited  to continue the Bank’s work, including with groups that have \nbeen under -represented in leadership and policy roles.  Our economy needs the \nbest ideas, energy, and effort from everyone.  \n \nPerspectives on the Economy, and Monetary Policy  \n  Now I’ll turn to some high -level perspectives on current economic \nconditions and monetary policy.  These views are my own; I’m not speaking for \nmy colleagues at other Reserve Banks or the Board in Washington.    \nCongress has charged the Federal Reserve with a dual mandate of price \nstability and maximum employment.  We define price stability as 2% inflation – a \nlow level, where consumers and businesses do not have to focus on protect ing \nthemselves from eroding purcha sing power.  Maximum employment, while less \nspecifically de fined, refers to the broad inclusive goal of job opportunities for all \nAmericans.  History has shown that pric e stability is a precondition to achieving \nmaximum employment over the medium and long run.  The two dimensions of \nour mandate are intertwined.  \nBut at the moment, inflation remains too high.  Rapidly rising prices for \nnecessities like food, housing, and transportation are also disproportionately \n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery  \nEMBARGOED UNTIL 10 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time, Monday, September 26, 2022 – OR UPON DELIVERY  \n5 \n affecting the most vulnerable.  And rising input costs , and wage pressures , \ncomplicate inv estment and planning decisions for firms , as well.    \nIt is the Fed’s mandate to bring inflation back down to the 2% target.  The \nFed’s monetary policymaking committee is called the Federal Open Market \nCommittee , or FOMC.  Actions taken by the FOMC since M arch, together with \nthe guidance provided in its most recent projections, illustrate policymakers’ \nresolve to address high inflation expeditiously, and prevent it from becoming \nentrenched in expectations.  \nThe rise in the overall inflation rate after the e arly stages of the pandemic \nstems from supply bottlenecks caused by the pandemic, and the food and energy \ndisruptions related to the war in Ukraine  – as well as  from the very rapid \neconomic recovery from the C OVID  outbreak, which has resulted in an extreme ly \ntight domestic labor market.   \nThere is little the Fed can do to alleviate pandemic -related bottlenecks in \nthe global supply chain and increases in energy and commodity prices related to \nthe war in Ukraine.  Some of the global supply chain problems that  contributed to \ntemporarily high inflation are beginning to fade.  But of course, we don’t know \nwhen the war will end, or when effects of the pandemic will fully abate.   \nFurthermore, domestic labor supply  developments are also beyond the \nFed’s control – though of course, we study these trends to understand their \nimplications.  An aging population, lower immigration, pandemic -related health \nconcerns , and early retirements have all contributed to a shortage of workers.   \nMonetary policy does, however, play a n active role in affecting demand .  \nAnd demand for goods and services clearly exceeds the economy’s productive \ncapacity right now, which is being manifested in a very hot labor market.  The \nexcessive labor market tightness is illustrated by an historically  high level of job \nvacancies – currently around two vacancies for every unemployed worker – and \nby the inflationary push associated with rapidly rising wages.    \nTo address this situation, the Fed is raising interest rates, which slows the \ninterest -sensitive components of demand.  Returning the markets for goods, \nservices and labor to a more stable balance is how monetary policy lowers \n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery  \nEMBARGOED UNTIL 10 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time, Monday, September 26, 2022 – OR UPON DELIVERY  \n6 \n inflation back to the 2% targ et.  I do anticipate that accomplishing price stability \nwill require slower employment growth and a somewhat higher unemployment \nrate.  And I take very seriously that unemployment is painful, and that its costs \nhave been disproportionately concentrated amo ng groups that have traditionally \nbeen marginalized.   \nHence it is no surprise that, as monetary policy moves to a restrictive \nstance to transition the economy to more sustainable labor market conditions, \nthere is apprehension about the possibility of a si gnificant downturn.  I do believe \nthe goal of a more modest slowdown, while challenging, is achievable.  \nThere are reasons to be somewhat more optimistic about the ability to \nachieve the necessary slowing of demand without leading to a significant \ndownturn , this time around.  Household and business balance sheets are \nconsiderably stronger than in previous tightening cycles, reducing the risk of a \nsignificant retrenchment in spending and investment as interest rates rise.    \nLabor market conditions also differ from past cycles.  Firms seem to have \ntoo few workers, not an excess, suggesting that this time a slowdown in activity \nmay have a smaller impact on employment.    \nDespite these potentially more favorable conditions, ther e are of course \nalso downside risks to the outlook.  A significant economic or geopolitical event \ncould push our economy into a recession as policy tightens further.  Moreover, \ncalibrating policy in these circumstances will be complicated by the fact that \nsome effects of monetary policy work with a lag.  \nI’ll end this part of my remarks by reiterating my commitment to bring \ninflation back to the 2 percent target, recognizing the toll that high inflation is \nalready taking, noting that it will be harder to bring inflation down if high expected \ninflation were to become entrenched, and reiterating that price stability sets the \nfoundation for sustainable  maximum employment.   \nReturning inflation to target will require further tightenin g of monetary \npolicy , as signaled in the recent FOMC projections .  It will be  important to see \nclear and convincing signs that inflation is falling, and I will continue to assess the \n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery  \nEMBARGOED UNTIL 10 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time, Monday, September 26, 2022 – OR UPON DELIVERY  \n7 \n range of incoming data, both quantitative and qualitative, as inputs to m y future \npolicy determinations.   \n \nA Focus on New England  \nTurning briefly to New England ’s economy, t he mix of cutting -edge work \nbeing done here, and the smart people who do it, make the region a national \ntreasure and an international powerhouse.  Of course, it does have  challenges.   \nLet me say a bit more about the regional economy – building both from \nstatistical analyses and what we hear from stakeholders.  I’m sure some of these \ntheme s will be familiar to you . \n Among  the strengths , I’ll highlight : \n▪ The region’s collective brainpower, diverse and skilled workforce, and \necosystem of innovation.  \n▪ The world -class institutions and organizations – in many fields, but \nnotably in education, health, technology, and finance.  \n▪ Our vibrant nonprofit, cultural, and public -policy sectors.  \n▪ The geography and physical features that make New England  such \nan appealing place to live, locate a business, or visit.  \n▪ And last but not least, job opportunities  have historically been plentiful  \nin this region – though  with some variation by area.  Of course,  high \nunfilled  job openings  factor into the region’s economic  challenges, too.   \nLet me summarize some key challenges and opportunities :  \n▪ I repeatedly  hear about the cost and availability of housing.  House -\nprice and rent increases  have been substantial .  Housing affordability \nendangers our ability to attract and retain the workers needed in the \nregion’s economy .   \n▪ In addition, p ockets of the region  face persistent  social and  economic  \nchallenges . \n▪ Concerns about the  reliability of key services essential to participati ng \nin the job market ( such as  dependent care, and  transportation).  \n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery  \nEMBARGOED UNTIL 10 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time, Monday, September 26, 2022 – OR UPON DELIVERY  \n8 \n ▪ New England, like many parts of our country, is challenged by \nreduced labor force participation . \n▪ And demographic factors, including net aging of the population, \ncontribute to lower labor -market participation and have implications for \nthe demand and supply of goods and services.  \n \nThoughts on the Boston Fed, as its New  Leader  \nMany of these challenges are the purview  of elected leaders and fiscal \npolicymakers.  At the Fed, our commitment to a vibrant , inclusive  economy and \nfinancial system leads  us to contribute as objective researchers ; and at times as \nconveners , bring ing attention to cross -sector opportunities . \nWith the fresh eyes of someone immersed in this organization for just a \nfew months, I’ ll share  some  early observations about  the Boston Fed and its \nroles, and what I would like u s to prioritize and build on, going forward.  \nOne is our tradition of analytical rigor, as we study the economy.  \nNonpartisan, unbiased research can be a public service, we hope, to anyone – \nand particularly those whose decisions impact others.  With a comm itment to \npursuing our dual mandate , I will focus  on the data and analysis as I participate \non the FOMC , as a voting member in the rotation this year , and going forward .   \nTo me, statistical data is complemented  by qualitative information  – \ninsights that stakeholders from different regions and sectors provide.  I’ve started \nengag ing with a range of stakeholders, to better understand the challenges and \nstrengths of the economy from their perspectives.  \nI’m also very c ommitted to the breadth  of our work at the Boston Fed.  \nWhat we do is much more extensive and varied than most people realize .   \nThe roles we play are broad, but they all have a strong link to supporting \na healthy economy and financial system characterized  by price stability and \nmaximum employment, our mandate.  Today, l et me mention two areas.  \nFirst, there is exciting work underway to ensure our country’s payments \ninfrastructure meet s the public’s needs.  Reserve Banks underpin many of the \n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery  \nEMBARGOED UNTIL 10 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time, Monday, September 26, 2022 – OR UPON DELIVERY  \n9 \n ways Americans m ake and receive payment – supporting coins and currency, \ncheck s, and electronic payment s (like the automated clearing house which \nsupports services like direct deposit, and systems that support wire transfers ).   \nThe Fed is building  a new, real -time payments “rail” that will change the \nfuture of payments – called the FedNowSM service.  Our C.O.O.  Ken \nMontgomery , and many others at the Boston Fed , are leading the execution of \nthis work.  \nThe FedNow service will provide a new clearing a nd settlement \ninfrastructure , enabling participating financial institutions to provide instant \npayment services in real -time – 24/7, 365.  The Fed’s connections with more \nthan 10,000 financial institutions mean this instant -payments infrastructure really \nwill be nationwide.  \nFor businesses, it will  mean the ability to make just -in-time payments to \nworkers or suppliers , or receive an immediate payment at the time of sale.  For \nindividuals, instant payments can be used to facilitate time -sensitive bill \npayments or  reduce high -cost “bridge” borrowing.  We recently announced that \nFedNow’s release is planned for mid -2023.  \nSecond , I’d like to mention work to support community economic \ndevelopment, expanding opportunities for everyone to participate in the \neconomy.    \nThe Boston Fed is making a unique impact on economies of smaller \ncities, regions, and rural areas through our “Working Places” initiatives .  The \nwork builds on  the lessons from formerly  industrial areas  that adapted well to the \nloss of manufacturing jobs  some decades ago.  Research showed that for \nresurgence , the key seems to be collaboration across sectors, and working \ntoward a common long -term vision at the local level.   \nSo Working Places, which began in 2013, ha s helped foster increases in \nthat collaboration among state government, the private sector, philanthropy, local \norgani zations, and residents .  The Fed does not direct this work; it is truly local.  \nWe help convene, catalyze, and connect  – and it makes a difference . \n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery  \nEMBARGOED UNTIL 10 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time, Monday, September 26, 2022 – OR UPON DELIVERY  \n10 \n Communities participating in Working Places report solving problems, \nmaking changes that create opportunitie s and jobs, and enlisting new voices and \npartners to shape progress.  Local t eams develop goals and strategies , which  \ncommonly include workforce development, poverty reduction, affordable housing, \nand removing barriers to entrepreneurship.  Working Places has expanded to 30 \ncommunities in 5 New England states.  \n \nConcluding Observations  \nIn conclusion, a t the Boston Fed our focus will always be on serving the \npublic interest.  We’ll work in ways both well -known and “under the hood” to \nsupport a vibrant economy and financial system that all can depend on.   \nThe challenges in our region, some of which I men tioned, clearly require \ncross -sector collaboration.  If sectors work together, there are opportunities to \nsecure a  regional  economy that flourishes for generations to come.   Like so \nmany of you, I am energized  and inspired  by that prospect.    \nThank you for  the opportunity to share some of my views .  I look forward \nto speaking with you, Jim, and  answering some questions.  Indeed, I appreciate  \ntalking with people around the region, in many different ways – including through \nforums like this .   \nThank you .",

U.S. Eastern Time, Friday, November 4, 2022 – OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n  \n 2 Key Takeaways  \n1. With inflation much too high, and job -availability  robust , the priority is to \nbring inflation back to the 2  percent  target, consistent with the Fed’s  dual \nmandate from Congress.  It is clear there is more work to do , to get there.  I \nexpect this will require additional increases in the federal funds rate,  \nfollowed by a period of holding rates at a sufficiently restrictive level  for \nsome time . \n2. Both unemployment and inflation are very costly for individuals and our \neconomy.  The costs for both are also disproportionately borne by those \nwho are most vulnerable in our society , like those with lower incomes.  \nReturning to low, stable inflation will set the foundation for maximum \nemployment that is sustainable; and for a vibrant, resilient, inclusive \neconomy that works for all.  \n3. Lowering inflation requires slowing economic activity, and bringing \ndemand and supply in the labor markets into better balance to relieve \ninflationary pressures.   While there are risks and uncertainties, I remain \noptimistic about the possibility of achieving this without a s ignificant \neconomic slowdown.  \n4. The aggressive pace of interest rate increases to date has been \nappropriate, given rates had been near zero before March.  Now that rates \nare in restrictive territory , the next phase of tightening should shift from a \nfocus  on pace  to a focus on levels  – determining the level  needed to be \nsufficient ly restrictive .  I expect it will be appropriate to continue raising \nrates , with the size of future increases determined by a holistic assessment \nof incoming information.  \n5. As policy becomes more restrictive, the risks of overtightening rise.  \nIncreasingly, these risks must be thoughtfully weighed against the risks of moving too slowly and allowing higher inflation expectations to become entrenched.  \n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery  \nEMBARGOED UNTIL 10 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time, Friday, November 4, 2022 –  OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n \n \n 3 Good morning , and thank you for having me speak with you today.   It is truly a pleasure \nto be hosted by the Brookings Institution for this talk.  My association with the Brookings \nEconomic Studies area extends back some 30 years.  I have many fond memories of my time \nas a senior fellow.  The  nonpartisanship, rigor, open- minded inquiry, and emphasis on impact  at \nBrookings  are values we share at the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston.  \nI also want to mention my appreciation for David Wessel, and his decades  of work  \nhelping  people better understand the economy and policymaking, most recently as director of \nthe Hutchins Center.  As a lifelong educator, I see this work as  so important.   \nI joined the Boston Fed as president just a  few months ago.  In this  role, I have the \nprivilege and responsibility of serving on the Federal Open Market Committee (or FOMC), which \nsets national monetary policy –  this year as a voting member.  \nThe committee met this week.  At this time of intense focus on the FOMC , I want  to \nshare my perspectives on macroeconomic conditions and discuss some key dimensions of \nmonetary policymaking in the current context.  \nBefore beginning, I would like to note that these views are my own, and I am not \nspeaking for colleagues at the other Reserve Banks or the Board in Washington.  \n \nOverview  \n I will start by providing some historical context for current monetary policy.  Then I ’ll turn \nto inflation and explore how we got to today ’s environment  – which is important for thinking \nabout mapping out future policy discussions.   I’ll then discuss the recent path of monetary policy \nand explore some of the challenges to determining appropriate policy going forward – and \ninclude some of my own perspectives on monetary policymaking.   \n After my remarks, I  look forward to answering some questions.  \n \nKey Context  \nI’d like to start with some context . \nNot long ago , the challenge facing policymakers was persistently low inflation, and how \nto increase it to the FOMC’s target.  Clearly, this is no longer the issue.  Inflation has surged, \nand remains much too high, with serious repercussions for households, businesses, and the  \neconomy.    \nCongress has charged the U.S. central bank  with a dual mandate –  price stability and \nmaximum employment.  We define price stability as two percent  inflation – a low level, where \nconsumers and businesses do not have to focus on protecting the mselves from eroding \npurchasing power.  The other facet  of our mandate, m aximum employment , is less specifically \ndefined.  It refers to the broad, inclusive goal of job opportunities for all .   \nHistory has shown that low and predictable inflation is an important  precondition for \nsustaining maximum employment over time .  In other words, t he two dimensions of the Fed’s  \nmandate are intertwined;  they work together  in the long run .  Price stability is foundational to \nachieving the Fed’s overarching mission, which is a vibrant , resilient,  and inclusive economy .  \n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery  \nEMBARGOED UNTIL 10 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time, Friday, November 4, 2022 –  OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n4 \n At the moment, with inflation well above the Fed’s  2 percent target, the Fed’s central \ntask must be to restore price stability.  The FOMC has  moved aggressively towards \naccomplishing this important goal, but the job is clearly not yet done.  I expect more tightening \nwill be needed.  \nThe higher  interest rate environment necessary to restore price stability has challenging \nimplications for real people.   I take this, as well as the costs associated with too high inflation, \nvery seriously.  Indeed, policymakers must balance the risk that inflation remains elevated and \nbecomes entrenched in expectations, against the risk that policy actions excessively slow down \neconomic activity.   \nThe economic environment is, admittedly, highly uncertain but today I will discuss why I \nam still optimistic about the possibility of restoring price stability while maintaining a relatively \nrobust  labor market.   \n  More generally, I will also discuss my perspectives about monetary policy going forward. \nWe are moving from the initial policy phase focused on moving rates into restrictive territory very \nquickly, to a second policy phase with a focus on determining how high rates need to go to \nreturn inflation to the Committee’s 2 percent target  over a reasonable horizon.  This requires a \ncareful, holistic assessment of available information and deliberate actions.  I will say more \nabout this in my remarks as well.  \n \nInflation  \n I want to briefly review how inflation  got to where it is , since that is important for \nassessing  how best to go forward.  \nThe initial rise in  inflation , across many  countries , resulted mostly from supply \ndisruptions rooted in repeated waves of the COVID -19 pandemic.   They  caused commodity \nprices to jump , and the cost of transportation to rise, particularly for imported goods.  Then, \nRussia’s  war in Ukraine disrupt ed production and trade for several key  commodities , such as \nenergy and wheat .  \nOver time it became apparent that problems with  supply were not going to fade as \nquickly as expected, while demand was noticeably exceeding  the economy’s productive \ncapacity .  To restore price stability, m onetary policy needed to respond  to realign demand with \nsupply . \nAs the acute phases of the pandemic eased, the strength in U.S. consumer demand led \nto a very hot job market , characterized by widespread job vacancies , rising quits  rates , and what \nI’ll call “ hesitant ” labor supply.  All these factors had employers compet ing fiercely  for workers . \nThis led to wage increases inconsistent with a sustainable rate of overall inflation .   \nA number of factors  have played,  and are playing,  a role in the shortage of workers –  \nincluding a population that is aging ,  early retirements, lower immigration, and some potential \nworkers remaining on the sidelines with  pandemic -related concerns.  So far,  high wages and job \navailability  have yet to prompt  a more robust return to the labor force.  \nClearly , the evolution of the labor market and jobs during and after the pandemic is a \nvital topic and , parenthetically, I want to mention that it is the focus of this year’s Boston Fed \nannual economic conference, which will take place in two weeks.  \n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery  \nEMBARGOED UNTIL 10 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time, Friday, November 4, 2022 –  OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n5 \n Returning to inflation , there is unfortunately little the central  bank  can do to address \nsupply  constraints  – whether related to C OVID -19, Russia’s  war in Ukraine, or workers’ \ndecisions about labor -force participation.  But m onetary policy  can influence demand, and our \njob right now is to slow demand,  to bring it back into alignment with our economy’s productive \ncapacity and relieve pressures on inflation.   \nIrrespective of source, current levels of inflation are simply too high, and are taking a \nsignificant toll on households and firms .  If not address ed, inflation  will be increasingly damaging \nto the economy  and its participants .  I’d like to spend a bit of time discussing some of these \ncosts, and why bringing inflation down is so important.  \n Of course, the Fed conducts  extensive  analysis of economic data.  We augment this \nanalysis by working to understand the experiences and economic realities of people and \norganizations in the economy.   For example, an increase in inflation can reduce consumers’ \nspending power –  and that problem is more acute for lower -income individuals.  I’ve heard \nabout the increasing difficulties that many lower -income households are having making ends \nmeet as costs for food, housing,  and transportation rise. The rise in fuel and auto prices has  \nalso made it difficult for some  low wage workers to accept jobs that require a car to get to work.    \nIn addition, m any operators of small businesses have told me about the challenges they \nare experiencing with inflation’s effects on their raw inputs and supplies.  I’ve also heard about \nfirms putting their expansion plans  on hold because of the uncertainty created by inflation.   \nImportantly , high inflation  also risks upsetting the stability in inflation expectations  seen \nover the past 25 years.  Without well -anchored inflation expectations  (that is , expectations  \nconsistent with the Fed’s  2 percent target) , the cost of bringing inflation down, which involve s \nslowing economic growth and thus lost output , would be much higher . \nUnfortunately, r ecent data on price inflation show PCE inflation only slowly drifting down \nfrom its year -over-year peak  of 7 percent , reached in June.  This has been disappointing,  and \nthere  clearly is more work to do to bring inflation down, as I’ll discuss shortly.   \nBut I’ll note that  other , related price indicators are providing more encouraging signs.  In \nparticular, some global supply chain problems that have contributed to inflation since early 2021 \nare beginning to fade.   Transportation costs and commodity prices have significantly retrenched \nfrom their peaks, and broader measures of prices paid by manufacturers have noticeably \ndeclined in recent months.   In addition, recent wage data, specifically the private sector \nEmployment Cost Index, grew more slowly than anticipated in the third quarter of 2022.  \nSo there are some hopeful signs, although not yet  clear evidence, that inflation may be \nbeginning to moderate.  It is also reassuring that long- run inflation expectations, measured in a \nvariety of ways, remain well anchored overall . \n  \nMonetary Policy Actions to Date  \n  Monetary policy makers  reacted to this significant rise in inflation by raising interest rates  \nrapidly . I would like to briefly discuss the recent path of monetary policy.  In doing so, I will \nexamine some factors that add challenges to determining appropriate policy going forw ard.  \nGiven the uncertainty surrounding the pandemic, and concerns over additional waves of \nCOVID -19, the federal funds rate remained near zero from the beginning of the pandemic until \nthis spring.  \n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery  \nEMBARGOED UNTIL 10 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time, Friday, November 4, 2022 –  OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n6 \n Since March, the FOMC has embarked on an appropriately aggressive path of interest \nrate increases , moving the federal funds rate from near zero to near ly 4 percent,  including this \nweek’s action. The strong pace of these increases in a short period of time has brought \nmonetary policy  from a very accommodative stance in March to restrictive territory  now, with the \ngoal of slowing demand.   \nImportantly, however, the work to tame inflation is not yet finished.  As Wednesday’s \nFOMC policy statement noted, \"the Committee anticipates that ongoing increases in the target \nrange will be appropriate ” until the s tance of policy is “ sufficiently restrictive to return inflation to \n2 percent over time. ”1 \nVarious indicators do suggest that the policy  tightening underway since March  is having \nan effect. Raising the federal funds rate – which is a short -term rate  – impacts the longer -term \ninterest rates  that affect people and firms’ economic decisions.   The runoff of assets from the \nFed’s balance sheet that was initiated earlier this year is also increas ing interest rates at longer \nmaturities.   In all, longer -term rates have proven to be more  responsive than in some previous \neconomic cycles, and this  amplifies the restrictiveness of the current level of the funds rate.   \nThis has been especially notable with mortgage rates. They had risen 75 basis points at \nthe beginning of the year , then rose from roughly 4 percent  in March  to around 7  percent  in \nOctober .  This has had a strong impact on what was an extremely hot housing market .2  \nDemand is also slowing for appliances and other durable goods that go along with home \npurchases .   \nAgain, the path to price stability involves bringing what has been very strong demand \ninto better balance with supply.  So I believe we need to see growth at a below trend pace in \ninterest -sensitive sectors of the economy and more broadly  — growth that is hopefully still \npositive  but down from the rapid pace we saw last year .  Indeed, t here are some early signs  that \ngrowt h in consumer spending is slowing to a pace closer to trend.   Ultimately , this broader \nslowdown in demand will affect the labor market.  Restoring a better balance between demand \nand supply in the labor market will play an important role in reducing unsustainable wage \ninflation, and with it, price inflation.  \n  \nIn this context , it is notable that wage inflation is now much higher than it was pre -\npandemic , despite a similar unemployment rate.  A possible explanation is that demand for \nlabor is  stronger , relative to labor supply , than it was pre -pandemic.  Some evidence of this can \nbe gleaned from the fact that vacancies per unemployed worker are now considerably  higher \nthan they were in 2019.  Another sign is that workers have been quitting their jobs  for other  \nopportunities at higher rates than before the pandemic.  \nWith a  very low unemployment rate, and very high vacancy and quit rates, wages were \nbound to increase sharply.  I hope it will be possible to see  a decline in wage inflation with only \na relatively modest increase in the unemployment rate, as demand in the labor market cools \nand vacancies and quits decline.  \nThe possibility of re -equilibrating the labor market with only a modest increase in the \nunemployment rate is one important reason for optimism about reducing inflation without a \nsignificant downturn.  \nThere are also other reasons  for optimism .  Household balance sheets remain strong, \nand there do not a ppear to be  significant  imbalances in the nonfi nancial business sector.  So, \nhouseholds and businesses are fairly well positioned to support spending,  and weather tighter \nfinancial conditions  – which has not typically been the case in earlier cycles.  In particular, \n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery  \nEMBARGOED UNTIL 10 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time, Friday, November 4, 2022 –  OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n7 \n households accumulated more than two trillion dollars in excess savings over the course of \n2020 and 2021, and while they have started to spend out of this stock, the buffer is still large.  \nMoreover, many  firms may be reluctant to lay  off workers they have had considerable difficulty \nhiring.  \nAnd well-anchored medium - to longer -term inflation expectations, as I have noted , will \nreduce the extent of the slowdown in activity needed to reduce inflation.   \nI recognize that this scenario might  sound rosy, and acknowledge that  there a re a \nnumber of significant  risks.  The continued stresses and uncertainties of the pandemic period \nhave been extremely challenging, taking a toll on individuals, families, and communities.  \nUnderstandably,  this has also dented consumer sentiment , which  implies a risk that \nexpectations of a downturn could become self -fulfilling, with a sudden curtailing of  spending.  \nAnd, unfortunately, we cannot rule out additional  supply or demand shocks, whether \nfrom a resurgence of C OVID -19 or from food and energy supply disruptions due to other factors.  \nWe have also seen a sharp appreciation of the dollar, interest rate hikes around the globe, and \ngrowth slowdowns in many nations.  These factors increase the risks of a more rapid decline in \nglobal  and domestic  demand.   \nBut o verall, while a realist and attuned to the significant r isks, I  am optimistic  about the \npath for our economy, as we do the essential  work to restore price stability –  which  is \nfoundational to an economy that works well for everyone.  \n \nMonetary Policy Going Forward  \nGiven all the imperatives and uncertainties I have mentioned, what is the way forward for \nmonetary policymaking?   \nThe FOMC’s goal is to bring inflation back down to the Committee’s 2 percent target  \nover time , and as  Wednesday’s FOMC statement and communications stressed, this will likely \nentail raising rates to a sufficiently restrictive level and then holding there for some time.  \nBack in March, rates were far from being restrictive – they were near zero.  Since then , \nthe FOMC has tightened policy at a very fast pace  to reach a level of the federal funds rate near \n4 percent.  The swiftness of these actions was appropriate, and reflected the FOMC’s \ncommitment to price stability.  \nWith rates now in restrictive territory,  I believe it is time to shift focus from how rapidly  to \nraise rates , or the pace , to how high – in other words, to determining what is sufficiently \nrestrictive.  And down the road, when we get there, in my view we’ll need to shift again to focus \non how long to hold rates at that level.  \nIn thinking about how to reach the level of the funds rate at which  the Committee will \ndeem appropriate to hold policy , I believe it is important for us to consider the various options for \npolicy moves.  This will include 75 b asis points , as well as smaller increments.  I note that a 50 \nbasis-point move was considered a large move in the past.   \nIn my view, smaller increments will often be appropriate as we work to determine how \nmuch tightening is needed to reach a level of the funds rate that is sufficient ly restrictive .  A \nfocus on the level (not the pace) is what “ resolve”  looks like in this second policy phase.  \nImportantly, as policy tightens further, the risks of overtightening increase.  As I’ve \ndiscussed, I do not believe a significant slowdown is required to accomplish our goal of restoring \n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery  \nEMBARGOED UNTIL 10 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time, Friday, November 4, 2022 – OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n8 \n price stability.  Therefore , it will increasingly  be important to balance the risk of possibly slowing \ndemand in the economy too much, with the risk of allowing inflation to persist too long and \npossibly de- anchoring inflation expectations.   \nMaking policy decisions going forward will not be easy – it never is at this stage in the \neconomic cycle.  There is no one single indicator that will be sufficient by itself to guide policy. \nDecisions, even more than usual, will require a careful, holistic assessment of the range of information available.  Our task is further complicated by some unusual challenges of extracting \nthe signal from what can be very noisy data.  For example, demand indicators and the labor \nmarket may send somewhat different signals as the need by businesses to fill vacant positions \nmay persist even with some slowing of demand.  The continued above- trend growth in payrolls \nin this morning’s October employment report is consistent with this view. \nIt is premature to signal how high rates should go.  However, I will say that the median \npath in September’s Summary of Economic Projections  can be taken as a starting point of my \ncurrent thinking, with the possibility of a higher path depending on incoming information.  \nIn determining appropriate policy, I will assess how much financial conditions have \ntightened and look for evidence that our cumulative policy actions are slowing demand, cooling \nlabor markets,  and having the desired effects on wages and prices.  Indeed, as noted in this \nweek’s FOMC statement, the Committee “will take into account the cumulative tightening of monetary policy, the lags with which monetary policy affects economic activity and inflation, and \neconomic and financial developments.”   \n \nConcluding Observations  \nTo conclude, let me reiterate my commitment to the Fed’s dual mandate – price stability \nand maximum employment – and specifically, my resolve to restore price stability. Policy has  \nmoved expeditiously into restrictive territory, but there is more work to do.  In this next phase for \npolicymaking, my focus is shifting from raising rates rapidly to determining the level that the funds rate mu st reach to be sufficiently restrictive to achieve the desired outcomes. This \nrecognizes that the risks of inflation falling too slowly and of the economy weakening too quickly are becoming more balanced. \nReturning to price stability will set the foundation for sustainable maximum employment \n– and for achieving the mission of a vibrant , inclusive  economy that works best for all in the long \nrun.    \nThank you again for hosting me today, to discuss  my perspectives on the economy and \nmonetary  policy.  David, I look forward to your questions.  \n \n \n1 To view the full statement, see Nov. 4, 2022  Federal Reserve Board - Federal Reserve issues FOMC statement . \n2 Home buying has been slowing, house price increases have been decelerating (if not declining in some areas), and residential \ninvestment has been contracting quite sharply.",

The Fed’s focus on the U.S. labor ma rket is grounded in its dual mandate \nto achieve price stability and maximum employment. Restoring price \nstability remains our current imperative as monetary policymakers, and it is \nclear there is more work to do. Understanding how the pandemic is \naffecting employment in the short and longer term, while challenging, is \nessential for that effort. \n2. There has been a significant amount of work on COVID-19 and the labor \nmarket among academic economists as well as researchers within the \nFederal Reserve System. This conferenc e brings together leading experts \non the topic, enabling us to benefit fr om their perspectives and learn about \nremaining questions to be answered. \n3. Answering key questions about t he pandemic’s effects on labor demand \nand labor supply is important for ca librating monetary policy and reducing \ninflation back to 2 percent. By raisi ng rates, we are aiming to slow the \neconomy and bring labor demand into better balance with supply. I remain \noptimistic that there is a pathway to re-establishing labor market balance \nwith only a modest rise in the unemployme nt rate – while remaining realistic \nabout the risks of a larger downturn.  \n4. Potentially long-lasti ng effects of the pandemic on the labor market, such \nas increased remote work and accelerated automation of service-sector \njobs, are likely to have differential effects across the workforce. \nUnderstanding these differences is important for achieving the Fed’s \nmission of a vibrant, inclusive economy in the wake of COVID-19. \n \n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery \nEMBARGOED UNTIL 8:40 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time, Friday, November 18, 2022 – OR UPON DELIVERY \n \n3 \n   Good morning. It is my great pleasur e to welcome everyone to the Federal \nReserve Bank of Boston. We are also pleas ed to be joined by those watching on the \npublic livestream.  \n  This is the 66th economic conference organized by the Boston Fed. And while it \nis my first conference as the Bank’s pres ident, it is wonderful to be reconnecting with \nmany friends and colleagues attending today to explore some very important issues.   \n  I’m delighted to now be part of the Bo ston Fed’s long conference series. These \nmeetings foster analysis and discussion – among a diverse set of researchers, central \nbankers, and other policymakers. They fo cus on complex issues where the work \npresented and discussed can inform, and make a difference – consistent with the Fed’s \ngoal to support a vibrant, resilient, and inclusive economy. Our conference this year is a \nprime example, and I want to commend our economic research team – led by our \nDirector of Research Geoff Tootell – for designing such a timely and impactful agenda. \n  Before beginning, I note as always that the views I share today are my own. I am \nnot speaking for colleagues at the other Rese rve Banks or the Board in Washington. \n \nContext: Maximum Employment and Price Stability \n  Let me start with some context. At the Fed, policy-relevant discussions are \nrooted in the dual mandate assigned to us  by Congress – maximum employment and \nprice stability. We define price stability as 2 percent inflation.  Maximum employment is \nless specifically defined; but I see it as a broad,  inclusive goal of job opportunities for all.  \n  I’ve noted in past remarks that these two mandates are intertwined . Price stability \nis key for achieving sustained maximum empl oyment – meaning, only when inflation is \nlow and stable can the economy in general, and the labor market in particular, work well \nfor all Americans. Labor market conditions also  influence inflation dynamics, as we have \nseen recently with very tight labor ma rkets contributing to high inflation. \n  At the Fed we approach our man date with the utmost seriousness, and \nconferences like this help in achieving our goals – by providing insights, challenging \nassumptions, and exploring central question s about the economy. And coming out of \nthe acute phase of the pandemic , there are many relevant  questions about the U.S. \nlabor market to explore. For instance: \n How has the pandemic affected job opportunities, and how is labor supply \nresponding to those changes? \n Which recent changes in the labor market reflect transient, cyclical conditions; \nand which reflect developments in long-run,  structural forces that monetary \npolicy has little influence over? \n  These sets of questions are important  for the key task t he Fed faces today: \nlowering inflation back to 2 percent. By ra ising rates, we are aiming to slow the \n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery \nEMBARGOED UNTIL 8:40 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time, Friday, November 18, 2022 – OR UPON DELIVERY \n \n4 \n economy and bring labor demand into better balance with supply. The intent is not a \nsignificant downturn. But restoring price stabi lity remains the current imperative and it is \nclear that there is more work to do. I expec t this will require additional increases in the \nfederal funds rate, followed by a period of hol ding rates at a sufficiently restrictive level \nfor some time. The latest data have not reduced my sense of what sufficiently restrictive \nmay mean, nor my resolve. Still, despite being realistic about the risks, I look at current \nconditions1 and remain optimistic that there is a pathway to reestab lishing price stability \nwith a labor market slowdown that entails onl y a modest rise in the unemployment rate.  \n  In my remarks today, I will begin with the issue of structural versus cyclical labor \nmarket developments, then touch on aspects of  the labor market that are especially \nsalient for the current conduc t of monetary policy, and fina lly consider some longer-run \nissues related to full employment in an inclusive economy. \n \nStructural Trends Versus Cyclical Movements \n  Distinguishing long-run trends from temporary cyclical movements in the \neconomy and labor market is challenging. And it is vital for calibrating monetary policy, \nso as to ensure we restore price stability in a reasonable timeframe without slowing real \nactivity more than necessary.  \n  Changes in the labor mark et are typically driven by a combination of structural \nand cyclical forces, and parsing their relati ve impact is complex. For example, \nmanufacturing employment is highly cyclical, but the two recession s in the decade from \n2000 to 2010 likely brought forward some of the longer-run declines in factory jobs that \nwould have happened anyway, from increased automation and gl obalization. In other \nwords, structural change can be c oncentrated in recessionary periods.2,3  \n  Of course, structural influences have not  prevented the job market’s return to a \nhealthy state during ensuing economic recove ries. That was the case after the COVID-\n19 recession, as the unemployment rate quickl y returned to low, pre-pandemic levels.  \n  Even so, there are potentially many long- lasting implications  of the COVID-19 \nrecession for the labor market . It is quite possible that COVID-19 brought significant \n \n1 For example, it appears many firms are still “cat ching up” to fill staffing vacancies even as demand \nslows. In addition, strong household balance sheet s should help support consumer spending. \n2 See for example “ Why does structural change accelerate in recessions? The credit reallocation channel ” \nby Cooper Howes, in the Journal of Financial Economics , Volume 144, Issue 3, June 2022, pgs. 933-952.  \n3 More generally, fears of increased structural unemp loyment have often followed recessions, going back \nat least to the early 1960s. In 2011 the Federal Op en Market Committee (FOMC) discussed whether a \nsignificant amount of the high unemployment that re mained after the Great Recession was structural. \nSee, for example, a now-public memo  on structural unemployment presented to the FOMC in 2011.  \n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery \nEMBARGOED UNTIL 8:40 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time, Friday, November 18, 2022 – OR UPON DELIVERY \n \n5 \n changes that bear directly, and over the long term, on the Fed’s goal of a thriving, \ninclusive economy. \nConsider that in addition to a significant decline in aggregate demand , the \nCOVID-19 recession also saw large changes in aggregate supply  as firms shut down \nearly in the pandemic. Firms have re- opened, but pandemic-related adjustments like \nincreased remote work and the accelerated autom ation of service-sector jobs have the \npotential to affect aggregate supp ly in the longer run.  \n  And these trends will probably have diffe rential impacts on workers with different \ncharacteristics. This is important becaus e the Fed’s mandate is to support a healthy \neconomy characterized by price stability and maximum employment – for everyone. To \ndo so, policymakers must assess which of t he labor market changes originating in, or \naltered by, the pandemic are likely to last. For example, there have long been troubling \ngaps in the rate of unemployment for Black and Hispanic workers relative to national \naverages. Beyond their human toll, these gaps reflect underutilization of our country’s \nlabor resources, and adversely affect producti vity and prosperity. It is important to \nunderstand the factors behind these gaps in general, and how (and for how long) they \nare affected by labor market disruptions like Covid-19.  \n \nParsing the Pandemic’s Effects   One way the COVID-19 recession’s afterma th has played out differently than that \nof past recessions involves the relationshi p between the unemploym ent rate and other \nlabor market variables. In contrast with re cent recoveries, unemployment returned quite \nquickly to its prior rate a fter the COVID-19 recession an d has remained between 3.5 \nand 3.7 percent since March.  \n  However, other indicators are now quite  different than they were pre-pandemic. A \nchallenge for current monetary policy is determining whether the changes in the \nrelationship between the unemployment rate and other labor market variables stem \nfrom temporary effects of t he pandemic, or from longer-lasting labor market trends that \nthe pandemic might have influenced.  \n  In particular, both price and wage infl ation are now much higher than before the \npandemic, even though the unemployment rate  is back to pre-pandemic levels.  \n  One explanation for a higher inflation  rate coinciding with the pre-pandemic \nunemployment  rate has to do with the tradeoff bet ween unemployment and inflation as \ncaptured by the Phillips Curve. More specif ically, the Phillips Curve may be steeper at \nunemployment rates near 3.5 percent.\n4  \n \n4 Demand pressures appear much more pronounced now than before the pandemic. With a much steeper \nPhillips Curve at low unemployment rates, these a dditional demand pressures would result in much \n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery \nEMBARGOED UNTIL 8:40 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time, Friday, November 18, 2022 – OR UPON DELIVERY \n \n6 \n   A key question for monetary policy is whether relationships at this low \nunemployment rate are symmetric . If true, this would raise the likelihood of a similarly \nrapid decline  in inflation associated with modest increases in unemployment, as tight \nmonetary policy eases demand pressures. But we cannot rule out other explanations \nthat would point to a less favorable tr adeoff between inflation and unemployment, such \nas an increase in inflation expectations re levant for wage and price setting.    \n  The pandemic has also highlighted challe nges in measuring labor market slack. \nVacancies relative to the unemployment rate , as captured by the so-called Beveridge \nCurve, are now at historically high levels . One reason could be that firms are struggling \nto replace workers who move from job to job to obtain higher wages.  Alternatively, the \nrecent increase in vacancies could signal  a longer-lasting increase in frictional \nunemployment, and therefore in the natural rate of unemployment.5   \n  These alternative explanations fo r the recent observed vacancy-to-\nunemployment relationship matter for moneta ry policy, and how we think about labor \nmarket slack. If the substantial increase in vacancies mostly reflects temporary factors, \nthen a slowdown in labor demand could work pr imarily through lower vacancies, rather \nthan higher unemployment. This scenario for the Beveridge Curve would be consistent \nwith a steeper Phillips Curve at low unempl oyment rates – the possibility I just \nmentioned.  \n \nLonger-Run Issues Affecti ng the Labor Market \n  The increase in remote work is just  one example of longer-term trends that the \npandemic may have accelerated, or in other cases slowed. These trends are relevant \nbecause they affect our understanding of the cyclical position of the economy, and also \nbecause they matter for what the Fed considers to be maximum sustainable \nemployment. Moreover, trends affected by COVID-19 could have di sparate effects on \ndifferent groups in the labor force.  \n  I’ll briefly highlight thr ee key trends that we will explore in more detail over the \nnext day and a half – remote work, education, and automation. \n  First, remote work , while not an option for all jobs, could alter employment \nopportunities at the individual , sectoral, and regional levels. Given all the considerations \nfor employees and employers, these changes are unlikely to apply uniformly across \nworkers and firms. Nevertheless, at the indivi dual level, the ability to work remotely \n \nhigher inflation, with little further reduction in t he unemployment rate. In this view, the pandemic has \ntraced out a portion of the Phillips Curve that may have  always existed but was no t empirically relevant in \nrecent decades. \n5 For example, workers may not live in areas of increased labor demand due to a lack adequate housing \nin those places. Although housing markets may even tually adjust, restoring regional balance between \nlabor demand and supply may take a long time. \n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery \nEMBARGOED UNTIL 8:40 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time, Friday, November 18, 2022 – OR UPON DELIVERY \n \n7 \n could help people with family responsibilities or  physical limitations participate in the \nlabor force to a greater degree.  At the regional level, the ability to work in remote \nlocations could help spread the population more widely and limit the disproportionate \ngrowth of job opportunities in high cost, “superstar” cities.6  \n  However, remote work may not amelio rate troublesome geographic disparities.  \nRather than repopulating cities that had lost  manufacturing jobs, remote workers may \ninstead flock to places with relatively high consumption amenities, which may worsen \nthe housing shortages in those places.  And given that higher-incom e, college-educated \nworkers were more often able to work from home during the pandemic, they may be \nmore likely than others to benefit from a long-run shift toward  remote work.   \n  Second, we need to parse the pandemic’s effects on education  – a topic near \nand dear to me, and very important to the labor market. College enrollment was 6.8 \npercent lower for students graduating from high school in 2020 than in the previous \nyear.7  This unprecedented decline could reduce t he lifetime college attainment rate for \nthe affected cohort – and was more pr onounced among students from disadvantaged \nhigh schools.   \n  T h i r d ,  automation  may well extend beyond assembly-line and clerical jobs, which \nhave been disproportionately autom ated during the last several decades, to encompass \nmore jobs in the service sector. The pus h for additional automation may be fueled in \npart by limited labor supply in the servic e sector following the pandemic. In general, \neconomists view favorably the application of  new technologies to production since \nproductivity growth is the ultimate source of  rising living standards . But economists also \nrecognize that there are often winners and losers from automation. Increased \nautomation of service-sector jobs  could exacerbate wage inequality.  \n \nConcluding Observations \n  The sessions at this conference will address critical labor-market issues – \nincluding the effect of COVID- 19 on labor supply, the future of remote work, the effects \nof automation, retirement tr ends, immigration, short-time  compensation, and new firm \nformation. The analysis and discussion will help  illuminate COVID-19’s implications. \n \n6 A few months before the pandemic began, the Boston  Fed hosted a conference on regional disparities. \nThe growth of remote education and work has the pot ential to ameliorate some problems the conference \nhighlighted. \n7 A March 2021 report  from the National Student Clearinghous e Research Center (NSCRC) documents \nCOVID-19’s effect on college enrollment among students gr aduating from high school in 2020. The report \nnotes that the pandemic “disproportionately affected  graduates of low-income, high-poverty, and high-\nminority high schools, with their enrollments dro pping more steeply than their more advantaged \ncounterparts. For instance, enrollment declines are 2.3 times steeper for low-income high schools \ncompared to higher income schools.” \n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery \nEMBARGOED UNTIL 8:40 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time, Friday, November 18, 2022 – OR UPON DELIVERY \n \n8 \n   While fascinating in their own right, t he conference sessions are highly relevant \nfor monetary policy given the Federal Rese rve’s dual mandate. At the Fed we are \ncommitted to returning inflation to the 2 perc ent target in a reasonable amount of time.  \nOnly when inflation is low and stable c an the economy in general — and the labor \nmarket in particular — work  well for all Americans.   \n  Clearly, policymaking benef its from careful, ongoing st udy of all the ways the \npandemic has changed the labor ma rket. So it is a fitting time to gather, and deepen our \nunderstand of the l abor market during and after the pandemic. \n  Thank you again for being here. Now we’ll move into the first session.

U.S. Eastern Tim e on  \nTuesday, January 12, 2021 – OR UPON DELIVERY  \nThe views expressed today are my own, not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal Reserve Board of \nGovernors or the Federal Open Market Committee.  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n“The Economic Outlook  – Optimism Despite  the \nChallenges Ahead ”  \n \n \nEric S. Rosengren  \nPresident & Chief Executive Officer  \nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston  \n \n \nThe Greater Boston Chamber of Commerce  \n \n \n \nJanuary 12, 2021  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL  \n2:10 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Tuesday, January 12, 2021 - OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n \n1 \n  \nGood afternoon, and a very h appy new year to all.  It has been a long and unprecedented \nnine months  since the COVID -19 pandemic forced Greater Boston  to all but shut down last \nMarch .  Through December  and into early January , the pandemic continues to significantly alter  \nour normal ways of living and working .  However, we come now to a time of considerable \npromise: as the new year dawns , it seems likely that the public health crisis that has inflicted so \nmuch damage  – on individuals, families, businesse s, and the economy generally – will dissipate  \nover the course of this year .  With two highly effective vaccines already starting to be distributed  \nin the U nited States and more in the pipeline  – and with medical staff and those most at risk now \nbeing  vaccinated  – we should see much needed relief for hospitals as we move  into the spring.  \nAlthough i t seems likely to me that  the economy will, at best , continue to grow modestly until \nthere is widespread vaccination , I believe  a more robust  economic  recove ry – supported by  \nexpansionary monetary and fiscal policy  – is likely to follow.  \nNear -term economic performance  is likely to continue to be substantially affected  by \npandemic -related  challenges.  The labor market has stalled as infections have climbed and simple \nself-preservation  has forced many people to continue to restrict their activities .  Many firms in \nthe service sector remain quite stressed ; with restaurants, hotels, and entertainment venues likely \nto continue to  be materially impacted  by the virus , particularly with a new more infectious strain \nreportedly  becom ing more pervasive.   \nIn my view, t argeted fiscal  policy  actions are an appropriate way to support  those \nbusinesses that have been disproportionately impacted by the pandemic  – and t he Consolidated \nAppropriations Act , recently signed into law,  will provide support to many business es and \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL  \n2:10 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Tuesday, January 12, 2021 - OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n \n2 \n individuals that have experienced significant distress .  Unfortunately, s ome states have had to cut \nback on essential services  (given their sharp drop in revenue and their balanced -budget rules);  \nand the limited financial flexibility of state and local governments is likely to restrain the speed \nof the recovery, similar to what was experienced after the financial crisis of 2007  and ensuing \n“Great R ecession .”  \nIn addition, it is sobering to note that many of the economic problems caused by the \npandemic have actually been deferred , to date  – for example , problems in commercial real estate \nand the bank loans tied to such property  are likely to only be fully revealed later this year.  These \nfactors , along with the speed of inoculations,  will impact how quickly the U.S. economy returns \nto full employment.  \n However, I am relatively  optimistic about the economic outlook for the second half of \n2021 .  Domestic stock market indices are near all -time highs , suggesting investor confidence in a \nrecovery.1  With very low interest rates, even some  financially strapped individuals may be able \nto make payments on debt until incomes are restored  (although low interest rates do not solve the \nchallenge of ongoing expenses when there has been an interruption of income ).2  The housing \nsector has been helped by low mortgage rates, and the eager ness of many households to transact \nreal estate despite the challenges of the pandemic  (and in some cases, because of the pandemic \nand the lifestyle changes it has ushered in) .  While consumer services remain  depressed, t he \nconsumer goods sector has recovered nicely  and continues to benefit fr om the broad and \nexpedited movement to online  purchas ing.  Many firms have increased their capital investments, \nas they rely more on technology to conduct business and refit offices to accommodate more \nremote work.  For those lucky enough to have the option  to work at home, there may be more \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL  \n2:10 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Tuesday, January 12, 2021 - OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n \n3 \n opportunities to do so going forward,  which may be a long -term positive for some , including  \nworking parents.  \n As a result, d espite the near -term challenges  brought on by COVID -19, I am optimistic \nthat we will see significant employment gains over the next two years.  However, I do not expect \nthe U.S. economy to reach a sustained 2 percent inflation rate over the same time frame , which \naccording to the guidance the interest -rate-setting  Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) has \nprovided in its policy statement s, implies that policymakers will continue to maintain very \naccommodative short -term rates.   \nYet, as I often note, a “low for long ” environment does present  other important  \nchallenges.  For example, i t encourages firms and individuals to take on more leverage and \nfinancial risk.  In addition, many of the financial shocks in March  2020  could have been \nameliorated by proactively addressing problems with money market mutual funds and financial \ninfrastructure before  the pandemic  hit.  If we are to avoid similar problems in the future, my \nview is more needs to be done to make the financial infrastructure  of our economy  more \nresilient.3   \nFinally , and importantly , the disparate economic outcomes we have seen during the \npandemic have further highlighted the problems of income inequality that remain a significant \nchallenge for a strong economy.   As I have discussed in recent speeches , policymakers  must be \nmindful of the  deep pain still occurring in many segments of the  economy  – particularly for \npersonal -service -related businesses  (restaurants, hotels, retail stores, and tourism  – for example ) \nwhich employ large numbers of workers, many of whom have little savings to cushion against a \ndisruption in wages that lasts for many months.  Frequently, these workers are people of color, \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL  \n2:10 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Tuesday, January 12, 2021 - OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n \n4 \n young, or individuals with less educational attainment .  Not surprisingly , the unemployment rate \nhas risen the most for these groups.4   \n \nThe Near -Term Economic O utlook  \n I am looking forward to the time when the outlook for the economy is no longer \nintertwined with that of C OVID -19; but unfortunately , that is not yet the case.  We continue to \nface an unusually complex employment situation due, in large part, to the uneven response in the \nUnited States to this public health crisis.   As I have said in prior talks, I firmly believe that the \npath to stabilizing  the economy  hinges on first getting the virus under control , and without \neffective public health policy, the virus will remain the major source of economic challenges.5  \nFigure 1  shows the rate of COVID infection, scaled by population  – for the United \nStates, the European Union, and G -7 countries excluding the U .S.  Unfortunately, the figure  \nshows that the public health response in th is country has been problematic .  The U .S. has tended \nto have higher  per capita  COVID infection rates for  much of the past nine months and , relative to  \nmany European countries that have managed to gain some control over infection rates through \nlimits on social mobility, the United States now has significantly more infections.  This is all the \nmore tragic because these infections are occurring only months before vaccinations will \nsignificantly reduce individuals ’ chan ces of becoming  infect ed. \n While infect ion rates have been high in the U .S., Figure 2  shows that although  death \nrates from COVID are quite high, they are roughly similar with that of Europe.  For Europe , the \nUnited States , and the G -7 countries excluding the U.S., the death rate s among those with \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL  \n2:10 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Tuesday, January 12, 2021 - OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n \n5 \n COVID are now higher than at any time during the pandemic.  Th e fact th at Europe has more \nsubstantially restricted economic activity  in response to virus resurgence – and still is seeing  very \nhigh death rates  – suggests the potential for high economic costs to preventing COVID s pread  in \nthe near term.  \n Given the high infection and death rate s currently seen in the U .S., it is not surprising that \nwe are also observing  a softening of economic conditions , in the data.   Figure 3  provides the  \nfour-week moving average of  initial claims for unemployment.  Over the last three  months , as \nthe pandemic has worse ned, the earlier progress reducing the flow of workers into \nunemplo yment has  suffered a setback, with these initial claims for unemployment insurance  \nrising somewhat from the end of November and remain ing at a very elevated level of 800,000 \nclaims .  This is consistent with the employment report covering the month of  December , released \nlast week,  which  had unemployment leveling off at 6.7 percent  and payroll employment \ndeclining  by 140,000 . \n However, the unemployment rate can be misleading when many  people are dropping out \nof the labor force , because it takes into account only those currently seeking work .  With many \npeople dropping out of the labor force, data on actual employment  can provide a more accurate \nsnapshot of labor market conditions .  Figure 4  shows the employment -to-population rat io for the \npast year.  When the pandemic first hit, many people were placed on temporary layoff , or \nfurloughed .  However, the employment -to-population rat io still shows a large gap relative to pre-\npandemic conditions , reflecting continued elevated numbers of people out of work  and also out \nof the labor force .6   \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL  \n2:10 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Tuesday, January 12, 2021 - OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n \n6 \n  Figure 5 shows the variety of outcomes for payroll employment  across industries during \nthe pandemic .  Overall, payroll employment is m ore than 6 percent below the level  seen a year \nearlier .  Industries such as entertainment , which relies on  group  gatherings , and personal \nservices , like restaurants , have declined much more than the average for  all nonfarm industries.    \nThe number of i ndustries that have higher employment than a year ago is limited , but it involves \nwork  such as couriers and messengers , and warehousing and storage , as well as building material \nand general merchandise stores  – which  saw a  rise in employment as people worked from , and \nstayed at , home.  \n As shown in Figure 6, some goods that can be consumed at home saw significant \nincreases ; including , for example , games and computers.  It is important to note that many of \nthese go ods are not domestically produced, limiting the employment benefits  in the U.S .  \nMeanwhile,  goods that have been  consumed less during the pandemic , when people were largely \nconfined to their homes,  include gasoline and cars.  \n Consumer services ha ve been more depressed than goods.  Figure 7 shows some \nincreases in certain services , such as streaming services and medical laboratories, but there were \nbig declines in many service areas related to travel and entertainment.  Many of these depressed \nconsum er services are unlikely to fully recover until widespread vaccination  of the population \nhas been ac hieved . \n Overall, recent indicators suggest near-term problems stemming from  elevated infections  \nand persistent  public health concerns.  So clearly,  the near -term recovery is highly dependent on \nrapid , widespread  vaccination.  Unfortunately, to date, the inoculation rate has been \ndisappointing, which likely will impact public health  and the economy in the near term .   \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL  \n2:10 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Tuesday, January 12, 2021 - OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n \n7 \n A Positive Medium -term Outlook  \n Amidst the near-term challenges we face, I will also point out several reasons for \noptimism concerning the economy’s medium -term outlook.  \nOne reason to be optimistic is that household saving remains elevated and \naccommodative fiscal policy is likely to  further support individuals and firms.   Figure 8  shows \nthat the personal saving rate remains quite high, even before the recently enacted additional \nfederal stimulus.  Prior to the COVID -19 pandemic, the saving rate was roughly 7.5 percent, and \nmore recently it has been over 12 percent .  This suggests that for those whose incomes were not \ninterrupted (for example, those whose jobs were conducive to working from home, and whose \nindustries were not stalled  by the pandemic ), there is  significant capacity to make expenditures \nonce the pandemic is over.  Because consumption is such a large part of the economy, in the \nsecond half of the year  if vaccinations are widespread , we are likely to see a significant pick up \nin consumption  – particularly in the kind of services that consumers have missed during the \npandemic , such as dining in restaurants, traveling, and attending in-person entertainment  events . \n A second reason to be optimistic  in the medium term  is that financial conditions remain \nfavorable,  and asset prices have risen significantly since last spring.  Figure 9 shows that , despite \nthe substantial decline in stock prices last March  as the pandemic took hold , the S&P 500 ended \nthe year  roughly 15 percent higher than it was at the beginning of 2020.  My view is that h ighly \naccommodative fiscal and monetary policy will provide a significant tailwind for risk y assets this \nyear.  \n A third reason to be optimistic is that the housing market has remained quite resilient  (in \ncontrast to the last crisis and recession) .  New and existing  single -family  home sales plummeted \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL  \n2:10 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Tuesday, January 12, 2021 - OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n \n8 \n during the initial COVID lockdown , but recovered over the summer and were  more than 20 \npercent higher  at the end of November  than a year prior  (Figure 10 ).  While the resurgence in \nthe pandemic has caused a pause in sales, I expect  that low interest rates, higher asset prices , and \nmore saving s will support  continued home purchases in the coming year.  \n Figure 11 shows the forecast from the Federal Reserve policymakers’ Summary of \nEconomic Projections , which asks each participant to provid e their outlook  for the \nunemployment rate over the next three years.  My own forecast is somewhat more pessimistic  \nthan the consensus  in the near term, as a result of the second wave of the pandemic  – but does \nanticipate  a decline in the unemployment rate once a significant proportion of the population has \nbeen vaccinated.  \n It is important to note that despite my optimism for 2021, there are risks  to this outlook .  \nThe pandemic is likely to economically scar many individu als and firms.  A large number of  \nhouseholds  have experienced a loss of wealth and employment during the pandemic, and many \nfirms experience d a substantial drop in revenues  when they had to  shut down.   Many businesses \nclosed permanently.    \nIn addition, some economic consequences of the pandemic  are likely to be revealed only \nwith a lag.  A good example is commercial real estate.  Figure 12  shows the delinquency of \nloans in commercial mortgage -backed securities ( CMBS holdings of commercial real estate ).  \nSeveral sectors, particularly hotels and retail , are showing delinquencies much higher than even \nduring the severe financial crisis  that began in 2007 .  Most CMBS structures limit the ability to \nwork directly with troubled borrowers , so the problems tend t o appear relatively quickly.  Similar \nassets held in bank and insurance portfolios have benefited from financial institutions working \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL  \n2:10 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Tuesday, January 12, 2021 - OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n \n9 \n with many of their borrowers.  However, as that forbearance ends, rising nonperforming loans \nare likely to appear by the s econd half of 2021.  This example illustrates that  despite the \ngenerally positive outlook for 2021, there are still lingering problems from the pandemic that \nwill likely need to be addressed.  \n \nCentral Bank Emergency Support  \n A major factor in the resilienc e of the economy through the pandemic has been the  \npresence of  significant fiscal and monetary support.  Fiscal stimulus from elected officials has \nprovided needed support to business es and individuals badly impacted by the pandemic.  \nMonetary policy has been very supportive as well, as interest rates  were immediately reduced to \ntheir lower limit  once the pandemic began , in order  to enable individuals and businesses to \nborrow very cheapl y.7   \nOther significant supports came in the variety of emergency lending facilities establish ed \nby the Federal Reserve  with the approval of the U.S. Department of the Treasury .  The New \nYork Reserve Bank operated a number of facilities focused on market functioning , and t he \nBoston  Reserve Bank operated a  facility supporting money market mutual funds .  Together, \nthese facilities  were important reasons why the  financial instability and  sharp ly declining output  \nin the spring did not  persist through the year .   \nIn addition, the Boston Fed administered , on behalf of the Federal Reserve System , a new \ntype of facilit y during the crisis  – the Main Street Lending Program.  The program was designed \nto help small - and medium -sized businesses  and nonprofit organizations  bridge the pandemic \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL  \n2:10 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Tuesday, January 12, 2021 - OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n \n10 \n downturn .8  The program aimed to assist organizations  that might otherwise be in a challenging \nspot – not large e nough to have mark etable debt that might benefit from the emergency facilities \nfocused on market functioning , but large r than many of the companies utilizing the federal \ngovernment’s  Paycheck Protection Program .9   \nThe Main Street program is now closed .  I am pleased to be able to share some initial \nsummary information on the program with you .  This information  complement s the disclosures \nthe Fed makes on a weekly basis in the H.4.1 statistical release, which includes the net portfolio \nholdings ,10 and at 30 -day increments per the CARES Act (providing details on Main Street \nProgram loans, last published yesterday, January 11).   \nOver 2020 , the program extended more than $16.5 billion  in lending  to over 1 ,800 \ncompanies .  As Figure s 13 and 14  show, the valu e and number of loans processed increased \nsignificantly in December.  This surge in demand for the program  followed  the November 19 \nannouncement of the decision by the Treasury to not extend C ARES  Act facilities .  It also no \ndoubt reflects  the stresses many medium -sized businesses were experiencing at the end of 2020  \nas a result of the resurgence of COVID infections.  \nI’ll share some summary information and then draw a few conclusions from the data.  \n• While Figure 14 shows consistent loan grow th from July, it really underlines the \nsurge in demand in December.  The program settled just under 650 loans in the \nmonths from July to November, then over 1,150  loans  in December alone.  Lender \nparticipation also surged in December, with 45 percent of th e eventual total pool of \nlenders participating for the first time .   \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL  \n2:10 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Tuesday, January 12, 2021 - OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n \n11 \n • Again, this was quite a surge  in demand for Main Street b orrowing .  On a related side \nnote, I would like to commend everyone at the Fed  for their dedication to public \nservice , exhibited by  work ing tirelessly  through the month of December to support \nthe increased yearend demand , in an intense effort  to meet the needs of program  \nparticipants  before closure . \n• The program’s geographic reach wa s ultimately broad, with settled loans across 49 \nstates and two U.S. territories (See Figure 15). \n• Looking at the industries utilizing the program’s loans suggests some unsurprising \nareas of need, given the pandemic’s toll  on certain industries where social distancing \nis challenging  (See Figure 16).  Industrial catego ries that include food services ; \nscientific and technical services; and arts, entertainment, and recreation are the most \nprominent in the Main Street portfolio .  Many of the se industries reflect what one \nwould expect to be industries disproportionately impacted by the pandemic.  \n  \nThe Main Street program proved to be a challenging undertaking for all involved , and \nunfortunately did not meet the needs of everyone who expressed interest ; however , my personal \npreference would have been to continue the program  through the first half of 2021 .  The program \nfilled a hole often lef t unaddressed – support for medium -sized  businesses.  In my view, there are \nsignifi cant implications for productivity and industrial organization if only small and large \ncompanies can receive  fiscal and lending support during crises.   \nAt the same time, w hile the Main Street lending program provided very helpful \nfinancing, I believe that were certain tweaks permitted, it could have been more impactful.  I will \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL  \n2:10 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Tuesday, January 12, 2021 - OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n \n12 \n offer a few preliminary observations.   First, w ith less focus on mitigation  of potential loss  to the \nTreasury , much more credit would have been made available.  Second, designing the program to \nhave  less legal  and operational complexity , and structuring the bank s’ role11 differently  – for \nexample, as  an opportunity to earn fees as long as the loan performed, rather than a 5 percent \nparticipation – may have increased the attractiveness of the program  for banks .  Finally, longer \nterms and greater ability to refinance would have provided support to medium -sized businesses  \nmore aki n to what was available to larger companies.   \nThe Main Street program was unprecedented, and very challenging, given the fact that \nbusiness loans are not homogeneous  and loan participations are difficult to streamline.  Still, we \nmust keep in mind the vital importance of credit access, especially to small and medium -sized \ncompanies and nonprofit organizations.  If a future crisis compels lawmakers and policymakers \nto want to extend emergency lending to small and medium -sized businesses , through the Fed or \nanother entity, I hope such a program  can incorporate the lessons of the Main Street effort and \naddress challenges where possible,  so that it is better structured to meet even more firms’  needs.   \nDespite the potential for improvements , and its many challenges , the Main Street Lending \nProgram showed the feasibility of marshalling lenders and the public sector to assis t hard-to-\nreach businesses – businesses that can survive with the support of a bridge to better times, post -\ndownturn . \n \n \n \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL  \n2:10 P.M.

The pandemic is likely \nto continue to be a problem for public health and the economy until widespread vaccinations take \nhold.  Nonetheless, with substantial fiscal and m onetary support, I expect a robust recovery \nstarting in the second half of this year.  I also expect that short -term interest rates near zero will \nbe appropriate throughout this year, and that the Federal Reserve  will continue to purchase long -\nterm assets until the economy is on a stronger economic footing.   \nDespite th is generally upbeat outlook, my own view is that policymakers must  continue \nto find ways to support those individuals and firms that have been  disproportionately and \nseverely  impacted by the pandemic.   \nThank you for having me  speak  today, and I wish you continued good health in the new \nyear.  \n \n \n \n1 And, potentially, accumulating wealth to complement pent -up demand.  \n \n2 It is worth noting, many  low-income individuals lack savings they can rely on, even in good economic times. For \nexample, i n 2013, t he Federal Reserve Board of Governors introduced an annual survey of the economic well -being \nof U.S. households , which, among other findings, highlighted the so -called ‘$400 problem ’ – almost half of \nrespondents at the time could  not cover a $400 emergency expense without selling something or borrowing money . \n(For more, see, Attacking the $400 problem on many fronts , Jay Lindsay, Jan. 30, 2019 , www.bostonfed.org .) \nAccording to the Board’s  most recent survey data , however, Current Report - Update on the Economic Well -Being \nof U.S. Households: July 2020 Results , 70 percent  of adult  respondents would pay a $400 emergency expe nse using \ncash or its equivalent, up from 64 percent in April and 63 percent in October 2019.  \n \n3 For more discussion, see Oct. 8, 2020 remarks by Eric S.

U.S. Eastern Time on Fri day, Febru ary 19, 2021 -  OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n \n1 \n  \nGood mor ning, and t hank you for inviting me to address the Yale E conomic \nDevelopment S ymposium.  The theme of this gathering, rebuilding an inclusive economy, is \nhighly relevant  to the current moment , and is central  to many  policy discussions .  I am pleased to \nbe able to offer my own perspective s with you today on this important topic.  \nThe most recent policy statement  from the Federal Reserve’s interest- rate-setting  Federal \nOpen Market Committee (FOMC)  noted how  “the ongoing public health crisis continues to \nweigh on economic activity, employment, and inflation, and poses considerable ris ks to the \neconomic outlook.”1  Indeed, the  impact of COVID -19 has been  extraordinary, damaging \nindividuals, families, businesses, and the economy overall .  And  the disparate economic \noutcomes for some individuals and groups during the pandemic have further exacerbated long -\nstanding issues in our  economy.   \nFortunately, vaccine distribution across the United States is underway – and while  not as \nseamless a rollout as any of us would have hoped, the vaccines represent  a very promising \ndevelopment .  Although COVID- 19 infection rates have recently declined, they remain at a \nrelatively high level.  While  it seems likely that the economy will continue to grow despite this \nelevated infection  rate, a more rapid pace of economic activity  will be realized only when there \nare widespread inoculations .  Indeed, a  successful vaccination rollout by the middle of the  \nsummer  suggests  that b y the second half of this year a  robust economic recovery should be \nunderway – supported by the current accommodative stance of  both monetary and fiscal policy.  \nToday, I will first focus on  the outlook for the U .S. economy, including some discussion \nof economic conditions in Connecticut.  The uneven nature of this downturn has highlighted the \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL  \n10:10 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Fri day, Febru ary 19, 2021 -  OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n \n2 \n need to rebuild the economy in a more inclusive way.  I will suggest some development policies \nthat I believe will help  complement the traditional macro  polic y responses , to build a more \nequitable economy.   \nOver the past several months , economic trends have largely been determined by the path \nof the virus and the resulting health policy response s.  I expect , unfortunately, that th e evolution \nof the virus  will continue to determine the course of the economy  through the middle of the year , \nas the U .S. and our trading partners continue to grapple with th e continually evolving public \nhealth crisis.   \nI will emphasize today that the pandemic has had significantly divergent impacts on \ndifferent industries and workers, leading to very different economic outcomes  across different \nsegments of the population.  The sectors most impacted by social distancing , due to significant \ncustomer -facing interaction  – recreation, entertainment, retail, restaurants , travel,  and hotels  – are \nalso large employers of workers  who  receiv e relatively low wages.  Many of the employees \nworking in these sectors are B lack or Hispanic .  In addition, many are women and many are \nyounger workers. As a result,  these segments of the population have suff ered disproportionately \nduring the pandemic.   \nIn contrast, Americans with jobs that can be performed  remotely, although certainly \nconstrained by the pandemic , have been able to continue  working – albeit  from home .  As a \nresult, certain segments of the economy – those  where working at a computer or over the phone \nis feasible – allow these  business es to be conducted from socially  distanced locations, largely \nuninterrupted.  In fact, t his evolution in the way we work and collaborate  might have long- lasting \neffects on  the workplace of the future.  There are also some goods -producing industries  where \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL  \n10:10 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Fri day, Febru ary 19, 2021 -  OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n \n3 \n production lines can achieve some social distancing, and these industries  have flourished .  Many \nof the workers in minimally affected jobs have found themselves saving more money as the \npandemic  limits spending on travel , entertainment, and other things .  \nGiven this added savings, we should see a significant increase in demand for many of the \nactivities that have been limited by social distancing once consumers no longer feel threatened by the virus.  Of course, this requires that public health officials  can successfully vaccinate a \nlarge share of the population, and that the vaccinations continue to keep up with new variants of the virus .   \nDespite a potentially difficult road ahead over the next few months, monetary policy is \nquite accommodative , and fiscal policy has been and likely will continue to be forcefully \ndeployed.  From my perspective , both the monetary and fiscal policy responses have been quite \nappropriate , given the  severity of the public -health -induced economic crisis .\n2   \nPerhaps, however, i t is not enough to focus solely on the macroeconomic response to the \npandemic . The recovery provides us a unique opportunity to ensure  that the economic rebuilding \nprocess advances a more inclusive economy.  Indeed, t he pandemic has highlighted the critical \nimportance of f inding ways to improve workforce development, increase workplace  flexibility, \nand revitaliz e areas where many low -income workers reside.   \nA number of programs can continue to make a difference  along these dimensions .  I will \nfocus today on initiatives that are improving child  care, improving the quality of jobs, and \nproviding additional financing targeted to those communities most impacted by the pandemic.  \n \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL  \n10:10 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Fri day, Febru ary 19, 2021 -  OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n \n4 \n The Economic Outlook  \nFigure 1  highlights the scope of the tragic effects  of the COVID -19 virus .  For the U .S. \nas a whole (the blue line) , deaths per million of population late last year  surpass ed the \ncomparable number reached  last spring, dur ing the early stages of the pandemic, and remain \nelevated .  In Connecticut  (the green line) , the death rate  per million of population is substantially \nlower than in  the s pring, but still not much different from the national average.  The persistent  \nseverity of the pandemic continues to limit individuals’  willingness to venture much beyond their \nown residence, with  many people prefer ring to shelter at home while waiting for the supply of \nvaccines to catch up with demand.  \nMobility data  – which is measured by cell -phone -based data on foot traffic to over 5 \nmillion points of interest – capture how individuals’ movements  have  been altered by social \ndistancing.  As Figure 2  shows , for the U .S. and Connecticut , government  mandated restrictions \nlast spring meant that  many  individuals either chose to curtail their visits to restaurants and to \nestablishments involved in non- essential retail  (for instance, discretionary shopping)  or were \nforced to , because the establishments were shut  down .  As the distancing restrictions reduced \ninfection rates, mandates were relaxed , and there was a signific ant pick -up in visits to restaurants \nand stores.   \nHowever, as we approached winter  and the second wave of infections swelled , many \nstates that had scaled back restrictions  saw infections and deaths rise  once again , with people \nreduc ing their mobility acco rdingly.  Mobility in  Connecticut data has  largely mirrored the \nnational trends .  And t he weaker economic data that we have seen for the end of last  year are \nconsistent with the reduced mobility.  \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL  \n10:10 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Fri day, Febru ary 19, 2021 -  OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n \n5 \n Note that the reaction to the even more severe second wave – in terms of reduced \nmobility – is, in part, more modest than the reaction to the initial wave last spring , as firms and \nconsumers have adapted to the constraints imposed by the virus.  High -frequency spending data , \nshown in Figure 3 , highlight  that spending fell dramatically in the s pring and has remained \ndepressed for the spending categories that are most impacted by social distancing.3  However, \nconsumers have substituted goods that can be  delivered to the home for services that require \nleaving the house.  The right side of the chart shows data for  Connecticut ; the series are \nsomewhat different as they are changes in spending per transaction rather than changes in total \nspending.  T he data show a similar pattern to the U.S., with depressed spending on social \ndistance- sensitive segments  relative to all other spending.  While  social distance- sensitive \nspending started to rebound as cases declined in the late spring and summer, it retreated as cases rose again . \nConsistent with the spending data , we have seen sharp fluctuations in employment , \nparticularly in industries most affected  by social distancing , shown in Figure 4 .  There were \ndramatic declines in payroll employment in the s pring, some recovery during the s ummer, and \nfurther declines at the end of last year.  Not surprisingly, the Arts, Entertainment, and Recreation \ncategory shows the biggest decline, with many businesses  in this segment of the economy still \nbeing restricted by limits on congregating.  Employment  in Connecticut in these s ectors , shown \non the right side of the figure, ha s largely mirrored that of the nation. \nFigure 5  shows the  change in employment  from February 2020 through January of this \nyear, for the U.S. as a whole .  Even though employment has generally been expanding since \nMay, give n the sharp declines in payroll employment in these industries last March and April , \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL  \n10:10 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Fri day, Febru ary 19, 2021 -  OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n \n6 \n we remain  well below the employment levels we saw roughly one year ago.  Unfo rtunately, \nbecause of the composition of the workforce  in many of these industries, B lack and Hispanic \nworkers have born e a disproportionate  share of the pain . \nTo capture the extent of the differences in labor market outcomes  across segments of the \npopulation, Figure 6  focus es on a broader measure of labor market slack, the U -6 measure of \nunemployment .  As well as including people unemployed and actively looking for work, the U -6 \nmeasure also encompasses  people who  are working part  time for economic reasons and persons \nwho are marginally attached to the labor force.  By this broader U -6 measure, labor market \noutcomes for Blacks and Hispanics since last February have been significantly worse than for \nWhite workers .  Note , however, that race is not the only distinguishing feature  of how the \npandemic has impacted the workforce.  Figure 7  shows that younger  workers have also suffered \ndisproportionately , with the U -6 measure for younger workers roughly double that of older \nworkers.   These race and age patterns in unemployment are not uncommon during a recession \nand the early stages of a recovery, but they are nevertheless important to highlight if as a society \nwe want to achieve more equitable outcomes .  \nWomen in the workforce have be en disproportionately impacted by the pandemic as \nwell.    While a U -6 measure by gender would not show a dramatically different experience for \nmen and women, other measures highlight the disproportionate impact of the pandemic on women.  Figure 8  shows the  labor force participation rate for men and women by age \ncategories.   Overall, the labor force participation rate for women has fallen by more than that for \nmen.   The differential is  more pronounced by age category.  For the younger age  groups , \nwomen’s lab or force participation rates have fallen by over a full percentage point more than \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL  \n10:10 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Fri day, Febru ary 19, 2021 -  OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n \n7 \n men’s  labor force participation .  The younger age categories are those where families might have \nchild  care issues during the pandemic which could cause a parent, likely a woman, to leave the \nlabor force.    \nA closer examination  of labor market outcomes  in the pandemic  also reveals differences \nin the type of unemployment.  Figure 9 shows that temporary layoffs have been much more \nprevalent than during previous downturns  (they are shown in the dark blue area at the base of the \nfigure).4  Figure 10 shows that the industries that account for much of the significant rise in \ntemporary layoffs have been those most impacted by social distancing – such as leisure and \nhospitality.  While temporary layoffs would normally come with the expect ation of be ing \nrehired, perhaps quickly, such an expectation  reflects in part that temporary  layoffs in the past \noften involved large firms that were likely to recall workers once demand started to recover .5  \nIndeed , Figure 1 1 shows that roughly 30 percent of temporary layoffs currently involve  workers \nwho have been on layoff for 27 or more weeks.  Though temporary layoffs have fallen dramatically from their peak of over 18 million  workers,  to just under 3 million workers , there \nare worrying possibilities to consider.  T o the extent that many of  these nominally temporary \nlayoffs are occurring at relatively small firms , whose reopening status is uncertain , the transition \nback to employment for these remaining temporary unemployed workers may be more difficult \nthan in previous recessions  – unless t he recovery  is exceptionally strong or policy relief \nimmediate . \nFortunately, macroeconomic policies have been forceful  since the start of the pandemic .  \nThe federal funds rate, the  short -term interest rate that the Federal Reserve targets , has been \nbetween 0 and 25 basis points since March, and as the January 27 FOMC statement indicated, \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL  \n10:10 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Fri day, Febru ary 19, 2021 -  OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n \n8 \n Fed policymakers  expect this level to persist until the committee’s  stated 2 percent inflation \ntarget  has been reach ed.  The Federal Reserve is  also continuing its purchases of Treasury and \nmortgage -backed ( MBS ) securities, which mak es it easier  and less expensive  for individuals and \nfirms to borrow at longer horizons .  These purchases will continue until there is substantially \nmore progress in  lowering unemployment and raising inflation.   \nImportantly, fiscal policy is the most effective option when monetary policy has reached \nthe lower effective bound for interest ra tes.  Fiscal policy makers  have  already taken significant \naction, and further actions are under discussion in Washington.  To my eye, policymakers have \nreacted aggressively to the current pandemic -driven economic situation and appear prepared to \ncontinue  with additional  fiscal and monetary policy actions as  needed  in order  to avoid further \nimpairment of labor markets  and the economy as a whole . \n \nCommunity Development Actions  \nWhile improving near -term public  health and macroeconomic conditions are critically \nimportant, my own view is that policymakers  should also take the time , as we rethink so many \nthings  coming out of the pandemic , to resolve some of the problems that have been brought to \nthe fore front  over the  past year .  “Essential employees ,” for instance, have always been essential, \nbut the prevalence of C OVID -19 ha s made the challenges  faced by that segment of the \nworkforce more apparent .  Indeed , we have been  frequently reminded anew that these workers \nprovide services that all  of us need to survive .   \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL  \n10:10 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Fri day, Febru ary 19, 2021 -  OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n \n9 \n One example is illustrated in  Figure 1 2, which looks  at income levels and the \ncomposition of service workers in New England prior to the pandemic .  The low -wage nature of \nservice jobs is clear as 35 percent of service workers have family income less than 200 percent of \nthe Federal Poverty Level, compared with 20 percent among workers overall.  And, a larger share of service workers rely on Supplemental Nutrition A ssistance Program (SNAP) benefits to \nfeed their families despite having a job.  And finally, it shows that  Hispanics  in particular  hold a \ndisproportionate share of these jobs .  Moreover , many of these jobs did not come with benefits \npackages.   \nParticularl y striking is the disparity in access to any form of health insurance coverage for \nnon-health  care essential workers in New England at the onset of the pandemic , shown in Figure \n13.  While 7.7 percent of White essential  workers were uninsured, 10.5 percent of B lack \nessential workers  and 13.6 percent of Hispanic  essential workers did not have health insurance.  \nIn addition, essential workers who have health insurance often face the challenging prevalence of \nhigh- cost, high- deductible plans.  Along with health insurance , there is a need for safe workplace \nenvironments, with employers investing sufficiently to protect their employees.  The rethinking of the workplace that will come as we move beyond the pandemic should also re double thinking \non safety, broadly speaking – along with the public health benefits that may accrue from better access to primary care, medical visits , and sick leave . \nWe should all remember that p rior to the pandemic, a major concern of employers across \nNew England was filling job openings  in very tight labor markets.  At the same time, in my visits \nto many New England locales – including, for example , East Hartford, Connecticut – potential \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL  \n10:10 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Fri day, Febru ary 19, 2021 -  OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n \n10 \n workers noted the impediments created by inflexible  job characteristics that limited  their ability \nto participate in the workforce.  \nIn the economics field, we  often focus on the need for workers to have sufficient skills to \nmatch the needs of employers.  I ndeed, a worker’s invest ment  in education and in other work -\nrelated skills can have a significant impact on wages and on the likelihood of holding onto a job \nin an economic downturn.  But a s Figure 1 4 illustrate s, the other side of the equation is \nimportan t; employers can and should consider how to  tweak or tailor jobs to the workforce they \ncan attract  and need to attract .  Features that raise “job quality” can be a win not only for \nworkers , but also for employers seeking to attract and retain talent.  In particular, finding ways t o \nadapt or alter regular hours so that workers can more easily commute and deal with  child  care or \nelder care could make a big difference toward the goal of  raising labor force participation  – \nespecially if coupled with more significant benefits that include health insurance, sick and family \nleave, and taking advantage of technology to allow working from home when appropriate.  \nOther actions may require more partnerships between employers and government.  The \npandemic has left many  families struggling with remote schooling and a lack of child care \noptions .  Many parents have made difficult family and financial decisions to  provide for the \nneeds of their children during the pandemic , with some choosing (at least temporarily) to exit the \nworkforce .  I believe we can do more as a nation to make sure these parents can return to the \nworkforce  even after the pandemic has subsided.  These solutions , however, will require  creative \nthinking, and employer and government support for affordable, quality child care – which \ncontinues to be a n issue for so many families  – and early childhood education.  Absent such an \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL  \n10:10 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Fri day, Febru ary 19, 2021 -  OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n \n11 \n effort, many individuals  will continue to be held back from participating in the labor market, \nwith negative repercussions for  the economy  as a whole. \nFinally, one of the challenges during the pandemic has been maintaining momentum to \nadvance important economic development goals in an economic context that has changed \nconsiderably.  Prior to the pandemic, t he Federal Reserve Bank of Boston ha d been working with \na number of cities and rural communities ar ound New England to provide collaborative solutions \nto community problems  through our Working Places initiative.6 \nHere in Connecticut, for instance, the effort involves a partnership between the  Boston \nFed, the s tate, members of the private sector  and philanthropic communities, and five  \nConnecticut  cities .  The program consist s of a three- year grant funding competition designed to \nstrengthen civic infrastructure in the participating communities by supporting teams of leaders collaborating across se ctors on shared economic goals , an approach supported by Boston Fed \nresearch .\n7  The cities  of Danbury, East Hartford,  Hartford, Middletown, and Waterbury are \nworking on a variety of efforts geared toward system ic change, engaging residents , addressing \nracial equity, and learning and adapting to build a more inclusive and equitable local economy for their residents  (Figure 1 5).   \nWhile the work is not yet completed, we have already seen many cities achieving the \nmilestones they set out for the mselves .  This sort of cross -sector collaboration at the state and \nlocal level is , in my view, critical to our ability to rebuild for a more inclusive economy set up \nfor more widespread prosperity, better business conditions, and more resilient long- term growth .   \n \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL  \n10:10 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Fri day, Febru ary 19, 2021 -  OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n \n12 \n Concluding Observations  \nThe past year with the pandemic has been grueling.  Eleven months after the initial \noutbreak, economic outcome s for individuals and businesses  still remain closely tied to finding \nand implementing  effective public health policy.  However , with the success ful development  of \nmultiple vaccines, it is now possible to imagine much better macroeconomic outcomes  ahead .8  \nMy view is that policymakers must  work to ensure that the benefits of the eventual recovery are \nwidely shared.   \nAs I’ve mentioned, I believe that as we think about recover y from the pandemic, we \nshould take the time to look for ways that our economy can be reimagined  for the better  with \nwhat we have learned during this trying period.  We should learn from the challenges that the \npandemic brought to the forefront – but were simmering even before COVID -19.  And we \nshould capitalize on the opportunities that  stem from realizing new ways of working and extend \nthem more broadly to benefit more workers  – especially those in low - and moderate -wage \noccupations  – along with employers, industries, and local economies.  \nThank you for having me , and I wish you all continued good health in 2021.  \n \n \n \n \n1 See Jan. 27, 2021 FOMC statement: \nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20210127a.htm .  \n \n2 It is worth noting that this strong fiscal a nd monetary policy response is needed, in part, because the public health \nresponse was not as forceful as it needed to be.  \n \n \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL  \n10:10 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Fri day, Febru ary 19, 2021 -  OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n \n13 \n  \n3 Year -over-year percent change of four -week moving average.  United States figures are total spending by category.  \nConnecticut fig ures are credit card  spending per transaction by category by residents living in Connecticut.  \n \n4 The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) defines people on temporary layoff as people who have been given a \ndate to return to work or who expect to return to work within 6 months.  \n \n5 Because the aggregate temporary layoffs displayed in Figure 8 are seasonally adjusted whereas the figures by \nindustry displayed in Figure 9 are not, there is a difference in the pattern for the most recent data.   The emphasis in \nFigure 9 is not on the trend but on the composition of layoffs.    \n \n6 For more about Working Pl aces, see: https://www.bostonfed.org/workingplaces.aspx  \n \n7 For more discussion of the research on which the Working Places initiative is based, see: Lessons f rom Resurgent \nCities - Federal Reserve Bank of Boston (bostonfed.org)  \n \n8 For more discussion, see Jan. 12, 2021,  talk by Eric S.

U.S. Eastern Time on Mon day, April  12, 2021 - OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n \n1 \n Good afternoon.  Thank you for inviting me to join you  today .  As we gather today, \nimprovements on the public health front, coupled with fiscal and monetary policy actions , make \nthis a hopeful time to discuss the outlook for the U.S. economy.   \nDespite continuing concerns with COVID -19 variants , which have contributed to \ninfection rates still being elevated, over one -third of Americans have already received at least \none dose of va ccine, and  the economy is beginning to show signs of recover ing from the \ndevastating effects of the pandemic.   \nEven w ith this relatively positive  public -health outlook , policymakers  must be mindful \nthat many businesses and households  continue to  experience significant economic distress  \nbrought on by the pandemic .  The effects have, unfortunately, fallen disproportionately on lower -\nwage workers in industries where social distancing and remote work are  difficult  – segments of \nthe workforce that includ e many Black and Hispanic workers.   Women  and younger workers  \nhave also suffered disproportionately during the pandemic. With economic recovery in sight, we \nshould focus on creating a more inclusive economy in which  opportunities  are widely shared.1  \nThere are a number of signs that the economy is recovering , starting with t he recent \nemployment report .  The employment report for March illustrates the strength of the recovery, \nwith payroll employment growing by over 900,000 jobs.  However, the U.S. unem ployment rate \nis still elevated , at 6 percent , and many workers and firms impacted by social distancing \nrequirements (or continued consumer fears , at least for the time being ) are still struggling.   \nAssuming vaccines remain effective against new variants o f the virus, the U .S. economy should \nexperience a significant rebound this year, propelled by highly accommodative monetary and \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL  \n1 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Mon day, April  12, 2021 - OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n \n2 \n fiscal policy, and significant pent -up demand from consumers and firms  whose ability to spend  \nhas been restrained by the pandemic . \n At the March meeting of the Federal Reserve’s policy -making body, the Federal Open \nMarket Committee (FOMC) , the median projection  of participants  for real GDP growth for 2021 \nwas 6.5 percent , with the  unemployment rate expected to finish the yea r more than  2 percentage \npoint s lower (i.e., better) than at the end of 2020.  Many private forecasters expect particularly \nstrong consumption  growth this year , fueled by fiscal stimulus payments and the easing of \nrestrictions that have limited consumers’ ability to spend on certain leisure and entertainment \nservices.   As people become vaccinated, domestic travel is likely to pick up . Indeed, airlines, \nhotels, and restaurants  that were particularly hard hit over the past year are already  showing \nevidence of recovery in high -frequency spending data.  \n Despite  this very strong forecast,  I expect  a return of the economy to pre -pandemic levels \nwill likely take longer than m any private forecasters expect.  With labor -market slack  still \nsignificant , and inflation still below the Federal Reserve’s  2 percent target, my perspective is  that \nthe current highly accommodative  stance of  monetary policy is appropriate.   \nCertainly e veryone hope s that we quickly return to an economy with tight er labor \nmarkets  and a significant  improve ment in many of the  sectors of the economy hardest hit by the \npandemic.  A strong labor market and a return to in -person schooling, for instance, would make \nit easier  for parents  who left the job market  last year  to care for children  (a dynamic that \ndisproportionately involved female workers) , to reenter the labor force and find a job.   I expect \nthat over the next couple of years , we will see the unemployment rate  falling back to  pre-\npandemic levels, with significantly improved labor  force participation  rates . \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL  \n1 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Mon day, April  12, 2021 - OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n \n3 \n  The current accommodative stance of monetary and fiscal policy should help return the \neconomy to full employment much faster than in the previous downturn.  Indeed, t he Fed eral \nReserve ’s revised  monetary policy framework puts an emphasis  on seeing  economic evidence \n(for example, of higher inflation)  before shif ting the stance of policy.    \nOf course, the Fed seeks to avoid a prolonged slow recovery such as the one that \nfollowed the financial crisis of 2007 -2008 and the ensuing Great Recession .2  Nonetheless, it is \nimportant to acknowledge that running a so-calle d “hot” economy for a prolonged period is not \nwithout risk s, as I have discussed  many times in recent years .  As I will discuss  today , it arguably  \nfactored into some of the challenges to financial stability that emerged at the start of the \npandemic .  Going forward, s uch issues should be addressed to limit financial markets’ potential \nto amplify the effects of adverse economic outcomes  in the future.    Today, I will focus on three \nsuch risks.  \n• First, I will highlight that in the last two downturns (the episodes beginning in 2007 and \n2020),  prime and tax -exempt money market funds experienced rapid , large  outflows of \nfunds , which  badly disrupted short -term credit markets.  (This necessitated  emergency \nlending facilities , which were  administered by the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston  on \nbehalf of the Federal Reserve System .)  I will also highlight risks in certain open -end \nmutual fu nds.    \n• Second, many financial firms experienced a liquidity squeeze that led to  a wave of sales \nof usually liquid Treasury securities, badly disrupting the Treasury market which is the \ncornerstone of the U .S. bond market.  \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL  \n1 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Mon day, April  12, 2021 - OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n \n4 \n • And t hird, I will share my view  that extensive forbearance for borrowers and banks was \nnecessary  to continue the flow of bank credit.   \nThe factors underlying t hese financial market stresses , in my view, must  be addressed  – to avoid \na future repeat of the issues the economy  experienced at the start of the pandemic.  \n \nThe Economic Outlook  \n For the past year, economic forecasts have been intertwined with projections of C OVID -\n19 infections and mortality , which were reflected in  many of the movements of higher -frequency \nmobility and spending data.  Today , I am pleased to focus for a moment on  a more optimistic \npicture – vaccination rates.  As Figure 1  shows, i n the U .S., 33 percent of the population ha ve \nreceived at least a first  dose of the vaccine.   Here i n New England, the rollout of vaccinations has \nbeen better than  in many parts of the country, with all six New England states among the states \nwith the highest percent age of residents who have received at least one shot.   \nIn contrast,  as the figure shows,  Europe has had difficulty obtaining a  sufficient vaccine \nsupply , and then getting that supply to people, at a time when variants of the virus are \nunfortunately provin g more contagious.  This has caused several European countries  to once \nagain confront rising infection  rates  with increased restrictions on social mobility .  Without th ese \npolicies hospital s would again become strained and deaths would rise.   The problem is even \nworse in many third -world countries , where the re is little to  no domestic vaccine production, and \nvaccine costs are prohibitively  high. \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL  \n1 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Mon day, April  12, 2021 - OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n \n5 \n  Figure 2  shows that as the vaccination rollout  in the U.S.  has improved  since the \nbeginning of th e year , FOMC participants have upgraded their outlook  for GDP , as reported in \nthe Summary of Economic Projections, which is a collection of economic projections made by \nFed policymakers four times a year.  Passage of the large fiscal stimulus also played a role. \nSpecifically, between the  December  projections and the March  projections , the median GDP \ngrowth forecast  for this year has risen by more than 2 percentage points.  \nThis optimism appears to also be shared by private -sector  forecasters.   Figure 3  reports \nthe four most  recent GDP forecast s from the Blue Chip  Survey  (which polls roughly 50 private -\nsector  economic  forecasters ).  Many of the Blue Chip forecasters have upgrad ed their forecast of  \nhow quickly the economy will recover.  Passage of fiscal stimulus also played a role.  Between \nJanuary and April , these private forecasters have  increased their forecast for  economic growth , \nparticularly  in the first half of the year.   \nFigure 4 provides a sense of the distribution of the Blue Chip forecasts.  The average of \nthe 10 forecasters with the highest growth rate are expecting GDP growth in excess of 10 \npercent.  The average of the 10 forecasters with the lowest growth rate still exceeds  3 percent \nthrough this year.  \n The r apid projected growth in GDP is similarly reflected in expectations for significant \nimprovements in the labor market.   Figure 5 shows the unemployment rate forecast from the \nFOMC’s Summary of Economic Projections .  From September to March, FOMC participants \nhave been lowering their estimate of the path of unemployment  as they raised their estimated \npath of GDP growth .  Over that six -month period, with substantially more fiscal spending than \nestimated last September  and better vaccination outcomes  than expected at the end of 2020 , \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL  \n1 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Mon day, April  12, 2021 - OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n \n6 \n participants have reduced their forecast of unemployment for the end of this year by 1 percentage \npoint, with declines in forecasts for subsequent years also substantial.  Figure 6 shows that  the \nmost recent Blue Chip consensus  forecast follows a similar pattern  – but starting from a slightly \nhigher level, ends at a slightly higher level than the SEP, despite a slightly less  gradual decline in \n2022.  \n FOMC participants have also been increasin g their estimates for core PCE inflation, \nshown in Figure 7.  The most recent forecast, shown as squares, has core inflation somewhat \nexceeding 2 percent  in 2021 and 2023 .  The average core inflation rate for the Blue Chip \nforecasters  is roughly in line with the Summary of Economic Projections from FOMC \nparticipants.  However, as Figure 8 shows, the range of Blue Chip survey  forecasts is quite large \nbetween the average of the 10 highest inflation forecasts and the average of the 10 low est \ninflation forecasts.  \n As the economy return s to full employment and 2 percent inflation, the median FOMC \nparticipant expect ation is  that short -term interest rates will remain close to zero through 2023 , as \nis shown in Figure 9.  Note that during most previous economic recoveries, forecasts of \nreturning to full employment at the  target  inflation  rate would have been accompanied by  \nexpectations of gradual increases in interest rates.  However, with the revised  monetary policy \nframework  adopted by the F OMC, monetary policy makers  can be more patient  and wait for \nmore tangible signs  that inflation has increased , rather than just forecasts, before starting to raise \nrates.  \n \n \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL  \n1 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Mon day, April  12, 2021 - OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n \n7 \n The Employment Report  \n Turning to the labor markets, t he most recent data on employment are quite consistent \nwith an economy beginning to expand from the constraints of the pandemic.  Figure 10 shows \nthat after a pandemic -related slowdown at the end of last year , payroll employment has been \nincreasing.  In March alone, more than 900,000 new jobs were created.   \nFigure 1 1 shows that some of the growth in jobs has been  in industries that had been \nstrongly impacted , initially, by the pandemic and the need for  social  distancing.  Leisure and \nhospitality  employment,  which declined during the second wave of the pandemic at the end of \nlast year  and the beginning of this year , has since been rising  – though employment still remains \nwell below levels seen prior to the pand emic.  If one looks at total employment not including \nleisure and hospitality, jobs have been increasing gradually, but still remain somewhat below  \ntheir pre-pandemic levels.  \n Other indication s of the continued strains on the labor market as a result of th e pandemic \nare the changes in the  labor force participation rates  for prime working age men and women , \nshown in Figure 1 2.  With many schools either in a remote or hybrid  learning mode , many \nparents have left the workforce to provide support for their children.   Those who leave the labor \nforce are not counted as unemployed, even though  some of them would nevertheless prefer to be \nworking if the childcare situation were different and job conditions were better . In this respect, \nreduced labor force partic ipation represents a concerning development.  While labor force \nparticipation has been improving  of late , it is still well below the participation rate we saw before \nthe pandemic . \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL  \n1 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Mon day, April  12, 2021 - OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n \n8 \n  Given the challenges in the labor market, fiscal and monetary policy are un usually \nstimulative, with the hope that the economic recovery will be much faster than the one  follow ing \nthe Great Recession .  As Figure 1 3 shows, five years after the 2008 recession,  the \nunemployment rate was still close to 8 percent.  Of course the natur e of the 2020 shock was very \ndifferent, as was the condition of banks this time , but with a much more aggressive monetary and \nfiscal policy response and the rapid development of vaccines, the unemployment rate has already \nfallen much more quickly  this time .  And as I previously show ed, FOMC participants expect  that \nthe unemployment rate will decline  to just under  4 percent within two years.  \n  \nSome Risks to the Economic O utlook  \n While there are downside risk s to economic activity from  potential COVID -19 virus \nvariants, risks to the upside are also present , as the amount of fiscal and monetary stimulus is \nmuch greater now than in previous cycles. Th ese upside risks could,  in turn , pose some financial \nstability risks  when the next recession occurs .  As I mentioned earlier , my view is that other \nremaining risks  are the structural ones that contributed to the financial market disruptions that \noccurred when the pandemic began  last year .3   \n The first  of the three structural risks I see relates to  short -term credit markets , which , in \nthe past two recessions , have been disrupted by runs on prime and tax -exempt money market \nmutual funds  (MMMFs) .  Figure 14  shows the run on prime funds as a sharp reduction in assets \nunder management, in 2008 and in 2020.  These funds invest in relatively high -quality , short -\nterm credit instruments, which can experience liquidity problems if investors pull their money \nfrom the money funds quickly, forcing the funds  to sell  relatively illiquid assets  into distressed \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL  \n1 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Mon day, April  12, 2021 - OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n \n9 \n markets . Figure 15  depicts that problem, showing that in both 2008 and 2020, such selling into \ndistressed markets caused  a spike in the spread above the Fed Funds rate for highly rated, asset -\nbacked commercial debt .  Other indicators  of funding market st ress also spiked  during both \nepisodes , including those for short -term municipal debt.   \nSimply put, prime and tax -exempt MMMFs should not need emergency lending facilities  \nas they did in the financial crisis that began in 2007 , and more recently  at the onset of the \npandemic .  Unlike prime  and tax -exempt funds, government MMMFs (which invest in short -\nterm U.S. Treasury and agency securities  and private debt fully  collateralized by such \ninstruments ) did not experience the same problems  – rather, go vernment funds experienced large \ninflows .  One potential solution would be to require prime and tax -exempt MMMFs to convert to \nsuch government funds.4 \nI should mention that the pandemic also shed a light on the remaining structural \nvulnerabilities in open -end mutual funds (MFs), particularly corporate debt MFs, which allow \ndaily redemptions, notwithstanding the liquidity of their underlying assets.5   A potential \nremedial action would be to require all MFs to adopt swing pric ing, which is currently \nvoluntary.6  A properly calibrated swing pricing system could reduce investors’ incentives to run, \nas it would force them to at least partially bear the cost of their redemptions, without  \ndisadvantag ing those investors choos ing to remain in the fund.   Alternatively, measures that \nmatch a MF’s redemption frequency to the liquidity profile of its underlying holdings are worth \nexploring.   \n A second risk that came into view at the onset of the pandemic involved a “dash for \nliquidity ,” in which a variety of entities, seeking to bolster their liquidity position s, sold large \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL  \n1 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Mon day, April  12, 2021 - OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n \n10 \n volumes of U .S. Treasury securities.  However, the infrastructure for buying and selling U .S. \nTreasury securities relies primarily on broker -dealers and could become strained if unusually \nlarge volumes of Treasury securities are being sold, as was the case in March.  One possible  \nsolution would be to create a structure less reliant on broker -deale rs’ balance sheet s to maintain \nliquid  markets for these securities .  One way t his could be done  is by creating expanded central \nclearing mechanisms for Treasury securities and the financing of Treasury securities.  \n A third risk that became apparent early i n 2020  was the concern that banks would \nconstrict credit, potentially exacerbating the economic downturn.  A variety of regulatory relief \nproposals were adopted, including greater forbearance for borrowers, encouragement to utilize \ncapital buffers, and a r elaxation of some of the prevailing capital requirements.7  In addition, \nbanks were asked to stop share repurchases and limit dividend payments until it was clear that \ntheir capital was sufficient to weather the recession  brought on by the pandemic .  While these \nmeasures were needed  at the time , and thus appropriate , in my view  they reflect a capital regime \nthat is not sufficiently flexible during economic downturns.  Investors in banks , and bank \nmanagement teams, would pr efer to avoid the attendant uncertainty around capital planning, and \nbank regulators would prefer to not suspend bank regulations in economic downturns.   \nA solution to this problem is to provide a Countercyclical  Capital Buffer , or CCyB , that \ngets built u p during economic recoveries, but is expected to be drawn down during economic \ndownturns.  Rather than disrupt bank capital planning and rely on temporary relief from capital \nregulations, the CCyB  provides a “shock absorber ” that, if appropriately implemen ted, would \nallow borrower financing to continue without these temporary extraordinary and less predictable \nmeasures.8   \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL  \n1 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Mon day, April  12, 2021 - OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n \n11 \n A policy that runs a “hot” economy could pose other financial stability challenges , as I \nhave discussed in previous speeches .  However, my view is  that these three structural risks seem \nthe most immediate to address in an effort  to avoid a repeat of the financial problems \nexperienc ed at the outset of the pandemic.  \n \nConclu ding Observations  \nIt seems likely that the economy will grow rapidly this year .  This should reduce the slack \nin the labor markets and eventually return inflation to the Federal Reserve’s 2 percent target.  \nAssuming virus variants do not become especially problematic, we should see an unusually \nstrong post -recession recovery .   \nWhile the near -term public health and macroeconomic improvements  are more than  \nwelcome and  critically important , I also believe that  policymakers  across the spectrum  should \ntake the time to examine some of the problems brought to the forefront  over the  past year .  In \ndoing so, they can help  to en sure we are rebuilding an economy that works for all Americans  \nthroughout the inevitable business cycle .    \nThe combination of accommodative monetary and fiscal policy, and consumers and firms \nwell positioned to renew spending, should result in returning to full emplo yment much more \nquickly than after the  last financial crisis and Great Recession .  However, many of the \nunderlying problems that can disrupt financial stability – as at the outset of the pandemic  – still \nneed to be addressed .  During the economic recovery,  policymakers  should be diligent about \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL  \n1 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Mon day, April  12, 2021 - OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n \n12 \n removing these risks to financial stability, which translate into risks for the economy  and every \nfirm and worker in it . \n Thank you for having me speak today, and best wishes for good health and economic  \nrecovery  in the months ahead .  \n  \n \n \n \n1 For more discussion, see Feb. 19, 2021,  talk by Eric S. Rosengren entitled: Perspectives on the Eventual Economic \nRecovery . \n \n2 For more discussion of the changes to the fr amework, see : Federal Reserve Board - 2020 Statement on Longer -Run \nGoals an d Monetary Policy Strategy .  \n \n3 For more discussion, see  Oct. 8, 2020,  remarks by Eric S. Rosengren, entitled Economic Fragility: Implications for \nRecovery from the Pandemic , and also Jan. 12, 2021 , remarks entitled, The Economic Outlook – Optimism Despite \nthe Challenges  Ahead . \n \n4 Some MMMF sponsors have converted their prime funds into government  funds.  For example, Vanguard, noting \nthe “…rewards of even the most conservatively managed prime funds are  no longer worth the risk,” reorganized its \nprime money market fund into a government fund.  See:  Vanguard, Aug. 2020, Vanguard Anno unces  Changes to \nMoney Market Fund Lineup .   \n \n5 Policymakers have highlighted “liquidity transformation” risks a s a vulnerability arising from the MF structure.  \nSuch funds offer daily redemptions, irrespective of the liquidity profile of their holdings.  The key concern is that \nheavy investor redemption s would force MFs to liquidate assets at “fire sale prices,” which could impact other \nfinancial markets.  Last March, corporate and municipal bond MFs experienced significant redemptions, which \nlikely contributed to strains in bond markets during that peri od.  \n \n6 A fund that adopts swing pricing will reduce  (increase) its price per share  by a pre -established “factor” if net \nredemptions  (purchases) exceed a certain threshold.  We are not aware of any U .S. MF that has adopted swing \npricing.  In contrast, swin g pricing is widely used in Europe, and some research suggests it reduces redemptions \nduring periods of stress.  See, for example: Dunhon et al, Nov. 2019, Swing Pricing and Fragility in Open -Ended \nMutual Funds , International Monetary Fund Working Paper .   \n \n7 To be more specific, easing of the leverage ratio for the largest firms and adjusting the CBLR requirement for \nsome small banks.  \n \n8 For additional  discussion of the CCyB and other financial stability policy tools, see March 23, 2018 , remarks at the \nTenth Conference of the International Research Forum on Monetary Policy by Eric S.

U.S. Eastern Time on Wednes day, May 5 , 2021 - OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n \n1 \n Good morning.  Even though this event is being held virtually, it is wonderful to be with \nthe Boston College community today.  Thank you for inviting me to participate in th is webinar \nseries , focused on aspects of life after the COVID  pandemic .  Clearly , we have all learned a great \ndeal during this extremely difficult  period.   Now , as we contemplate and work towards a \nrecovery – in both public health and the economy – it is important to keep learning, to continue  \napplying those le ssons even after the crises fade , and to keep analyzing data and policy  options \nwith rigor  – and without overreacti ng to the inevitable temporary ebbs and flows  that may show \nup in high frequency economic data.  The analysis I will share with you today , I hope, will \nreflect  this perspective.    \nI’d like to begin with an overview of the main points I will cover  today .   \nI’ll start on an optimistic note , recognizing that  half of the adult  population , or more , in \neach New England state has already received one dose of a COVID -19 vaccine .  In fact , all six \nstates  in the region are among the top ten  U.S. states with the highest  percent of  their population \nwith at least one vaccine  dose.  As a result , New England residents and businesses can \ncontemplate  a somewhat more normalized summer.  Indeed, high  frequency data on economic \nactivity indicate that air travel is picking up , as are visits to restaurants  – suggesting  that \nindustries hard hit by social distancing are now beginning  to recover.  And the New England \neconomy, like the national economy, is in the process of experiencing rapid growth in real output  \nand notable improvements in payroll employment  relative to the levels seen at the depths of the \npandemic .   \n Despite the improved public health outlook  and the expansion in economic activity , it is \nvery important to note that significant slack remains  in the economy .  U.S. unemployment in \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL  \n11:05 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Wednes day, May 5 , 2021 - OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n \n2 \n March was still elevated  compared to pre-pandemic  readings .  And th e unemployment rate does \nnot include the millions  who have left the workforce  since the pandemic began .  The l abor force \nparticipation  rate, measured by the percent of the population in the workforce, whet her employed \nor unemployed, remains depressed .  Therefore , while rapid economic g rowth is very good news, \nit was, and still is, badly needed to offset the sizable shock that occurred with the COVID -19 \npandemic . \n The strong outlook for the economy is not just reflecting  the progress toward \nnormalization of the public health situation and the resulting  reopening  of businesses ; it is also \nthe result of aggressive government policy  actions .  Fiscal policy has been  unusually  stimulative , \nand in some innovative  ways,  provid ing a major boost to the pandemic -shocked economy.  The \nstance of m onetary policy has also remained highly accommodative, as the Federal Reserve’s \nnew policy implementation framework places emphasis on realized, rather than expected, \noutcomes as part of  material shifts in policy.1  This implies that current  policy will remain \naccommodative  until the labor market can consistently help deliver on the Fed’s  2 percent \ninflation goal , as is described in the most recent statement by the Federal Open Market \nCommittee (FOMC) .2 \n Given the strong support from both fiscal and monetary policy , some analysts are worried \nthat inflation – dormant for most of the past decade , if not longer  – could  pick up significantly . \nAs I will discuss today, a  number of temporary factors are like ly to make measured in flation this \nspring higher than its underlying  and more informative  trend.  These factors , to a large degree , \nare the result of  the ebbs and flows of the pandemic, which has produced unusual patterns in the \nmonthly economic data.   \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL  \n11:05 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Wednes day, May 5 , 2021 - OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n \n3 \n Indeed , payroll employment, retail sales , and inflation numbers have all been influenced  \nby pandemic -related  events .  As a case in point, at the outset of the pandemic  the contraction in \npayroll employment  and retail sales led to a notable decline in prices and a  slowdown in the \nassociated 12 -month measures of inflation, such as the Consumer Price Index ( CPI) and the \nPersonal Consumption Expenditures  (PCE) Price Index .  However, as the weak March and April \ninflation readings of last year drop out of the 12 -month computation, measured inflation will \nrebound, largely reflecting the reversal of deflationary pressures that occurred in late spring and \nearly summer of last year.  \n Other factors are also likely to distort the inflation numbers this spring.  Oil prices , which \ndeclined dramatically as travel fell, have increased significantly of late .  Pent -up demand for \ngoods ha s resulted in the rise of shipping costs , and delays in unloading at ports have made it \ndifficult fo r many businesses to restock their shelves.  All these factors will likely result in \ntemporary increases in prices.  \n The Federal Reserve is , and should be , focused on the underlying rate of inflation, and \nnot on temporary price fluctuations , such as the ones just mentioned .  In this regard, i nflation \nexpectations remain stable, compensation and wages  have yet to expand at rates that would drive \naccelerating inflation , and the most likely outcome remains that inflation will normalize close to \n2 percent.   \nMonthly e conomic data can grab attention and fuel concern, so this is an important time \nto recognize distortions in the higher frequency data brought by the pandemic .  In short , it will be \nimportant to differentiate between temporary and longe r-term trends.  Of course, p olicymakers  \nwill need to be vigilant in making sure that the post-pandemic economic environment does not \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL  \n11:05 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Wednes day, May 5 , 2021 - OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n \n4 \n bring structural changes that would lead to wages and prices being  more responsive to tightening \nlabor market conditions .  \n \nEbbs and Flows in the Economic  Data  \n Figure 1  provides a cell-phone -based mobility index that a data provider calculates based \non tracking foot traffic to different points of interest . At the beginning of the pandemic, \ngovernment -mandated shu tdowns and concern with public health caused most of the public to \nstay in their residences , and as a result the mobility index fell precipitously .  As government \nmandates lifted  and people and firms adapted market transactions to social distancing needs, \nmobility increased. W ith progress in vaccinations  since the height of the second wave in the \nwinter , many people are once again enjoying enhanced mobility.  It is important to note that \nwhile mobility has clearly improved, it remains abou t 15 percent below 2019 levels.   \n This pattern can be seen even more clearly in the next slide. Figure 2  provides high  \nfrequency spending data, again compared to the same period in 2019 , but this time spending that \nrequires close personal contact is separate from spending that does not .  Consum er spending \npatterns on goods and services less sensitive to  social distancing already mirror  2019 spending \npatterns.  However, spending that is more sensitive to  social distancing  – such as tourism and \ntravel  – remain s more than 20 percent below 2019 levels , even though it has improved \nsignificantly since the onset of widespread vaccinations .   \nIt is my view that t he ebbs and flows of spending sensitive to social distancing have \nimplications for future growth.   The impact of the pandemic on  such spending is worth noting .  \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL  \n11:05 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Wednes day, May 5 , 2021 - OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n \n5 \n At the outset of the pandemic social -distance -sensitive spending fell, rebou nded quite rapidly \nwhen infections were low, fell again in the fall with a resurgence of cases, and has rebounded \nmore recently as vaccines have rolled out.   While much progress has been made, one reason to \ncontinue to expect strong growth in employment and real GDP going forward is that there are a \nvariety of industries still impacted by the pandemic.  Policymakers  expect these effects  to further \ndiminish as a higher percentage of the population is vaccinated and the in fection rate diminishes \nfurther.   \nThe same pattern can be seen in the more traditional retail sales data.  Figure 3 provides \nthe monthly ebbs and flows in retail sales.  Again , we see a similar pattern  – a sharp decline at \nthe outset of the pandemic, a pick -up as COVID cases fell in the summer, a decline in the fall \nwith higher case  count s, and a recent pick -up as more people are  being  vaccinated.  In short , the \neconomic data , and in this case retail sale s data,  are strongly showing the impact of the \npandemic.   \nAs previously mentioned , more than  pandemic -driven business  re-opening s are driving \nconsumer spending .  Many individuals fortunate enough to have not los t their job  have increased \ntheir saving rate  during the pandemic .  This , in addition to the support from government \ntransfers, was largely because  many households reduced their discretionary spending  given  the \npublic health concerns.  As many individuals now have more opportunit ies to spend, that \nincreased savings represents  pent-up demand for goods and services that were restricted during \nthe pandemic . The release of this pent -up demand should lead to strong growth going forward.  In \nfact, consumption last quarter expanded more than  10 percent.  This expectation of strong \nconsumption is one reason that  at the March meeting  of the FOMC , the median real GDP growth \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL  \n11:05 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Wednes day, May 5 , 2021 - OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n \n6 \n forecast for 2021 was 6.5 percent  – a much faster pace of growth than what we normally \nexperience in the United States.  \n With an expected surge in spending, low interest rates, and stimulative fiscal policy, \nsome commentators have highlighted risks that inflation will pick  up quickly.  Figure 4  shows \nthe April  forecasts of the Blue -Chip forecasters, roughly 50 private -sector economists.  The left \npanel shows the distribution of their individual forecasts for inflation for 2021.  The average of \nthe forecasts is 2.3 percent.  In addition, the forecasters are tightly clustered  between 2 .1 and 2.5 \npercent, with only a few i solated forecasters either above or below that range.   \nThe right panel shows the distribution of Blue  Chip forecasts  for inflation for 2022.  Here \nthe average  is 2 percent, somewhat below th is year’s average  expectations. However, the  2022  \nforecasts are now more dispersed, with most forecasts between 1. 6 and 2. 4 percent.  Seventeen \nforecasters expect an inflation rate above 2 percent in 2022, while 21 forecasters expect a rate \nlower than 2  percent . And, the median for 2022  – 2 percent – is also the mo de with 9 economists \nforecasting a rate of 2 percent in 2022.  Overall , these private -sector forecasters  expect slower \nprice increases in 2022 than 2021.  This indicates that many prominent forecasters expect \nsomewhat more pronounced price increases in the near term , but that th ese increases will be \ntemporary and as such , will not significantly alter the underlying rate of inflation.  Still, many of \nthem expect that once these temporary increases have dissipated, the inflation rate will remain \nnoticeably abo ve 2 percent next year.   \nI will now spend a few moments investigat ing with you  why this uncertainty is a feature \nof the inflation  outlook . \n \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL  \n11:05 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Wednes day, May 5 , 2021 - OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n \n7 \n Ebbs and Flows  – Versus Trends  – in Inflation  \n Figure 5  shows the monthly changes in the CPI and PCE inflation indices.3  Like the \nspending data, inflation data show substantial effects from the pandemic.  As the economy was \nclosing down  in the early days of the pandemic , prices were being heavily discounted.   As the \neconomy surged with reduced infections and a reduction in restrictions over last summer, \nmonthly prices rose quite rapidly.  With a rise in infections as we approached winter, price  \nincrease s were again subdued;  and now prices are  again  rising as people get vaccinated.   \nThese price movements , intertwined with the ebb and flow of the pandemic , cause \nunusual patterns in the monthly inflation data.  While the monthly data normally show only \nmodest fluctuations, the data for the past year are quite va riable.  This implies that annual \naverages of inflation will be impacted noticeably by these oscillations  in the monthly readings .  \nFor example, as the updated , rolling  annual average s no longer include the initial months of the \npandemic, large negative observations will be dropped  – which will cause the measured inflation \nover the past year to rise.  Ideally, we should all focus on the more durable underlying  price \nincreases and recogn ize that the choppiness of the data will cause some ebbs and flows in annual \naverages , largely  tied to what was occurring with the pandemic last year.   \n In addition to the pandemic causing volatility in measured inflation, commodity prices \nlike oil are hi ghly sensitive to current economic conditions .  Figure 6  shows that oil prices have \nincreased substantially from a year ago.  However, the magnitude of the increase reflects how \nweak oil prices were at the outset of the pandemic.  Figure 7  illustrates  that both oil prices and \nthe total P CE show significant movements depending on what was happening with the pandemic  \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL  \n11:05 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Wednes day, May 5 , 2021 - OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n \n8 \n (a sharp drop as the pandemic began, for example, and dips when cases flared up mid to late \n2020) . \n Supply disruptions are also affecting prices  in the short run . Many firms are currently \ncomplaining that they cannot get intermediate goods  for production , or that it has become \nincreasingly costly and time consuming to replenish inventories.  Ports have had difficulty \nunloading ships, resulting in back -ups.  Figure 8  shows a measure of shipping costs , which \nindicates that as pandemic restraints have been l ifted, the cost of shipping has risen markedly.   \n Figure 9  highlights that import prices have exhibited  significant movements related to \nthe pandemic.  Foreign producers dropped prices as the pandemic began, but with surging \ndemand and many impediments to  production arising in many developing countries, prices of \nimports have been rising.  \n The supply constraints occurring with surging demand are particularly problematic for \nsome firms , because of their reliance on just -in-time inventory processes.  While k eeping \ninventory levels low reduces carrying costs, it also means that many goods may be in short \nsupply in the near term.  Figure 10  shows that inventories declined significantly at the outset of \nthe pandemic and still lag pre -pandemic levels  quite signif icantly .  As a result, in addition to a \nsurge in consumer demand, many firms are trying to rebuild their inventories.  \n In sum, a s all these charts illustrate, we should expect that measured inflation  will \naccelerate  this spring.  However, my view is that this acceleration in the rate of price increases is \nlikely to prove  temporary.  Toilet paper and Clorox were in short supply at the outset of the \npandemic, but manufacturers eventually increased supply,  and those items are no longer scarce .  \nMany of the fac tors raising prices this spring are also likely to be similarly short -lived.   \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL  \n11:05 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Wednes day, May 5 , 2021 - OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n \n9 \n However, the debate about whether trend inflation will rise as the economy strongly recovers, \nrepresented by the dispersion of Blue Chip inflation forecasts for 2022, will not be answered \nuntil next year.  \n \nPolicy Implications  \n The Federal Reserve should b e and is  focused on underlying inflationary trends.  One-\ntime, temporary  changes in prices should not impact the medium -term trajectory  of inflation .   \nWhen  people expect persistently higher inflation, it would follow  that wages would begin \nto reflect thes e higher expectations.  Figure 11  shows that average hourly earnings are higher.  \nHowever , it is important to appreciate a nuance:  much of this trend reflects that , unfortunately,  \nfirms impacted by social distancing reduced staff that were generally lower paid, and this made \nthe calculation of average hourly earnings rise.  The employment co st index controls for \ncomposition changes in the workforce, and to date is not showing much change.  \n Figure 12  summarizes  the outlook for inflation  from the Blue  Chip forecasters .  Despite \nthe ebbs and flows of the data, inflation is expected to remain close  to 2 percent over the forecast \nhorizon.  This does seem to me to be the most likely outcome, which should allow monetary \npolicy makers to be patient in removing accommodation, until more progress in the labor  market  \nhas occurred .   \nHowever, the pandemic is  likely to change some behaviors.  Both spending patterns and \nwork environments are likely to  be altered by the pandemic.  It is too early to know whether the \neconomic relationships we observed  pre-pandemic will behave similarly in the post-pandemic  \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL  \n11:05 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Wednes day, May 5 , 2021 - OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n \n10 \n era.  It will be particularly important to see whether wages and prices continue to be relatively \nunresponsive to  the tightening of the labor market.  \n \nConcluding Observations  \n With a shock as large as the pandemic , policymakers  need to be alert to potential changes \nto the economy.  To date, inflation expectations and the underlying inflation rate look to be \nstable.  It is important to keep in mind  the difficulty that was experienced in  achieving inflation \nof 2 percent in the Uni ted States and most of the developed world after the Great Financial \nCrisis .4  As a result, my perspective is  that the emphasis on actual outcomes rather than forecasts \nof risin g inflationary pressures  when setting monetary policy appears justified .  However, given \nthe noise in the data, it will be important to carefully filter underlying inflation trends as labor \nmarkets tighten.  \nThank you  for having me today, and I wish you all an enjoyable – and heal thy – spring \nand summer.  \n \n \n \n1 For more discussion of the changes to the framework, see : Federal Reserve Board - 2020 Statement on Longer -Run \nGoals and Monetary Polic y Strategy . \n \n2 For more discussion, see the April 28, 2021 statement by the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC):  \nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press releases/monetary20210428a.htm .  \n \n3 Economists typically measure inflation as inflation over the year – the percent change in either the CPI or PCE for \na given month from the same month in the previous year (as is done  in Figures 6 and 7).

U.S. Eastern Time on Wednes day, May 12, 2021 - OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n \n1 \n   \n Thank you for the opportunity  to join you for this important discussion  today .  The topic \nof central bank digital currencies is certainly  of interest to the Federal Reserve and other nations ’ \ncentral banks around the world .  Like other s, the Federal Reserve System is considering both the \ntechnical and policy issues surrounding all aspects of a central bank digital currency.  In my brief \nremarks today  on the panel , I will  touch on several of the se key considerations .   \nThanks in part to  the lower cost of information and data processing , brought on by \ntechnology  advances , payments and payment systems are changing rapidly.  In the United States , \nthere has been a grow ing need to update our payments system to  allow  for cutting -edge  digitiz ed \ncommerce.  A major  step in that direction came in the form of  the 2019 announcement of the \nlargest payments system investment by the Federal Reserve in 40 years  – specifically our  plans \nto roll out an instant payment system, FedNow, running 24 hours a day , 365 days a year, and \navailable to banks of any size in the United States.1   \nFedNow is intended to be a fast, seamless, and secure way to transmit funds.  The Federal \nReserve S ystem is expect ing to launch the service in 2023 , and I would note that FedNow  will \nprovide many of the use cases frequently associated with  potential digital currencies, including \nfacilitating digital commerce in dollars.  It may , over time , also have the capacity to significantly \nreduce costs f or a variety of transactions, including possibly international transactions.  In \naddition, a faster payments system – combined with a no -cost transaction account at banks – \ncould potentially promote better economic i nclusion in the financial system  for many citizens . \nIn addition to the work being done on FedNow, the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston is \nalso engaged in research focused on the technology related to a central bank digital currency.  At \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL  \n9:05 A.M.  U.S. Eastern Time on Wednes day, May 12, 2021 - OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n \n2 \n the outset, i t is imp ortant to highlight that this is exploratory work , and any decision to move \nforward with such a currency would depend on a variety of factors beyond the technological \nfeasibility and implementation.2  Of course a  variety of very difficult policy issues would need to \nbe resolved to appropriately design key features of a central bank  digital currency.   \nA variety  of reasons are sometimes offered for deploying a central bank digital currency , \nincluding :  \n• resolv ing issues with financial inclusion , such as serving the unbanked ;  \n• reducing costly cross -border transactions ;  \n• providing monetary policy  with additional  flexibility ;  \n• facilitating targeted fiscal transfers ; and \n• reducing counterparty risk by using legal tender.   \nDesign choices w ould involve trade -offs, however, including introducing additional \ncomplexity that could actually slow the processing of large volumes of transactions.   In addition, \none must  be attuned to  the possibility of  unintended consequences, including the possibility of \nrapid movements of funds which could impact financial stability.   \nIn part, of course, it is important to understand what problems a central bank digital \ncurrency is being designed to solve, and whether other technologies could more cheaply or \nefficiently  address  those problem s.  Nonetheless, work on understanding the technical  hurdles to \na central bank digital currency can proceed,  while these very  difficult policy  issues are \nconsidered and navigated .   \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL  \n9:05 A.M.  U.S. Eastern Time on Wednes day, May 12, 2021 - OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n \n3 \n I am not going to discuss in any detail  today  the policy issues involved , but I will touch \non the work being done by Boston Federal Reserve Bank that is focused on the technology .  This \nwork  has two major components.   \nThe first  component is a joint exploration with MIT’s Digital Currency Initiative (DCI) \ninto the use of existing and new technologies to build and test a hypothetical digital currency \nplatform.3  Dubbed “Project Hamilton,” the  effort is designed to determine the feasibility of the \ncore processing of a central bank  digital currency, while leaving substantial flexibility for the \nimpact of future policy decisions.   \nA central bank digital c urrency would need to be able to provide rapid processing of a \nlarge number of transactions in geographically dispersed locations.  We anticipate  that in early \nthird quarter of this year , MIT and the Boston Fed will release a white paper that will document  \nthe ability to meet reasonable goals with core processing , and create an open source license for \nthe code .  Additional work following the white paper’s release  will explore how addressing \nadditional requirements including resiliency, privacy , and anti -money laundering features will \nimpact the core processing.   \nA second component , and area of exploration , will focus on comparing Project Hamilton \nwith some of the  private -sector platforms currently being built , and open -source platforms for a \npossible digital currency.  This workstream will examine how each platform performs in similar \nenvironments, with a focus on being able to provide a large number of transactio ns across \ndifferent locations in a short period of time.   \nIt is important to note that there are many complementa ry aspects of the  Federal \nReserv e’s work on FedNow , and the exploration of a central bank digital currency.  Both require \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL  \n9:05 A.M.  U.S. Eastern Time on Wednes day, May 12, 2021 - OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n \n4 \n technology experts to study and pursue topics ranging from data architecture, to coding , to \neffective use of the cloud.  It may be, even, that some significant aspects of both systems could \nbe run on the same payments backbone.  Certainly  there is much to explore, and the eventual \npayments platform choices are quite uncertain, but this is an exciting area for central banks to \ncontinue to explore.  \nThank you for having me  join you today . \n \n \n \n1 For more discussion, see Aug. 8, 2019 Federal Register Notice: Federal Register :: Federal Reserve A ctions To \nSupport Interbank Settlement of Faster Payments , and subsequent announcement on Aug. 15, 2019: Federal Reserve \nNames Ken Montgomery Leader o f Newly Announced FedNow Service for Real -Time Gross Settlement of Faster \nPayments - Federal Reserve Bank of Boston (bostonfed.org) .  \n \n2 For more context , see Feb. 5, 2020 remarks by Federal Reserve Board of Governors’ Lael Brainard: Speech by \nGovernor Brainard on the digitalization of payments and currency (federalreserve.gov)  \n \n3 For more, see: The Federal Reserve Bank of Boston announces collaboration with MIT to research digital currency \n- Federal Reserve Bank of Boston (bostonfed.org)",

Montgomery \nInterim President & Ch ief Executive Officer \nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston \n \n \nWelcoming Remarks at \nthe Federal Reserve Bank of Boston’s \n 64th Economic Conference, entitled \n“Racial Disparities in Today’s Economy”  \n \n \nOctober 4, 2021 \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n\n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL  \n10:10 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Monday, Oct. 4, 2021 - OR UPON DELIVERY \n \n \n1 \n  \nGood morning, and thank you for joining us for the first of two economic conferences to \nbe hosted by the Boston Fed this fall.  We had hope d by now we would be able  to hold this event \nin person; but public health trends had other pl ans, and made it advisable to hold the events \nremotely.  But, we are grateful to all our participants, speakers, and audience members for \njoining us to discuss, dissect, and analyze a v ital topic – racial dispar ities in today’s economy. \nI appreciate the Bank’s research leaders for putting together another rigorous, analytical, \nhighly relevant economic conference, the 64th held by the Bank over many years, exploring \nimportant economic issues.  And I appreciate the opportunity to sa y a few words as we open the \nconference. \nThe Federal Reserve Bank of Boston has long been engaged in studying gaps in credit, \nemployment, and wealth – across ra ce, ethnicity, and gender – with an eye to policies and actions \nthat can make a difference.  More than thr ee decades ago, the Bank’s research department \ncontributed groundbreaking work on r acial differences in home mo rtgage lending.  That initial \nresearch led to a large body of rigorous acade mic work that was subsequently published in \nleading economic journals, and also led to important policy actions.   \nMore recently, we at the Boston Fed have done studies focused on racial and ethnic \ndifferences in wealth.  And we are proud to be on e of three Federal Reserve Banks that initiated \nthe Racism and the Economy event series that now has the part icipation and sponsorship of all \ntwelve regional Reserve Banks, and has seen the participation of te ns of thousands of interested \nindividuals across the country.1   \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL  \n10:10 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Monday, Oct. 4, 2021 - OR UPON DELIVERY \n \n \n2 \n I mention these efforts in order to empha size the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston’s \ncontinued commitment to this vita l exploration.  While this work and interest is not new to the \nBoston Fed, it is important to hold a rigorous and analytical economic conference focused on \nracial disparities in the economy, at this time.  As we have le arned from the discussions in the \nFederal Reserve System’s Racism and the Economy  series in recent months, the lamentable fact \nis that differences in racial, ethnic, and gender outcomes remain  large in the economic data – \nparticularly in the areas of employment, credit, wealth, educ ation, and health.  Even more \nsobering, for us as a society, is the fact that th ese persistent differences  in the data have not \nlessened since the Boston Fed’s research first de scribed disparities in mo rtgage lending practices \n30 years ago.   \nConsider these striking statis tics: over the past 35 years, the Black unemployment rate \nhas exceeded 10 percent for 60 percent of the time , spending roughly 21 years at over 10 percent.  \nAt the same time, the white unemp loyment rate exceeded 10 percent for just 3 months , in 2020, \nat the outset of the pandemic.  The persistence of these gaps  also underscores why it is so \nimportant for the Federal Reserve to conduct research on economic raci al disparities if we are to \nachieve the full employment component of our “dual mand ate” from Congress.2  I’ll say it again: \nunderstanding racial disparities is essential to the Federal Re serve’s full employment mandate. \nOver the next few days, we will have many terrific presenters – as Jeff mentioned – \nsharing their research on racial di sparities in labor market outcome s, in education, in housing, in \nwealth, and in criminal justice.   \nWe will begin, however, with a keynote presen tation, further setting the stage for much \nof the discussion that will follow. \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL  \n10:10 A.M.

U.S. Eastern Time on Mon day, Nov. 8, 2021 - OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n \n1 \n  \nGood morning , and thank you for joining us for the Boston Fed’s 65th annual economic \nconference  – the second of two economic conferences hosted by the Bank this fall .  We are \npleased to have our speakers, participants, and audience members join us this week to discuss  \nand analyze a very important  topic  – the implications of high leverage.  As noted in the title of \nthe conference , we want to explore the implications  of high leverage  for financial instability risk, \nfor real economic activity, and for p olicy responses.  \nI am grateful to  my colleagues in the Boston Fed’s Research Department for putting \ntogether another in a long line of rigorous and relevant economic conferences .  Our intention  \nwith these conferences  has always been  to convene experts  who can explor e important economic \nissues  and contribute to improving policy  and outcomes . So I appreciate the opportunity to say a \nfew words of introduction and overview as we open the 65th such gathering . \nI’ll begin by saying t he Federal Reserve Bank of Boston has long been engaged in \nstudying financial instability risks, specifically the implications of these risks for the real \neconomy.   Eric Rosengren, who recently retired as president of the Bank, studied and spoke \nabout these issues , first as a res earcher and later as a policymaker, often working alongside Joe \nPeek and his colleagues .  All told , the Bank has , for some time , emphasized the important role of \ncredit in the economy and the importance of financial stability considerations in monetary pol icy \ndeliberations.   \nThis focus at the Boston Fed has allowed us to contribute in significant  ways  to policy \ndiscussions and decisions at some critical moments for the U .S. economy .  Two such examples, \nabout which I will touch on only very briefly , are the 2008 financial crisis , and the COVID -19 \npandemic .  Indeed, in both cases,  we had the opportunity to  play key role s in implementing and \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL  \n10:05 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Mon day, Nov. 8, 2021 - OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n \n2 \n administering Federal Reserve System programs i ntended to help provide liquidity to markets \nand support  credit availability to the private sector.   \nThe first example  I’ll point to  – the Great Recession of 2008 and 2009, which was \ntriggered and exacerbated by a financial crisis  – drove home the critical  importance of having a \nstable and resilient financial system.  Policymakers have since taken many actions to strengthen \nregulation of financial institutions  in order to minimize the risk of a repeat financial crisis and \nresulting  disastrous collapse in ec onomic activity of the sort we experienced during the Great \nRecession.  Take, for instance,  the introduction of stress testing for large banks and a number of \nother regulatory measures that led to a relatively well -capitalized banking system.  \nIn contrast, over the past decade, we  have seen other sectors’ indebtedness climbing  – to \npotentially co ncerning levels.  In particular, by some measures, nonfinancial business leverage is \nhistorically high  – perhaps due, in part, to extremely low interest rates globally.  Our conference  \naims to analyze the risks of such high leverage for the broader economy  – and also provide a \nforum for  discuss ion of  appropriate policy responses targeted at mitigating those risks.  \nI’ll turn now to the second example – focused on the Fed’s response to the  economic \nemergency brought on by the COVID -19 pandemic.   The COVID -19 outbreak  in the U.S. , \nstarting in March 2020 , had a devastating impact on many households and businesses, especially \nsmall businesses.  Many business  owners lost revenue  streams  overnight , as they had to \nsubstantially curtail or even shut down operations.  Millions of workers lost their jobs.  The \nabrupt and drastic disruptions, along with extremely elevated uncertainty, caused widespread \nturmoil in financial markets.   \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL  \n10:05 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Mon day, Nov. 8, 2021 - OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n \n3 \n Confronted with such  unprecedented disruptions to the U .S. economy, public \npolicymakers  – both monetary and fiscal  – took decisive actions to support households, \nbusinesses , and markets in order to stabilize the financial sector and ultimately help minimize \ndamage to the real  economy.  The Federal Reserve, with support from the Treasury Department, \nintroduced a number of liquidity and credit facilities to ensure businesses , as well as consumers , \ncould readily access the credit they needed in order to weather the pandemic -induc ed \ninterruptions.  The Main Street Lending Program,1 one such facility that was administered by the \nBoston Fed  on behalf of the Federal Reserve System , support ed continued operations of small \nand medium sized businesses , despite the pandemic disruptions.  \nThe Bank’s 65th annual research conference is intended to contribute to our \nunderstanding of how leverage  affects financial stability risks , and ultimately the resilience of \nthe real economy  – in particular the effect of  leverage on key macroeconomic variables such as \nemployment and investment.  In addition to a focus on the business sector, the conference will \nalso include analysis of the effects of household  leverage on the severity of the Great Recession, \nas well as analysis of how the commercial real estate sector can best recover after the pandemic.  \nAnother particularly timely topic to be considered is the likely difficult trade -off for \npolicymakers going  forward  – stemming from the unfortunate side effects of some of the policy \nmeasures taken to combat the pandemic, given that  they added more debt to businesses’ already \ndebt-laden balance sheets.   \nI am confident the insights we take from the discussions and presentations during the next \nthree days can contribute to improving the formulation of public policy going forward.   Again , I \nwant to thank our organizers, presenter s, discussant s, and audience members for taking part.  \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL  \n10:05 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Mon day, Nov. 8, 2021 - OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n \n4 \n At this point , it is my pleasure  to introduce the moderator of the first day of the \nconference, Benjamin Friedman.  Professor Friedman is the William Joseph Maier Professor of \nPolitical Economy at Harvard University.   \nProfessor Friedman’s work has focused on monetary policy  – including the optimal \nconduct of policy and the transmission of policy through the financial system to the real \neconomy  – as well as the role of central banks in maintaining financial stability and formulating \nappropriate policy responses to various crises.   \nMore r ecently, Professor Friedman has broadened even further his distinguished portfolio  \nof work , with his newest book , Religion and the Rise of Capitalism , which provides a \nfundamental reassessment of the foundations of current -day economics and shows how religious \nthinking has shaped economic thinking.   \nPlease join me in welcoming Professor Friedman  – truly an expert on many of the topics \nthat will be cen tral to this conference.   \nThank you.  \n \n \n \n \n \n1 For more information, see: Main Street Lending Program - Federal Reserve Bank of Boston (bostonfed.org)",

U.S. Eastern Time on Monday,  January 13, 2020 - OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n \n \n1 \n Good morning, i t is a pleasure to be with you today.  Participating in the CBIA ’s outlook \nevent is always a great way to start the new year.   \nWe end  2019 and begin 2020 with an economy that is doing  quite well.  The labor market \nis strong , with the national  unemployment rate  at 50 -year lows .  Inflation is somewhat below 2 \npercent , the Fed eral Reserve ’s target , but is projected to graduall y return to 2 percent .  \nIn addition, most professional forecasters are expecting the good news to continue in \n2020 .  The consensus forecast has real GDP growing roughly at potential ; the unemployment \nrate remaining near its  historically low  range of last year ; and inflation approaching  the Fed’s 2 \npercent  target .  Financial markets , too, appear optimistic about the economy’s prospects, with \nstock market indices ending the year close to all -time highs.      \n These elements of the forecast for 2020 have not changed much over the past year.  Yet \nthe current outlook for 2020  is conditioned  on a much more accommodative stance for  monetary \npolicy .  At this  time last year , the members of the Fed’s monetary policy commi ttee – the Federal \nOpen Market Committee, or FOMC – were anticipating interest rate increases , given the tight \nlabor markets and the expectation that inf lationary pressures would  build  as a result .  With the \noutbreak of trade -related  concerns  and worries over a potential global slowdown , the FOMC  \nvoted to  reduc e the federal funds rate three times during 2019 to insure against the risk of an \neconomic downturn.  As we close d out the year , it was clear that labor markets remained strong \nand the econom y continue d to grow faster than its estimated potential . \n In the December Summary of Economic Projections  (SEP), FOMC  members provided \ntheir outlook s for economic conditions in 2020 , the consensus  of which was quite similar to that \nof private forecast ers.  The SEP forecast also includes a projection of expected monetary policy \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL  \n10:05 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Monday,  January 13, 2020 - OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n \n \n2 \n rates, the  so-called dot plot, which shows the path for monetary policy consistent with FOMC \nmembers’ forecasts.   The December dot plot showed no change in the median interest rate from \n2019 to  2020 , but has rates rising very gradually next year and beyond.  Such a forecast reflects \nwhat the FOMC policymakers  think is the most likely outcome , but it goes without saying that  \nthe economy rarely evolves exactly as expected.   \n Today , I will focus on the economic outlook  for 2020 – and two potential risks  to the \noutlook that could arise , should the economy grow faster than expected  due to  the \naccommodative stance of monetary policy .  \nThe first  potential risk I will discuss has to do wit h the acceleration of inflation, in that \nthere is the possibility  that labor markets could  tighten to unsustainable levels , causing \ninflation ary pressures to build faster than the very gradual pace that is currently expected.  The \nsecond  potential risk I will discuss has to do with financial stability, in that persistently low \ninterest rates could lead consumers and firms to take on riskier financial investments in search of \nbetter returns , increas ing asset price s to unsustainable levels .  There are  also, of course , risks that \nthe economy could underperform, and these derive primarily from geopolitical and trade risks.   I \nhave focused some on these risks in previous talks.1  But to preview my conclusion : If these risks \nremain contained, my view is we will likely have another year of good economic outcomes . \n  \nOverview of the Economic Outlook  \n Over the most recent two  quarters , real GDP has grown close to 2 percent , somewhat \nabove what economists believe is the economy’s potential  growth rate.  My own estimate of that \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL  \n10:05 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Monday,  January 13, 2020 - OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n \n \n3 \n rate is about  1.75 percent .  By that calculus , the economy has recently been growing somewhat \nfaster than its potential  rate, and correspondingly unemployment declined a bit , over 2019 .    \nFigure 1  shows actual GDP growth as a solid li ne, and then provides the forecast of \nFOMC participants (the median of their projections in the SEP) through 2022 , shown as squares .  \nIt show s that the median forecast of Fed policymakers is for future real GDP growth to be 2 \npercent in 2020 , then 1.9 percent in 2021,  and then 1.8 percent in 2022 .2  The SEP also includes \nthe median of estimate s for growth in the longer run  (potential growth) , which  is 1.9 percent  – \nslightly higher than my own estimate .  But in sum , the median of these forecasts anticipates  \nannual GDP growth to be around the level  we have seen recently , and close to Committee \nmembers’  estimates of potential . \nTurning from growth to labor markets, o ver the past nine month s the unemployment rate \nhas remained in a relatively tight ban d, ranging from  3.5 to 3.7 percent.  As is c onsistent with a \ngrowth estimate close to the economy’s potential, the median forecast of Fed policymakers  is for \nthe unemployment rate to remain in this narrow band , as Figure 2  show s.   \nFOMC members ’ current median estimate of the unemployment rate in the longer run is \n4.1 percent.  This estimate has declined noticeably  over the past two years , as the actual \nunemployment rate f ell below 4 percent  and even so, inflation  remained somewhat below the \nFed’s 2 percent  target .  My own estimate s are for the unemployment rate to be somewhat below \nthe SEP median projection s for 2020 through 2022 , and for long er-run unemployment to be \nsomewhat higher than the Committee ’s median  projection of 4.1 percent . \nTurning to p rices, the inflation rate has continued to be somewhat lower than the Fed’s 2 \npercent inflation target.  The SEP median forecast has core inflation ending 2020  at 1.9 percent \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL  \n10:05 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Monday,  January 13, 2020 - OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n \n \n4 \n and hitting the  2 percent  target in the following two years , as shown in Figure 3 .  By the way, it \nis worth noting that w hile the current core inflation rate is only 1.6 percent, there were very low \nreadings last spring which will fall out of the annual average this spring .  And more recent \nannualized quarterly readings have been much closer to 2 percent.   So while there remains \nuncertainty about the trajectory for inflation,  I personally do expect readings at or around the 2 \npercent target in the future.  \nIn addition, t he current federal funds rate  is well below the 2.5 percent  rate the \nCommittee expects in the longer run , so monetary policy is currently accommodative.  Given the \nstability of the forecast s for GDP growth, unemployment and inflation, it is not surprising that \nthe median forecast for interest rates  (shown in Figure 4 ) is for no change this year and gradual \nincreases over the next two years.  Certainly , the lack of inflationary pressure to date has \nprovided one justification for accommodative monetary policy despite the duration of the \nrecovery and a current historically  low unemployment rate.  However, m aintaining interest rates \nbelow the  consensus longer-run “equilibrium ” interest rate is predicated on both inflationary \npressures  not building up and financial stability concerns being contained.  \nOverall , the SEP median s project a very benign outlook , with what can be considered an \nalmost ideal economic outcome : Inflation returning to target, labor markets remaining quite \nstrong,  and economic growth close to potential .  However, as I mentioned in my introduction, the \nworld rarely  unfolds exactly as forecast .  So it is important to consider some of the risks that \ncould cause significant deviations from this rather  positive  forecast.  \n \n \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL  \n10:05 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Monday,  January 13, 2020 - OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n \n \n5 \n Risk s to the Forecast : Acceleration of Inflation  \n Since the financial crisis  of 2008,  the inflation rate has fairly persistently undershot the \nFed’s  target of 2 percent , which we use in pursuing our assigned mandate of price stability.  \nUndershooting the target for most of th e period  since the crisis  was not especially surprising , \ngiven the slack in resource  utilization  caused by the severe recession .  However,  the more recent \nabsence of significant inflationary pressures  – despite very low unemployment rates  – has been \nmore surprising.  In fact, given  historically  low unemployment rates, most forecasters have \nsystematically expected more inflation than has actually occurred.   \nThe inverse  relationship between the unemployment rate and the inflation rate  – high \nunemployment  is associated with lower inflation, other things equal, and vice versa  – is often  \nreferred to as  the “Phillips Curve, ” named after New Zealand economist A.W. Phillips, who first \nobserved the regularity  of the pattern .  This relationship was more apparent up until the mid -\n1990s, but it has become n oticeably weaker over the past 25 years.  There are many potential \nexplanations for th e smaller effect of unemployment on inflation , including  the somewhat \ndiminished  size and influence of  labor unions and more effective inflation targeting by central \nbanks .  Whatever the reasons, the relationship has undeniably weakened, with  inflation \nremaining be low 2 percent despite the unemployment rate reaching 50 -year lows.  \nOne implication of low inf lation and low nominal interest rates is that there is very little \nroom for monetary policy to react to an economic downturn by reducing rates.  Currently, with \nnominal interest rates and inflation below two percent, Fed policymakers have much less room to  \nreduce short -term interest rates before hitting the effective lower  bound than they did in recent \nrecessions.  In addition, prevailing long-term rates are lower , because of lower expected inflation \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL  \n10:05 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Monday,  January 13, 2020 - OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n \n \n6 \n and lower inflation risk premia.  This leaves policymaker s with less room to use large -scale asset \npurchases to push down  long-term rates, should they hit the effective lower bound with the short -\nterm rates they influence.3 \nWhile private forecasts and the  Fed’s  SEP expect low inflation and low interest rates, I \nwould note that this is predicated on inflation continuing to be tame.  However, we should \nacknowledge that there are relatively few cases  where the unemployment rate and the Fed’s \npolicy interest rate both remain ed well below  their estimated long-run valu es for an extended \ntime.  \nAs a result, one risk that could alter the outlook is if inflationary pressures buil d up more \nquickly than currently expected.  Admittedly, with little room currently to lower rates in a \ndownturn, inflation somewhat exceeding projections could be a good thing.  But e conomists do \nnot have a very precise understanding of how inflation expectations form, and of course an \neconomy  eventually  running too hot could increase inflationary pressures.    \n Figure 5 shows that average hourly  earnings have been trending  up over the past five \nyears , although in the most recent report released last Friday, the preliminary figures indicate a \npause , which will be followed closely in terms of the trend .  While some of this increase is \nconsistent with wages that reflect  inflation a bit below 2 percent , and productivity growth of \nabout 1 percent, w e see some evidence that a strong  labor market is placing additional upward \npressure on wages , as the  wages of nonsupervisory workers have risen more quickly.  Let me be \nclear – sustainable wage growth is a good thing.  But w ith higher minimum wages, and more \nwage pressures for low -wage workers , wage inflation that noticeably exceeds the sum of \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL  \n10:05 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Monday,  January 13, 2020 - OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n \n \n7 \n productivi ty growth and inflation may result in price pressures, particularly in sectors that do not \nface import competition , such as services . \n Again, to some degree , wage increases need not be  inflationary  if they are offset by \nincreased productivity.  However, the growth in productivity has been modest in recent years , as \nshown in Figure 6.   \nAlso, r eal wage gains  in excess of productivity growth  tend to  be reflected in a \nweakening of corporate profits  relative to GDP .  As shown in Figure 7,  corporate profits relative \nto GDP have been tailing off in recent years .  While l ower corporate profit margins are one way \nto absorb wage pressures without rai sing prices , relatively  lower corporate earnings  of late may \nmake absorbing increased wage costs less likely . \n To the extent that firms are unable or unwilling to absorb  the rising costs as wages \nrespond to low unemployment, we may observe the associated inflation risk materializ ing.  \nAdmittedly,  most forecasters do not expect this in their modal  (most likely outcome)  forecast .  \nBut more rapid than expected inflation remains a risk of running the economy with \naccommodative monetary policy and tight labor markets.  \n \nRisks to the Forecast: Financial Stability  \n As a practical matter, central bankers do not have much histo rical experience with \nextended periods where interest rates  are running  below the estimated equilibrium level while  \nunemployment  rates  are, simultaneously, historically low .  So we want to be alert to any \npotential risks emerging.  In my view, another potential risk is that low interest rates and a \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL  \n10:05 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Monday,  January 13, 2020 - OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n \n \n8 \n booming economy will encourage  investors  to increasingly “ reach for yield ” – that is, they will \ntake on more risk  in order  to raise the nominal returns they are receiving  (since  the associated \nrisk premiums embedded in the returns to riskier assets  compensate for that added risk ).4   \nReal estate is an area of the economy that is  historically susceptible to this risk -taking .  \nBoth residential and commercial real estate are sensiti ve to the level of interest rates , and are \nwidely held as collateral by leveraged financial institutions.5  Some of the more severe \nrecessions, both in the U.S.  and ab road, have occurred when real estate prices collapsed and the \nfinancial positions of highly  leveraged institutions and households became precarious . That is, \nthe debt they held came to greatly exceed the value of the assets they had borrowed against.  \n Figure 8  shows the change in house prices relative to per capita personal income since \n2015 , for the United States and several European nations.   An increase in the index indicates \npurchasing a home is less affordable, as income is not increasing as rapidly as hou se prices.   The \nindex has risen almost 10 percent in the U.S. since 2015, as housing prices have been rising \nfaster than per capita personal income.   In some countries – like Portugal, the Netherlands , and \nGermany, the index and house prices have risen muc h more sharply since 2015.    Low interest \nrates – in some cases negative – may be spurring house price increases.    \nSimilarly, there continue to be  decreases  in the capitalization rate s of commercial real \nestate  properties.  A low cap italization  rate – the ratio of net operating income to the price of the \nproperty, at the time of the transaction , shown in Figure 9  – implies relatively high valuations \ncompared to the income the property is expected to generate, which is a sign of inflated asset \nprices.  Fortunately, s ome sectors have seen capitalization rates decreasing  less rapidly of late.    \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL  \n10:05 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Monday,  January 13, 2020 - OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n \n \n9 \n In sum, i t is important to see and understand the risk that  sustained low interest rates \ncould place more pressure on real estate asset prices  through reach -for-yield behavior – a \nscenario that preceded the 1990 and 2007 recessions .  In certain scenarios,  financial stability \nrisks could potentially emerge as  a problem for the otherwise  benign outlook . \n \nConclu ding Observat ions \n To summ arize and conclude, p rivate forecasters and FOMC participants anticipate  a good \noutcome for the economy  in 2020 and beyond , with low inflation and strong labor markets.  \nHowever, as with any forecast, there are risk  scenarios  that are not captured in the most likely \noutcome fo r the economy.   I have highlighted two  potential risks  that I will be monitoring  this \nyear – inflation picking up more than currently expected ; and asset prices, particularly real estate \nprices, showing evidence of more acute financial stability risks .  To be fair, there are also \ndownside risks to the economic outlook, as well  – primarily centered on the potential for trade \ndisruptions  and slowing growth among our trading partners.

In addition, prevailing long-term rates \nare lower now than in the past because of lower expected inflation, lower inflation risk premia, and the lower term premia th at our large -scale \nasset purchases engendered.  This leaves  policymakers with correspondingly less room to lower long -term rates through such purchases, a policy \nthat proved effective in spurring the economy following the last recession once the Fed had pushed short -term interest rates to their effective \nlower bou nd.

U.S. Eastern Time on Friday , March 6, 2020 - OR UPON DELIVERY \n \n \n \n2 \n   Good afternoon.   I would like to thank the organizers of this conference for inviting me to \nparticipate on this panel – and more broadly fo r organizing a conference examining many of the \nchallenges policymakers have faced over the past  20 years.  As many of you know, these were \nchallenges that Marvin Goodfriend anticipat ed, well before the Great Recession forced \npolicymakers to confront them.  Specifically, our panel topic – monetary policy and the zero \nlower bound – is one that Marvin devoted a good d eal of thought to.  A nd as I’ll touch on today, \nhis emphasis on this topi c proved prescient.   \nI will focus my remarks on his paper, “Ove rcoming the Zero Bound on Interest Rate \nPolicy,” that appeared in the Journal of Money, Credit, and Banking  roughly 20 years ago.  The \narticle was originally written for a Federal Rese rve conference held in Woodstock, Vermont, in \nOctober 1999 – before most economists were thinking of this as a significant problem.1\n  Indeed, in October 1999, the federal funds rate was 5.2 percent and the Federal Reserve \nwas increasing interest rates.  In fact, the funds rate had not been below 2 percent since the early \n1960s, despite several severe recessions.  The “j ob-loss” expansion in the mid-2000s had not yet \noccurred, nor had the Financial Cr isis.  And despite th e developments in Ja pan, where short-term \nnominal rates hit zero in 1999, most economists cons idered it unlikely that  the U.S. policy rate \nwould fall to zero.  Moreover, the thinking was that in the highly unlikely event it did fall that \nfar, it would be there for only a quarter or two. \nFor several reasons, Marvin had the foresight to take seriously the possibility of zero \ninterest rates in the U.S.  The zero interest rate s prevailing in Japan at the time, together with a \nlow-inflation environment in many developed count ries, prompted Marvin to revisit and expand \non an issue that had been examined previously, in  the context of the Great  Depression.  In fact, I \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL  \n2 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Friday , March 6, 2020 - OR UPON DELIVERY \n \n \n \n3 \n had numerous discussions with Marvin about Ja pan’s “Lost Decade” of the 1990s, and what its \nrelevance could be for future monetary policymaking.    \nIn our conversations and in his 1999 paper, Marvin emphasized two policies that were \nactually implemented, later, in response to the Fi nancial Crisis – negative  interest rates, which \nwere adopted in Europe and Japan; and open market purchas es of long bonds, which were \nimplemented in the U.S., Japan, and Europe.   \nOn the first, Marvin highlighted that negative nominal interest rates might be helpful in a \nsignificant economic downturn when the policy rate had already reached zero.  Although many \ndismissed this suggestion, given the higher (zero) return to ho lding currency, Marvin focused on \nthe technical issues regarding the central bank’s ability to charge negati ve nominal rates on bank \nreserves.  Yet Marvin realized that even if  policymakers could succeed in charging negative \ninterest rates, and possibly help the overall ec onomy recover, he correct ly noted that such a \npolicy could “create stress for lenders and pe ople heavily dependent on interest income.” \nOn the second policy, the open-market purch ases of long-term bonds that Marvin \ndiscussed were ultimately employed during the Fi nancial Crisis in almost every developed \ncountry.  He viewed these asset purchases as an important part  of the monetary policy toolbox, \nparticularly when short-term rates approached their lower bound.  Howeve r, he advocated that \nthe U.S. Treasury Department should agree to inde mnify the central bank ag ainst capital losses.  \nIndeed, he understood the potential political pi tfalls a central bank w ould face in such an \nenvironment.  I would point out th at this type of indemnification was done in the U.K., but not in \nthe United States.   \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL  \n2 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Friday , March 6, 2020 - OR UPON DELIVERY \n \n \n \n4 \n Overall, Marvin showed a great deal of inte llectual dexterity at a time when the United \nStates was far from seeing short-term rates approach the zero bound.  In many respects, his paper provided a prescient preview of many of the actions ultimately taken by global central banks during the Financial Crisis.   \nOf course, some of the operational sugges tions, such as implementing a carry-tax on \ncurrency, were unlikely to get much political trac tion, despite their potential ability to make his \npolicy suggestions more effective.  But the clar ity in Marvin’s thinki ng and the boldness of his \nsuggestions highlight the creative intellect  that characterized much of his work. \nNow that we have the experience of the Financial Crisis and the resulting Great \nRecession, we should ask ourselves some importa nt questions.  What further issues should \npolicymakers consider as we confront the curr ent low-interest-rate environment, given the \npotential for adverse shocks?  And, with more th an 20 years of experience since Marvin wrote \nhis paper, what additional concerns should we have? \nI’ll offer three observations on those questions. \nFirst, Marvin foresaw another element of the current situation that few anticipated – that \nthe equilibrium real rate of interest might fall to a very low level.  In fact, in the time since he \nwrote his paper in the late 1990s , the amount of “space” for monetary policy to operate before \nhitting the effective lower bound ha s diminished significantly.  Ind eed, we are in a low-interest-\nrate environment for reasons that go beyond th e low-inflation environment emphasized in \nMarvin’s paper, and this  may have implications for the effec tiveness of the policy solutions at \nthe zero lower bound.  \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL  \n2 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Friday , March 6, 2020 - OR UPON DELIVERY \n \n \n \n5 \n Specifically, in June 2007 – prior to the Financ ial Crisis – the effective federal funds rate \nand the 10-year U.S. Treasury rate were above 5 pe rcent.  While the federa l funds rate ultimately \nfell to zero in 2008, the 10-year U.S. Treasury rate  did not, as Marvin anti cipated.  Long rates at \nthe time remained above zero.  Now, however, for a variety of reasons, the federal funds rate is \nat only 1.1 percent (the target ra nge being 1 to 1.25 percent), and the 10-year U.S. Treasury rate \nfell below 1 percent this week.  As investors are more aware of the likelihood of short-term rates \nhitting the zero lower bound, they have been mo re willing to use U.S. Treasury bonds as hedges \nagainst recession risk.   \nOn January 21, around the time of the first U.S. coronavirus cases, the 10-year U.S. \nTreasury rate was 1.8 percent.  With on-going con cerns about the coronavirus, the 10-year rate \ndeclined by roughly 80 basis points.  If the econo mic reaction to the coronavirus does result in \nthe funds rate falling to its effective lower bound, th is heightened sensitivity of the 10-year U.S. \nTreasury rate to adverse news raises the possibi lity that the 10-year U. S. Treasury rate could \nfollow close behind.  In fact, this “co-movement ” has been the case for some time in many \ncountries.  As a result, there w ould be little room for the Federa l Reserve to lower rates through \nlarge purchases of long-term Treasury securi ties – like it did to make conditions more \naccommodative in and after the Great Recession – if a recession occurred in this rate \nenvironment.     \nSuch a situation would raise challenges policymakers did no t face even during the Great \nRecession.  In such a case, as Marvin highlighted in his 1999 article, we should allow the central \nbank to purchase a broader range of securities or assets.  Such a policy, however, would require a \nchange in the Federal Reserve Ac t.  And I agree with Marvin’s analysis that if the Federal \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL  \n2 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Friday , March 6, 2020 - OR UPON DELIVERY \n \n \n \n6 \n Reserve pursued such a policy, it should possess an explicit agr eement with the U.S. Treasury \nDepartment to indemnify the Fed against losse s.  Alternatively, the Federal Reserve could \nconsider a facility that  could buy a broader set of assets, pr ovided the Treasury agreed to provide \nindemnification.   \nSecond, while Marvin felt that negative interest rates might be effective and could be \nmade operational, I will say that I remain skeptical.  Marvin recogni zed potential side effects, but \nI personally view the adverse side  effects as likely quite large.  Marvin noted negative rates \nwould pose a significant challenge for banks, and I mo re than agree with him.  We need banks to \nbe healthy enough to provide credit and li quidity in challenging economic times.  \nCompared with banks in the United States, ba nks in Europe and Japan – where rates have \nbeen negative for some time – have lower price- to-book ratios, lower return on assets, and lower \nleverage ratios.  While there are many factors influencing these comparatively lackluster metrics, \nI would suggest that negative interest rates have been part of the problem.2\n  In my view, negative interest rates p oorly position an economy to recover from a \ndownturn.  And other actions that have helped support banks in Japan and Europe might not be \npolitically feasible in the United States. \nIn addition, many developed countries have fina ncial stability authoriti es that have tools \nto potentially limit excessive leverage for households and firms.  It is important to note that the \nUnited States has no such organization with the aut hority and tools to restra in excessive leverage \nfrom developing in a low-intere st-rate environment.  And while  the U.S. Congress could, for \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL  \n2 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Friday , March 6, 2020 - OR UPON DELIVERY \n \n \n \n7 \n example, limit the tax deductibility of debt when it involves excessive leve rage, such tax reform \nseems unlikely any time soon.   \nThird, and finally, I view the recent experi ence of countries with  negative rates as \nevidence that such a policy would not be particul arly successful in stimulating economic activity.  \nIn part, concerns with retireme nt and pension arrangements in an environment of negative rates \nhave caused saving rates to rise, not fall, in so me of these countries – meaning that consumers \nare less willing to spend and fuel the economic r ecovery.  In addition, firms’ behavior does not \nseem to respond very strongly to negative rates.  Further, while the exchange rate effects from \ninterest rate changes can be im portant for firms, they become virtually nonexistent if every \ncountry moves their rates into  negative territory.     \nIn a low-interest-rate environment, the obvi ous alternative to monetary policy in a \ndownturn is to depend on fiscal policy shoulde ring a greater share of the burden for providing \nneeded stimulus to the economy.  Somewhat surp risingly, there seems to  be little movement \ntoward making automatic stabilizers more prominent, or preparing to invest significantly more in \nthe sorts of public investment projects that yield positive returns. \nIn 1999, Marvin Goodfriend was able to consid er what had not occurred in the recent \npast, and contemplate bold alternatives.  Over the next few years, th at type of vision and \nboldness will be needed by all policymakers if we have to consider how policy should react to \nany large, adverse shock to the economy. \nThank you. \n \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL  \n2 P.M.

            "content": "Addressing the Economic Effects of the COVID- 19 Pandemic  \nA perspective from Eric Rosengren , president and CEO of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston  \n \nJust 20 days ago , Dr. Paul Biddinger and I urged  employers  to prepare for the gather ing storm  by taking tangible step s, \nlike implement ing work -from -home and restricting business travel,  to prevent more devastating health  and economic  \noutcomes  from the pandemic . \nToday , we’re witnessing  the pandemic’s  stark effects on public health. Meanwhile, t he necessary response – social \ndistancing – has stilled our strong economy , disrupt ing countless  lives  and livelihoods . It’s also  been  distorting  the credit \nand liquidity flows that underpin our economy , threatening the greater pain of a full-blown  financial crisis . \nBut e verybo dy can help mitigate the  pandemic’s impact. Public health officials and heroic front -line medical p ersonnel \nplay the most important part . Governments, civic organizations, scientific and educational institutions, and citizens also \nhave  key roles to play.  And f iscal policy is crucial.  \nAt the  central bank we’re  focused on addressing, and blunt ing, the economic effects of the pandemic. T he Federal \nReserve  has acted quickly to address  spillovers from the economic disruption. I’d like to explain some of what the Fed \ndid, and suggest other steps that a range of parties could pursue.  \nThe Federal Reserve  is working to limit the financial and economic distres s – to take actions  that help avoid  even  higher \nlevels of unemployment or a slower recovery. To that end, t he Fed’s interest -rate -setting committee cut the short -term \nrates the Fed controls to close to zero to help ease market interest rates in an economy  suddenly facing challenges  (see \nFig. 1).   \nFurther , both the Treasury and mortgage-securities  markets had too many people and institutions seeking to sell assets  \nto raise cash  (rushing to more liquid assets as a crisis response) , resulting  in an inability to trade,  and unusual volatility. \nTo remedy distortions in these important markets , the Fed h as been buying Treasuries and mortgage- backed securities  \nto stabilize markets and make it easier for financial institutions to pass through lower interest rates to consumers and \nbusinesses.  \nIn addition , many firms and individuals keep liquid assets in money market funds , and there was a danger of seeing \nfunds gated or closed as investors rushed to pull cash from them  (see Fig. 2) . Similarly, the municipal money market \nfunds that buy short -term, highly -rated municipal securities  and help meet the short -term funding needs of \nmunicipalities  were seeing few trades.  In sum,  given the rush for cash in financi al market s, it was proving a challenge for \nthe funds to sell high -quality debt of even the strongest companies and states.  The Boston Fed  open ed a facility  that \nlends money to banks, so they can buy these highly -rated assets from money market funds . This ensures money market \nfunds can meet the demands of individuals and firms seeking to redeem cash , restores  a market for short -term high -\nquality asse ts, and addresses the liquidity problem impacting individuals, companies, and local governments .  \nAlso,  the New York Reserve Bank is running a facility to buy short -term high -quality assets of firms – helping trading to \nresume and s upport ing firms’ ability to issue short -term debt . It is important for economic fun ctioning that firms have \naccess to funding . The New York  Fed is establishing facilities for firms to issue debt and for secondary trading of debt . \n(see Figs. 3 & 4)  \nMeanwhile , problems threatened to ripple through banking markets  as business  closures and layoffs spiked.  To meet \nthe increased demand for liq uidity, the Federal Reserve is providing collateralized loans to banks so their customers –  \nfirms and individuals  – have access to liquid funds . Regulatory  changes will allow bank s to restructure loans to help \n\nindividuals and businesses with a temporary loss of revenue  avoid bankruptcy and layoffs by, for instance, defer ring \npayment of principal and interest for up to six months.  \nFiscal policy makers have  acted strongly with the recently passed CARES Act. We must continue to adapt as the crisis \nproceeds , with  constant attention to the plight of workers who have been or will be laid off. Unfortunately, we expect \nthe unemplo yment rate to rise dramatically.  \nSocial distancing is needed  to avoid overwhelm ed medical facilities and unnecessa ry deaths, but it also poses great \nchallenges  for low-income workers, who are  more likely to lose jobs and have few other resources . Meanwhile, \nfurloughs have been occurring,  particularly in the hotel, retail, travel and restaurant industries . We’ve already seen an \nunprecedented  rise in initial claims for unemployment insurance .   \nTraditional e conomic  models are challenged by  this unique situation. To me,  the mo st important factors are how well \nwe avoid financial spillovers , and how effective the fiscal stimulus is, as well as the progression of COVID -19 infections . \nThese will all impact the speed of the economic recovery . That is  not a fatalistic assessment. O n the contrary,  it should \ngalvanize us.  In that spirit, I offer three concluding observations : \n1. This is a time for public -spiritedness  \nOur mantra a t the Boston Fed is “public service that makes a difference.” Central banks can and must do a lot in crises, \nto alleviate str esses in the financial system we all count on, which  can hurt all citizens. But e veryone – in small or big \nways – can do their part to make a difference. T he public interest is more important than ever ; social distancing is one \nexample. What we all do now in the public interest can help recover y, once the worst is over.  \n2. This is no time to leave anyone behind  \nWe are all being challenged right now , but our legacy can be that we rose to the challenge and kept a focus on the \nvulnerable, those with low and moderate income, and those whose livelihoods operate on the thinnest of margins. T he \nlong-term prosperity of our region and the people who are our nei ghbors (and our customers)  will shape the recovery. \nAmong other things, we need to support the workers who keep our organizations and those we rely on (like grocery \nstores , shipping networks , and of course health care) up and running. And we must tide over  workers and businesses \nthat see demand dry up for a while.  \n3. This is a time for our best , together   \nThe brainpower of our region and nation is needed more than ever , and i t is important to continue being nimble, \ncreative, proactive, and, perhaps most import antly, collaborative  – because the tactics and approaches that will help are \nlikely to be multifaceted and involve the public, private, and nonprofit sectors.   \nThis is  a time of challenge , but it’s also a time to  bring out our very best . \n \nThis perspective summarizes remarks delivered at a  forum  hosted by the Greater Boston Chamber of Commerce, held on \nApril 1, 2020.  \n\n \n \n \nNote:  All charts are daily, from February 18, 2020 through March 30, 2020.  \nSources:  (1) Federal Reserve Board, (2) iMoneyNet, (3) Bloomberg Finance L.P., Federal Reserve \nBoard, (4) ICE/BAML, Federal Reserve Board, (1,3,4) Haver Analytics  0.000.250.500.751.001.251.501.75\n18-Feb-20 03-Mar-20 17-Mar-20Figure 1:  Federal Funds Rate\nPercent\nEmergency \nFOMC \nMeetings\n600700800900\n2,4002,8003,2003,600\n18-Feb-20 03-Mar-20 17-Mar-20Government (Left Scale)\nPrime (Right Scale)Billions of Dollars Billions of DollarsFigure 2:  Prime and Government Money Market Fund \nAssets Under Management\n-0.10.40.91.41.9\n18-Feb-20 03-Mar-20 17-Mar-20PercentFigure 3:  Spread Between Highly -Rated Asset -Backed \nCommercial Paper Rate and the Federal Funds Rate\n01234\n18-Feb-20 03-Mar-20 17-Mar-20PercentFigure 4:  Spread Between AA Corporate Bond Yield and \n5-Year Treasury Yield",

Thank you for the opportunity to offer some remarks and information  \nduring this incredibly challenging time for New Englanders  and all Americans .  People in \nhouseholds across the country are coping with illness, working on front lines, and adjusting to \nnew realities and uncertainties.  Most Americans are concerned about the impact of the public \nhealth crisis on their family and friends ; and worry about their financial he alth too, given the \nsevere economic consequences of the pandemic.   \nUnfortunately,  the pandemic and the absolutely necessary response, aimed at protecting \nlives and health , involve  a high cost to the economy  – which was so recently doing very well .  \nThe economic shock is an unprecedented challenge for economic policymakers including the \nFederal Reserve , where we will do whatever we can  to support a return to  full employment a nd \nstable prices  – our mandate from Congress – and our commitment to financial st ability , which is \nimportant to the well -being of all Americans . \nPublic health concerns  are driving the economic challenges we face, so as an economic \npolicymaker I have to analyze a range of medical and public health issues.  Unfortunately , in the \nUnited States we have so far not been able to fully halt community spread of the virus, and many \nstates are now relaxing restrictions even while infections and deaths remain a major concern.  \nWhile allowing employers to reopen will enable  some peop le to return to work,  it is not a \npanacea for our economic challenges, which again are rooted in public health  concerns .  It is \npossible that many  households will remain reluctant to spend , and employees may be reluctant to \nreturn  to the workplace – either because of their own health concerns, the lack of open daycare  \nfacilities or schools  for their children, or to protect or take care of other family members .  Some \nfirms may be  reluctant to invest , until community spread of the virus has been signifi cantly \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL  \n2 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Tuesday , May 19 , 2020 - OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n \n \n 2  \n reduced .  The optimal mix of public health and economic policies is complex , making economic \nforecasts at this juncture unusually uncertain.   \n To be sure, the economic pain ushered in by the pandemic is extraordinary.   The recent \nemployment report1 underscores  the unprecedented speed and ferocity with which jobs have \nbeen affected by this public health crisis.  Social distancing and quarantine are essential health \npolicy measures, but costly.   It is important that the  sacrifices and  progress  made so far not be \nundone.  This requires that health policy measures limit the risk of second waves  of the \npandemic,  to the extent  possible .  \nFrom an economic policy standpoint, my view is that measures should be taken to limit  \nthe potential for medium - and longer -term “scarring ” from the crisis.  This means, among other \nthings, minimizing the length of unemployment spells , and ensuring that solvent firms have the \nliquidity necessary to weather the crisis.  As a result, it is very important that we maintain \nresolve to do whatever is necessary to restore the public health and economic health of the \nUnited States as quickly as possible.  \n Central banks can play a powerful role in crises.  S ome of the more significant  financial \nspillovers recently  have been mitigated by the actions of the Federal Reserve.2  For example, t he \npanic selling that hit financial markets in March was largely offset by  the Fed – by reducing \nshort -term interest rates to near zero , and setting u p emergency lending facilities  and purchasing \nsecurities to support the credit needs of U.S. households and businesses .  Preventing bouts of \nfinancial instability from having significant spillovers to the flow of credit to consumers and \nbusinesses is a vital crisis role for central banks, and the Fed has aggressively played that role \nduring this  very challenging period . \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL  \n2 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Tuesday , May 19 , 2020 - OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n \n \n 3  \n In my remarks today,  I will provide a brief overview of the economy and its future \nprospects .  I will discuss  two of the  Federal Reserve  System ’s lending programs – which are \nbeing operated by the Boston Fed  for the System  – in an effort to help explain and illuminate \nrecent policy actions  and to inform  businesses and lending institutions about how they can \nparticipate . \nThe first emergency lending facility  I will discuss is the Money Market  Mutual Fund \nLending  Facility,3 which  was established in late March  and operate s out of the Boston Fed  to \nhelp alleviate disruptions in short -term credit  markets  and money market  mutual  funds .   \nThe second program I will discuss is the Main Street Lending Program, which, when it \nbegins operating in the coming weeks , is intended to help provide loans to businesses affected  by \nthe COVID -19 pandemic.4  The program will operate through three facilities: the New, Priority , \nand Expanded  loan facilit ies.  I will say more about the program in a moment.  \n \nRecent Economic Developments  \n I’d like to give an overview of recent economic developments.  As I noted in my \nintroduction, t he April employment report encapsulated the scale and severity of this public -\nhealth -driven economic crisis .  Job loss  for so many Americans  is spurring the Federal Reserve \nto do all we can to help, as I  will describe shortly .   \nWhile the economy had a very low unemployment rate in February  – 3.5 percent  – by \nApril the unemployment rate had soared  to 14.7 percent , as shown in Figure  1.  In addition, \npayroll employment declin ed by 20.5 million jobs in the month of April.  This unprecedented \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL  \n2 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Tuesday , May 19 , 2020 - OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n \n \n 4  \n shock to the labor markets has two components : employees who temporarily  are not working \nbecause of the mandated shutdowns intended to contain the pandemic, and those workers \ncurrently , or likely to soon be, more permanently  unemployed becaus e firms are closing or \nbecause the weakened demand for goods does not require as many workers.  Unlike the past \nthree recessions, t he April data are  consistent with m ost of these workers being temporarily la id \noff.  Yet the following  is a key point: how we all address the pandemic will greatly influence \nhow many of  these temporary  job losses  become permanent.  \n Figure  2 shows the percent decline in payroll jobs for select industries, with the decline \nmeasured from February , before the pandemic widely affected  labor markets.  The largest \ndeclines occurred in industries where social distancing is most challenging  – such as  recreation, \nentertainment, the arts , and food services .  These activities have been severely  curtailed  by \nclosure requirements , and may continue to be hurt  by the discomfort individuals  may have in \nattending large events or eating out while community spread of the disease  remains a concern . \n Figure  3 illustrates the declines in employment in terms of  the total number s of jobs lost  \nby industry .  The two largest drops were in accommodation and food services, and retail trade.  \nThese two industries employ a large share of U.S. workers, and again are industries that may \nhave trouble returning to full capacity as long as consumers are c oncerned about their safety.  \n Figure  4 shows the share of total employment for industries that may be significantly \nimpacted by the pandemic for some time.   With accommodation and food services , and retail \ntrade , together  accounting for such a large share of total employment  (nearly 20%) , a full \nrecovery in the economy is going to hinge on  how well society gets the pandemic under control.  \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL  \n2 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Tuesday , May 19 , 2020 - OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n \n \n 5  \n If consumers are afraid to eat out , shop,  or travel , a relaxation in laws requiring business closures \nmay do little to bring back customers, and thus jobs.  \n Figure  5 provides another reason why firms may face significant challenge s as long as \nthe public health concerns have not been sufficiently mitigated.  Americans that are between 50 \nand 79 years of age account for 45 to 55 percent of purchases in spending categories  that are  \nimportantly affected by social distancing .  Because people in this age cohort are more likely to \nsuffer severe consequences if infected  by the virus , they may be particularly reluctant to venture \nout until the public health situation improve s significantly . \n In sum, simply allowing business es to reopen is not a panacea.   Until community spread \nof the virus has been significantly reduced , many of the industries with the sharpest job cuts will \nlikely face reduced demand as long as social distancing is necessary.  Public health solutions are \nparamount – without them, it will be virtually impossible to return to full employment.  I t is vital \nthat the design and timing of  reductions in business res trictions not result in worse health \noutcomes and higher unemployment over a longer period of time . \n \nThe Federal Reserve ’s Response to the Pandemic  \n If they do the right things, central banks can help address crises  and prevent , or at least \nsubstantially mitigate,  the spillover of problems from the financial realm to the real economy \ncomposed of household and business  activity .  Although the unemployment rates may look \nsimilar to those in the Great Depression, both fiscal policy from the federal government  and \nFederal Reserve  actions  have now  – in contrast to the Great Depression era – taken \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL  \n2 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Tuesday , May 19 , 2020 - OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n \n \n 6  \n unprecedented actions to mitigate the economic downturn .  The Fed  quickly reduced s hort-term \ninterest rates to close to zero ; stabilized the foundational markets for Treasury and mortgage \nsecurities , through purchases ; and established lending facilities to make sure that credit is \navailable  and not seizing up .  And Congress has passed  and the President has signed  several \naggressive spending and aid packages to assist l aid-off workers and to support businesses during \nthe shutdown .  \nToday, in the interest of time, I would like to focus on two  of the emergency  Federal \nReserve facilities , as they are  being administered  by the Federal Reserve  Bank  of Boston .  It is \nimportant to note that the powers granted to the Fed  for emergency and exigent actions involve \nlending , not spending .5  All of the Fed’s  programs involve loans that are to be repaid ; they are \nnot grants  by the Fed .  But lending can play a crucial role in a crisis and in bridging to more \nnormal conditions.  \n The M oney Market Mutual Fund Liquidity Facility , or MMLF,  set up in March and \noperat ing through the Boston Fed, was  designed to address two problems.  First, short -term debt \ninstruments , such as commercial paper , were not trading  efficiently due to a lack of liquidity,  and \nthe interest -rate spreads had become unusually wide  (meaning rates were jumping higher as asset \nprices fell  in “fire sale” mode ).  Second, prime money market funds that  buy these short -term \ndebt instruments were facing redemptions by investors, and at the same time were having \ndifficulty selling financial instruments that normally are highly liquid, with rates  close to the \nfederal funds rate.  \nMore specifically , money mar ket funds that invest substantially in corporate short -term \ndebt, including commercial paper, experienced large redemptions as conditions deteriorated in \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL  \n2 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Tuesday , May 19 , 2020 - OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n \n \n 7  \n March.  The concern was that such large redemptions would reduce the supply of credit to \nbusinesses.  Moreover, these large outflows risked further disrupting the short -term credit \nmarket s, including if money market mutual funds  resorted to disposing of assets at “fire sale” \nprices, or imposed fees or gates on redeeming investors – which would mean further  loss of \npublic confidence and impacts on households and businesses that invest in these funds.   \n Figure  6 shows that in February, commercial paper was trading relatively close to the \nfederal funds rate.  As the pandemic worse ned, the federal funds rate was cut to near ly zero, but \neven so,  rates on commercial paper rose significantly.  In response to these developments, the \nMMLF  was established to  provide non -recourse loans , generally  at an interest rate of 1.25 \npercent , that were  collateralized by  short -term debt instruments owned by money market funds.  \nAs the MMLF made loans, the rates began to fall on short -term debt instruments , and by the \nmiddle of April, short -term rates were well below the 1.25 percent charged on those loans, \nmeaning the market had stabilized and the emergency facility worked . \n Figure  7 shows  another dimension of this brief crisis.  While government money market \nfunds, which invest in securities with little default risk, were experiencing large inflows, by the \nmiddle of March  as crisis conditions flared  up, the riskier prime money market funds were \nexperiencing significant outflows.  To meet these outflows , the prime funds were selling short -\nterm debt instruments a mid an illiquid market for such assets .  Wit h the availability  of the \nMMLF , the pressure on prime funds receded and investor confidence improved so that  the \noutflows quickly slowed down  – and since the middle of April both types of funds have been  \ngenerally experiencing inflows.   \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL  \n2 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Tuesday , May 19 , 2020 - OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n \n \n 8  \n Figure  8 shows tha t assets under management of the government money market funds \nhave continued to rise, and are well above pre-pandemic levels.  Prime funds have stabilized and \nare gradually seeing mo dest inflow s, although they  remain well below pre-pandemic levels.  \nSince  the middle of April , there has been little activity at the MMLF .  This is by design : the \nfacility’s terms become less attractive as the crisis in a particular market fades and normal credit \nflows resume .  The facility has advanced more than $50 billion in  loans, which are already in the \nprocess of being paid off , with total loans outstanding now under $40 billion.  Currently , both \nshort -term credit markets and money market funds are operating with more normal pricing  and \ninterest -rate spreads.   This is important , as these markets underpin the financing flows on which \nmany businesses depend.  \n \nMain Street L ending  Program  \nThe other Federal Reserve program  being administered by the Boston Fed is  the Main \nStreet L ending Program .  The MSLP is  a loan program designed to help  credit flow to  small - and \nmedium -sized businesses  that were in good financial condition  prior to the crisis , but now need  \nloans that can help them until they have recovered from , or adapted to , the impact of the \npandemic.   \nIts structure is designed to reach those borrowers in a way that supports their operations \nand employment , supporting economic activity but also managing risk and safeguard ing the \ntaxpayer  backstop .  There are various loan sizes to meet a range of needs of small and midsize \nborrowers, and a ttractive terms ( for example, no payments or interest f or a year, a 4-year term, \nand a modera te interest rate ). \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL  \n2 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Tuesday , May 19 , 2020 - OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n \n \n 9  \n Let me begin by discussing some of the ways this pr ogram is unique, even among the \nFed’s other crisis actions , both now and in the past .  By the way, some of these unique aspects \naccount for the time it is taking to set up the program . While many of the Fed’s facilities focus \non securities that are relatively  homogenous financial instruments, this program seeks to support \nbank lendi ng.  Bank loans  are not  very standardized  – for example , the terms and conditions of \nthe loan are negotiated between borrower and lender.  Smaller  companies  likely  also have less \npublic information available for making a credit risk evaluation.  \n The program differs from other  program s for businesses  made possible by the CARES \nAct.  Unlike t he Paycheck  Protection Program  (PPP) , where many loans could  turn to grants \nfunded by the CARES Act,  the Main Street  Lending Program  involves  loans  that must be repaid .  \nThe MSLP  has no loan guarantee like the S mall Business Administration  provided for the PPP,  \nand requires both the borrower and lender to be eligible  to participate in the program.6 \nFigure 9 shows a stylized version of the Main Street program .  As previously mentioned, \nthe program is designed to serve businesses that were  doing well before the pandemic began, are \nexperiencing pandemic -related disruption, and are expect ing to do well once the pandemic is \ncontained .  The program is aimed at lending to mid -sized and small entities that are too big for \nthe PPP and too small for other emergency credit facilities.7  Enterprises of this sort accounted \nfor a major share of U.S employment, and this program intends to make loans that support their \nability to continue  until the  pandemic is contained and the  recovery ensues.  \nBusinesses will not come directly to the Federal Reserve for a loan .  Instead, p otential \nbusiness borrowers need to work with an eligible lender to determine if they meet the minimum \nrequirements for the program, as defined in the term sheet s as well as the lender’s own \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL  \n2 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Tuesday , May 19 , 2020 - OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n \n \n 10  \n underwriting standards.  An eligible lender will ultimately determine whether a borrower is \napproved for a loan, considering  credit risk .  Banks will underwrite the loan and the Federal \nReserve will participate with the bank in the lending  by purchasing 85 or 95 percent of the loan, \ndepending on the  program  facility .  Hence , the lenders continue to have “skin in the game ” to \nensure that  they will be motivated to certify  the quality of the loan.   \n Some of the high -level terms of the loan s are shown in Figure 10.  The new, priority, \nand expanded  facilities’  loans all share some common characteristics.  The maturity of the loans \nis four years, the loans have no interest or principal  payments due  in the first year, the loans can \nbe prepaid, and the loans have an interest rate of LIBOR plus 3 percent.   \nHowever, there are differences among the facilities , including with respect to how the \nloan types interact with the borrower’s existing outstanding debt .  The new and priority lending \nfacilities , which  are likely to serve  somewhat smaller companies , provide new loans for which \nthe eligible lender  seeks the participation of the Federal Reserve.  Both facilities would be \navailable to the participating lender’s existing customers as well as new customers.  The loan \nsize range is $500,000 to $25 million.  The two facilities have different features to allow a \nbroader range of potential eligible borrowers.  In the new facility,  the MSNLF,  the lender retain s \na 5 percent stake , but the debt level of the borrower must remain low .8  In the priority  facility , \nthe MSPLF,  the borrowing business can carry somewhat more debt but the lender must take a \nlarger share of the loan – 15 percent  – and the loan must not be junior to9 other  debt (other than \nmortgage debt) .10   \nFor larger businesses, it is likely that they may already have a loan agreement with \nmultiple banks, with these loans being secured or unsecured.  The Main Street program ’s \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL  \n2 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Tuesday , May 19 , 2020 - OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n \n \n 11  \n expanded  loan facility (MSELF) provides an opportunity for eligible lenders to increase (or \n“upsize”) an existing term loan or revolving credit facility, with the Federal Reserve becom ing a \nnew participant.  This expanded loan facility for larger borrowers has a much higher  minimum \nloan size, $10 million, and a maximum loan size of $200 million .  The bank must maintain a 5 \npercent stake in the expanded loan, with the Federal Reserve taking  the remainder.   \n As shown in Figure 1 1, there are several  ways the Federal Reserve will manage thi s \nprogram to address inherent  risks.  First, the lenders  will need to underwrite the loan and retain \ntheir own stake in it, at 5 or 15 percent depending on the facility .  Second, the borrower’s credit \nneeded to be in good standing prior to the pandemic – loans to these borrowers  must have been \nrated “pass” at the end of 2019.11  Third, the borrower is limited in how levered the loan can be , \nas noted a moment ago .  One implication i s that firms that were already very highly levered \ngoing into the pandemic wi ll not qualify for a loan from the se facilit ies.  Fourth, and more \nbroadly, the U.S. Treasury Department will make a $75 billion equity investment in the facilities  \nto cover potential losses,  using funds appropriated under the CARES Act.  \n This is only a high-level discussion of the program.  Interested borrowers or lenders \nshould refer to the information we have posted on the web, for more program details.  Additional \ndetails about the program will be forthcoming as we approach launch, including webi nars \navailable to potential borrowers and  to lenders.   \nAlso, I would mention that while nonprofit organizations are not currently eligible under \nthe program , the Federal Reserve acknowledges the unique needs of nonprofit organizations, \nmany of which are on the  front lines providing critical services and research to fight the \npandemic.  The Federal Reserve and the Treasury Department will be evaluating the feasibility \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL  \n2 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Tuesday , May 19 , 2020 - OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n \n \n 12  \n of adjusting the borrower eligibility criteria and loan eligibility metrics of the program for such \norganizations.   Such an evaluation will also likely take place with respect to asset -based \nborrowers.  \n The maximum amount of loan participation agreements the Fed will purchase  in the Main \nStreet  program  is $600 billion, with the U.S. Treasury providi ng $75 billion in equity to cover \npotential losses.  Since these are loans  with repayment expected (not forgivable  loans or grants) , \nwe are anticipating that th e Treasury backstop will  ensure that there is sufficient capacity to meet \nall eligible loans.  T he Federal Reserve Bank  of Boston  is in the process of hiring  several \ncompanies to help  support this  large and complex  program .  Information on the se supporting \nfirms  – selected in a competitive process focused on both capacity to perform and price  – will be \nposted on the Boston Fed’s website  in the coming weeks .    \n This is an important program, and we’ve worked very hard to get it right.  We listened \ncarefully to initial feedback and expanded the program in a number of ways to serve a wider \nrange of borrowers.  It will not be able to assist everyone, but we expect that it will provide an \nimportant bridge for many businesses that employ much  of the American workforce.  We will \nalso have the ability to adjust the program , if needed.  \nAs Figure 12  shows,  businesses and  lenders interested in participating can find more \ninformation at www.bostonfed.org/mslp  -- including frequently asked questions, term sheets, a \nmailbox for submitting questions , and a way to subscribe to future email notifications that will \ngo out when updates are available .  I would also mention  the webinars that we pl an to host over \nthe coming weeks.  \n \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL  \n2 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Tuesday , May 19 , 2020 - OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n \n \n 13  \n Concluding Observations  \n The economy has suffered a truly severe  shock from the COVID -19 publi c health crisis .  \nThe unemployment rate has risen very significantly in response to necessary shutdowns  \nintending  to limit the health impact of the pandem ic.  However, even when businesses are free to \nopen, many may face diminished demand  until customers once again feel secure leaving their \nhomes, which underlines that public health is at the root of this crisis and its solutions .   \nI expect that the unemployment rate will likely peak at close to 20 percent .  \nUnfortunately, even by the end of the year , I expect the unemployment rate to remain at double -\ndigit level s.  This outlook  is both sobering  and a call to action .  Now is the time for both \nmonetary and fiscal policy to  act boldly to minimize the economic pain from the pandemic.  \n The Federal Reserve has taken strong actions to mitigate the economic consequences of \nthis crisis .  Policymakers  have dropped interest r ates to near zero, bought Treasury and \nmortgage -backed securities , and initiated a range of  lending facilities.  I have provided some \ndetail on the Main Street  Lending Program , one of the more innovative and economically \nimportant program s which we expect  to open in the coming weeks .  As Fed policymakers, w e \nwill continue to vigilantly pursue  ways  to help the economy return  to full employment.  \n Thank you for having me  today .  I wish you continued health  during these challenging \ntimes . \n \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL  \n2 P.M.

U.S. Eastern Time on Fri day, June 19 , 2020 - OR UPON \nDELIVERY  \n \n \n \nThe views expressed today are my own, not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal Reserve Board of \nGovernors or the Federal Open Market Committee.  \n  \n   \n \n \n \n“An Update on the Economy and the  \nMain Street Lending Program ” \n \n \nEric S. Rosengren  \nPresident & Chief Executive Officer  \nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston  \n \n \nRemarks to the Greater Providence Chamber  of Commerce  \n \n \nProvidence, Rhode Island  \nJune 19, 2020  \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL  \n 10:15 A. M. U.S. Eastern Time on Friday , June 19 , 2020 - OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n \n \n 1  \n Good morning . Thank you for the opportunity to address the  Greater  Providence \nChamber .  I look forward to the time when these events can  once again  occur  in person.   \nFor all of us, the  effects of COVID -19 have been uniquely challenging.  C ities like \nBoston and N ew Y ork ended up with a high number of COVID -19 cases , given their population \ndensity along with their mix of transportation, touris m, international business travel, and \neducation . Rhode Island, too, is one of  several northeast  states that has faced  significant \nchallenges  from the virus .  Fortunately, many of the states  in our area  are following a data-\nfocused strategy for relaxing quaran tine arrangements .  This conservative approach to re opening \nis likely to pay dividends for the health of vulnerable populations and for the  medium - and \nlonger -term health of the economy.  \nToday I would like to speak with you about the pandemic, its effects on the economy, the \nimplications for Federal Reserve policymaking, and some of the steps that the Fed is taking to \naddress the cris is and mitigate its financial impact on American households and businesses .  This \nincludes the establishment of the Main Street Lending Program, which is being  administered by \nthe Federal Reserve Bank of Boston  for the Federal Reserve System .  I’ll say more about the \nprogram in a few moments, but let me note up front how pleased I am that the program opened for lender registrations on Monday.  Building the program and its operational background has \nbeen a complicated undertaking.  I am confident that this innovative program can help lenders \nacross the country support the credit needs of local businesses during these very challenging economic times, with the Fed standing ready to purchase 95 percent of eligible program loans  – \nloans with terms to bridge businesses to better days, like a 5- year term and no principal payments \nfor the first two years . \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL  \n 10:15 A. M. U.S. Eastern Time on Friday , June 19 , 2020 - OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n \n \n 2  \n The program is needed because of the unique economic and public health emergency we \nall face.  Restrictions on movement and commerce that were enacted  in late winter to combat the \nvirus came with great economic costs, but were necessary to avoid much worse health outcomes \ndue, in part, to an overwhelmed healthcare system . These restrictions also  allow ed the  time  \nneeded  to implement safety protocols throughout society.    \nWith states beginning to relax mandated restrictions —some earlier than others —we are \nseeing more individuals returning to work.  Indeed, the employment report for May was  more \npositive than expected.1  Any improvement in employment is wonderful news, given the \nimmense impact on individuals and households from job loss es and unemployment .   \nHowever, we currently face an unusually  complex employment situation, given the \nongoing public health concerns .  More  people returning to work is  good news in the longer  run \nonly if it can be done safely  and on a sustained basis .  If workplaces r eopen without the \nnecessary health precautions, t he recent increases in payroll  employment could be offset by \npossible business closures and serious health outcomes later .  The prospect of such an outcome \ncould also sap investor, consumer, and firm confidence.  If reopening can be done in ways that protect public health, then better outcomes now will also translate to better outcomes in the future. \nEven as many individuals are able to return to work , we must be mindful of the  deep pain \nstill occurring in many segments of the economy.  Jobs related to personal services  – such as \nrestaurants, hotels, retail stores,  and tourism  – have been disproportionately impacted by the \nhealth crisis.   These sectors  employ large numbers of workers, many of whom have little savings \nto cushion against a disruption in wages that lasts for many  months.  Frequently , these workers \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL  \n 10:15 A. M. U.S. Eastern Time on Friday , June 19 , 2020 - OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n \n \n 3  \n are people of color , young workers, and workers  with less educational attainment, and not \nsurprisingly, the unemployment rate has risen the most for these groups.  In addition, m any of \nthese workers are employed in small businesses, which are heavily represented in these service \nindustries  and typically have very limited  financial cushions to carry them through a disruption.  \nSimply put, business models have been disrupted and some business owners have had their life’s \nwork endangered.  \nFortunately , policy makers have acted  quickl y.  The federal government has expanded its \nusual  programs to help individuals  during a downturn, such as mak ing unemployment benefits \nmore available and paying higher benefits , as well as providing direct payments to lower -income \nindividuals .   \nIn addition, t he Federal Reserve has  taken a number of unprecedented actions to prevent \nbouts of financial instability from having significant spillovers to the flow of credit to consumers and businesses.  Among these actions, the Fed has reduced  short -term interest rates to essentially \nzero in order to lower  household and firms’ borrowing  costs.  The Fed has also stabilized \nfinancial market s with purchases of both Treasury and mortgage -backed  securities , which lower s \ncosts for businesses to borrow and individuals to buy or refinance mortgages .  Lastly, the Fed  has \nalso initiated  a range  of emergency lending facilities  to provide liquidity directly to borrowers \nand investors in key credit markets .   \nIn my remarks today, I will discuss  the progress of our  Main Street Lending Program , \nwhich is designed to help credit flow to small and medium- sized businesses that were in sound \nfinancial condition before the onset of the COVID -19 crisis, but now need loans to help maintain \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL  \n 10:15 A. M. U.S. Eastern Time on Friday , June 19 , 2020 - OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n \n \n 4  \n their operations and payroll until they have recovered from, or adapted to, the impacts of the \npandemic.2   \nDespite these important policy actions  to date , I believe more support is likely to be \nneeded from both monetary and fiscal policy .  Unemployment remains very high, and because of \nthe continued community spread of the disease, and the acceleration of new cases in many states, \nI expect the economic rebound in the second half of the year to be less than was hoped for at the \noutset of t he pandemic.  My own forecast is that the unemployment rate will remain in double \ndigits through the end of the year, which is somewhat higher than the median view of participants at the Federal Reserve policy -making body, the Federal Open Market Committee , or \nFOMC.  At the same time, the inflation rate is very likely to remain well below the Federal Reserve’s  2 percent target.  With low  inflation and high  unemployment through this year and \nnext,  I believe additional  policy  stimulus is necessary . \n \nThe Economic Outl ook \nThe employment report for May was stronger than most forecasters expected . One \npossible reason is that states began opening up earlier than epidemiologists were recommending  \nand workers returned to their previous jobs or found new jobs fas ter than anticipated .\n3  Still, even \nwith the employment gains,  the unemployment rate remains  quite  elevated, as shown in Figure \n1.  At 13.3 percent, t he U.S. unemployment rate for May was up dramatically from February.   \nHowever , even this very high unemployment rate understates the disruption in labor \nmarkets.  The second set of bars show s the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics ’ estimate of how \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL  \n 10:15 A. M. U.S. Eastern Time on Friday , June 19 , 2020 - OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n \n \n 5  \n many respondents to the employment survey classified themselves as being  employed but not  at \nwork —individuals who should have been counted as unemployed on temporary layoff .  As you \ncan see from the estimates,  these respondents , if correctly classified , would have increased the \nunemployment rate by almost five percentage points in April and just over three percentage \npoints in May .  So yes, the unemployment rate did improve from April, but the picture is not as \nbright as the headline unemployment rate  measure suggest s.  In addition, the number of \nindividuals want ing a job now but not currentl y looking for work, the third set of bars, also rose \nonce the pandemic hit.  Taken together, these three set s of bars indicate a badly disrupted labor \nmarket.  \nFigure 2  shows that the unemployment rate rose for all age cohorts.  However, \nindividuals between the ages of 16 to 24 have  a particularly elevated unemployment rate.  This \nindicates the presence of significant challenges  for those individuals who are newly entering the \nlabor market and are frequently looking for entry -level positions.  This should be  particularly \nconcerning, given prior evidence that the earnings paths  of those individuals entering the labor \nmarket during a downturn are adversely affected for many years.  \nFigure 3  illustrates that Hispanic and African American  workers have been  \ndisproportionately impacted  by recent job losses , with Hispanic workers showing the largest \nincrease in unemployment .  In all , while prior to the pandemic  unemployment for people of color \nhad fallen to quite low levels by historical standards , these groups  have been disproportionately \nimpacted since the onset of COVID -19. \nFigure 4  shows that the pandemic caused increases in unemployment across all \neducational attainment categories.  However, the increase in unemployment is particularly \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL  \n 10:15 A. M. U.S. Eastern Time on Friday , June 19 , 2020 - OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n \n \n 6  \n pronounced for those w ith low er levels of  educational attainment.  Many of the jobs that are \noften filled by people with lower educational attainment are service jobs  that have been \nparticularly impacted by the pandemic, such as positions at hotel s, restaurant s, and tourism -\nrelated firms . \nFigure 5  provides the median forecast for several economic variables submitted by \nparticipants at  the June  FOMC meeting.  The se median forecast s reflect the  significant economic \ntoll from the pandemic.  Real GDP is forecast to decline by 6.5 percent this year , core inflation is  \nexpected  to end the year at only 1 percent, and the unemployment rate is forecast to be  9.3 \npercent  by year end .  Unfortunately, I believe e ven this dire outlook may be too optimistic.  My \nown forecast is  somewhat more pessimistic, as I expect the unemployment rate to still be at \ndouble -digit levels at the end of the year , given what are likely to be persistent  economic  \nheadwinds from the pandemic over the second half  of the year .  And my own more pessimistic \nforecast does not fully incorporate the challenges of a second wave  of the virus  that is more \nsevere than the first  – an outcome that occurred with the 1918 Spanish Flu, the 1957- 1958 Asian \nFlu, and the 2009- 2010 H1N1 Flu.  \nAs Fi gure 6  highlights, the economic toll of the virus is closely tied  to how successful ly \nwe can get the public health pandemic under control.  So far, in t he United States efforts to \ncontain the virus have not been particularly successful, with more  cases per thousand than the \nother countries shown on the chart.  This  lack of containment could ultimately lead to  a need for \nmore prolonged shut -downs, which result in reduced consumption and investment, and higher \nunemployment  – as shown on the chart .  Countries with much more successful pandemic \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL  \n 10:15 A. M. U.S. Eastern Time on Friday , June 19 , 2020 - OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n \n \n 7  \n containment efforts , like Japan and South Korea, have also had much less disruption to their \nlabor markets.   \nAs a result, I believe that a more rapid and complete economic recovery requires better \nability to  contain  the pandemic.  O r medical solutions that make infections much less likely , such \nas with an introduction of a successful vaccine  – or much less severe, such as with the \ndevelopment of more effective treatments . \nFigure 7  shows differences  in social distancing across states , measured in terms of \nmobility from cell phone -based foot  traffic data to over 5 million points of interest.  The figure \nsuggests that social distancing behavior is strikingly different  across states .  In Massachusetts \nand Rhode Island, where the economy is now only slowly reopening, non- essential retail and \nrestaurant visits are down dramatically and do not look much different now than in the middle of \nMarch.  In contrast, a state like South Carolina, and to some degree Florida, have seen visits to \nnon-essential retail establishments and restaurants rise following their initial decline in March, \nand especially since the early reopening of these states’  econom ies.  Especially in South \nCarolina , visits to these locations are only a little  lower now relative to  their pre -shutdown level s.  \nRapidly available (h igher  frequency ) expenditure data show a pattern similar to the mobility \nnumbers  – with spending in many southern states that reopened earli er rebounding more than in \nstates in the Northeast and West.   \nWhether states with mobility patterns like Massachusetts and Rhode Island – or South \nCarolina and F lorida  – fare better going forward will depend importantly on how changes in \nsocial distancing  affect the progress of the pandemic; in fact, evidence is already emerging that \nnew cases in South Carolina and Florida are rising ( Figure 8 ).  If there are significant flare -ups \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL  \n 10:15 A. M. U.S. Eastern Time on Friday , June 19 , 2020 - OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n \n \n 8  \n in states that have aggressively reopened, the reduction in social distancing that contributes to \nstronger  economic performance in such states now  may translate to more depressed economic \nactivity and increased public health issues in those states in the f uture. And given the U .S. \npopulation’s ability to travel, any region that does not socially distance effectively and suffers increased rates of infection will likely export their public health problems to other regions of the country that are tourist sites , transportation hubs, or educational centers.  \nIn sum, g iven the death toll of the virus even with the economic lockdown, I see a \nsubstantial risk in reopening too fast and relaxing social distancing too much.  And e ven if it \nturns out that the response t o the pandemic has been calibrated appropriately, the forecast from \nFOMC participants highlights the need for a dditional highly stimulative monetary policy, \nincluding the use of  Federal Reserve emergency lending facilities.  \n \nUpdate on t he Main Street L ending Program  \nI will now turn to a discussion of the Main Street Lending Program, expanding on some \nof my earlier comments .  Since the Federal Reserve first announced the program ,\n4 the Boston \nFed ha s been very focused on taking all the necessary steps to operationalize th is innovative \nemergency lending  initiative , which aims to  help  facilitate credit flows that can  bridge  small and \nmedium -sized businesses  until better economic times.  I’m very happy to  provide an update on \nthose efforts today , and would like to say a bit about the ways this program can make a \ndifference.  \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL  \n 10:15 A. M. U.S. Eastern Time on Friday , June 19 , 2020 - OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n \n \n 9  \n First, some context.  In contrast to many of the Federal Reserve’s emergency facilities, \nwhich focus on buying relatively standardized market securities, the Main Street Lending \nProgram  focuses on bank  loans to business es.  Since every business , and every business loan, is \nsomewhat unique, the program is inherently complex.  I am very proud of the team that is \nwork ing tirelessly to stand up the program to serve the public interest at this terribly challenging \ntime in our economy.  \nIn particular, the program  addresses a problem that is evident in Figure 9 .  In each of the \npast three recessions, business lending decreased significantly.  While some of the se declines \nresult ed from  reduced demand for loans  from businesses , in two of the past three recessions  \nlending conditions clearly  tighten ed significantly , restricting credit supply .  In general, credit \nsupply is restricted  when uncertainty is high and some banks experience elevated loan losses.   \nThis dynamic is particularly relevant  if bankers fear worse ning economic conditions, or \ntheir bank’s own financial condition make s them more reluctant  to lend on the same  terms as \nprior to  the economic downturn.  In severe downturns, such as the 2008- 2009 f inancial c risis, \npoorly capitalized banks reduced their balance sheet s by becoming much more restrictive with \ntheir lending.  (Loans are assets for banks, so lending less  preserves  capital -to-assets ratios when \ncapital is under stress).   While banks are currently well capitalized, the economic outlook is  \nhighly  uncertain , with substantial downside risks, and bank balance sheets may become more \npressured over time.   Whi le some pre vious rec essions  have involved c redit crunches , the kind of \nshock we’ve seen since the pandemic  arrived is unprecedented in post -war history.  \nTo facilitate the flow of  credit for businesses, particularly those that are dependent on \nbank financing, the Federal Reserve created the Main Street Lending P rogram  to participate in \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL  \n 10:15 A. M. U.S. Eastern Time on Friday , June 19 , 2020 - OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n \n \n 10  \n lending with banks.  While I covered some of the details of this program in an earlier talk, recent \nchanges  to the program ma de it even more widely available for borrowers , allow ing more small \nand medium -sized businesses to be able to receive loans .5  The revised term sheet include d \nsignificant adjustments .  I would highlight that the minimum loan size was reduced to $250,000, \nmaking it more attractive to smaller businesses and community banks.  In addition, the terms \nwere made more attractive.  The maturity was extended to five years (from four ), and the \namortization schedule was eased .  No principal is due in the first two years , with interest deferred \nin the first year.  \nThe program is designed to assist lenders in meeting the credit needs of the businesses in \ntheir communities , even amidst the pandemic’s economic disruptions . The Fed will participate in \nthe lending by purchasing a 95 percent intere st in the loan , provided it meets the terms and \nconditions of the program .  By purchasing this percentage  of the loans, the Federal Reserve will \ntake on most of the risk that would otherw ise need to be absorbed solely by lenders, and will \ncreate additional balance sheet capacity for lenders to extend more loans  at this challenging time \nfor our country’s economy . \nInterested businesses will work with an eligible lender to determine if they meet the \nprogram requirements, which are available online, as well as the lender’s own underwriting standards.  The lender will determine whether a business is approved for a loan.\n6  \nIn addition, the Federal Reserve just announced it is seeking feedback on a proposal to \nexpand the program  to support nonprofit  entitie s.7  While the loan underwriting conditions have \nbeen tailored to nonprofits, other aspects of the loan, such as maturity and amortization are the same as for small and medium -sized businesses  (Figure 10 ).  The Federal Reserve and Treasury \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL  \n 10:15 A. M. U.S. Eastern Time on Friday , June 19 , 2020 - OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n \n \n 11  \n are seeking comment on this term sheet before revising it and preparing to operationalize the \nprogram.  \nOn Monday of this week,  we opened the registration and verification process for financial \ninstitutions  that wish to participate as lenders in the Main Street P rogram.   These are still early \ndays in the program, and we are seeing a steady stream of interest  – with over 200 financial \ninstitutions , large and small , initiating registration  as of yesterday .  The institutions that have \nregistered so far are geographically dispersed , representative of all 12 Federal Reserve districts .  \nI am encouraged , too, by the interest of many smaller financial institutions like community \nbanks. \nMany more lenders have inquired about the program and attended our outreach sessions.  \nWe encourage lenders  who have not yet registered to explore the program , learn about the ways \nit can help them help their business borrowers, register to participate, an d in fact to begin to \nimmediately make the loans that qualify  using the program terms .  Lenders need not wait to \nmake qualified loans , which they will be able to  sell 95 percent of to the Fed when the program’s \ntransactional phase begins .8   \nI anticipate that  many more institutions will register for the program, given its benefits to \nthem, their customers, and the areas where they operate.  We continue to do widespread outreach \nand field significant numbers of inquiries.  Lenders have a vested interest in the resilience of the \nbusinesses in their market, and this program gives them a way to help bridge those businesses that were sound before the pandemic to better days. \nOf course there is a learning curve, but we are seeing tremendous interest in the loans \nfrom businesses .  Lenders  are determining how they’ll participate  in and communicate about the \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL  \n 10:15 A. M. U.S. Eastern Time on Friday , June 19 , 2020 - OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n \n \n 12  \n program.  Borrowers will need to persist during this ramp- up phase.  But I am very positive \nabout t he promise of the program in helping local businesses and lenders maintain vital business \ncredit during the se very challenging  economic  time s. \n \nConcluding Observations  \nI’d like to conclude with a few big -picture comments.  The global  pandemic has already \nmade existing societal divisions starker – and recent tragic events have left us all wresting with \nthe complex reality of societal inequities.  Here at the Boston Fed, we know that now , more than \never, it is important to continue our work to make socio- economic outcomes inclusive of every \nAmerican.   The recovery aft er the Great Recession, with low levels of unemployment enjoyed \nacross disparate demographic groups before the COVID -19 outbreak, illustrates that the Federal \nReserve’s fulfillment of the full employment mandate can help to support an inclusive economy .  \nThe U .S. economy is currently suffering from high unemployment and low inflation, \nfully justifying additional monetary and fiscal policy  action s to return the economy as quickly as \npossible to where we were prior to the COVI D-19 pandemic.  While these policies can help \nmitigate the economic impact of the crisis , much of the path of the economy will be determined \nby the virus and how successful ly it can be contain ed, either through public health or medical \ninnovations. \nAs well as m ore traditional monetary policy tools, the Federal Reserve is operating \nseveral significant emergency credit facilities .  The Main Street Lending Program has recently \nexpanded in scope  to become  more attractive for borrowers and lenders .  Our hope is that this \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL  \n 10:15 A. M.

            "content": "1 \n Eric S. Rosengren , President  and CEO , Federal Reserve Bank of Boston  \nPrepared Testimony for the Congressional Oversight Commission  \nAugust 7, 2020  \n \nMembers of the Commission – Representative Hill, Mr. Ramamurti, Representative \nShalala, and Senator Toomey  – thank you for the opportunity to speak with you about  the \noperationalization of the Federal Reserve’s Main Street Lending Program, a facility authorized \nby the Board of Govern ors of the Federal Reserve System (“Board of Governors”) under section \n13(3) of the Federal Reserve Act, with approval of the Secretary  of the Treasury .  As you know, \nthe Department of the Treasury  (“Treasury”)  has committed to make  an equity investment of  $75 \nbillion in the Program  – and th e funds available for invest ment  by the Treasury were \nappropriated to the Exchange Stabilization Fund under section 4027 of the Coronavirus Aid, \nRelief, and Economic Security Act ( the “CARES Act ”). \nThe Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, which I lead, administers the operations of the \nMain Street Lending Program  (“Main Street” or “Program”)  for the Federal Reserve System.   As \nsuch, I am very pleased to be here today to provide information that I hope will be useful to you \nin you r important oversight work . \n \nBackground to the Program  \nIn addition to  the tragic loss of life, all of us know that the COVID -19 pandemic poses a \nshock to the U .S. economy  that is unprecedented in our lifetimes .  With real GDP in the second \nquarter falling by more than 30 percent, it is clear that businesses , nonprofits, and individuals  \nacross the country  are being challenged  by the fallout from  the virus .  We have seen a \n\n \n2 \n disproportionate impact  on entities  whose operating model s require significant social interaction , \nstemming from consumers’ concern with their own health and safety  as well as  more  formal \nrestrictions on movement and commerce.  For example,  hotels, airlines , retail  stores , \nentertainment  venues , restaurants, and tourism -related enterprises  have al l suffered significant \ndisruptions to their business es and cash flow, with more  difficultie s possible if the public health \nconcern s persist.   Nonprofit entities like medical service providers and educational institutions \nalso are challenged.  \nBoth fiscal and monetary policy makers  have acted swiftly  to address the economic \nimpacts of the pandemic and cushion  the blow.  The Federal Reserve , for example, has taken a \nnumber of aggressive policy actions since late winter , aimed at blunting the economic effects of \nthe crisis.  Seeing  unusual volatility and troubled financial markets, the Federal Open Market \nCommittee  reduced short -term interest rates to near zero and purchased significant amounts of \nsecurities , and the Board of Governors established a variety of emergency facilities under section \n13(3) of the Federal Reserve Act  in order to restore market functioning and facilitate lending .   \nThese actions helped to restore financial stability and significantly reduced spreads on \nshort - and long -term corporate and municipal securities  – spreads  which had increased due to \nuncertainty , and challenged the flows of credit that underpin our economy .  And the facilities \nhelped to unlock a great deal of private credit , as well . \nMany of the emergency lending facilities are similar to facilities rolled out during the \n2008 -2009 financial crisis.  However, many of the businesses  most impacted by the pandemic \nare smaller firms that rely on banks for loans , rather than access ing public credit markets  (i.e., \nissuing bonds) .  The Main Street Lending Program is designed to facilitate lending to small and \nmedium -sized businesses that have suffered disruptions from th e pandemic, and were in sound \n\n \n3 \n condition prior to the pandemic.  The program, like all emergency lending facilities, was \nauthorized by the Board and Treasury, and in this case is being implemented and administered by \nthe Federal Reserve Bank of Boston.   \nThe terms of the Main Street Program were enhanced  and expanded by the Board and \nTreasury prior to the Program’s opening , and more recently a term sheet has been released that \nmakes the Program available to non -profit organizations  as well as for -profit businesses .  I would \nnote that in addition to providing loans for borrowers in current need of funds, the Program  \noffers a credit backstop for firms that do not currently need financing, but may if the pandemic \ncontinues to erode the  financial condition of these firms over late summer and fall . \n Importantly, the Main Street Lending Program differs from other programs for businesses \nmade possible by the CARES Act, reflecting the parameters of what the Federal Reserve is \nauthorized by Congress to do.  Unlike the Paycheck Protection Program, where many loans \ncould turn into grants  funded by the CARES Act, the Main Street program involves loans that \nmust be repaid.  The Program has no loan guarantee like the Small Business Administration \nprovided for the Paycheck Protection Program, and requires both the borrower a nd lender to be \neligible to participate in the Program.  \nWe engaged in a g reat deal of  consultation with  potential  borrowers and lenders as we set \nup th e Program.   In addition to soliciting public comment, s taff at the Board of Governors, \nTreasury, and the Federal Reserve Bank  of Boston  conducted outreach to potential borrowers \nand lenders of all sizes – ranging from community banks to the largest lenders in the country – in \nan effort to gather information to inform  policy judgments and  operational decisions related to \nthe Program.   In addition to the variety of outreach calls, we have h osted  a series of 14 (so far) \nwebinars  that have been tailored  to borrowers and lenders , and in which presenters review  the \n\n \n4 \n terms, conditions , and operat ional details of the Program.  All of the sessions have been well \nattended with many having more than 1,500 participants .   \nTo ensure the Program is widely known, in conducting these webinars and otherwise \nsharing information we have made an intentional effort to reach nonprofits, minority and \nwomen -owned businesses, minority depository institutions , and tribal businesses .  In addition, \nrobust Frequently Asked Questions  document s provide detail on many  aspects of the for-profit \nand non -profit program  facilities , and are updated with some frequency .   \n \nParameters of the Program  \nThe Main Street Lending Program was designed to provide credit support for business or \nnonprofit borrower s that ha ve temporary cash-flow problem s due to the pandemic  – and given \nthe uncertain outlook might otherwise have difficulty in obtaining credit  from  a lender that \nwould have to hold 100 percent of the loan .  Main Street can provide a loan to bridge the \nborrower  over this current challenge .  Main Street  loans have no interest or princip al payments in \nthe first year, and indeed no princip al payments until year three , making the cash -flow aspects of \nthe loan attractive to borrowers experiencing a pandemic -related, temporary disruption of their \nbusiness  model . \n The Program includes three lending component s for for-profit businesses .  They have  \nsimilar interest rates, maturit ies, and terms, but have somewhat different collateral  arrangements , \nloan-size limitations, and underwriting.  For mid -sized businesses with existing term or revolving \nlines of credit, the Main Street Expanded  Loan Facility (MSELF) allows businesses to upsize \ntheir current loans , with additional lending of  $10 million  to $300 mi llion.  For smaller \nbusinesses , the Main Street Priority  Loan Facility (MSPLF) allows businesses to borrow from \n\n \n5 \n $250,000 to $50 million.  Under each  of these facilities the Main Street loans must be senior or \npari passu  (of equivalent status ) with the borrower ’s other loans and debt instruments  (excluding \nmortgage debt) .   \nFor smaller business loans without collateral , there is the Main Street New Loan Facility \n(MSNLF) that provides loans from $250,000 to $35 million dollars, which  cannot be \ncontractually subordinated to other debt.  Because these loans do not have security or collateral \nrequirements,  they are only available for firms whose debt including the Main Street loan do es \nnot exceed four times  the borrower’s  EBITDA  – a more restrictive underwriting criterion than \nthe other two loan types, which  set maximum loan size based on six times the borrower’s \nEBITDA .   \n The two nonprofit  lending  components of Main Street are announced but not yet live .  \nThey will have broadly similar terms as the for -profit Main Street facilities , for example in  \nmaturity  and interest rate.  The Nonprofit Organization Expanded  Loan F acility (NOELF) and \nthe Non profit Organization New Loan Facility (NONLF) have similar priority a nd size \nrequirements to the ir for -profit counterparts .  They differ in that the underwriting is tailored to \nthe special characteristics of nonprofits.   \n \nLending, and Lenders  \n We have take n great  care to operationalize the Main Street program to ensure i t functions \nsmoothly and securely.  Of course, s etting up a program to serve many different borrowers and \nlenders  is inherently  complex , but I believe the Commission in its oversight role can feel \nconfident that th is challenge is being met in strong fashion, in the public interest .   \n\n \n6 \n Unlike the corporate credit and muni facilities, which purchase largely  standardized \ncredit instruments, Main Street purchases interests in loans that are , by nature,  bespoke \nagreements between borrowers and lenders.  Loan agreements and loan terms can be quite \ndifferent across banks, and even within a bank the agreements are the result of negotiation \nbetween borrower and lender that often result in complex, bor rower -specific terms and \nconditions .  For example, banks differ on whether  they require personal guarantees  or collateral \nin excess of Program requirements ; and those policies may vary based on the financial condition \nor business model of the  borrower.   \nConstructing a Program that handles this complexity is something we have been intensely \nengaged with these last few months at the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston.  We are pleased to \nhave the opportunity to do this important work , in the spirit of public service that runs through \nour work and our staff . \n Shifting to how the program works, t o become an eligible lender for the Program the \nfinancial institution must  first register  via our Main Street lender portal.  As part of the \nenrollment  process,  the institution must verify that it meets our eligibility requirements , and \nmake attestations regarding CARES Act provisions which require the signature of the principal \nexecutive officer and principal financial officer.   Furthermore, the institution  must  set up and \nverify arrangements to transfer funds effectively and safely , to ensure security and resilience.    \nSince our portal opened for lender registration on June 15 , 509 financial institutions have \nregistered with the Program, and their assets represent  $14.25 trillion , which is approximately 58 \npercent of total bank ing assets  in the U nited States .  The attached  Figure  1 shows the size \ndistribution of registered MSLP lenders.  It includes the largest universal banks and region al \n\n \n7 \n banks, and a sizable number of banks in the $1-10 billion  asset range as well as in the under $1 \nbillion asset categor y.  Participation is of course strictly voluntary for financial institutions.  \n During the extensive outreach that we did prior to launching Main Street , we heard \nconcerns from some businesses that their current lender would not be participating in the \nProgram or that they might find it difficult to locate a participating financial institution that \nwould work with new customers.  In aiming to address these concerns, we ask lenders during the \nregistration process if they plan to accept loan applications from new customers.   We contact \neach lender that sa ys they would consider  loan applications from new customers, and ask \nwhether they w ill join a public list of such lenders .  Figure 2  shows the interactive map  we \ncreated  that allows borrowers to identify  which lenders in their state are registered with Main \nStreet,  are prepared to consider new customers , and are willing to be listed as such .  The \ninteractive map is available on the program website, www.bostonfed.org/mslp , and w e update \nthe list daily as new lenders register.   Currently it contains 153 lenders.   Figure 2 shows, for an \nexample, the financial institutions on the map for my home state of Massachusetts.  \nIt is important to note that Main Street relies on lenders to underwrit e the  loans, and \nindeed the lenders  have  “skin in the game” by retaining 5 percent of the loan participation.  \nBorrowers need to meet the underwriting standards of the financial institution , and the terms and \nconditions of the Main Street Lending Program, whether they have an existing relationsh ip with \nthe lender or are a new customer.  \n Borrowers also must meet the  eligibility criteria set out in the Program  term sheet, and \nmust be able to make the certifications and commitments required by the Program, including \nthose  required under the CARES Ac t.  Also, w hile the loan interest rate of 300 basis points over \nLIBOR is likely attractive to somewhat higher -risk borrowers, those businesses that have strong \n\n \n8 \n balance sheets and have not been significantly impacted by the pandemic may very well find \ntheir lender can give them more attractive terms than the Main Street Program.  Because the \nloans are not forgivable by the Federal Reserve and lenders retain a 5 percent interest in the loan, \nborrowers must have the ability to pay back the loan.  For borrowers  with severe problems, \nadditional debt may not be helpful, and neither the lender nor the borrower will find taking \nadditional debt attractive.  But for many others, the program can serve as a vital bridge to address \ncash flow interruption ushered in by th e pandemic.  \n \nEarly Results  \nFigure  3 shows the flow of potential loan participation purchases  through the Program’s \nportal  as of the end of the day on Tuesday (August 4) .  As you see on the summary bottom line, \ncurrently over $530 million  in loans  are active  in the portal , representing 54 loans.  Of that total, \n18 loans with a combined value of $109 million have commitments for purchase or have been \nsettled .  In addition, over $421 million in loans  are in various stage s of review in the portal.   As a \nreminder, the program opened for loan purchases on July 6 .  The numbers I share with you today \nare consistent with what I would characterize as a  gradual pace of initial activity, which is more \nrecently expanding . \nThe 54 loans submitted in the portal currently represent 29 distinct lenders.  Almost all \nthe loans currently in the portal have been initiated by financial institutions with under $50 \nbillion  in assets . Additionally, there are 36 lenders with draft  entries in progress in the system.  I \nmenti on these draft entries because they reinforce that additional lenders are active in the portal \nand getting familiar with Program operations.   \n\n \n9 \n  Figure  4 breaks out the total of potential loans in the portal by the particular branch or \nfacility of the Program.   The largest number of loans – 29 – are in the New Loan Facility.   \nThe Priority Loan Facility currently has 24 loans valued at $328 million in the portal.  And \ncurrently there is only one loan utilizing t he Expanded Loan Facility in the portal.  Th e \nExpanded loan facility will generally encompass  larger loans and require current participating \nbanks to alter existing loan agreements to upsize existing credit facilities.   \nFigure 5  provides the size distribution of potential loans currently in the portal .  While \nthe largest number of loans are in the size cohort between $1 million and $2.5 million dollars, \nthere are loans under $1 million and greater than $30 million.  The industries represen ted include \nconstruction and design firms, dental offices, retailers, and entertainment -related firms like \nmovie theaters.  Thus , the loans we have seen to date have reflected what one might broadly \nexpect of small and mid -sized firms whose businesses have  been disrupted by the current efforts \nat social distanc ing. \nFigure 6 shows the potential loan distribution by the asset size of the lender  registered in \nthe Program .  The largest number of loans are by financial institutions in the $10-50 billion size \nrange.  However, there has been participation by relatively small community banks  as well .  To \ndate, there has been only limited activity by banks with more than $50 billion in assets.  \n As I alluded to a moment ago, t he Program ’s relatively modest initial numbers  seem to be \ngiving way to more uptake  as participants become familiar with the program’s parameters .  I \nbelieve the gradual uptake is a function of participants adjusting to a few unavoidable factors.  \nFirst and foremost, loans are bespoke,  and the Program needs  to accommodate lending across a \nwide  range of industries, jurisdictions, and business profiles , which makes for operational \nchallenges.  Also, the Program’s complexity reflects  the underlying loan agreements, the terms \n\n \n10 \n and conditions in the Program , and requirements related to  the CARES Act.  As a result, it can \ntake some time for borrowers and lenders to gather the required documents  for submission to the \nProgram .  Loan d ocument s not in compli ance with terms and conditions have slowed some of the \nintake .  We are working to help participants understand and avoid common errors that can slow \nthe process down.  \n \nSummary Observations  \n Designing and operationalizing a program of this breadth and nuance, delivered through \nhighly secure technology, is a significant achievement in a few months’ time .  Everyone \ninvolved is focused on helping to provide important credit support to businesses and nonprofits \nat this critical and challenging time.  \nAs we speak today , in early August, I can say that  we have worked through many \nchallenges.  A mong the emergency lending facilities established by the Federal Reserve since \nlate winter  – and indeed in co mparison to the emergency programs of the 2008 financial crisis – \nthe Main Street Lending Program  is operationally complex .  Quickly scaling up a program that \npurchases participations in bespoke loans – from a very diverse group of borrowers in a \ndecentral ized market that lacks standardization – is inherently difficult.  There are also tradeoffs \nbetween limiting credit risk, targeting support, reaching scale, and achieving operational \nefficiency.  Considerations such as these have made the M ain Street Lending Program  one o f the \nmost challenging emergency lending programs the Federal Reserve has ever put in place.  The \nCommission can be assured that t he Federal Reserve  and Treasury have sought to design a \nprogram that is  well managed with respect t o risks, efficiency, and resilience, while being \nresponsive to the needs of borrowers experiencing difficult times.   \n\n \n11 \n The eventual size of the Program will be determined by the path of the pandemic and the \neconomy, generally.  Should the pandemic and the e conomy worsen, or financial institutions  \nexperience larger than expected loan losses and depletion of capital – all things we hope do not \nhappen – then I would expect interest in using this Program to expand more rapidly . \nIn conclusion, the pandemic’s shock to our economy is unprecedented, and the pain for \nbusinesses, organizations, and workers has been unparalleled in our lifetimes.  It is important that \nthe Federal Reserve stands ready  at this time of distress , in the public interest and  in pursuit of \nour Congressional mandates, to support lending to for-profit businesses and nonprofit \norganizations  of many sizes  at reasonable  rates.  From many decades of research and \npolicymaking, I can attest that c redit interruptions  prolong recessions and ultimately harm \nindividuals on Main Streets across America.  I pledge to you that in administering th e Program, \nthe Boston Fed and the Federal Reserve as a whole will do all that is in our power and purview  to \neffectively support th e firms, nonprofits, and individuals that make up our nation’s economy.    \nThank you for the opportunity to provide  this high-level  overview of the Program .  I \nwould now be happy to address any questions.",

While it is unfortunate that we cannot be together for this event, I am grateful that \ntechnology allows us to gather virtually .  \n \nPublic Health and Econom ic Effects  \nThis continues to be a challenging time, with the high rate of positive COVID -19 cases  \nand resulting deaths  across the country highli ghting the unfolding human tragedy of the \npandemic.  In addition to a tragic loss of life, the pandemic has resulted in an unprecedented \nshock to the U.S. economy.  \nThe i nability , thus far,  to control the virus in the United States is resulting in renewed \nrestrictions on individuals and businesses in many parts of the count ry.  While vital  and \nnecessary  for the good of the economy in the longer run , the ongoing  social distancing in \nresponse to the virus’s spread will continue to comp licate policy makers’ task of supporting  the \neconomy in the short run with fiscal and monetary policy.  As the Federal Reserve’s July F ederal \nOpen Market Committee  statement highlighted, “The path of the economy will depend \nsignificantly on the course of the virus.” 1   \nEven as official  restrictions relax , many people may prefer to continue avoid ing activities \nthat require social interaction in order to protect their own health . With s uch a pattern of  \nbehavior  taking hold, momentum in the economy toward  return ing quickly to full employment  \nwould likely fade.  Being c autious during a pandemic is  absolutely the right thing to do, and all \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL  \n 10:10 A. M. U.S. Eastern Time on Wednesday , August 12 , 2020 - OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n \n \n 2  \n of this highlights that we must get the virus under control  in order for a  sustainable  economic \nrecovery to take hold . \nThe New England region  currently has COVID -19 infection rates below those prevailing \nin many parts of  the country, including  the South and the West.  Recent ly, however, New \nEngland  infection numbers  have been gradually increasing.  Certainly , common sense \nprecautions – such as wearing masks  when around other people , maintaining safe social distance , \nand avoiding crowded indoor settings  – are much less costly than having to shut down whole \nsectors of the economy again.   It is, therefore,  important that everyone continue to take steps to \nprotect public health in order to avoid more tragic outcomes along with further economic pain.  \nThis is especially true at a time when  some colleges and universities are resuming in-person \nclasses, and some K -12 school districts  are planning to bring students back together this fall  – \nwhen there will be less ability to congregate outdoors .     \nToday I would like to begin my remarks by reviewing the current state of the U.S. \neconomy , and I will then discuss some of the steps that the Fed is taking to address the crisis and \nmitigate its  impacts on both  financial  markets  and the real economic activity of  American \nhouseholds and businesses .   \nIn this crisis , which finds little precedent  in our lifetimes,  both monetary and fiscal \npolicy makers  have moved aggressively to offset some of the economic impact of the  pandemic .  \nPolicy actions this year have been l arge and timely, reflecting the urgency of the risks that the \ncontinuing public health crisis  poses.   Specifically, t he federal government has expanded its \nusual programs to help individuals during a downturn, such as making unemployment benefits \nmore wide ly available and increasing the payouts , as well as providing direct payments to lower -\n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL  \n 10:10 A. M. U.S. Eastern Time on Wednesday , August 12 , 2020 - OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n \n \n 3  \n income individuals.  Keeping this segment of the economy afloat , by providing a financial bridge \nuntil economic conditions normalize,  will play an important role in  the recovery.2   \n  In addition, o ne of the segment s of the economy heavily  impacted by the pandemic  has \nbeen small  and medium -sized businesses , which together empl oy a very sizable share of the \nworkforce.   Many small and medium -sized businesses had  to close  down operations  when  \nquarantine restriction s were put in place in the  spring  and simply  cannot fully recover until the \npandemic has abated.    \nAs one measure t o address this concern, i n early July t he Federal Reserve Bank of \nBoston , on behalf of the Federal Reserve System,  opened the Main Street Lending Program,  or \nMSLP, which aims to help facilitate credit flows that can  provide a  bridge  for small and \nmedium -sized businesses until better economic times  arrive .  Because activity in the facility will \ndepend , to a significant degree,  on the path of the economy and the virus, I expect utilization to \nincrease as we get into the fall.  I will say more about this later in my remarks.  \nDespite the sizeable interventions by monetary and fiscal policymakers , high -frequency \neconomic data indicate that the recovery may be losing steam , as activities in many states are \nonce again restricted  (officially or voluntarily) to slow the virus’s spread .  Particularly in some \nparts of the South and the West, where some hospitals are reaching their ICU capacity, changes \nin behavior a re showing up in high frequency data on individuals’ mobility and spending.  \nClearly , continued stimulative monetary and fiscal policy are critical, a nd most importantly \nslowing down the COVID -19 infection rate.  \n \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL  \n 10:10 A. M. U.S. Eastern Time on Wednesday , August 12 , 2020 - OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n \n \n 4  \n The Outlook for the Economy  \nA notable  feature of this recession is how aggressively policy makers  have responded.  \nFigure 1 shows the path of real disposable personal income since January 2000.  Generally, the \ndata fall on a relatively consistent line, and you see  relatively small changes around  the periods \nof recession shading.  However , in this recession, there has been  a substantial increase in real \ndisposable income .  This reflects the extraordinary amount of fiscal action  taken  to offset the \nimpact of the virus .  Fiscal policy has provided many individuals  with substantial financial \nsupport , as befits an unprecedented crisis . \nThe extraordinary fiscal relief provided to households, however, has translated only \nmodestly into spending .  Figure 2  shows a striking rise in the personal saving rate  – a far bigger \njump than we have seen at any time  since World War II .  Several factors account for this  surge in \nsaving .  First, with  both required and voluntary social distancing, and less willingness or ability \nof many people to pursue  certain  activities  – such as  travel ling, attend ing entertainment  events  \nwith crowds, or eat ing indoors at restaurants  – spending will likely be lower relative to the past , \nuntil activities involving social interaction entail  substantially less  public health risks.  Second, \nsaving may have risen for some because of the concern  about  the prospects for worse economic \ncircumstances and less fiscal support going forward.   In all, the increase in saving is a reminder \nof the importance of containing the pandemic in order to achieve a more robust recovery.  \nAlong with fiscal polic y, monetary policy reacted quickly and decisively.  Short -term \ninterest rates were quickly dropped to close to zero in March and , as Figure 3 shows,  the 10 -year \nTreasury yield is well below the level reached  during the financial crisis  of 2008 -9 and Great \nRecession .  In addition , the Fed has deployed a variety of emergency credit facilities designed to \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL  \n 10:10 A. M. U.S. Eastern Time on Wednesday , August 12 , 2020 - OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n \n \n 5  \n maintain  the availability  of credit to firms and individuals.   Based on  many decades of research \nand policym aking, I can attest that credit interruptions prolong recessions and ultimately harm \nindividuals  and firms  on “main streets ” across America.3  So these credit facilities implemented \nby the central bank are very important, and welcome.  \nWith such substantial  deployment of fiscal and monetary policies , one might expect a \nrobust recovery.  Unfortunately, as long as the virus poses significant threat s to public health, a \nfull economic recovery will be  very difficult  as individuals , often voluntarily, avoid activities \nthat place their health at risk .  The increased saving rate , reflecting a falloff in consumption  \ndespite substantial fiscal transfers to individuals , illustrate s the challenges the recovery faces .  \nIndeed, the trajectory of  the economic recovery will be determined more by the path of the virus \nthan by the path of policy making , although monetary and fiscal policy can mitigate , and have \nmitigated,  some of the most significant adverse  impact s to the economy.  \n \nRecent Data, and the Pandemic ’s Effect on  the Economy  \nFigure 4  illustrates  one of the challenges in achieving a full , and timely,  economic \nrecovery  by comparing new COVID -19 cases per million in the European Union with those  in \nthe United States .  While both the EU, which I’ll refer to here as Europe , and the United States \nhad significant increases in infection rates during the spring, Europe enacted more stringent  \neconomic  shutdowns and limits on individuals’ mobility that were  maintained over a  longer  \nperiod .  As a result, the ir infection rates fell  faster and  further , and have remained  relatively low.  \nIn contrast, in the United States, infection rates remain elevated , as states lifted protective \nmeasures  too soon and in a manner  not calibrated for the true risks posed by the virus.  For the \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL  \n 10:10 A. M. U.S. Eastern Time on Wednesday , August 12 , 2020 - OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n \n \n 6  \n country as a whole, the infection  rate is much higher than in the spring , and stands in sharp \ncontrast to the level of infections in Europe.  \nFigure 5  compares new COVID -19 death rates  in the U nited States  and the E uropean \nUnion.    The chart  shows that deaths per million in population have been rising and are \nconsiderably  higher  in the U.S.  than in Europe.  The U.S. death rate from the virus remains \nbelow its peak in the spring  – in part, many suspect, because younge r patients have accounted for \nmore of the infections, and also because  hospital treatments have improved.  Nonetheless, the \nrising death rate could become more severe if infections that start with younger people spread to  \nmore vulnerable  individuals  over time.  \nFigure 6  shows  cumulative death s per million people from the virus in Europe and the \nUnited States.  While Europe had more cumulative deaths  than the U.S. through  March and \nApril , cumulative deaths in the  United States have  now far surpassed those in Europe.  The \nreason , I would argue,  is highlighted  in Figure 7 , which shows  the change in visits to retail and \nrecreation al locations  in the U .S. and select  countries in Europe .  The pattern of the visits \nillustrates how Europe shut down more forcefully , maintained  restrictions  longer, and did not re-\nopen until the virus had reached low levels.  As a result  of this more successful virus \ncontainment policy , visits by Europeans to retail  and recreation locations have now experienced  \na more robust recovery compared with American visits to such locations and are close to their \npre-pandemic levels .  \nAdditional e vidence of the costs of early re-opening  of the U.S. economy  – in economic \nand public health terms – can be  seen in data on infections, mobility and consumer spending \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL  \n 10:10 A. M. U.S. Eastern Time on Wednesday , August 12 , 2020 - OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n \n \n 7  \n across states , as highlighted in my next four charts .  They demonstrate various facets of the \ninteractions between the virus and the economy.  \nFigure 8 plots the states based on two factors – first, the level of mobility  within each \nstate (as measured by cellphones coming in close proximity to one another)  at the end of May  \nand beginning of June , relative to February ( pre-pandemic ); and second by the chan ge in the \ntypes of spending that are sensitive to social  distancing , in May versus April .  Spending  that is \nsensitive to social distancing  involves  sectors  such as travel, hotels, restaurants , and certain \npersonal care services like beauty salons and barber shops .  What we see is evidence of the initial  \neconomic benefit in states that became less restrictive  earlier .  The regression line shows the \ncorrelation – spending in May was stronger , relative to pre -pandemic levels , in those states that \nhad more mobility  (contacts)  and less restrictions on economic activity .   \nBut, unfortunately , that benefit was short -lived.  \nFigure 9  compares the same mobility measure for each state to the percentage change in \ninfections in July.  The regression  line highlights  the overall relationship – more mobility in a \nstate through June is generally correlated with  larger recent increases in infection rates  in July .  \nIn particular, states in the Northeas t typically  experienced much less mobility through June, but \nalso much lower growth in infections in July than many states in the South and West.   \nThe lower recent growth in infections in some states is in turn associated with greater \nrecent  mobility.  Figure 10  compares  the percent change in COVID -19 infections in July with \nthe change in mobility  (contacts)  in the same period .  The Northeastern states now have smaller \nincreases in infections  and higher mobility, as low er infecti on rate s support more mobility .  In \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL  \n 10:10 A. M. U.S. Eastern Time on Wednesday , August 12 , 2020 - OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n \n \n 8  \n contrast , Southern  and Western states now have more infections and less mobility , as people \nreduce contacts  both voluntarily and because of increased restrictions on economic activity .   \nFinally,  Figure 11  shows that the monthly growth rate in July spending was ultimately  \nmuch better in the previously more restrictive and slower to reopen states in the Northeast \nrelative to many Southern and Wes tern states.   Specifically, the figure plots the c hange in \nCOVID -19 cases in July versus the change  in social -distancing -sensitive spending in July.   \nTaken together, these data show that s tates that re-opened early and quickly lifted \nrestrictions saw a short -term increase in activity, but it was at a cost – rising rates of infections , \nwhich resulted in less spending more recently.  In short, lifting restrictions too early and too \nquickly hurt both the economy and public health  down the road .  In the Northeast, where \nrestrictions were more substantial  and lasted longer , states are now experiencing both better \npublic health outcomes and more spending in sectors of the economy that are  sensitive to social \ndistancing.  These results are somewhat parallel  to the differences in outcomes  between Europe \nand the U .S.  \nDespite s ome states achieving a recent reprieve from COVID -19 infections , it is of course \nimportant to remain vigilant, given the ease of spread  of the virus due to the ease of travel across \nstate borders .  Recent slight upticks in states like Massachusetts and cou ntries like Germany – \nwhich have taken the pandemic seriously – bear watching.   Going forward, s tates should be \ncarefully calibrating their actions to data , especially  as we reach the fall with schools opening \nand more activities  moving  inside  as the seasons change .  Failure to take quick actions to \nsuppress the virus could result in more severe economic outcome s as well as the unnecessary \nloss of life.   \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL  \n 10:10 A. M. U.S. Eastern Time on Wednesday , August 12 , 2020 - OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n \n \n 9  \n An Update on t he Main Street Lending Program  \nAs I noted earlier, the path of the economy depends heavily on the path of the virus.   No \neconomic policy action can fully offset the public health crisis , but it can help limit its  impact on \nthe economy.   \nAn important economic policy action designed to mitigat e current and potential economic \neffects of the pandemic is the  Main Street Lending Program , which seeks to facilitate  the \ncontinue d flow of credit to small and medium -sized businesses that were in sou nd financial \ncondition prior to the pandemic, but have been adversely impacted  by it.  The program is \nattractive ly structured for many businesses facing cash -flow interruptions due to the pandemic  by \nfacilitat ing 5-year loans with no payment of interest in the first year and no payment of principal  \nuntil the third year.  It is attractive for lenders because they can meet the credit needs of credit -\nworthy companies and nonprofit organizations in their markets while retaining only 5 percent of \nthe loan on their books , with the Federal Reserve taking a 95 percent participation interest in the \nloan.   \nWith the program , the Fed is aiming to help creditworthy businesses and nonprofits that \nhave suffered temporary cash -flow problems due to the pandemic,  and, given the uncertain \noutlook, might otherwise have difficulty in obtaining credit from a lender that would have to \nhold 100 percent of the loan.   The Main Street program  can provide essential financing to help \nthese entities  avoid  shutting their doors and permanently laying off their  employees.  \nFigure 1 2 shows that there are currently 522 lenders registered in the program.  Banks of \nall sizes have enrolled , with the greatest  number of banks in the $1-10 billion range, although \nsmall er community banks and large r universal banks have also signed up .   \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL  \n 10:10 A. M. U.S. Eastern Time on Wednesday , August 12 , 2020 - OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n \n \n 10  \n One concern raised by  potential  borrowers  about the program  was that their bank might \nnot be participating in the program and , if that were the case , how could they find a bank willing \nto take  on a new customer and work with them on  a Main Street loan.  In response, we have \nmade available a n interactive  map on our  website, www.bostonfed.org/mslp , which provides a \nlist of all participating banks in each state that are currently accepting loan applications from new \ncustomers  and that have agreed to be announced to the public .  There are currently 160 banks on \nthis list; Figure 1 3 provides a view of the banks in Massachusetts tha t are part of this subset of \nregistered  lenders .   \nBy the way, while participation on any level in the MSLP is voluntary – registering, \nworking with existing customers, or taking on new customers – I strongly encourage additional \nbanks to consider  joining those  already registered and th ose on our  list accepting new customers.  \nWe have seen tremendous interest from potential borrowers experiencing a  pandemic -related, \ntemporary disruption of  their businesses.  Financial institutions have a vested interest in the \ncontinued viability of local business es and organizations, and the vibrancy of their local \neconomy.  The Fed is eager to work with lenders and help them as they provide credit to  their \nborrowers.  Given the unprecedented crisis brought on by the pandemic, it is important that the \nFederal Rese rve take extraordinary measures  to help “main street ” businesses.    \nImportantly, additional debt may not be right for every business and organization at this \nchallenging time, but I would encoura ge business es that ha ve been disrupted by the pandemic \nand are in need of financing to explore the program.  On the Boston Fed ’s website , at \nwww.bostonfed.org/mslp , you can  learn more about the terms and conditions of the program , \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL  \n 10:10 A. M. U.S. Eastern Time on Wednesday , August 12 , 2020 - OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n \n \n 11  \n inquire with bank s in your network  to see if they are participating , and if not consult the \ninteractive map for lenders in  your state  accepting applications for new customers .   \nFor many, the program can serve as a vital bridge to address cash flow interruption \nushered in by the pandemic.   Of course, b ank loans are contrac ts between borrowers and banks, \nand the negotiations for loans can take some time  and effort .  As a result, when the program was \nlaunched in early July , there were relatively few Main Street program loans submitted for \nparticipation purchase .  As borrowers and banks have become  more familiar wit h the program , \nwe have seen a steady increase in banks submitt ing loans to our portal.   \nFigure 14  shows that there are currently  more than  $856 million in loans active in the \nportal, with  more than  $250 million in loans committed or settled.   Much of the increase has \noccurred recently , and I expect we will continue to see more activity as more firms are impacted \nby the pandemic.  Unfortunately, should the fall bring a resurgence of the virus as many \nepidemiological models predict , this program may beco me even more essential.  \nSome seem eager to suggest that the Main Street program’s modest initial activity is \nevidence of failure.  I completely disagree , and allow me to explain why .   \nThe Program differs from other programs for businesses made possible by  the CARES \nAct, reflecting the parameters of what the Federal Reserve is authorized by Congress to do.  \nUnlike the Paycheck Protection Program, where many loans could turn into grants  funded by the \nCARES Act, the Main Street program  involves loans that must be repaid. These loans are \nnegotiated between the borrower and lender, designed to meet the special needs  or circumstances  \nof a particular borrower, and must be underwritten by the lender .   A grant program, or a lending \nprogram w ith even more generous terms, would of course have faster uptake.  But MSLP’s  \ndesign, as determined by the Federal Reserve Board in Washington, in conjunction with the \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL  \n 10:10 A. M. U.S. Eastern Time on Wednesday , August 12 , 2020 - OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n \n \n 12  \n Treasury, can indeed support the flow of vital credit to many firms and nonprofit organi zations.  \nThe Federal Reserve and Treasury have sought to design a program that is well managed with \nrespect to risks, efficiency, and resilience, while being responsive to the needs of borrowers \nexperiencing difficult times.   \n Indeed, d esigning and operat ionalizing a program of this breadth and nuance, delivered \nthrough secure technology, is a significant achievement in a few months’ time.  Everyone \ninvolved is focused on  the public service goal of  helping to provide important credit support to \nbusinesses and nonprofits at this critical and challenging period.  Quickly scaling up a program \nthat purchases a large portion of existing loans – from a very diverse group of borrowers in a \ndecentralized ma rket that lacks standardization – is inherently difficult.  There are also tradeoffs \nbetween limiting credit risk, ensuring that operations are safe and secure, reaching scale, and \nachieving operational efficiency.   \nAs a reminder, the program opened for l oan purchases on July 6.  The numbers to date \nseem to me  consistent with what I would characterize as a gradual pace of initial activity  that is \nmore recently expanding  as participants become familiar with the program’s parameters.   \nIt is important that t he Federal Reserve stands ready at this time of distress, in the public \ninterest and in pursuit of our Congressional mandates, to facili tate lending to for -profit \nbusinesses and nonprofit organizations of many sizes at reasonable rates.  As I mentioned at the \noutset, credit interruptions prolong recessions and ultimately harm individuals and businesses on \nmain streets across America.  The Boston Fed and the Federal Reserve as a whole see the M ain \nStreet Lending Program  as one way to do all we can  to support the businesse s, nonprofits, and \nindividuals that make up our nation’s economy.   \n \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL  \n 10:10 A. M. U.S. Eastern Time on Wednesday , August 12 , 2020 - OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n \n \n 13  \n Concluding Observations  \nUnfortunately, the economic outlook is being driven by the course of the pandemic , and \nmuch depends on how successfully it can be contained, either through public health or medical \ninnovations.   The forecast  for the U.S. economy this fall is quite uncertain, but my view is that \nthe recent slowdown in economic activity that  we have seen in high  frequency data is likely to \ncontinue.  Currently , we have an unemployment rate above 10 percent, and because of the \ncontinue d community spread  of the virus , I am concerned that the pandemic will limit the ability \nof the economy to recover  quickly . As a result, an increasing number of those  who are currently \ntemporarily unemployed may ultimately have to face permanent layoffs and the difficult task of \nfinding a new job in a changed economic environment.    \nAt the Fed , we are focused on doing all in our power and purview to support the \neconomy , including through efforts we are very proud of, like the Main Street program  that again \nI recommend lenders, businesses, and nonprofits explore  participating in .   \nWhile the fiscal and monetary stimulus has been significant, it cannot fully offset the \neconomic drain caused by the public health crisis .  Limited or inconsistent efforts by s tates to \ncontrol the virus based on public health  guidance  are not only placing citizens at unnecessary \nrisk of severe illness and possible death  – but are also likely to prolong the economic downturn .  \nThank you  for having me today.  I wish you all continued good health during these \nchallenging times.  \n \n \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL  \n 10:10 A. M.

U.S. Eastern Time on Wednesday , September 23 , 2020 - OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n \n \n 1  \n Good afternoon and t hank you for the  opportunity to meet with the  members of the \nBoston Economic Club , albeit  virtually.   \nAs we approach the fall, the recent data for the national econom y have been better than \nexpected .  The reason is quite clear; m any states opened up from pandemic shutdowns relatively \nquickly , and economic activity has reflect ed the benefits of increase d personal mobility .  \nUnfortunately, we are also  seeing the costs  of higher mobility on  public health  outcomes, as \ninfections and deaths from CO VID-19 remain elevated.    \nIn Massachusetts , until recently, we ha d the highest state unemployment rate in the \ncountry , at 16.2 percent  in July .  However, the unemployment rate in Massachusetts fell to 11.3 \npercent  in August as more businesses have reopened.  Notably , over the summer  both infection \nand mortality rates have been much lower than in many other parts of the country.1  \nOur higher unemployment and lower infection rate ha ve several causes.  One is the \nlaudable focus o f Massachusetts policymakers on public health, and the ir unwillingness to trade \noff higher levels of economic activity in the short -term for higher rates  of COVID -19 infection .  \nHowever, the  type of work that is conducted in the state  also affects the employment situation .  \nA large swath of Greater Boston’s workforce  hold white -collar jobs  – many of which can be \ndone remotely – so downtown Boston has yet to see most workers return to its office towers . \nWith more workers remaining at home, activity  in the downtown area has fallen off significantly. \nThe large support system that developed around these white -collar jobs, consisting of many  \ndowntown businesses  and their employees , have suffered  greatly .   \nLooking beyond employment, t he consequent sharp reduction in revenues of these \nbusinesses has impaired their ability to make timely rent payments, producing adverse effects on \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL  \n 12:05 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Wednesday , September 23 , 2020 - OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n \n \n 2  \n landlords , and eventually their mortgage lenders .  The changed working environment  and its \n“multiplier effect s,” as they emanate through other stakeholders , exemplify some of the \nheadwinds the economy still faces.  \nThe Federal Reserve’s response to the initial and ongoing effects of the pandemic has \nbeen swift and mult ifaceted.   As an example, the statement after last week’s meeting of the Fed’s \npolicymaking body, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) , included new guidance  \nregarding interest rate policy .2   \nThe statement  highlighted that the federal funds rate range is expected to remain at th e \ncurrently  low level until three conditions are met.  First , that the economy reaches maximum \nsustainable employment.  Second, that inflation has risen to 2 percent.  Third , that in flation is on \ntrack to moderately exceed 2 percent  for some time .  These three conditions come with a caveat \nthat no risks emerge that could impede the Fed achieving its  dual mandate – such as increased \nfinancial instability .  In essence , the Committee is committing to wait ing until inflation is above \nits long -run target  before normalizing the federal funds rate , unless other  important risks become \nsignificant.   The lethargy of the inflation rate below the 2 percent target  essentially  since 2008 \nhas made the FOMC willing to overshoot the 2 percent target before normalizing rates , accepting  \nthe added risk to financial stability from holding interest rates near zero  for an extended period of \ntime. \nLast week FOMC meeting participants also provided their updated  forecasts for the \neconomy , in the form of the Summary of Economic Projections  – often referred to as the  SEP.3  \nThe median forecast  of the  FOMC participants has the unemployment rate dropping to 7.6 \npercent by the end of this year, and to 5.5 percent at the end of 2021 , along with a gradual return \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL  \n 12:05 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Wednesday , September 23 , 2020 - OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n \n \n 3  \n of inflation to 2 percent.  This outlook constitutes  a rapid return to full employment , considering  \nthe extent of the downturn from the pandemic  this spring .   \nUnfortunately, m y own forecast is less optimistic.   \nWhile I expect the economy to recover in time, my own  expect ation is that it will be more \ngradual  than the median forecast of FOMC  participants .  The reason for my differing outlook \nhinges on  several cha llenges that , I believe,  the economy  could  face in the coming months.  First , \nI am concerned that  a second wave of COVID -19 infections this fall and winter  is likely , which \ncould cause some states to impose new restrictions on mobility and face-to-face interactions.  \nEven without added restrictions, the added risk of infection from a second wave could  sap some \nof the willingness of consumers and businesses to spend  and invest.   Second, additional support \nfrom fiscal policy, which I believe is very much needed, seem s increasingly unlikely to \nmaterialize anytime soon.  The occurrence of a second wave could result in more fiscal actions, \nbut their impact on the economy would probabl y not be realized until early next year .  Third, I \nexpect that financial spillovers from businesses impacted by the virus will become a more \nsignificant headwind  going forward .  Finally, my forecast reflects my concern that workers \ndisplaced by the pandemi c may find it difficult to quickly transition to new jobs , with more \nfurloughs turn ing into permanent layoffs as many businesses remain troubled.  \nI certainly hope that this less optimistic outlook  turns out to be wrong .  But  the likelihood  \nthat this view is right is why I believe  additional fiscal stimulus, and continued monetary \nstimulus , remain necessary  – despite some of the encouraging economic data received over the \nsummer.  In particular , as concerns monetary policy, it continues to be very impo rtant that the \nFederal Reserve’s emergency lending  facilities  provide support to the economy.4  In my remarks \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL  \n 12:05 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Wednesday , September 23 , 2020 - OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n \n \n 4  \n today, I  will briefly discuss the progress on one such facility, the Federal Reserve’s Main Street \nLending Program  – including  some recent expansions to include multi -borrower loan  structures  \n(loans made to multiple co -borrowers ) and loans to nonprofit s, and a recent announcement \nemphasizing that lenders should focus on borrow ers’ financial position s before and after the \npandemic as they make their underwriting decisions.5 \nBefore I turn to the Main Street  Lending Program , however, I’d like to begin with  a brief \nsummary of  recent economic data and the forecast  provided by the FOMC , while highlight ing \nsome of the risks and challenges I see in the economic outlook .  To preview my conclusion, my \nview s are that the economy remains fragile, that fiscal - and monetary -policy stimulus are \nessential to the recovery, and that policy makers  should con tinue to explore how to reduce \neconomic scarring from  this severe pandemic . \n \nExamining the Recent Data  \nFigure 1  shows the unemployment rate for the nation since the beginning of the year.  \nThe dark blue line shows the standard , widely reporte d “U-3” measure.  The lighter blue line \nshows the unemployment rate corrected for one of the mis classification  errors  that ha ve been \ndocumented this year .6  In particular, many respondents  — especially early on in the pandemic  \n— answered the household labor survey by saying they were employed but not at work because \nof the pandemic , when they should actually have stated that they were  unemployed on temporary \nlayoff.  Even without th is adjustment , the U -3 unemployment rate is currently at 8.4 percent, \nwhich is still consistent with  a severe recession.  Th is misclassification  has become less severe \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL  \n 12:05 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Wednesday , September 23 , 2020 - OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n \n \n 5  \n with better reporting efforts and some of the workers being  recalled or , unfortunately, \ntransitioning to  being permanently unemployed.    \nIn addition, o ther indicators sugges t that the headline unemployment rate , even if \nmeasured correctly,  may understa te the amount of slack in the labor market.  Indeed, t he labor \nforce participation rate is still almost 2 percent age points  lower than it was at the beginning of \nthe year , and t he number of individuals  reporting that they are working part-time for economic \nreasons remains elevated .  While the improvement  in the unemployment rate since April is \nencouraging, I believe further progress will be more difficult to achieve until disruptions from \nthe virus become less acute.  \nFigure 2  highlights  the industries with the most pronounced employment growth since \nMay.  The se industries are the ones t hat were most disrupted by the pandemic  – such as Retail \nTrade, and Accommodation and Foo d Services  – and are sectors of the economy still impacted \nby consumers ’ reticence to engage  in activities where they are less confident of being protected \nfrom the virus.  \nDespite the recent hiring, Figure 3  shows that employment in th ese industries remain s \ndramatically below levels from the beginning of the year  – especially in Arts, Entertainment,  and \nRecreation,  which is impacted by the lack of group events ; and in Accommodation and Food \nServices ( hotels and restaurants ), which relies on  consumers  leaving home  to make expenditures .  \nAmong e ven those industries that have recovered more significantly, employment still remains \nbelow where it was earlier this year.   As a result , while labor markets have improved, the path \nfor further  reemployment  will not be easy  – particularly if a second wave of infections occurs  \nand consumers remain reluctant to participate in activities where social distancing is difficult .  \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL  \n 12:05 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Wednesday , September 23 , 2020 - OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n \n \n 6  \n As a result , the most likely labor market outcome seems to me to be continued improvement, but \nwith slower gains in employment than we have experienced  since April . \n \nThe Economic Outlook  \nAs I mentioned, following last week’s FOMC meeting , the Federal Reserve release d the \nSummary of Economic Projections  (SEP) , which involves asking each FOMC participant to \nprovide their forecast for key economic variables.  Figure 4  shows the median SEP forecast , and \nthe central tendency , for the unemployment rate .  The median of the participants ’ forecasts has \nunemployment ending the year at 7.6 percent, f alling  to 5.5 percent by the end of 2021 , and then \ndropping down to 4.6 percent by the end of 2022.   \nAlthough some of this improvement has alre ady occurred, the expected decline  would \nrepresent a rapid recovery from the pandemic ’s severe employment effects .  Despite this \nprojected pattern of a swift improvement in labor markets, Figure 5 shows that FOMC \nparticipant s forecast only a gradual return to the Federal Reserve’s  2 percent inflation goal.  The \nmedian of the SEP projections has inflation still at 1.8 percent at the end of 2022 , despite the \naccompanying forecast of tight ening  labor markets.   \nThe rapid improvement in the  unemployment rate is facilitated by unusually low interest \nrates.  The median  of the  SEP forecast s for the interest rate through 202 3 is unchanged at its \ncurrent target range , as shown in Figure 6 .  This is consistent with the forward guidance that I \ndiscussed at the outset of my remarks , where Fed policymakers stated their  intention to  wait to \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL  \n 12:05 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Wednesday , September 23 , 2020 - OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n \n \n 7  \n raise rates until the economy has  reached maximum sustainable employment , and inflation is on \ntrack to moderately exceed 2 percent  for some time . \nAll told, the median SEP projection is a relatively optimistic forecast.  The \nunemployment rate falls to 4.6 percent by 2022, and inflation reaches 2 percent in 2023.   As I \nnoted earlier, my own view is less optimistic , because I believe that the path of the pandemic will \ncontinue to present challenges that represent  significant headwinds  to economic growth . \n \nChallenges  to the Economy and the Forecast  \nThe biggest challenge to the economy, and the risk to a more optimistic forecast , \ncontinues to be our inability in the United States to  achieve the public health progress  on the \nvirus seen in  many other developed countries .  Figure 7  shows new infection rates for the United \nStates in dark blue , new infections for Massachusetts in light blue , and new infections for G7  \ncountries (excluding the U.S.) in green .  Starting with Massachusetts, the infections per million \npopulation peaked in April, and then declined significantly as the state imposed strong \nrestrictions to reduce the infection rate.  To date, we have been able to avoid a large resurgence \nof the virus  in Massachusetts, with infections rising only a bit higher than the lows reached in \nJune.  In contrast, national infections were much more subdued in March and April, but \nincreased significantly as many states re -opened very quickly , with few restrictions , causing a \nsurge in infections.  Th ankfully , those infections have moderated nationally, but remain well \nabove the levels in Massachusetts.   The G7 countries , excluding the U.S. , show a dramatically \ndifferent situation, with their new cases per million population peaking in late March at a much \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL  \n 12:05 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Wednesday , September 23 , 2020 - OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n \n \n 8  \n lower level than either Massachusetts or the U.S. as a whole went on to achieve – and remaining \nlow throughout the summer.   \nDespite the  overall  progress nationally  since the July peak , the virus has tended to surge \nin areas that previously had relatively low infection rates.  Figure 8  shows th ree states in the \nNorthern Midwest  that have re cently experienced a surge  – possibly triggered by less restrictions  \non, or higher aversions to,  wearing masks and social distancing, despite a number of large group \nevents.  Th ese patterns of infections emphasize the need to be vigilant, particularly as more \nactivities move inside  this fall and winter . \nFigure 9  shows the forecasted effect  of the virus over the remainder  of this year , based \non the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation ( IHME ) model that is maintained at the \nUniversity of Washington.7  While this is only one model -based projection , it broadly reflects the \nconsensus of many experts and the experiences of past pandemics , that the fall and winter are \nlikely to result in a resurgence of the virus.  Because community spread is not contained, and \nregional fla re-ups are still occurring, one has to be  concern ed about reduction s in restrictions  on \nmobility  at a time when schools are back in session and colder weather  is returning .   \nOf course , the outlook from th e IHME model  could likely  be improved by  more careful  \npersonal behaviors , such as  social distancing and wearing masks, or by states clamping down on \nmobility in the face of rising infection rates .  Still , the model highlights that a second wave is \ncertainly possible if we do not take sufficient precautions .  Due to projections such as this one , \nmy economic forecast is predicated on individuals and firms still being constrained significantly \nby community spread of the virus  this fall and winter.  \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL  \n 12:05 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Wednesday , September 23 , 2020 - OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n \n \n 9  \n If increased infection rates occur during the fall , as I expect , it will exacerbate other \neconomic and financial headwinds that I anticipate will  be more apparent in the last four months  \nof this year.  Figure 10  shows the  delinquency rate s associated with  different real estate asset \nclasses  so far this year , based on  data reported on collateralized mortgage -backed securities  or \nCMBS .  Moving forward, e ven conservatively underwritten properties will likely face challenges \nif consumers are afraid to shop in stores and stay in  hotels through the fall and winter.  So far, \nthese fears have more clearly manifested themselves in the data from CMBS markets; already \nover 25 percent of hotel properties are delinquent , and close to 20 percent of retail properties are \nin arrears.  Moreover, t he CMBS market data may actually be underestimating the problems in \nthese sectors , as it disproportionately accounts for large r properties.  Smaller hotels and retail \nstrip malls, which are more likely to be financed by small and medium -sized banks, are likely to \nbe even more severely impacted  – although data on delinquencies from the summer are not yet \navailable .   \nIn contrast, office and multifamily commercial real estate loans currently have low \ndelinquencies.  However, an important issue for both of these sectors is rollover risk.  Given that \nmost multifamily properties have one -year leases, the costs arising from a wave of no n-renewing \ntenants become clear only at lease renewal times.  An inability to fill the resulting vacancies \ncould lead to an increase in mortgage delinquencies for these properties.  \nFigure 1 1 shows that such stresses are already showing up in major cities , in terms of \nvacancy and rental rates.  Data from Costar, which calculates daily vacancy  rates  and rental \nprices for apartments in major cities, show rapidly rising vacancy rates and fairly sharp declines \nin rents in several major cities.  Particula rly challenged are expensive cities like Boston  and San \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL  \n 12:05 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Wednesday , September 23 , 2020 - OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n \n \n 10  \n Francisco , shown in the figure,  and L os Angeles .  The decline in rents is more abrupt than we \nwould normally see in a  more traditional  (non-pandemic) economic downturn, and may be \nindicative of more s ubstantial problems on the horizon.  Similarly, office properties have longer -\nterm leases, so the stress es in that market will likely become apparent only over time.  However, \nan open question remains – whether there will be structural changes in downtown office space as \na result of a prolonged period with many employees working from home.  \nThe reason to focus so much attention on commercial real estate is because real estate \nprices were inflated by reach ing-for-yield behavior as low interest rates persisted  during the \nrecovery from the Great Recession.  A structural shock, like the pandemic, can result in a \nsignificant increase in the number of nonperforming loans, eventually impinging  the ability of \nbanks and insurance companies  to continue to make credit available to borrowers.  Hence, I am \nespecially  worried about a “second shoe dropping ” that will particularly affect  small and \nmedium -sized banks, which provide a large share of commercial real estate loans and small \nbusiness lo ans.  A curtailment of credit resulting from such problems has caused serious \nheadwinds to recoveries in the past,  and may be a serious problem going forward.  \nFigure 12  shows that , unfortunately,  challenges from the pandemic are likely to extend to \nthe lab or market.  If many hotels, restaurants, and retail firms declare bankruptcy, workers in \nthese sectors  will have to search for new employers, and possibly new industries  for \nemployment .  The industries most impacted by the pandemic tend to be large employe rs of \nwomen, minorities , and young people , as the figure illustrates.  The ability to retrain for jobs \nwith different employers or in different industries can take time, and I worry that th ese employer -\nemployee matching challenges  will result in a slower labor market recover y than what is implied \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL  \n 12:05 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Wednesday , September 23 , 2020 - OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n \n \n 11  \n by the  median unemployment -rate outlook in the SEP.  However, fiscal polic y actions,  like the \ncreation of Paycheck  Protection Program  (PPP) or emergency Federal Reserve program s, like the \nMain Street Lending P rogram , could help moderate the numbers of  firms that close.  \n \nThe Federal Reserve’s Main Street  Lending Program  \nThe Main Street Lending Program , the MSLP,  was designed to provide support  to firms \nthat had been profitable before the pandemic, expect to be profitable after the pandemic  \ndisruptions abate , but have been severely impacted during  the pandemic.  This “bridging” \nconcept is entirely appropriate and beneficial given the presumably temporary disruptions in \nactivity and revenue while  the pandemic is present.  These kind s of bridge loans also tend to be \nscarce during crises, particularly for small and medium -sized firms.8  \nThe MSLP  involves the Federal Reserve purchas ing 95 percent participation s in loan s to \nfor-profit companies or nonprofit entities – loans t hat ha ve been underwritten by a bank , which \nretains 5 percent of the loan .  The program is attractive to borrowers because the interest rate is 3 \npercent age points  over LIBOR – and requires no payment of interest until year two, and no \npayment of principal until year three .  Also, principal payments are back -loaded, at 15 percent in \nyears three and four, and 70 percent in year five – allowing time for the pandemic to pass  and \nbusiness  activity and revenue streams  to revive .  The program  should be attractive to banks , both \nbecause of the fees collected and  because it reduces the risk to the bank of a borrower that was \nimpacted by the pandemic , given that  the Federal Reserve  holds 95 percent of the loan.  Hence , \nthe MSLP allow s bank s to help maintain vital credit  flows in their local market , which avoid s \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL  \n 12:05 P.M.

The Main Street program brings a solution – a backstop to \nthat problem  – given the Federal Reserve’s ability to take on 95 percent of the loans.  I continue \nto urge the nation’s financial institutions to work wit h the Federal Reserve to help provide a \nbridge  for pandemic -affected  businesses and nonprofits to better times, avoiding more lasting \neconomic damage to communities and workers.9 \nImportantly, I would note that t here has been some confusion about the appropriate \nunderwriting standards that a bank should apply to the loan s in the program .  The Federal \nReserve  recently provided new clarifying FAQ s encouraging banks to focus on borrower status \nboth before and after the pandemic when considering whether a borrower is appropriate for the \nprogram.  We also published an FAQ that clarifies how the loan should be treated by bank \nsupervisors, with all three federal regulators agreeing on th e clarification .  Hopefully , these \ndevelopments will encourage some banks to more actively engage with borrowers impacted by \nthe pandemic , using the Main Street program . \nAs shown in Figure 13 , the Main Street Program as of Monday night has $2 billion  in \nloans that have been accepted and $2.4 billion  in loans that have been completed or are actively \nbeing considered in the portal.  We have seen an increased flow of loans as banks and borrowers \nbecome more familiar with the program.  The Main Street Lending Program has recently been \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL  \n 12:05 P.M.

The program will continue to evolve as the Board of Governors and Treasury \nevaluate needs for any additional changes to the program.  \nFigure 14 shows the top states where Main  Street program loans have been completed or \nare under review.  The states are generally areas that were impacted more severely by the \npandemic over the summer , and some of the larger states by population.   \nHowever, an important component has been banks ’ willingness to participate in the \nprogram.  Figure 15 shows that relatively few banks have made more than 10 loans (shown as a \nsquare) and the banks making at least six loans in the Main Street Program have been banks with \nassets under $ 20 billion.  None of the nation’s largest banks , by this metric,  are currently active \nin the program.  \n \nConclu ding Observation s  \nRecent economic data have been encouraging, but I believe the most difficult part of the \nrecovery is still ahead of us.  A full recovery probably requires the availability of  vaccines and \nmore effective treatments for the virus because until then, many businesses and households are \nunlikely to return to  more normal spendi ng habits.  While I anticipate a slowly improving \neconomy, econom ic activity still  faces serious headwinds .  Potential  financial impediments and \nchallenges in the labor market make the recovery process more gradual than any of us would \nprefer.   \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL  \n 12:05 P.M.

Until a vaccine is widely available, it is appropriate to have \nhighly accommodative monetary and fiscal policy.  Monetary policy is pursuing new and \nimaginative ways to deal with the effects of this pandemic.  However, my view is that additional \nfiscal policy is probably the mo re effective tool at this time , since it can directly  allocate money \nto firms and businesse s most  impacted  by COVID -19 without requiring them to take on \nadditional debt  that must be repaid . \nThank you for having me to speak with you today .  I hope you all stay well , and I look \nforward to our next gathering  – hopefully  – being in person.   \n \n1 Massachusetts had the highest unemployment rate in July at 16.2 percent.

U.S. Eastern Time  (11:10 A.M. Central Time)  on Thursday , October 8 , 2020 - OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n \n \n 1  \n Good morning, and t hank you for the opportunity to speak with you  today , albeit, \nvirtually.  I particularly regret not being able to meet with you in person, given the many years I \nenjoyed living and visiting Wisconsin  – first as a graduate student at University of Wisconsin -\nMadison, and then later, when visiting my daughter during her four years in medical school at \nthe Medical College of Wisconsin .  \nI am honored to join the ranks of economists  you have invited to  give the Marburg \nMemorial Lecture  at Marquette  University .  Perhaps appropriately, most  of the previous speakers \nhave been distinguished academics .  Today , I share with you the perspectives I ’ve gained from a \ndifferent role, which is t hat of a policymaker.   \nThe stated  goal of the Marburg Memorial Lecture is to provide a forum for the discussion \nof moral, philosophical , and social dimensions of economic issues .1  Economists discuss the \nsocial dimensions of economic issues  all too rarely .  At this time, in the grip of a worldwide \npandemic, the breadth of the effect of th e virus on society  has made COVID -19 of crucial \nconcern to many disciplines, and economics is certainly no exception.  It is an essential time for \neconomist s to be considering the social implications of  economic  policy, as the nation remains \naffected by  a virus  that has taken  more than  210,000 lives .  As we head into the colder months , \nwe continue to see a high rate of positive COVID cases across the country  (including  a \ntroubling ly high infection rate in Wisconsin and much of the  Midwest), which underscores  that \nthe human tragedy of the pandemic  continues to unfold  even as the economy has reopened and \nimproved  noticeably .   \nIt is important  to note that  both the negative public  health  effects,  and economic \nrepercussion s, of the pandemic ha ve not been felt  evenly  in society .  The virus itself has \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL  \n12:10 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time  (11:10 A.M. Central Time)  on Thursday , October 8 , 2020 - OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n \n \n 2  \n disproportionately affected  minorit ies who, statistically,  tend to  live in more dense  urban area s \nand rely on public transportation to get to work, and who are more likely to be employ ed as \nfrontline and essential workers .  Such jobs cannot easily be performed  remotely, and despite \nbeing deemed essential, often involve modest pay.  In addition, these workers are often  in \nservice -related industries that have been particularly hard -hit by the crisis , and so they have been \ndisproportionally affected by job loss es.2   \nUnfortunately, the uneven effects of recessions ar e not unique to the current one.  B ut the \ncurrent situation  is severe .  As the pandemic is dragg ing on, and consumers remain wary of \nengaging in activity that requires close social contact  – restaurants, hotels, and retailers are \nbeginning to close  – with the consequen ce of permanent job losses for the typically lower -wage \nworkers in these industries.3  \nBusinesses closing , making  job losses permanent , is one example of the so -called \nrecessionary dynamics that often take hold during an economic downturn .4  Importantly, t he state \nof the economy  as it enters  a downturn  – especially the health of the financial system  – can play \nan important role in recessionary  dynamics and how the recessionary  burden is spread across the \neconomy.  \nIn my remarks t oday , I will explore  an economic issue that definitely has social and even \nmoral dimensions a nd implications, consistent with the Marburg lecture  serie s – whether the \nUnited States economy, as currently configured , is particularly vulnerable to economic \ndisruptions  and in turn those recessionary burdens .  In terms of this vulnerability to disruptions, \nit is possible that no one could have predicted  that a worldwide pandemic would occur precisely  \nin 2020  – but one could have anticipate d that having highly levered firms and excessive \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL  \n12:10 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time  (11:10 A.M. Central Time)  on Thursday , October 8 , 2020 - OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n \n \n 3  \n concentrations  of commercial real estate  lending  at some institutions  would make the economy  \nmore vulnerable to a variety of  disruption s, including a pandemic or other shock .   \nYou might be wondering why I would bring up losses from financial instability in the \nsame breath as the pandemic  and its uneven economic and public health burdens .  I do so \nbecause losses due to financial shocks  affect a wide range of stakeholders  – not only  \nshareholders, but also of course  the workers in the affected industries .  A wave of unnecessary \nbankruptcies  resulting from such shocks can  cause a spike in permanent job loss and a significant \nscarring of labor market  participants  – particularly, though not exclusively, those at the lower  \nend of the income distribution.   These lower-wage workers, who tend to have little if any \nfinancial cushions, are the individuals least prepared to endure an economic downturn . \nAmerican novelist Ernest Hemingway famously – and succinctly  – capture s some of my \nconcerns in this dialogue from  his b reakout novel,  The Sun Also Rises : “’How did you go \nbankrupt? ’ Bill asked. ‘Two ways,’ Mike said.  ‘Gradually and then suddenly. ’”  Many \nbusinesses are, unfortunately , facing  the “suddenly ” part right now .  In recent years, m any of \nthese firms had gradually increased risk by taking on more leverage, which magnifies returns \nwith good outcomes – but also magnifies losses w hen bad outcomes  occur .5   \nThis increase in risk -taking is more likely to take place in a low -interest environment, \nlike the one which prevailed  in the aftermath of (and as a result of ) the financial crisis and Great \nRecession .  Low interest rates encourage households and firms to accumulate more debt by \nmaking it easier to meet the cash flow needs to service the debt associated with buying a house \nor making a business (capital) investment, or even share buybacks by firms.  But wh en a bad \neconomic shock occurs, financial buffers for households and firms alike tend to fall, and the debt \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL  \n12:10 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time  (11:10 A.M. Central Time)  on Thursday , October 8 , 2020 - OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n \n \n 4  \n service and potent ial repayment of the  debt can become quite problematic.  Financed assets – be \nthey companies or shopping malls – will also lose va lue in a recession, making it much harder to \nrefinance that debt by taking out a new loan , as might be done in normal times.  \nDuring economic downturns , monetary policy accommodation helps to stimulate the \neconomy  by lowering interest rates and encouraging households and firms to take more risk  – a \ndesired effect during the depths of a recession , when many households and firms become  overly  \nrisk-averse  and limit their spending . (One might think of this as pump -priming to rein in the \ndownward spiral of the economy and initiate a recovery. )   \nHowever, there are potential adverse consequences from  low rates persist ing for an \nextended period  even after the economy has made progress in the recover y.  Abnormally low \nrates  for a long period  during times when econo mic slack is no longer a concern can result in \nexcessive risk -taking , as businesses and firms take on additional debt and accumulate more risky \nassets in search of better returns  – potentially bidding up asset prices to unsustainable levels .  \nThe financial pressures associated with such behavior build gradually, and only become clear in \nthe next economic downturn.  When the ensuing recession occurs, often suddenly , and more \nsevere recessionary dynamics take over, the impact tends to be greatest on workers and firms that \nare least able to adjust and adapt.      \nMy remarks today  focus on  some of the mechanisms that contribute to financial \ninstability and tend to amplify the effects of economic downturn s, and how these mechanisms \nare likely to impact the  economic recovery .  While these observations apply to downturns in \ngeneral, they are certainly relevant in the present particula rly challenging episode . \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL  \n12:10 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time  (11:10 A.M. Central Time)  on Thursday , October 8 , 2020 - OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n \n \n 5  \n • First, I will highlight  an important mechanism that plays a role in recession ary \ndynamics  – the tightening of credit terms and credit availability  during an economic \ndownturn.  In part , the importance of  this channel  is amplified by a low interest rate \nenvironment  during the pre ceding  economic expansion when households and firms \naccumulate d loans , oftentimes in real estate .  A prime example in the current \ndownturn is commercial real estate, wh ere the high leverage build -up before the crisis \nand the severe hit from the crisis have led to a noticeable tightening in credit \nconditions.  With tighter credit conditions, it becomes even more difficult to roll over \nmaturing loans, which are plentiful d ue to the increased leverage.  \n• I will then show that  low rates for a long period of time  not only compound bank \nexposures in real estate , but also increase  firms ’ reliance on debt, making cash flow \ndisruptions from the pandemic more severe.   \n• Finally, I wil l highlight that this build -up in financial risks has  implications for labor \nmarket conditions  – which , unfortunately,  likely mean s a slower  and more painful  \nrecovery than if we had more aggressively addressed  the build -up of risks in the \ncorporate and banking sectors  prior to the pandemic .   \nAll of t his has important policy implications  – for both monetary and supervisory  policy .  \nFirst, it has implications for how long monetary policy should remain highly accommodative ; \nand second, it has implications with respect to the lack of a coherent framework in the United \nStates for conducting supervisory policy that effectively address es the build -up of financial \nstability risks.   Policy improvements in this area should not be seen a s dry or abstract notions – \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL  \n12:10 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time  (11:10 A.M. Central Time)  on Thursday , October 8 , 2020 - OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n \n \n 6  \n given the opportunity to make downturns less severe, hasten recoveries, and alleviate some of the \nhuman toll of job losses and economic insecurity.  \n \nTightening of Credit Conditions  \nThe t ightening of credit conditions frequently occur s in economic downturns , as lenders \nbecome more concerned about the ability of borrowers to pay  off their loans , and the value of \ncollateral  – and become more uncertain  about the evolution of the economy  more generally.  \nFigure 1  shows the results of the bank lending survey for commercial and industrial loans \nconducted by the Federal Reserve.  For both large and small borrowers,  lending standards have \ntightened appreciably , relative to the time prior to the pandemic, and are currently approa ching \nthe peaks we saw in the financial crisis and Great Recession .   \nIn Figure 2 , it is clear that one major difference  between  the current pandemic -driven \nrecession  and the last recession , at least to date, is the better financial condition of U.S. banks.  \nDuring the financial crisis  that began in 2007 , a large number of bank failures occurred, as banks \nheld too little capital for the shock generated from the fall in real estate prices, pa rticularly as it \ninvolved  highly leveraged households.   \nEven though bank failures are currently low  (Figure 2) , and many banks are better \ncapitalized, why are financial conditions tight  (Figure 1)  at least for commercial and industrial \nlending ?  One possi bility is that as the pandemic drags on, the likelihood of more severe \noutcomes for borrowers, and their lenders, has risen .  As uncertainty increases, banks tend to be \nless willing to take on risk , at any price.  Also, a significant depletion  of capital, even if  it does \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL  \n12:10 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time  (11:10 A.M. Central Time)  on Thursday , October 8 , 2020 - OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n \n \n 7  \n not cause a bank to fail, can lead to banks tightening the ir lending standards applied to potential  \nborrowers.    \nIn particular, falling commercial and residential real estate prices were a major reason for \nlosses on loans during th e last financial crisis.  Figure 3  shows  that of l ate, nonperforming real \nestate loans have turned up, but have yet to rise dramatically.  The most recent data come with a  \ncouple of caveats .  First, the data tend to lag fairly significantly; the peak in th e previous \nrecession was well after the recession ended.  Second, and relatedly,  many banks reportedly \nprovided their customers forbearance in the spring  and summer – including , but not limited to , \nforbearance  for real estate loans backed by retail stores or hotels, which  have been particularly \nimpacted by the pandemic , and also for residential borrowers through regulatory mandates .6  \nBecause of the forbearance, borrowers  are meeting current contractual arrangemen ts, but are \nlikely  to struggle  once the forbearance ends if econom ic activity  remains suppressed by the \npandemic.7  \nThis concern  with future loan defaults, along with low net interest margins in a low -\ninterest -rate environment , likely helps explain why  bank stock prices  have remained so  \ndepressed , despite a significant rebound in broader stock indices , as shown in Figure 4 .  U.S. \nbank stocks are at only 60 percent of their value from the beginning of the year, while the \nbroader S&P 500 stock index is now above levels seen in January .   \nIn part , these concerns also focus on the commercial real estate loans made by  many \nbanks.  As Figure 5  illustrates, t he largest banks hold only a little over 5 percent of their assets in \ncommercial real estate loans, while small and mid -sized banks have approximately 25 percent of \ntheir assets in commercial real estate.  One reason for this divergence is that large banks with \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL  \n12:10 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time  (11:10 A.M. Central Time)  on Thursday , October 8 , 2020 - OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n \n \n 8  \n more investment opportunities – and in part, with their CRE portfolio subject to annual stress \ntests that feature advers e scenarios for real estate – have chosen a smaller CRE portfolio relative \nto small er banks, where CRE lending is often the most straightforward collateralized lending for \nmany small and medium -sized businesses .  Over time more commercial real estate loans have \nmigrated to small and medium -sized banks.8 \nWhile banking data do not yet reflect significant problems in commercial real estate, \ngiven the forbearance  I mentioned  and the lagging nature of indicators , we can obtain  an \napproximation of likely problems from the  recent  equity performance of real estate investment \ntrusts.  These are companies that seek exposure to specific sectors of the commercial real estate \nmarket.  As Figure 6  shows, equity indices focused on two commercial real estate sectors – retail \nreal estate and hotel real estate are particularly depressed  since the pandemic hit .  For example,  \nthe hotels and resort s REIT ind ex is at about  50 percent of its pre-pandemic level.  I would add  \nthat many of the loans in bank portfolios are more likely to be smaller hotels and  retail strip \nmalls, which might have been even more adversely  impacted  by the pandemic  than their larger \npeers , given their lack of direct access to bond and equity markets .9   \nNote that travel and hotel firms  have been hurt by a variety of events  over the past 20 \nyears .  They were depressed after the September 11 , 2001  terrorist attacks, during the financial \ncrisis  of 2007 and 2008 , and now.  This is an industry where tail events should not be all that \nunexpected.  A highly levered hotel can be quite profitable during good times, but during a \nsevere economic downturn may face a significant  challenge to survive.   \nIt is worth noting that t he early 1990 s credit crunch, the financial crisis and Great \nRecession , and likely this pandemic -driven  recession  all provide  examples of the prominent  role \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL  \n12:10 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time  (11:10 A.M. Central Time)  on Thursday , October 8 , 2020 - OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n \n \n 9  \n real estate has played  as a headwind to recovery due to the losses incurred from real estate assets \nheld inside and outside  the banking sector.  Howe ver, when sectors regularly contribute to the \nseverity of downturns, one wonders whether  it is time to note that  reaching -for-yield behavior \nduring a low interest rate period may exacerbate a subsequent  economic downturn, to the \ndetriment of many people beyond the sector.   \n \nBuild -up in Leverage  \nFigure 7 shows  the build -up in nonfinancial corporate business debt relative to GDP.  \nBut for cyclical fluctuations when GDP fell in recessions, the extended low interest rate \nenvironment after the Great Recession help s explain why the leverage ratio rose over the past 10 \nyears.  Corporations increased their  leverage as the prevailing low interest rate environment \nprovide d more capac ity to take on debt.   \nHowever , in an economic downturn, greater leverage  – with its principal and interest \nrepayment demands – may prove problematic for firms, or by extension the economy.  This can \nresult in firms being forced into bankruptcy, which hurt s a wide range of stakeholders in addition \nto lenders and investors , including  customers, suppliers, and employees.  \nFigure 8 provides an example  involving  retailers.10  During normal times, retailers can \nhave a relatively predictable revenue stream.  This makes it attractive to increase debt, either by \nmanagement  decision  or as part of a  private equity acquisition.  However, when the unexpected \noccur s, as the pandemic  has shown , it can  interrupt firms ’ revenue stream s, forcing them  to slash \nemployment to continue meeting debt service requirements and survive.   The f igure shows the \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL  \n12:10 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time  (11:10 A.M. Central Time)  on Thursday , October 8 , 2020 - OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n \n \n 10  \n debt to EBITDA ratios for publicly held retailers with a default in 2020 (retailers whose \nfinancials are publicly available ).  As shown, most of these firm s have a debt  to EBITDA ratio \nthat would disqualify them from participation in the Federal Reserve’s Main Street Lending \nProgram  (where ratios of four  times adjusted EBITDA for loans with less security , and six times \nadjusted EBITDA  for loans with more security , represent the maximum allowed debt load) .   \nLeverage not permissible for a troubled borrower lending program, but standard for many \nretailers prior to the crisis, highlights that the significant build -up of leverage is a contributing \nfactor to the bankruptcies we have already seen  – unfortunately with more quite likely in the \ncoming months.  \n \nImplications  for Labor Markets  \nThe firm closures and layoffs associated with recessionary dynamics mean that debates \nabout corporate leverage involve  more than issues of  finance ; they involve the welfare of \nworkers .  The build -up in risks in commercial real estate , and leverage in the corporate sector , \nprior to the COVID -19 pandemic  are likely to result  in more bankruptcies and higher \nunemployment during this crisis than if less risk had been taken.   \nIf the costs for taking on the extra risk were borne only by investors knowingly taking \nthat risk, it might not be so problematic.  While less levered busi nesses still face disruptions in \nthe current environment, they will hopefully recover and rehire workers and re -engage with \nsuppliers and customers.  A leveraged business is more likely to declare bankruptcy, \npermanently severing its many formal and inform al contracts with customers, suppliers, and \nemployees.  The human toll can be immense.  \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL  \n12:10 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time  (11:10 A.M. Central Time)  on Thursday , October 8 , 2020 - OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n \n \n 11  \n Of course , large declines in employment in particular sectors of the economy can be \ncostly , and slow to recover from , because work ers need to not only find new work but also \npotentially must develop skills for working in a new occupation or  industry.   While this can \noccur with or without leverage contributing, clearly excessive leverage can exacerbate job losses \nfrom temporary demand sh ocks, and make the recovery process slower and more painful than it \nwould have been without the leverage.  \nFigure 9 shows that since the beginning of the year, the number of employees \npermanently unemployed has risen.  Figure 10 shows that long -duration une mployment is on the \nrise.  As the pandemic drags on much longer than originally hoped , the likelihood increases that \nmany job  losse s that firms and employees hoped would be temporary , become permanent.  This \nmakes it much more difficult , of course, for the economy  to return  to full employment . \nNot only does it take time for workers to get retrained and find jobs in new areas, but \nmany workers lose the will to continue looking for work.  Such discouragement effects could be  \nparticularly prevalent among second earners in a household , and people nearing retirement. We \ncan see this effect with a nother measure of slack in the labor force , the labor  force  participation \nrate, shown in Figure 11.  As people become discouraged with their prospects for employment, \nthey stop looking for work.  As more people are not employed and not looking for work , the \nlabor force participation rate declines.  The roughly 2 percent age-point  decline in the labor force \nparticipation rate indicates that  the labor market recovery may prove  challenging.   It is also \nnoteworthy that loss of jobs have been concentrated in industries that employ a significant \nnumber of wom en, and as schools continue to impacted by the pandemic, more women are \nleaving the labor force – possibly in part to address inadequate support for school -age children.  \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL  \n12:10 P.M.

As the figure shows, there ar e rising \ninfections in many parts of the country , including Wisconsin.   \nAddressing the public health crisis is the prerequisite for resolving the economic crisis .11  \nThe increases in infections  since March , which has already resulted in hundreds of thousands of \ndeaths  in the U.S. , also has dire economic consequences.  Firms and households are unlikely to \nresume pre -pandemic economic activity  and spending until the public health situation improves , \nand activities that require close social contact are less of a concern.   \n \nConcluding Observations  \nClearly a  deadly pandemic was bound to badly impact the economy.  However, I am \nsorry to say that the slow build -up of risk in the low-interest -rate environment that preceded the \ncurrent recession likely will make the economic recovery from the pandemic more difficult.   \nThe increased risk  build -up, such as the reach ing-for-yield  behavior  in commercial real \nestate or increased corporate leverage, make economic dow nturns including  this one more \nsevere.   These are issues that I and others spoke about quite extensively in the years before the \npandemic hit, in particular with respect to questions about the need for  accommodati ve interest  \nrates when the economy was doin g well , and the potential for a build -up of financial stability  \nrisks .12 \nIn the United States , we do not have a cohesive set of regulat ory and supervisory tools to  \nmoderate risk  build -ups.

The urgency of these topics is underlined by the fact that  the economic \nimpact of these downturns is disproporti onately borne by those who can least afford it.   \nThank you for inviting me to deliver the Marburg Memorial Lecture  today.   I wish you \ncontinued health during these challenging times , and look forward to the next time I can visit the \ngreat state of Wisconsin.  \n \n1 For more about the Marburg Memorial Lecture, see: https://www.marquette.edu/business/center -for-\napplied -economics/marburg -lecture.php  \n \n2 Workers in these sectors who have remained employed, or who have been r ecalled to previous jobs, also \nface a higher risk of job losses going forward, to the extent that the recovery in industries such as \nhospitality and entertainment proves sluggish as we head into the colder months.   \n \n3 Another troubling factor this time is the dropout rate of women from the labor force being greater than \nthe typical recession, likely because of the unequal burden sharing between husbands and wives of taking \ncare of children who are schooling at home.  \n \n4 Recessionary dynamics refers to when aggregate demand falls below production so that inventories rise. \nFirms start cutting back production, and laying off employees. In addition, since production exceeds \naggregate demand, inventories keep building for a while and firms have no incentive to invest, so \naggregate demand continues to fall as consumption (due to the increase in unemployment and the fall in \nincomes) and investment fall further.  \n \n  \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL  \n12:10 P.M.

See, for example, LinaLu, Matthew Pritsker, Andrei \nZlate, Kenechukwu Anadu, and Jim Bohn, “Reach for Yield by U.S. Public Pension Funds,” Federal \nReserve Bank of Boston, Supervisory Research and Analysis Working Papers 2019,Series 19 -2.Other \npapers have found reach -for-yield behavior in other investor type s, including insurance companies  \n \n6 By regulatory mandates I am referring to the requirements for GSE -insured mortgages that lenders allow \nhomeowners to defer mortgage payments . \n \n7 It is also the case that small businesses received significant short -term help from fiscal policy; aid that \nhas not been extended or increased as of yet.  \n \n8 It is worth noting, however, that smaller banks have less ability to diversify in some sectors.  \n \n9 For context, larger properties tend to be debt/equity financed rather than bank financed  – as is often the \ncase for smaller hotels and retail strip malls.  \n \n10 It is worth noting that the traditional retail sector writ large has been challenged  for a period of time, \ndue in part to the rise of online retail and the likes of Amazon.com .  \n \n11 For more discussion, see: Sept. 23, 2020 talk by Eric Rosengren entitled, The Economy’s Outlook, \nChallenges, and Way Forward  and also August 12, 2020 talk by Eric Rosengren entitled, The COVID -19 \nPandemic, the Economic Outlook, and the Main Street Lending Program .  \n \n12 For more discussion, see: Jan. 13, 2020 talk by Eric Rosengren entitled, The Economic Outlook – and \nTwo Risks to the Forecast that are Worth Watching.

M. U.S. Eastern Time  (3:10 P.M. GMT ) on Tuesday , November 10 , 2020 - OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n \n \n 1  \n Good morning – or good afternoon, depend ing on where you are tuning in today – and \nthank you for inviting me to join you  for the UBS European Virtual Conference .  I am happy to \nbe speaking during  a most interesting , and , unfortunately , challenging,  time for the world \neconomy.   \nBoth the United States and many European countries are currently at a place we had \nhoped we could avoid  – in the midst of a second wave of a deadly pandemic .  In Europe, many \ncountries have gone from modest restrictions to a “shutdown -light” model , to try to bend the \ncurve of COVID -19 cases , with the possibility that more severe shutdowns may be needed .  In \nthe U .S., the rise  in infections  is more recent, and the lack of central coordination has led to \ndivergent response s among states.  Some states have done  little, if anything , to restrict activity, \nwhile other states have taken a much more proactive public health stance.   \nOf course, offi cial policies and personal behavior can differ.  For example, some \nlocalities  chose to institute requirements for masks , but found enforcement too difficult .  Other \nplaces  opted for  a less conservative  public health response, yet people chose to limit their activity  \nand focus on self -preservation , staying at home even without being subject to government \nmandates.   \nLike many observers, I firmly believe that the path to righting the economy hinges on \nfirst getting the virus under con trol.  Without effective public health  policy, the virus will remain \nthe major source of economic  problems – despite fiscal and monetary authorities acting early on \nto try to moderate the  economic impact of the virus.  \nCOVID -19 is what economists would call a “tail event ,” meaning something in the \nlower-probability “tails” of a distribution of possible outcomes.   (Of course, some had predicted \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL  \n10:10 A. M. U.S. Eastern Time  (3:10 P.M. GMT ) on Tuesday , November 10 , 2020 - OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n \n \n 2  \n that viral pandemics would occur at some point, so it may be wrong to see it as an esp ecially \nsurprising tail event, or one especially unlikely to occur again).  The severity of a tail event can \nbe impacted  – positively or negatively – by many factors, not just the immediate fiscal and \nmonetary response s.  How well a country is positioned t o weather a tail event depends , \nimportantly , on the financial positioning of households, financial institutions, and firms  when \nthat tail event strikes .  So, while a worldwide pandemic happening precisely when it did could \nnot have been predicted,  it was c ertainly possible that  some  tail event  might occur that would  \ndisrupt the economy .   \nMy view is that t he possibility of such tail event s justifies , as pruden t, financial \npositioning to lessen the severity  of adverse economic shocks  – whether th ose positioning steps  \nare personal decisions, such as precautionary savings , or regulatory ones , such as bank capital \ncushions .  Those economies that go into a recession in more fragile financial condition are likely \nto experience amplified economic problems that could have been ameliorated with more \nproactive financial stability steps , taken in advance .  Of course, protection from adverse tail \nevents is not fre e, so to speak .  The behavior of economic agents is largely based on cost-benefit \ndecisions, often driven  by incentives and disincentives provided by policymakers.1   \nThe most recent  statement by the Federal Open Market Committee , or FOMC  – the \nFederal Reserve’s monetary policy -making body – indicates the committee’s intention to keep \ninterest rates at the current low level until the Fed’s 2 percent inflation target has been achieved.2  \nThis reflects concerns about  the below -target inflat ion rate experienced over the previous decade.  \nA potential cost of this policy , from my perspective, would be the incentives that low interest \nrates create for households and firms to take on more leverage and more risk.  In the United \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL  \n10:10 A. M. U.S. Eastern Time  (3:10 P.M. GMT ) on Tuesday , November 10 , 2020 - OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n \n \n 3  \n States, the corpora te sector was more leveraged in early 2020, at least by some measures, than at \nthe beginning of previous recessions.  Today , I will discuss the ramifications of low interest rate \npolicies, the impact on leverage, and the potential  consequences for a subseq uent economic \ndownturn – based on the U.S. experience in the current recession.  \nThis is an important time to focus on preventing the buildup of financial imbalances, \nbecause many central banks are considering modifying their reaction functions to prioritize \nachieving  certain elements of their mandates.  In the U nited States, that implies being more \nreluctan t than in previous recoveries to raise interest rates until we have achieved full \nemployment and 2 percent inflation.3   \nWhile I support achieving these two goals , I believe  it requires , in addition,  a more \nproactive supervisory and financial stability focus to prevent financial imbalances from \nratcheting up the  sever ity of  economic downturns.  In the United States , this is particularly \nproblematic , because legislation  formulated after the financial crisis  has not mandated a financial \nstability focus , but rather a too -big-to-fail focus , and the  regulatory tools  available to  the Fed  are \nmuch more limited than in many European and Asian countries.   \nI will also highlight in my remarks today that those segments of the labor market most \naffected  by amplified business cycles – when financial stability “guardrails ” are limited  – can be \npopulated by those  workers  who are most vulnerable and least able to adapt to the changed \neconomic environment .  That imbalanced human toll  is a bad outcome for democracy as well as \nthe economy.   \n \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL  \n10:10 A. M. U.S. Eastern Time  (3:10 P.M. GMT ) on Tuesday , November 10 , 2020 - OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n \n \n 4  \n The Current Situation  \nA healthy economy requires a healthy populace.  In both Europe and the United States , a \nfull recovery is not possible until the public health crisis has been addressed.  Figure 1  shows the \ndramatic differences across countries  in their experience with the virus .  On the horizontal axis is \na countr y’s share of the global population, and on the vertical axis is a countr y’s share of world \ndeaths from C OVID -19.  Countries above the dotted line are , given their population,  \noverrepresented in deaths caused by the virus, and those below the dotted line are \nunderrepresented  in virus deaths, given t heir population .4   \nWorth noting is that t wo panels are needed in the figure . On the left chart, the U .S. is so \ndisproportionately accounting for world C OVID -19 deaths  that it required  a separate scale  from \nthe right chart .  Unfortunately, several European countries also have a disproportionate ly high  \nnumber of deaths, including the United Kingdom, France, Spain , and Italy  – and have recently \nimposed new restrictions.   \nOn the other hand , Figure 1 shows there are countries that have done well  in managing \nthe virus , including New Zealand, Japan, and South Korea.  Even a  developing countr y, \nVietnam, is showing a disproportionately low share of COVID deaths given its share of the \nworld population, implying it s success  in controlling the virus.  \nObviously , the virus has  had severe  economic consequences, as shown in Figure 2 .  It is \nuseful to think about the virus’s effects in economies that disproportionately involve  services, \nwhich  tend to require more personal interaction than the production and sale of goods .  And, in \nfact, service  activities proved to be  more affected  by the need to social  distance than were  goods -\nproduc ing activities .  In the United States, consumption of goods now exceeds what was \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL  \n10:10 A. M. U.S. Eastern Time  (3:10 P.M. GMT ) on Tuesday , November 10 , 2020 - OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n \n \n 5  \n consumed at the beginning of the year, while services consumption remains depressed.  \nAmericans have continued remodeling houses  and buying durable goods , but things like \ntraveling and recreational activities outside of the home are taking place at a lower rate.  Thus , \nthe virus is a disproportionate shock for those countries  that are  more services dependent, such as \nthe U.S. , and most developed countries.  \n \nImpact of Economic Shocks  \nWhile the economic impact of C OVID -19 may fall disproportionately on service -oriented \neconomies  where the services require a lot of social interaction , other factors also are important \nin determining the severity of the pandemic’s  economic consequences .  As Figure 3  shows, the \nUnited States economy goes through cycles , with ups and downs of the unemployment rate  \nreflecting episodes of recessions and expansions .   \nThe f igure highlights two important points .  First, t he amplitude of the unemployment \nrate is currently quite high, as it was during the financial crisis of 2007 -2008 .  The second  point  \nworth noting is that the area on the chart where unemployment is above  the so -called full \nemployment  level  has been much la rger than the area involving unemployment below  the \nestimate of full employment.5  Part of the reason for this asymmetry is that much of the history \nof this sample reflected a disinflation ary trend  – inflation fell consistently from 1980 to 2004.  \nSeveral of th e instances  where the unemployment  rate bounced back up sharply were  recessions , \nresult ing from  attempts to control inflation.  But policymakers also cannot control the dynamics \nof the economy  all that precisely.  Thus, imbalances in one direction , say exceeding full \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL  \n10:10 A. M. U.S. Eastern Time  (3:10 P.M. GMT ) on Tuesday , November 10 , 2020 - OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n \n \n 6  \n employment to the point of excessively tight labor markets, tend to  result in a bounce back in \nunemployment above the natural rate.   \nIf policymakers  want to achieve  maximum sustainable employment, in my view the focus \nshould be less on pushing the economy well below full employment – which  helps produce  \nimbalances in the economy  that could also  affect  the severity of  the next recession .   \nSome imbalances are worse th an others.  Note  that in the recovery from the Financial \nCrisis and Great Recession , the U.S.  saw just over nine years  with the unemployment  rate above \nthe full employment  level , but just over three  years  of an unemployment rate  below its natural \nrate.  Instead  of pushing the unemployment rate below its natural rate , the focus should be  on \navoid ing the subsequent large spikes of unemployment and slow recovery that occur when the \ndownturn is  made worse by a lead -up that involv es excessive risk -taking  and the associated \nimbalances, both real and financial .6   \nAn additional  important factor in the severity of a downturn is the policy response.  \nFortunately, in the United States the initial policy response  to COVID -19 by monetary and fiscal \npolicymakers  was prompt and substantial.7  Unlike the beginning s of some  recession s when it  is \ninitially unclear whether the economy is in a downturn at the outset , the rapid increase in the  \nCOVID -19 virus, the economic shutdowns, and the sharp decline in asset prices made it \nimmediately clear to policymakers that swift action  was needed .   \nFiscal policy makers  moved quite quickly by historical standards in the U .S., with support \nfocused on small busin esses and low - and moderate -income workers.  Monetary policy was also \nimplemented  promptly .  In March,  the Federal Reserve reduced the federal funds rate to between \n0 and 25 basis points ( Figure 4 ) and began asset purchases ( Figure 5 ).  And a series of \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL  \n10:10 A. M. U.S. Eastern Time  (3:10 P.M. GMT ) on Tuesday , November 10 , 2020 - OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n \n \n 7  \n emergency lending facilities were announced that were designed  to stabilize financial markets \nand provide support for businesses.  This swift  action by policymakers has been critical to the \nimprovements in the economy  so far.  Now, with a se cond wave of infections  underway , my \nsense is that  more fiscal and monetary accommodation is appropriate.  \n \nFinancial Fragility  \nAnother  factor shaping the severity of this recession  – in other words, the severity of the \nconsequences of the pandemic shock – is how fragile , or susceptible to financial instability , the \neconomy was prior to the shock.  How well prepared were firms, households, and financial \ninstitutions for a so-called  tail event?  In the interest of time, t oday I will look  specifically  at the \npreparedness of firms.   \nAn examination of  payroll employment  by industry shows firms whose business  requir es \nsocial interaction continue to be  badly disrupted by the pandemic.  Figure 6  shows that retail, \narts and entertainment, restaurants, and hotels have all been severely  impacted.  While payroll \nemployment declined in these industries during the past recession, payroll employment declined \nmuch more substantially with the pandemic and remains well below levels from the previous \nyear.  \nThe large and enduring weakness in these sectors has other costs besides the loss of jobs \nin the short run.  Figure 7  shows a list of publicly traded firms in the  consumer discretionary \nspace that have defaulted on debt  (and/or filed for bankruptcy) in 2020 .8  Two observations stand \nout.  First, most of these firms had elevated leverage , as evidenced  by their most recently \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL  \n10:10 A. M. U.S. Eastern Time  (3:10 P.M.

In fact, most of the firms had debt  to EBITDA  too high to \nqualify for support through the Federal Reserve’s Main Street Lending  Program , a lending \nfacility designed to aid troubled firm s impacted by COVID -19, which requires a debt-to-\nEBITDA  ratio under six for collateralized loans.9  The s econd  observation is that these firms are \n“labor  intensive. ”  The consumer discretionary  sector accounts for significant employment, much \nof it relatively low -wage workers.   And, of course , bankruptcies tend to make temporarily \nunemployed workers into longer-term unemployed workers.  \nIt is important to note when  the high level of debt was incu rred.  If it was incurred right \nbefore the shock, the appropriate financial stability approach may be different than if it was \nincurred much earlier in the recovery.  Put another way, h ow has leverage in the corporate sector \nevolved over the years amid the  low interest rate environment, and what are the potential \nramifications of this trend?  This is an important question, which I will discuss next with some \npreliminary observations .   \nFigure 8  shows the median debt -to-EBITDA  ratio for (mostly publicly traded ) firms in \nthe consumer discretionary sector that defaulted (and/or filed for bankruptcy) in 2020 and those \nthat did not.  Interestingly, through 201 3 the median debt  to EBITDA  was around or below two \ntimes for the defaulted and the non -defaulted firms.  However, during the recovery period the \nmedian debt leverage of defaulted firms rose quite sharply, reaching  more than  eight  times  right \nbefore the recession  – while the non -defaulted firms had only a mild increased reliance on debt.  \nThe debt -to-EBITDA  measure can be affected  by firms with very low profitability.  \nFigure 9  shows the capacity to service debt had become impaired at defaulted firms, and Figure \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL  \n10:10 A. M. U.S. Eastern Time  (3:10 P.M. GMT ) on Tuesday , November 10 , 2020 - OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n \n \n 9  \n 10 shows that the debt -to-assets ratio, another measure of leverage,  began rising sharp ly in 2011.  \nAs a result, when the recovery had started , but interest rates were low, the firms that eventually \ndefaulted issued much more debt, and this increased leverage appears to have affected  their \nability to survive the pandemic  downturn .10 \n \nThe Impact of Excessive Risk-Taking  \nAs I discussed in a recent speech, t he financial pressures associated with excessive risk -\ntaking  behavior build gradually, and  usually  only become clear in the next economic downturn.  \nWhen the ensuing recession occurs  – often suddenly  – and more severe recessionary dynamics \ntake over, sadly the impact tends to be greatest on workers and firms that are least able to adjust \nand adapt.11      \nIndeed, for t he aforementioned defaulted firms , again, focused on the consumer \ndiscretionary sector, the debt began to rise about eight  years before the shock.  If the results  \nharmed  only shareholders, one could argue that they should be free to take that risk.  However, \nthe fact is that customers, supp liers, and employees are also hurt by risk -taking behavior .  Today, \nI will focus on the impact on employees.   \nFigure  11 shows the demographics of firms in the service sector.  A ratio above one \nindicates that the demographic group is overrepresented in that industry relative to its share in \nthe workforce.  Looking at the first row, women are overrepresented in the service s ector, \nrelative to their share in the work force .  Women are overrepresented in retail as well as in \nleisure and hospitality.  Note that Black  or African American workers , Hispanic or Latino  \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL  \n10:10 A. M. U.S. Eastern Time  (3:10 P.M. GMT ) on Tuesday , November 10 , 2020 - OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n \n \n 10  \n worker s, and  those workers between the ages 16 -24 years are over-represented in leisure and \nhospitality as well.   \nIn a bankruptcy situation, there normally is a reduction in workforce, and if it becomes a \nfirm closure , the employee ’s connection to the employer is severed.  As a result, a significant \nnumber of workers i n defaulted firms are likely to lose their job s, and when many firms in the \nindustry are simultaneously filing for bankruptcy, their ability to find work in the same industry  \nwill be  difficult.  \nDuring the pandemic, w omen and minorit ies may not only be disproportionately \nimpacted by excessive risk -taking by these firms, but they are more likely to leave the workforce \naltogether.  Figure 1 2 shows that the labor force participation rate for prime working -age women \nhad fallen sharply again in recent  months  and is well below the level at the beginning of the year.  \nOctober saw a slight  uptick in participation rates for both working -age men and women.  Figure \n13 shows that minorities also have  seen a large decline in labor force participation , relative to the \nbeginning of the year and relative to white  workers .  \n \nConcluding Observations  \nIn summary and conclusion, I would reiterate that shocks happen , but certain factors \nmake them worse .  While the m onetary and fiscal policy response  in the United States  has been \nan important economic mitigant to problems generated by the pandemic  since the onset this \nspring , excessive risk -taking during the previous recovery period is , unfortunately,  likely to \nprolong the country’s economic distress  – especially for those most disproportionately affected .    \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL  \n10:10 A. M. U.S. Eastern Time  (3:10 P.M. GMT ) on Tuesday , November 10 , 2020 - OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n \n \n 11  \n Financial factors , including excessive leverage,  can influence how severe the \nconsequences of a shock will be, and how painful a recession become s.  Imbalances in the real \neconomy and financial factors accelerating  recession dynamics can make the effects of a shock \nand the severity of a recession  much worse .  Today , I have focused on the excessive risk -taking \nof some firms in the consumer discretio nary sector.  However, imbalances in the household and \nfinancial sector have often been problematic, as well – particularly in the Financial Crisis and \nGreat Recession . \nThese observations have policy implications.  In Europe  and Asia , many countries have a \ngovernance structure able to focus on the financial stability imbalances that are occurring in their \neconom ies, and those countries have tools to try to prevent the bui ldup of excessive risk.  No \nsuch structure or tools are available in the U .S.  This is a problem , both now and for future \neconomic downturns.  \nWith many central banks focused on keeping interest  rates low for an extended period to \nachieve their mandates  – for example in the last recovery – it is particularly important to watch  \nfor reach ing-for-yield behavior and excessive risk -taking.  Easy monetary policy requires more \nguardrails  protecting against rising financial stability  risks .  Without financial stability \ngovernance and tools, recessions have the potential to be more severe and  fall disproportionately \non those that can least afford it.   And t he recessions are likely to be deeper and longer , requir ing \nmore fiscal and monetary stimulus than would otherwise be necessary .   \nIn sum: We need to place more attention on the severity  of outcomes in recessions, which \nare made worse if we cannot or will not take action against emerging imbalances.   \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL  \n10:10 A.

Rosengren, entitled: The Main Street Lending Program \nand Other Federal Reserve Actions .  \n \n8 It is worth noting, as I have in prior talks, that the traditional retail sector writ large has been challenged prior to \nCOVID -19, due in part to the rise of online retail and firms like Amazon.com.  \n \n9 For mor e on the Federal Reserve’s Main Street Lending Program, see https://www.bostonfed.org/mslp .  \n \n10 These analysis are descriptive and, therefore, do not suggest causality, nor control for firm -specific characteri stics.  \nAs previously noted, the analysis is preliminary and based on work being conducted by FRB Boston staff.  \n \n11 And if workers and firms are less able to adjust and adapt, that makes the recession more severe.

Eastern Time on  \nWednesday, January 9, 2019 OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \nThe views expressed today are my own, not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal Reserve Board of \nGovernors or the Federal Open Market Committee.    \n   \n \n   \n \n“Perspectives on Monetary Policy  \nand Market Volatility ” \n \n \nEric S. Rosengren  \nPresident & Chief Executive Officer  \nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston  \n \n \nThe Boston Economic Club  \n \n \nBoston, Massachusetts  \nJanuary 9, 2019  \n \n \n \n\n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 11:30 A.M. on Wednesday, January 9, 201 9 U.S. Eastern Time, OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n1 \n  \nGood morning.  It is a pleasure  to welcome  the Boston Economic Club to the Federal \nReserve Bank  of Boston , and to be joined by many of  the Bank’s staff members as well.  Early \nJanuary is a good time to assess the economy’s recent performance, its fundamentals, its outlook, \nand the forces that may impact it over the year ahead.   \nAs everyone knows, the past several months have seen a good deal of financial mark et \nvolatility.  From the beginning  of October to the end of December , the Dow Jones Industrial \nAverage fell 12.5 percent , and the S&P 500 index  fell 14.3 percent.  However, over the full year \nthe same indices declined  a smaller  6.0 percent and 7.0 percent , respectively .  Furthermore, o ne \nmeasure of stock marke t volatility, the Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index – or \nVIX – ended December well above its historical average , at 25.4 .  In addition, the rate on  10-\nyear Treasury notes,  which had  reached a high of 3.2 4 percent, finished December  trading below \n2.7 percent .   \n The decline in stock prices has certainly caught the attention of investors .  It constitutes a  \ntighten ing of  current  financial conditions, given the decrease in the value of these assets , and \ncould portend a decline in future economic growth.  I n that scenario , there might be less need – \nor even no need – for further tightening  of monetary policy by the Federal Reserve .   \nHowever, a critical issue is whether financial market  sentiment is  too pessimistic, too \noptimistic, or about right.  After all,  we know that financial markets can, and do, reverse \nthemselves.  This could happen  if it turns out that late last year many investors had become  \noverly pessimistic about  potential risks to the economic outlook.  If the economy continue s to be \nresilient, one might expect financial markets to reprice if it becomes  clear that risks ha d been \noverstated.  \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 11:30 A.M. on Wednesday, January 9, 201 9 U.S. Eastern Time, OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n2 \n  Indeed,  I personally suspect that financial mar ket sentiment  may have become unduly \npessimistic.  I recognize that the risk of a U.S. economic slowdown, led by weakness abroad, has \nincreased.  But m onetary policy remains accommodative, as does fiscal policy.  Economic \ngrowth was quite strong in 2018 , and some of th at strength is likely to carry forward.  \nFurthermore, the engine behind  the good growth level in 2018 was the consumer.  There are \nmany reasons to believe the consumer is still engaged and willing to spend  – employment growth \nremains strong,  wage growth rates are rising,  the savings rate is high, and consum er confidence \nremains high by historical standards .   \n However, I do view the current economic outlook as being quite uncertain.  Even at the \nbest of times, it is difficult to navigate soft  landings for the economy.  Recent data from China ’s \neconomy , the potential for increased trade tensions, and heightened volatility all coun sel for \npolicy to be both flexible and patient.  My baseline forecast still assumes growth somewhat \nabove potential , and some modest declines in the unemployment rate over this year.  \nNonetheless, I am sensitive to the heightened risks, and believe that policy is currently \nappropriately balancing risks.  Should these risks materialize and significantly impact the \neconom y, resulting  in an economic slowdown  – which is not my baseline forecast – policy would \nneed to recalibrate for that less -favorable environment.  But a t this juncture, w ith two very \ndifferent scenarios  – economic slowdown implied by financial markets ; or growth  somewhat \nabove potential GDP growth , consistent with economic forecasts  – I believe we can wait for \ngreater clarity before adjusting policy .   \n With that as introduction, I  would like to  preview my remarks to day.  I will begin by \nproviding some noteworthy  context to recent financial -market movements.  I will then examine \nwhether  these market movements have altered  the predictions of  private -sector forecasters.  I will \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 11:30 A.M. on Wednesday, January 9, 201 9 U.S. Eastern Time, OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n3 \n then discuss  how these private -sector  forecasts compare to th e forecasts made by Federal \nReserve policymakers  at the December 2018  Federal Open Market Committee  (FOMC) meeting.  \nFinally, I will explain  why my own assessment is closer to the relative optimism of many  \neconomi c forecasters th an it is to  the more pessimistic outlook suggested  by recent declines in \nfinancial markets.  \nAt the same time, I will hasten to add that the market’s effect of tightening financial \nconditions  – coupled with the uncertainty in forecast s – make it imperative that monetary policy \nshould be data depe ndent .  By this I mean that there should be no particular bias toward raising \nor lowering rates until the data more c learly indicate the path for  domestic and international \neconomic growth.  \n \nRecent Financial Market Movements , in Context  \n Figure 1  shows the yield on the  benchmark  10-year Treasury note over the past three \nyears.  For much of that period, the 10 -year rate was rising gradually, reflecting a str engthening  \nU.S. economy, inflation nearing the Federal Reserve’s  2 percent target , and gradu al tightening of \nmonetary policy.  While the 10 -year rate had risen to 3.2 4 percent in November  of 2018 , it fell \nappreciably in December , and is currently trading around  2.7 percent.   \n Figure 2  shows a similar pattern  prevailing in stock prices over the last three years .  The \nstock market rose from early in 2016 until the beginning of 2018, when  the Dow Jones Industrial \nAverage and the S&P 500 index both fell – before rising in the summer of 2018 and then falling \nsigni ficantly over the past several months.  Still, d espite the se recent declines, stock prices \nremain well above where they were t hree years ago.  \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 11:30 A.M. on Wednesday, January 9, 201 9 U.S. Eastern Time, OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n4 \n  Figure 3  shows the volatility index for stocks, the VIX.  As unsettling as the  recent \ndeclines  have been, the increased volatility  in the stock market  – with daily market swings  of \nmore than 1 percent  – has become increasingly common of late . This highlights that many \ninvestors  are quite uncertain about the outlook, and markets are particularly sen sitive to new \ninformation.  \n Figure 4  shows the price of oil.  Oil prices have also been increasing over the past three \nyears , as demand outstripped supply, in part because of a tightening in supply by OPEC .  Earlier \nthis year, the p rice of oil  exceed ed $75 a barrel , but more recently it has  declined sharply , to the \nmid-50s per barrel . \n Looking beyond U.S. financial markets, Figure 5  shows stock market performance in \nJapan, Europe, and China  along with  the U.S .  What we see is that d espite the declines in U .S. \nstocks  recently, U .S. stock prices have fared significantly better than many foreign stock -price \nindices.  Of the four, the U.S. S&P 500 index  remains the furthest above its level at the start of \n2016.  By comparison , the o ther regions’  stock indices ro se less in 2016, leveled off in 2017, and \ndeclined in 2018.  Among these four stock indices, Chinese stocks have fallen the most  – likely \nbecause  the Chinese economy has been slowing, financial stability concerns have risen, and \nChina has been the country most involved with and impacted by  trade policy  changes with the \nU.S. \n In summary, clearly financial markets ended 2018  on a sour note.  U .S. stock indices \nhave performed better than many foreign counterparts , but were  down 6  to 7 percent over the \nyear – and the decline and the increased volatility have understandably raised concerns about the \ndurability of the economic recovery.  However , at least to date, the economic data and the \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 11:30 A.M. on Wednesday, January 9, 201 9 U.S. Eastern Time, OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n5 \n outlook of forecasters ha ve both been more optimistic than recent financia l market movements \nmight indicate.  \n \nEffects on Economic Forecasters ’ Outlook  \nWhile economics is sometimes referred to as the dismal science, at present economic \nforecasters seem to have a more optimistic outlook than the sentiment suggested by recent \nfinancial market movements.  \n Figure 6  provides the Blue Chip forecast, as of December 10, for real GDP growth over \n2019.  The Blue Chip forecast is a compilation of the outlooks of roughly 50 private forecasters, \nwith the solid line reflecting the average of those forecasts, and the dotted lines reflecting the \naverage of the 10 highest forecasts and the average of the 10 lowest forecast s.  The consensus is \nfor growth slower than last year, but averaging more than 2 percent over next year.   In addition, \neven the  Blue Chip’s  average of the 10 lowest forecasts does not expect any quarter next year to \nbe negative.   \n Figure 7 provides the Blue Chip forecast for the unemployment rate over 2019.  The \nconsensus forecast is for the unemployment rate to drift down t o 3.5 percent by the end of this \nyear.  In addition,  the average of the 10 highest forecasts do es not expect the unemployment rate \nto rise above 4 percent in any quarter this year.  \n One likely reason for th e forecasters’  low assessment of the probability of negative real \nGDP growth , or significantly higher unemployment , is the strength of consumer spending.  \nFigure 8 shows that o ther than in the first quarter of 2018,  consumer s have increased their \npurchases of goods and services by more th an 3 percent over the past year.   \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 11:30 A.M. on Wednesday, January 9, 201 9 U.S. Eastern Time, OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n6 \n I would note also that m ost forecasters expect the last quarter of 2018 to end up proving \nto have been strong  for consumer spending .  This would reflect the strong growth in income and \nemployment , and the fact  that house values continue to rise.  \n Figure 9 shows the consumer confidence index  as published by the Conference Board .  \nWhile the index remains quite high, there was a decline in December as consumers became more \ncautious  – presumably because of recent f inancial market movements.1   \n Turning to  labor market conditions, Figure 1 0 shows the monthly change in U.S. payroll \nemployment.  Payroll employment gr ew by around 312,000 in December  and averaged 220,000 \nper month in 2018.   This is much higher than the roughly 100,000 jobs necessary for the \nunemployment rate to merely  remain flat , and much stronger than most forecasters had expected.   \nAll this is consistent with a very robust labor market.  \n Figure 1 1 shows that filings for initial claims for unemploymen t are still trending down, \nand below the levels we have seen over  most of  the past three years.  In fact, initial claims for \nunemployment insurance remain fairly close to 50 -year lows.  \n \nFOMC Members’  Outlook s \n Participants in  the FOMC,2 the U.S. monetary policy  decision -making body , also provide \ntheir economic forecasts on a quarterly basis , in the Summary of Economic Projections or SEP .  \nFigure 1 2 shows the forecast s of FOMC participants for real GDP over the next several years.  \nFor 2019 , FOMC participants ’ median forecast was for growth above 2 percent, with the central \ntendency also above 2 percent.3  Given my  1.8 percent  estimate of the economy’s “ potential ” \ngrowth rate , a forecast of above 2 percent  growth would be consistent with further declines in the \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 11:30 A.M. on Wednesday, January 9, 201 9 U.S. Eastern Time, OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n7 \n unemployment rate.  I should n ote that every  FOMC participant  in the central tendency  \nanticipated  real GDP growth remaining at or above 1 .5 percent through 2021.  \n Consistent with the forecast for real GDP gr owth, Figure 1 3 shows the median \nunemployment rate expected by FOMC participants and the central tendency.  The median for \nthe fourth quarter of  2019 is 3.5 percent , which is below the current level. The chart shows it  \nrising somewhat thereaft er.  I would also note that  in the SEP , for the unemployment rate \nforecast the central tendency  is quite similar to the median  forecast . \n In terms of inflation, the FOMC median forecast  was a bit below 2 percent for 2019 , but \nsomewhat above 2 percent thereafter , as sho wn in Figure 1 4.  Thus , FOMC participants expect \ninflation to remain quite near their  symmetri c inflation target of 2 percent.  \n \nConcluding Observations  \n My own view is that the economic outlook is actually brighter than the outlook one might \ninfer from recent financial -market movements .  I expect real growth over 2019  to remain solid \nenough to tighten the U.S. labor market  somewhat.  My views are therefore close r to the \noptimism reflected  by many professional forecasters and the FOMC  members of late , than they \nare to  the recent pessimism in financial markets.  \n Nonetheless, financial market volatility reflect s a perception of heightened risks.  \nConcerns with global growth, international trade, and geopolitical upheaval are important to take \ninto account, and serve as a prudent  warning that actual economic outcomes could diverge \nsignificantly from what is being forecast.  \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 11:30 A.M. on Wednesday, January 9, 201 9 U.S. Eastern Time, OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n8 \n  I will close by returning to the implications of all this for the Federal Reserve’s monetary \npolicymaking.  Today , we have explored the c ontrast of relatively optimistic economic forecasts \nand the pessimism reflected of late  by financial market participants .  This contrast , if nothing \nelse, highlights why monetary policy should not be on a set course , but rather  should take into \naccount and  reflect how real economic data unfold.   \nTo that end, if  the pessimism evident in financial markets eventually shows through to \neconomic outcomes, there would be less need (and perhaps no need) for further increases in \ninterest rates.   However, my current expectation is that the  more optimistic view will prevail, \nwith economic outcomes  consistent with the more upbeat forecasts (and stock markets perhaps \nrebounding ).  Yet given the reduced  certainty I have about my forecast – in light of  the slowing \nabroad and volatile financial markets  – in my view , the appropriate stance for monetary policy is , \nfor now , to not have a bias on moving policy in either direction until there is greater clarity \naround economic trends here and abroad.  The Fed eral Reserve’s current m onetary policy seems \nappropriate for now, and can  patiently observe future economic developments.  \n Thank you.   \n  \n1 Note that the University of Michigan ’s Index of Consumer Sentiment did not see a decline in December. See more \nhere: http://www.sca.isr.umich.edu/ .   \n \n2 FOMC participants include Federal Reserve governors and Federal Reserve Bank presidents.  Not all presidents \nare voting members in each year but all presidents submit forecasts.    \n \n3 The median forecast is the middle projection when the projections are ar ranged from lowest to highest. When the \nnumber of projections is even, the median is the average of the two middle projections.  The central tendency \nexcludes the three highest and three lowest projections for each variable in each year.

It is a pleasure to be with  the New England chapter of the National \nAssociation of Corporate Directors .  I’d like to especially acknowledge and thank one of your \nmembers, Cathy Minehan, who was my predecessor as president of the Federal Reserve Bank of \nBoston, and helped make this event  possible.  \nAs corporate directors, you as sess the plans and forecasts of  the organizations you \noversee – and also grap ple with the risks inherent in those plans, and how th ose risks can be \nmanaged.  In something of a parallel, I will talk today not only about the outlook for the \neconomy, but also the risks to that outlook – and how the Federal Reserve is taking those risks \ninto account as it executes monetary policy.  \nToday I plan to share my outlook for the econom y with you, as well as the implications \nthat outlook has for the Fed’s policymaking , in my view .  In order to look ahead, however, I \nthink it is important to begin by reflect ing on the economy at the end of last year, in the fourth \nquarter.  \n  I won’t need to remind you that t he fourth quarter of  2018 featured  a series of  problem s – \nsome  realized, some potential – that affect ed financial market s.  Domestic and international stock \nindices  fell, stock volatility rose, oil prices fell, l ong Treasury rates fell , and credit spreads \nwidened.  These asset price movements  – along with the partial government shutdown, trade \nconcerns,  and declines in consumer sentiment – likely contributed to much weaker than expected \nDecember retail sales.   The constellation of financial- market movements also caused some \nanalysts to highlight  recession proba bilities , and the heightened risk of a more pronounced \nslowdown for the global economy .  \n\n EMBARGOED UNTIL 7:35 A.M. on Tuesday, March 5 , 2019 U.S. Eastern Time, OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n2 \n After the calendar t urned to 2019, many financial markets  recovered smartly , and \nCongress and the Administration reached a  budget agreement that avoided an extended \nshutdown.  These developments  appear to h ave alleviated  some of the more  pronounced \nconcerns . \nHowever, many of the underlying global growth issues  that generated the recent spate of \nfinancial -market concerns  are as yet unresolved.  These issues include  slowing growth in China \nand Europe, constraints on international trade, the potential for Brexit- generated challenges,  and \nproblems at some  European banks – all issues that could weigh on an already -slowing economy .  \nThese conditions , together , provide ample justification for focus ing on prudent risk managem ent \nwhen setting monetary policy.  \nMy view , as I will discuss today, is that the most likely outcome for 2019 is relatively \nhealthy  U.S. economic  growth somewhat above 2 percent over  the course of the year, with \ninflation very close to Fed policymakers’  2 percent target , and a U.S. labor market  that continues \nto tighten somewhat .  All in all, a relatively strong forecast .  \nHowever, policymakers cannot place complete faith in what they believe is the most \nlikely outcome .  So the Federal Reserve must take into account key r isks to the forecast , and \ndevelop a strategy for managing those risks .   \nObviously one such risk involves the economy’s grow th rate, both at home and abroad.  \nDomestic g rowth somewhat above  2 percent , as I anticipate, would be a slowdown relative to the \nroughly  3 percent growth of last year , although still somewhat above my estimate of the \neconomy’s so- called potential growth  rate.1  The modest slowing from last year’s rate would be \ndue to the  diminishing  fiscal stimulus from earlier policies , and the effects  of four increases in \n\n EMBARGOED UNTIL 7:35 A.M. on Tuesday, March 5 , 2019 U.S. Eastern Time, OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n3 \n short -term interest rate s last year.   Those effects are built into my forecast  for a growth rate \nsomewhat above 2 percent – which  would still be sufficient to bring additional improvements to \nlabor markets , without much risk of higher inflation.  In that sense, it would be a very welcome \noutcome.  But there i s some  risk that more pronounced slowdowns in the rest of the world could \ndampen U.S. growth more than I am forecastin g.   \nOn the other hand, earlier concerns  that the economy might overheat in a number of ways \nseem somewhat less pressing  at this juncture .  Given the growth outlook, I  expect i nflation to  end \n2019 close to the Federal Reserve’s  2 percent target .  And s ome financial stability risks have \nbeen reduce d, as recent  financial market volatility  has tempered investor ebullience .  So, in my \nview,  there is less reason to fear overheating, and somewhat greater risks to the outlook – and \ntogether these factors are sufficient to justify a pause in the recent monetary tightening cycle.  I \nwould a dd to these factors one more – the  difficulties in interpreting the  trajectory of the \neconomy due to delays in economic data, caused by the partial government shutdown. \nAltogether, it is a good time for policymakers to  be patient , taking the time to evaluate  the risks \nI’ve outlined, as well as the underlying strength of the economy.  \nOverall , my message today is positive.   In my view , the U.S.  economy will likely grow \nfast enough to cause further tighten ing in labor markets .  Financial markets have stabil ized, and \nstock  prices have recovered from their December lows.   Concerns  about  government shutdowns \nare diminished , and there appears to be more optimism relative to trade disputes .  While labor \nmarkets are tight and wage pressures are rising, inflation is so far quite  well behaved .  This \nmeans  that, in the face of heig htened risks, policymakers can be patient , waiting to see additional \nincoming data  to better discern  the direction of the economy before taking any further monetary \n\n EMBARGOED UNTIL 7:35 A.M. on Tuesday, March 5 , 2019 U.S. Eastern Time, OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n4 \n policy action.  This is the essence of the prudent risk management in policymaking that is my \ntheme today.  \n \nFinancial M arkets – R ecovery from  the Fourth Q uarter  \n With that summary and overview, let  me now walk you through the data that underpins \nmy views.  \n Figure 1  shows the movement  of two domestic stock indices  – the Dow Jones 30 \nIndustrials  and the S&P 500 – since the beginning of 2018.  The indices showed no particular \ntrend in the first half of 2018 before rising  in the third quarter, and then rather sharp ly declin ing \nin the fourth quarter.  S tock prices  declined  approximately 15 percent  from the ir peak to the \nDecember lows .  However, there has been a significant recovery since the December holiday \nweek, with the stock indices  now exceeding their  level s at the start of 2018.   \n Figure 2  highlights that the stock market declines were a global phenomen on.  \nInternational  stock  indices  all swooned in the fourth quarter  (or earlier, in the case of China) .  \nBut unlike U.S. stocks they remain well below ( roughly 10 percent below ) their levels at  the \nbeginning of 2018.  The declin es sparked concerns that both the Europe an and Chi nese \neconomies might be slowing down more than anticipated.   \n Global  and domestic  slowdown concerns also resulted in significant  stock volatility  at the \nend of 2018, as shown in Figure 3 .  You may recall that there was a similar spike  in volatility at \nthe beginning  of 2018, stemming at least in part from  similar concerns  over  slower global \n\n EMBARGOED UNTIL 7:35 A.M. on Tuesday, March 5 , 2019 U.S. Eastern Time, OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n5 \n growth , including  slowing in China and other emerging markets.  As stocks have improved since \nthe beginning of this year, the volatility has subsided. \n While there is evidence of recovery in domestic and global stock indices, accompanied \nby a reduction in volatility, d ebt markets have not recovered to the same degree.   Figure 4  shows  \nthat the 10- year U.S. Treasury rate is about  50 basis points lower than its recent peak in the fall.  \nInvestors tend to move into l onger -term Treasury securities when they are concerned with global \nrisks  – in part, what many call a  “flight  to quality. ”  This increase in demand for Treasuries raises \ntheir price and lowers their yield.   One possible way  to interpret the fall in 10 - year Treasury \nrates is as a response by some investors who choose to use longer -term Treasury securitie s as a \nhedge against global risks , possibly  suggesting lingering  concern with downside risk, at least in \nthe bond markets .  \nFigure 5  shows two common measures of the slope of the yield curve.  The most \ncommonly used measure, the spread representing the 10- year Treasury rate mi nus the 2- year \nTreasury rate, declined significantly over 2018 – as the Federal Reserve raised short -term rates \nand as Treasury security rates declined .  A second measure of the yield curve studied by \nEngstrom and Sharpe (2018)2 looks at the implied forward yield on a three -month Treasury bill \nsix quarters  ahead , minus the yield on a current three- month bill.   By focusing  on the near -term \npath of interest rates rather than a 10 -year horizon, this measure  may  reflect the  market ’s \nassessment of whether near -term monetary policy may  tighten or ease.   The decline in this \nshorter yield curve measure is consistent with increased assessments of risk  by many investors, \nas well as the Federal Reserve’s recent willingness to be patient in light of those increased risk \nconcerns . \n\n EMBARGOED UNTIL 7:35 A.M. on Tuesday, March 5 , 2019 U.S. Eastern Time, OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n6 \n  Figure 6  shows that risks are also being priced in to credit spreads.   The spread  between  \nhigh-yield corporate bonds and 10- year U.S. Treasuries rose significantly at the end of 2018.  \nThis spread is important because it reflects a perception that corporate default risks  have \nincreased .  These risks might be most acute if investors thought that the probabi lity of a more \nsignificant economic slowdown had increased .  There has been some reversal of this increase \nsince the beginning of th e year,  but high -yield rate spreads remain higher than levels seen for \nmuch of 2018.  \nFigure 7  shows U.S. debt markets aren’t the only place where concerns about slowing \nglobal growth are surfacing .  Yields on 10- year German government bonds  have declined from \ntheir already low levels , potentially reflecting some flight to quality within Europe .  In contrast, \nItalian 10 -year government bond yield s have risen significantly, as investors require a higher  risk \npremium for Italian debt, likely react ing to the risk that global and European slowing  will \nweaken Italy’s economy and its government’s ability to meet its debt obligations . \nOverall, markets are still pricing in somewhat elevated  risk, even as some o f the concerns \nfrom the end of last year seem to have subsided somewhat .  U.S. stock markets have partially \nrecovered and stock volatility is lower, but foreign stocks and all debt markets are still priced as \nif there are heightened risks.  These heightened risks are another reason why patience in  \nmonetary policy is appropriate at this time.  \n \n \n \n\n EMBARGOED UNTIL 7:35 A.M. on Tuesday, March 5 , 2019 U.S. Eastern Time, OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n7 \n The Most Likely  Outlook  for the Economy  \n While downside risks are elevated, it is important not to lose sight of the modal forecast, \nthat is, the most likely outcome forecasters see for the economy.  Figure 8  shows the February \n10th Blue Chip Forecast, encompassing approximately 50 private -sector economists ’ forecast s for \nreal GDP over 2019.  The solid  line shows the average of the forecasts for real GDP.  These  \nprivate forecasts a re not anticipating a significant slowdown – with GDP growing somewhat \nabove 2 percent over the year.  Even the average of the 10 lowest forecasts does not show  a sharp \nslowdown, with growth over the year somewhat above 1.5 percent.   \n If growth exceeds 2 percent , as in the consensus  forecast , labor markets would be \nexpected to tighten further.   Figure 9  shows unemployment rate by race and ethnicity  – and each \nmeasure is  quite low by historical standards.  One  of the advantage s of such low unemployment \nrates  is that additional members of racial and ethnic groups that have tend ed to have high er \nunemployment rates are drawn into the labor market.  \nFigure 10  shows that in itial claims for unemployment remain quite low.   This suggests  \nthat employers are loathe to lay  off workers in an environment where finding new hire s could be \nchallenging.  \n Despite the clear benefits to  having a tight labor market, we have to keep in mind that \nthere are costs when  a labor market becomes too tight.   I will explore  this possibility in  my next \nfew charts.  \n  Figure 11  depicts the so -called quits r ate – the number of people who voluntarily leave \ntheir job as a share of total employmen t.  Voluntary job- leavers  do not qualify for unemployment \n\n EMBARGOED UNTIL 7:35 A.M. on Tuesday, March 5 , 2019 U.S. Eastern Time, OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n8 \n insurance  – so t he higher quit s rates  reflect worker s’ confidence that they will quickly find \nalternative employment if they leave a job .  But it is also a sign of emerging wage pressures . \nWorkers are likely voluntarily leaving jobs because other employers offer higher wages .  As \nworkers move to higher -paying jobs, the effect on wages can cascade through firms who lose as \nwell as gain employees.   The employer gaining a worker may face pressure to offer his or her  \ncurrent workforce the new (higher) market  wage , and the former employer will need to offer the \nhigher  market wage to attract a new worker to the position , which may also affect prevailing \nwages for the employer’s  workforce . \n To clarify, I am not suggesting  that wage growth is a problem per se.  On the contrary, I \nwant to see wage growth – particularly if it is a result of improved productivity.  B ut wage \ngrow th that drives inflation significantly above target would be a problem.  Again, we want to \nconsider the risk of the labor market becoming too  tight, given the downsides to that happening.  \nThe Federal Reserve’s dual mandate from Congress encompasses not just maximum sustainable \nemployment, but also stable prices.   \n Figure 12  shows that there has indeed been upward momentum in wages.  Both average \nhourly earnings and the  employment cost index  have been rising.   At current rates of increase, \nwage growth  roughly reflect s worker  compensation for their increased efficiency (productivity \ngrowth, about 1 percent) plus the increased cost of living ( inflation , about 2 percent) .  However,  \nif wages were to continue  to accelerate without a pickup in productivity , some of the increase in  \nwage cost s would be reflected in smaller profit margins or higher prices.  \n\n EMBARGOED UNTIL 7:35 A.M. on Tuesday, March 5 , 2019 U.S. Eastern Time, OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n9 \n  In Figure 13, we see wages trending up in several industries that tend to have lower -\nskilled workers .  This is good for employees , but highlights the p ressure that tight labor markets \nplace on some businesses.  \nFigure 14  shows that, to date, rising wages have  not placed significant pressure on \nprices , perhaps because most firms have significant profit margins to absorb any cost increases .  \nIn particular, core inflation remains just below the Federal Reserve’s  2 percent target, while total \nPCE inflation has fal len below 2 percent , largely  a result of lower oil prices .  Declines in oil \nprices could have longer -lasting effects on the level  of prices, but should have only temporary \neffects on inflation  (i.e., the rate of change) . \nTo further parse inflation  readings , Figure 15  shows that the 2 percent overall inflation \nrate reflects the combination of services  price increases of over  2 percent  with the more volatile \ngoods  prices that mostly fell from 2013 through 2016, and ha d risen significantly more slowly \nthan services of late.  While g oods prices did ris e much more slow ly than services, there had \nbeen a recent  increase, which at least partly reflect ed the impact that tariffs may be having on \ntraded goods  prices .  Goods prices declined slightly in December.   \n \nConcluding Observations  \n While  the modal forecast for the economy is consistent with growth s lightly above 2 \npercent, inflation close to target, and  some further tightening of labor markets , the risks to th at \noutlook have increased recently .  In my view, c urrent mone tary policy needs to balance this  \nrelatively benign forecast with the increased downside risks that are reflected in asset prices .  \n\n EMBARGOED UNTIL 7:35 A.M. on Tuesday, March 5 , 2019 U.S. Eastern Time, OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n10 \n  I will reiterate that while there has been some recovery in equity prices , financial markets \noverall continue to pric e in downside risks to the economy.  This is most obvious in longer \nTreasury rates and wider credit spreads , consistent with the ongoing risks posed by slower global \ngrowth.   While incoming data are still delayed because of the partial government shutdown, there \nis some indication in the December retail sales data that the economy may be slowing a bit faster \nthan policymakers  anticipated.  \nIt could be that asset -price declines,  government shutdowns, and challenges in reachin g \ntrade agreements  were the source of slowing in the real economy  at the end of last year .  Or it \ncould be that asset price weakness reflected the perception that the economy was slowing, \nparticularly in the face of rising interest rates.   It remains to be seen whether the few signs of \nweakness at the turn of the year reflect an underlying slowdown in the economy, or a response to \na variety of temporary concerns that may fade . \nIt may be several  meetings  of the Federal Open Market Committee before Fed \npolicymakers  have a clear er read on whether the risks are becoming reality  – and  by how much \nthe economy will slow compared to last year.   With less ebullience in financial markets and no \nimmediate signs of inflationary pressures, patient ly watch ing to see how the economy develops  \nis the appropriate policy for now, and represents prudent management of risks to the forecast . \nThank you.  \n \n1 Growth above the economy’s “potential” rate of growth, which I estimate to be 1.8  percent, would typically push \ndown unemployment.  \n \n2 See https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/feds/files/2018055pap.pdf",

It is a pleasure to be in Hong Kong for the Credit Suisse Asian \nInvestment Conference.  \nMy colleagues and I spend a fair amount of time talking to members of the public about \nthe economic analysis that goes into monetary policy making .  We spend somewhat less time \ntalking about the tools we will use to attain our economic goals.  And t o date we have s pent \nrelatively little time speaking in detail about one of those tools, the Fed eral Reserve ’s balance \nsheet  – that is, the assets  the U.S. central bank  is holding  and liabilities  and capital used to \nfinance those assets .1  It is an admittedly  complicated topic, but one  that needs more explanation .  \nThe balance sheet needs to be better understood – beyond just its total size, and beyond just the \nassets on it.   I say this  given its likely importance in the future, should there eventual ly be  an \neconomic downturn ; and given the suggestion in some quarters that balance sheet policies are \nbehind recent market volatility ( a suggestion I disagree with).   \nTechnically speaking, t he Federal Reserve’s balance sheet, like that of any enterprise, \nreflect s a point -in-time fin ancial snapshot.  The balance sheet is always evolving, and as a result \nthe Federal Reserve publishes it  each week.2  I would point out that last week the Fed released \nadditional information regarding its plans and principl es for balance sheet normalization.3 \nThroughout my remarks t oday , I will be highlighting the importance of the balance sheet \nas a tool that will likely need to be used by central banks  around the world , given  the low interest \nrate environments in many developed countries .  I will touch on some of the  misconceptions  that \nhave emerged around the topic, look in some detail at the actual composition of the Fed’s \nbalance sheet, discuss the Fed’s balance sheet normalization approach, disprove some mistaken \nassumptions about the bala nce sheet and recent financial market turbulence, and comment on the \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 8:30 P.M. on Monday, March 25, 2019 , U.S. Eastern Time , \nwhich is 8:30 A.M. on Tuesday, March 26, 2019 in Hong Kong  – OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n \n \n3 \n role of the balance sheet going forward – providing my own view of the role balance sheet \npolicies and actions could play in the future . \n \nMisconceptions  about the Federal Reserve Balance Sheet  \nThe balance sheet policies of the U.S. central bank  have received rather significant \nattention over the past two quarters.  That attention stands in contrast to the somewhat surpris ing \nlack of market reaction in Se ptember 2017 to the announcement of a very gradual runoff of \nFederal Reserve assets .4   \nEven more surprising to me was the association – made by some market analysts at the \nend of 2018 – that the increased  market volatility, falling long -term interest rates, and declining \nglobal stock market prices in the fourth quarter  could be attributed to Federal Reserve balance \nsheet actions.  In  actuality , the runoff in balance sheet assets continued at a little faster  pace in \nthe first two months  of this year than in the fourth quarter of last year , yet markets have risen  and \nvolatility has declined – which certainly does not squar e with the earlier commentary.   This \nepisode highlights  the reason for  concern that some misconceptions  have emerged about  the \neffects  of Federal Reserve balance sheet actions – and what such actions can, and cannot, \nachieve.   \nI have talked to a variety of market observers  who argue that the Fed’s  balance sheet \nshould return to levels similar to those that existed prior to the financial crisis of 2008 -2009 .  The \nargument for such a policy is based more on misconception  than fact, since  it does not recogni ze \nthat factors unrelated to monetary policy also impact the growth of the Federal Reserve ’s balance \nsheet , as I will demonstrate in a moment .  Furthermore, I think it is a mistake to focus primarily \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 8:30 P.M. on Monday, March 25, 2019 , U.S. Eastern Time , \nwhich is 8:30 A.M. on Tuesday, March 26, 2019 in Hong Kong  – OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n \n \n4 \n on the size of the balance sheet, with much less attention placed on the quantity of bank reserves \nand the duration of the ass ets being held . In my view , these latter  aspects are much more \nimportant  than overall size,  from a policy perspective.  \n It is important to dispel  misconceptions surrounding central bank balance sheet s if for no \nother reason than this:  It is quite likely that central bank  balance sheet s will be integral to the \nconduct of  monetary policy in the future , in the U.S.  and many other countries.  When  a \nrecession  eventually occur s, central banks would normally decrease short -term interest  rates .  \nBut with interest rates already low in most developed countries , central banks would likely reach  \nthe effective lower bound  quite quickly .  In fact, i n Japan and Europe it is theoretically possible \nthat rates might  not rise much above the effective lower bound before a hypothetical next \nrecession occurs.  As in the Great Recession that followed the financial crisis, this could force \ncentral bankers to use asset purchases to create more accommodative financial conditions and \nstimul ate their economies, which would necessarily entail an expansion of their balance sheet s.5  \nIf balance sheet policies are to become a more regular feature of monetary policy actions \naround the world, my view is that it is important that central bankers  are clear with the public \nabout why they would pursue such policies, what effects they will have, and what complications \nmight arise as a consequence of using such policies .   \n Allow me to outline the key  points that I will explore in more detail today .  First, part of \nthe expansion of the Federal Reserve ’s balance sheet  occurs as a normal consequence of a \ngrowing economy with a growing need for currency, a factor not related to monetary policy  \naction .  A second factor that is unrelated to monetary policy is changes  in the balances held  at the \nFed by the U.S. Treasury .  The Treasury’s General  Account has  grown significantly  following \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 8:30 P.M. on Monday, March 25, 2019 , U.S. Eastern Time , \nwhich is 8:30 A.M. on Tuesday, March 26, 2019 in Hong Kong  – OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n \n \n5 \n the financial crisis , in part because the Treasury shifted from using accounts at commercial banks \nto the Treasury General Account  and decided  to maintain larger  balance s.6,7  As a c onsequen ce \nof these factors , returning the balance sheet to a pre -crisis size may sound like the end result of \nnormalizing policy, but in fact is neither desirable nor feasible .  In addition, demand for reserves \nis much greater than pre -crisis, in part because financial institutions see the benefits of having a \nhigher level of liqui d assets.  \nSecond, when scaled relative to  GDP, the Federal Reserve ’s balance sheet is actually \nsmall compared to those of central banks in many other developed countries.   \nAnd t hird, as suggested by the previous discussion of currency and Treasury balanc es, it \nis important to focus on aspects of the central bank  balance sheet that policymakers  directly \ncontrol, and that are closely  related to polic y decisions .  I have in mind bank reserves , which can \ndirectly affect the ability to control short -term interest rate s, and the duration of assets , which can \nalso play a role in policymakers’  ability to lower longer -term interest rate s, as I will discuss in a \nmoment .   \nAs you likely know,  the Federal Reserve has announced  that it will continue using  the \nsame  monetary policy framework that it has since the financial crisis, which maintains  an ample \nsupply of reserves to ensure  that it can effectively maintain a “floor ” type system  for controlling \nshort -term interest rates  via adm inistered rates .8 I will describe this in more detail in a moment.   \nIn particul ar, variability in some of the components of the Federal Reserve ’s balance sheet make \nit necessary to have ample  reserves as a reasonable buffer if policymakers  seek to avoid \nsignificant volatility in short -term interest rates.9  \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 8:30 P.M. on Monday, March 25, 2019 , U.S. Eastern Time , \nwhich is 8:30 A.M. on Tuesday, March 26, 2019 in Hong Kong  – OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n \n \n6 \n Finally, in my view, monetary policy makers  should give more consideration to \nstructuring the balance sheet to provide  more leeway for policy measures  to be taken  when the \nnext economic downturn occurs.   This consideration primarily centers on building in the \nflexibility to exchange short -term for long -term Treasury securities so as to lower longer -term \nTreasury rates.   I will now discuss  all these points in more detail.  \n \nExamining the Federal Reserve ’s Balance Sheet  \n As I mentioned at the outset, the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet , like that  of any \nenterprise , reflect s at a single point in time the assets  it holds, and the liabilities  and capital  used \nto finance those assets .   \nFigure 1  shows how the assets and liabilities of the Fed have changed since before the \nGreat Recession. The table provides a high -level overview of the largest categories of assets and \nliabilities of the Federal Reserve , for January 2004 and for February  2019 .  The  assets are \ncomposed primarily of U.S. Treasury securities and mortgage -backed securities that have a \ngovernment guarantee.  All of these securities accrue  interest.   \nThese interest -generating  assets are financed primarily by three categories of liabiliti es: \nFederal Reserve notes  – U.S. currency  – a category that does not pay interest ; deposits held for \nthe Treasury ; and reserves  held for thousands of depository  institutions, which  pay an overnight \nrate – or interest on reserves.10  I would note that t he net income generated by the Fed’s balance \nsheet activity is turned over to the U.S. Treasury annually .11 \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 8:30 P.M. on Monday, March 25, 2019 , U.S. Eastern Time , \nwhich is 8:30 A.M. on Tuesday, March 26, 2019 in Hong Kong  – OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n \n \n7 \n  As Figure 1  illustrates, there have been significant changes to the assets and liabilities of \nthe Federal Reserve over the past 15 years.  In terms of assets, in 2004 the Federal Reserve held \nroughly one -third of its securities as short -term Treasury bills and held no  mortgage -backed \nsecurities.  By 2019, the Federal Reserve held essentiall y no Treasury bills and had dramatically \nincreased its holdings of long-term securities such as Treasury bonds and mortgage -backed \nsecurities.   This change in the composition of  assets reflects  a Fed policy choice  that was \nnecessitated by the fact that the short -term policy rate was already at its effective  lower bound, \neven as the economy remained quite weak.  Hoping to stimulate the economy, the Fed purchased \nlong-term securities in order to reduce long -term interest rates ( because debt security prices \nmove inversely with their interest rates , higher prices spurred by purchases  reduce d rates ).   \nIn principle, the Federal Reserve  can move to  longer -term assets either by exchanging \nthem for the central bank’s  holdings of short -term assets on the Fed  balance sheet (a reallocation \nof the portfolio, accomplished by selling short -term assets and purchasing longer -term assets) or \nby simply purchasing longer -term securities  – that is, crediti ng the banks that the Fed  purchase s \nthem from with new reserves.  In practice, the Fed did some of both.  In the end, t he overall \namount of assets the central bank  held became much larger , growing from less than  $1 trillion to \napproximately $4.5 trillion , in large part due to these policy -related purchases of long -term \nsecurities .   \nWhile much of this growth was initially a result of intentional monetary policy action s \nand the operation of lending facilities  set up to provide liquidity during the financial crisis , there \nwere also secular trends unrelated to Fed policy that caused  the balance sheet to grow .  These \ntrends primarily affected the composition of Federal Reserve liabilities.  \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 8:30 P.M. on Monday, March 25, 2019 , U.S. Eastern Time , \nwhich is 8:30 A.M. on Tuesday, March 26, 2019 in Hong Kong  – OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n \n \n8 \n  What liabilities  finan ced the growing assets  on the Fed’s balance sheet ?  Before the \ncrisis, t he largest category of Fed liabilities was currency holdings.  Currency is held by domestic \nindividuals who use it as a medium of  exchange, but is also held abroad .  In some countries the \nU.S. dollar is the  de facto domestic  currency, whereas  in other countries the U.S. dollar is often \nused as  a store of value, hedg ing against the possibility of exchange rate depreciation of the local \ncurrency.    \nThe Federal Reserve passively issues currency  through banks  in response to domestic and \ninternational  demand  for currency from bank customers .  And w hen individuals hold U .S. \ncurrency, they are in effect providing an interest -free loan to the federal  government .12   \nAs Figure 2 shows, as of 2019, currency holdings were  more than twice the size of the  \nFed’s  entire  balance sheet in 2004.  It is important to note that this particular driver of currency \nliabilities  is not a monetary policy action by the Fed .  Since 2004, c urrency has grown from \nunder $700 billion to $1.66 trillion.  The change in currency holdings alone highlight s that the \nFed’s balance sheet will not be able to shrink to earlier levels.   \nOf cour se, Figure 2 also shows that in 2004, just under 90 percent of  the Federal \nReserve’s balance sheet was financed by currency .  And now that percentage is just over  40 \npercent .   \nAmong the non-currency  liabilities on the Fed’s balance sheet , “Other Liabilities ” and the \n“U.S. Treasury General  Account ” are, like currency  growth , not primarily  driven by monetary \npolicy actions .  The balance sheet would have need ed to grow to accommodate  these changes as \nwell.  In short, those who argue for returning to a balance sheet closer to the former $1 trillion  \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 8:30 P.M. on Monday, March 25, 2019 , U.S. Eastern Time , \nwhich is 8:30 A.M. on Tuesday, March 26, 2019 in Hong Kong  – OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n \n \n9 \n level from before the financial  crisis  are ignoring the non -monetary policy reasons that the \nbalance sheet has expanded.  \n Even if one picks a much shorter horizon, significant changes in the composition of the \nFederal Reserve ’s liabilities  are evident , as shown in Figure 3 .  From September 2017 to \nFebruary  2019, Federal Reserve  policymakers have very gradually reduced the overall balance \nsheet by letting some of the securities that are maturing roll  off.  However, this relatively small \nreduction on the  asset  side of the balance sheet  has been accompanied by increases in both \ncurrency and the U .S. Treasury  General Account on the liabilities side.  The result has been  an \neven larger shrinkage of  reserves  – a Fed liability  – than would have occurred due to the r olling \noff alone . \n Figure 4  shows the overall size of the balance sheet compared to the amount of excess \nreserves  of depository institutions  – the reserves in excess of  the minimums  required to meet \nreserve requirements .13  During the period whe n Federal Reserve policymakers  were reinvesting \nmaturing securities and holding the balance sheet ’s overall size  relatively constant, excess \nreserves were declining because the other liabilities mentioned  earlier were rising , absorbing \nreserves out of the banking sy stem .  With an enormous surplus of reserves already in the banking \nsystem, the Fed chose not to offset these reserve declines.  As total assets have declin ed, and \nother liabilities have continu ed to grow, excess reserves are declining more rapidly than  the \noverall balance sheet . \n Figure 5  shows central bank s’ balance sheet s relative to GDP in major industrial ized \ncountries.  Examining the central bank’s balance sheet assets as a share of GDP shows that t he \nFederal Reserve ’s balance sheet , relative to the size of its economy , is smaller than that of these  \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 8:30 P.M. on Monday, March 25, 2019 , U.S. Eastern Time , \nwhich is 8:30 A.M. on Tuesday, March 26, 2019 in Hong Kong  – OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n \n \n10 \n other major developed  countries.  This is despite the fact that as a reserve currency, international \ndemand for  U.S. currency will be considerably larger than is the case for other currenc ies.  \nAnother reason  the Federal Reserve ’s balance sheet is smaller as a share of GDP than other \ndeveloped countries’ balance sheets  stems from the  aggressive and proactive easing by the Fed \nduring the financial crisis , which restored U.S. growth faster th an otherwise .14  I would assert \nthat partly a s a result  of that aggressive action , the Fed was able to move sooner to unwind its \nemergency monetary polic ies and  the United States is  further along in the balance sheet \nnormalization p rocess relative to many peers.  \n Overall, these facts suggest that the balance sheet should not be expected to decline to \nanything close to the pre -crisis size , in my view .  Growth in non -monetary policy related  \nliabilities , like currency , make it quite likely  that the absolute size of the Fed’s  balance sheet will \ncontinue to grow.    \nHowever, the size of the balance sheet  — more specifically, the size of reserve balances \nin the banking system  — is also closely  related to how the central bank  choose s to conduct \nmonetary policy , and how we want monetary policy to react in the next recession.   I will now \nexplore these aspects of the balance sheet with you.  \n \nBalance Sheet Normalization  \n Following its January meeting, t he Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), the U.S. \nmonetary policy  decision -making body,  issued  a short statement regarding monetary policy \nimplementation  and balance s heet normalization .15  The Committee said:  \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 8:30 P.M. on Monday, March 25, 2019 , U.S. Eastern Time , \nwhich is 8:30 A.M. on Tuesday, March 26, 2019 in Hong Kong  – OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n \n \n11 \n The Committee intends to continue to implement monetary policy in a regime in \nwhich an ample  supply of reserves ensures that control over the level of the federal \nfunds rate and other short -term interest rates is exercised primarily through the \nsetting of the Federal Reserve's administered rates, and in which active \nmanagement of the supply of re serves is not required.  \n \nTwo aspects of the announcement are particularly notable as we consider the future size \nof the  Fed’s  balance sheet.   \nFirst, the FOMC indicated  that the Federal Reserve  would continue to operate in an \nenvironment of an “ample” supp ly of reserves, which implies a floor -type system  of interest rate \ncontrol , consistent with the operating framework used since the fall of 2008.  Prior to the \nfinancial crisis , the Federal Reserve  operated in a “scarcity of reserves ” monetary policy  \nframework .  That meant simply that  there were enough reserves in the banking system to satisfy \nshort -term borrowing and lending needs, but not more.  As a consequence, to maintain the \ntargeted level for short -term interest rates , the Fed regular ly conduct ed open -market operations \nby adjust ing the supply of  reserves  (and thus the federal funds interest rate ), given its estimate of \nreserves demand .   \nBut o nce short -term rates had hit zero and the Federal Reserve’s  asset purchases had \ndramatically expanded the supply of excess reserves, it could no longer set short -term rates by \nmaking small adjustments to the supply of reserves.  There were just too many reserves to do \nthat.  So the Federal Reserve  moved to a “floor system ” where we rely on a key administer ed \ninterest rate  that we can set  regardless of reserve levels: the rate the Fed pays on excess reserves . \nIn theory, this rate will  establish  a floor  below which market rates w ill not fall  (since  banking  \ninstitutions would  generally  not lend out short -term money at  a rate less than the rate the Fed \npays risk -free on banks’  excess reserves) .  The announcement that the Fed is  continuing with the \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 8:30 P.M. on Monday, March 25, 2019 , U.S. Eastern Time , \nwhich is 8:30 A.M. on Tuesday, March 26, 2019 in Hong Kong  – OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n \n \n12 \n floor system implies that we intend  to maintain an ample supply of reserves at depository \ninstitution s. \n A second implication  of the announcement was that within the context of  an ample \nsupply  of reserves, intervention to add or reduce reserves to offset other liability movements  is \nnot necessary  (thus the phrase , “active management of the supply of reserves is not re quired .”)  \nIn this operating model, excess reserves need to be ample  enough that surprise movements in  \nother liabilities on the Fed’s balance sheet  do not need to be offset  through open market \noperations . \n Figure 6 shows  the major liability categories over the past 15 years.  While currency \ndemand has increased quite smoothly overall, liabilities like  the U.S. Treasury General Account \nand Other Liabilities have shown significant fluctuations.  To avoid regular interventio ns to \nreduce  short -term interest rate volatility, reserves need to be large enough that large , temporary \ndeclines or surges in liabilities do not cause short -term rates to spike  or plummet .  With ample \nreserves, fluctuations in other liabilities do not need to be offset.  \n \nThe Balance Sheet and Recent Financial Market Turbulence  \n Some market analysts attribute turbulence in financial markets during  the fourth quarter \nof 2018 to the Federal Reserve’s continuing reduction of the size of its balance sheet.  In my \nview, however, concerns about the international economy, potential trade disputes, and a U.S. \ngovernment shutdown are much more plausible explanations for the financial market turbulence.   \nFor one thing, t he Fed’s reduction is still quite gradual .  And equity markets experienced  a \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 8:30 P.M. on Monday, March 25, 2019 , U.S. Eastern Time , \nwhich is 8:30 A.M. on Tuesday, March 26, 2019 in Hong Kong  – OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n \n \n13 \n substantial recovery in the first two months of 2019 , even while the runoff of the balance sheet \nwas slightly faster than  in the fourth quarter .  \n Figure 7  shows the monthly change in the Federal Reserve System assets .  By design , the \nrunoff was intended to be quite gradual.  The  runoffs during the  third and fourth quarter s of 2018  \nwere similar , with an average mo nthly decline of 0.9 percent in both periods.  A similar decline \noccurred in January  2019 , with a mor e rapid decl ine following in Fe bruary 2019 .  Despite the \nroughly similar magnitude of runoff , the stock market rose over the third quarter while falling in \nthe fourth  quarter of last year  and recovering again since the beginning of this  year.  So there \nseems to be little correlation between equity  market  movements and the relatively small and \nsteady  decline in the balance sheet.  \n Looking at another financial indicator – the behavior of term premia – also argues against \nthe idea that the reduction in the Fed’s balance sheet spurred market turbulence.  Conceptually, \nquantitative easing should work through the term premium , or the return needed to induce \ninvestors to hold long-term securities instead of short -term securities .  Term premia from 2004 to \nearly 2019 are shown in Figure 8 .  As the Fed purchases long-term securities, it raises the price \nand lowers the rate on those securities, thus reducing the term premium.  This also encourages \ninvestors to “bid up ” the price and lower the interest rates on other high -duration securities , so \nthat the Fed’s purchase s of government -guaranteed securities have beneficial spillover effects to \na wide array of other asset prices .   \nWith quantitative tightening , one would expect over time that Treasury yields and term \npremi a would move  higher.  In  contrast, last December the 10 -year U.S. Treasury rate fell and \nthe term premium remained quite low  – not the reaction one would expect if the very gradual \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 8:30 P.M. on Monday, March 25, 2019 , U.S. Eastern Time , \nwhich is 8:30 A.M. on Tuesday, March 26, 2019 in Hong Kong  – OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n \n \n14 \n reduction in the balance sheet w ere responsible for substantial tightening , which caused asset \nprices to fall . \n \nThe Balance Sheet Going Forward  \n Both the composition and size of the central bank’s balance sheet can influence  financial \nconditions , and thus  the path of the economy.  As I discussed earlier, holding the balance sheet ’s \nsize constant w ould still reduce the amount of excess reserves , as liabilities  – such as currency  – \ngrow over time .  While the point at which the balance sheet no longer is being reduced  is clearly \nimportant , another significant  issue going forward will be determining the point  at which  the \nFederal Reserve should once again begin purchasing securities to offset the decline in reserves \n(and the size of its balance sheet) that would otherwise occur as currency and other  liabilities  \ngrow .   \n Another key  issue will be the composition of the balance sheet  and the duration of the \nassets on it .  Figure 9  shows that the Fed  has been very gradually reducing the duration of U.S. \nTreasury  securities holdings  on its balance sheet .  Even so, the duration is far higher than it was \nprior to the financial crisis.  One reason for this rise in duration is shown in Figure 10 .  The Fed \ncurrently holds virtually no U.S. Treasury bills , which had been more than one -third of the Fed’s \nsecurities holdings prior to the financial crisis.   \nIn my view, one benefit of having both short - and long -maturity Treasuries on the Fed  \nbalance she et is that it provides a way to stimulate the economy through quantitative easing  \nwithout increasing the size of the balance sheet , should that be necessary .  As suggested earlier, \npolicymakers  could lower longer -term interest rates by selling Treasury bil ls and buying  long-\n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 8:30 P.M. on Monday, March 25, 2019 , U.S. Eastern Time , \nwhich is 8:30 A.M. on Tuesday, March 26, 2019 in Hong Kong  – OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n \n \n15 \n term Treasuries, leaving the size of the balance sheet constant.  But to do so, the Fed  need s to \nhave some Treasury bills on the balance sheet.  Thus , increas ing the share of U.S. Treasury bills \nand more quickly lower ing the duration of securities  held as assets  may be an important goal as \npart of the normalization  process .  This would give the Federal Reserve  the flexibility to take the \npolicy step of lengthen ing the maturity  of its balance sheet assets the  next time a s ignificant \neconomic downturn occurs.  \n \nConcluding Observations  \n Active use of the central bank’s balance sheet is a relatively new tool for monetary \npolicy.  As a n emerging part of the monetary  policy toolkit, altering the size and composition of \nthe central bank ’s balance sheet does not yet have a long history of careful analysis  of its effects.  \nIn fact, most central banks still see moving short -term interest rates as the primary tool to \ninfluence the economy.  However, I think it is important to understand how balance sheet \nchanges can and do impact the economy .   \nIn summary, i t is unrealistic to expect the Federal Reserve ’s balance sheet to return to the \nsize it was before the financial  crisis , for several reasons  that I have described today .  First,  the \ndemand for some of the Fed’s liabilities  – for instance  currency  – continue s to grow , which given \nthe binding characteristics of a balance sheet implies  the purchase of additional assets over \ntime.16,17  A second reason is that operating framework s affect  the desired size and composition \nof the balance sheet .  At the January 2019 FOMC meeting, the Committee announced plans to \ncontinue running a floor system with an abundance of reserves .  A “scarcity of reserves ” \nframework  like the Fed operated with before the financial crisis  would have a smaller  pool of  \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 8:30 P.M. on Monday, March 25, 2019 , U.S. Eastern Time , \nwhich is 8:30 A.M. on Tuesday, March 26, 2019 in Hong Kong  – OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n \n \n16 \n reserves and a smaller balance sheet than a floor system with an abundance of reserves.  Third, \nsome of the liability categories have become more variable, and if policymakers  want to avoid \nregular interventions in the  financial  market, it requires that there be enough excess reserves that \nthese fluctuations in liability categories do not create additional volatility in short -term rates.  \n As I mentioned today, some have suggested that t he Fed’s balance sheet is partly \nresponsible for financial market volatility at the end of 2018 , but I disagree .  The Federal \nReserve ’s balance sheet decline has been quite gradual, and proceeded along roughly the same \npath when stock  price s have been rising as whe n stock  price s have  been  falling.  Furtherm ore, I \nnoted that the term premium , the main mechanism by which  the balance sheet impacts the \neconomy, remains at quite low levels.  \n In conclusion , I will say that i n a hypothetical next recession, it may be that many central \nbanks have little room to reduce short -term rates .  This will likely generat e an increased need to \nutilize the balance sheet as a stimulative tool of monetary policy .  Therefore , it is important for \npolicymakers to continue to research how bal ance sheet operations influence the economy  – and \nI dare say it is important for market observers, lawmakers , and the public to become more \ncomfortable with the benefits of central banks using their balance sheet tools to pursue the public \ninterest .   \n Thank you.  \n   \n1 See, for example, the discussion of balance sheets in Corporate Finance  by Ross, Westerfield, and Jaffe.  \n \n2 See https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/bst_fedsbalancesheet.htm . \n                                                            \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 8:30 P.M. on Monday, March 25, 2019 , U.S. Eastern Time , \nwhich is 8:30 A.M. on Tuesday, March 26, 2019 in Hong Kong  – OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n \n \n17 \n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n3 See the March 20, 2019 statement Balance Sheet Normalization Principles and Plans :  \nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20190320c.htm . \n \n4 After the September 2017 FOMC meeting, it was announced that the program for gradually reducing the Federal \nReserve’s securities holdings would begin in October 2017.  \n \n5 Specifi cally, such actions would likely entail an expansion of reserves, which, along with the normal and gradual \nincrease in currency requirements, would significantly swell the size of central bank balance sheets.  \n \n6 See Chicago Fed Letter, No. 395, 2018, The S tructure of Federal Reserve Liabilities, by Thomas Haasl, Sam \nSchulhofer -Wohl, and Anna Paulson: https://www.chicagofed.org/publications/chicago -fed-letter/2018/395 . \n \n7 This is done to cover payments in the event that the Treasury is unable to issue debt.  \n \n8 After the January 2019 FOMC meeting, it was announced that the operating regime would continue to be a floor \nsystem. See https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20190130c.htm . \n \n9 If the Fed shrinks available reserves too much, then fluctuations in reserves due to factors beyond our control —\nsuch as the Treasury’s deposits to and withdrawals from its Fed account —could lead to a scarcity or surplus of \nreserves that would in turn caus e significant volatility in short -term interest rates. Knowing how large is an “ample” \nsupply is something we are learning about; but as I have outlined, it is essential to keep an ample supply if we are to \ncontrol short -term interest rates as we have in r ecent years.  \n \n10 Congress gave the Federal Reserve the authorization to pay interest on reserves, effective October of 2008.   \nPaying interest on reserves is an important tool as the Fed works to raise rates – because banks can receive interest \non reserves held overnight with the Federal Reserve, banks will not want to lend at a rate below what they can get \nfrom holding funds with the Fed.   \n \n11 The net income generated by the Fed’s balance sheet activity is turned over to the U.S. Treasury as part of the \ncentral bank’s annual remittance of earnings net of expenses.  \n \n12 When banks purchase currency from the Fed, they “pay” for it with reserves, and thus their reserve balances \ndecrease.  If the Fed wishes to offset this decline in reserves, the Fed can purchase  government securities, which \nreplaces the reserves in the banking system, maintaining the overall level of reserves even as currency increases.  If \nit does not, reserve balances in the banking system will decline as currency use increases.  Those Treasury  securities \nare assets on the Fed’s balance sheet. The interest earned by the Federal Reserve on these securities is ultimately \nreturned to the federal government.   \n \n13 It is important to note that there are other reasons for banks to hold reserves; for ex ample, banks use reserves to \nmeet their liquidity requirements of holding high quality liquid assets.  \n \n14 It is important to note  the figure also shows that the other central banks have significantly expanded their balance \nsheets.  \n \n15 See the January 30, 2019 Statement Regarding Monetary Policy Implementation and Balance Sheet \nNormalization:  https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressrelea ses/monetary20190130c.htm  \n \n16 As I demonstrated, currency is now much larger than the Federal Reserve’s entire pre -crisis balance sheet.  \n \n17 If we intend to operate in an environment of ample reserves, policymakers will need to match increased currency \ndeman d with increased Treasury holdings.",

There is even a connection here to the \nFederal Reserve.  As you likely know, Woodrow Wilson, who as president  signed the Federal \nReserve Act into law, was a student here for a time.  And t he Corne lson Lecture is another \nwonderful  tradition .  I feel honored to join the ranks of economists  you have invited here for the \nlecture.1 \nTurning from history and tradition to the present, I would say that i n many respects the \neconomy is doing quite well , especially if you’re going by the Fed’s dual mandate: stable prices \nand maximum sustainable employment .  Labor markets remain quite tight , which is  great news \nfor many – including this year’s graduating senior  class, who are about to enter the workforce .  \nWith the national  unemployment rate at 3.8 percent, employers have to compete vigorously  for \nworkers , and as a consequence, wage  increases have been trending up.   \nIn addition, one broad measure of the economy ’s strength , real  (or inflation -adjusted)  \nGDP, increased roughly 3 percent in 2018 – although since the start of th is year, the incoming \ndata suggest that economic growth has slowed .  As a result, f irst quarter GDP growth is likely to \nshow a noticeable slowdown relative to the 3 percent pace seen  last year.    \nAlso, the inflation rate remains slightly below the Federal Reserve’s  2 percent targe t.  To \nbe clear, t he miss  relative to our  target  is relatively modest;  core inflation  (measured using the \nPersonal Consumption Expenditures or PCE price index , which is Fed policymakers’  preferred \nmeasure) , averaged  1.8 percent over the past year  in the United States , just below the target .  \nHowever, inflation has been below target for much of the past decade , in large part due to the \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 8:00 P.M . on Monday, April 15,  2019 U.S. Eastern Time, OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n \n \n3 \n depth of the Great Re cession and the considerable amount of time needed after to recoup the \nlosses in activity and employment.2   \nAnd t he Federal Reserve is not  alone  in this .  The central banks of both Japan and Europe \nalso have had  difficulty bringing  inflation back to target  after significant recessions  of their own, \npersistently undershooting their  inflation targets  by an even larger extent  than the Fed .   \nExperiencing b elow -target inflation  rates , of course , factor s into Federal Reserve \nmonetary policymaking  decision s.3  One reason for the policy committee’s  decision to be patient \nin determining future rate adjustments , despite tight labor markets , is waiting  to see more \nconvincing evidence that inflation will achieve and sustain  the 2 percent inflation target.  \nIt is important to note that the  persisten ce of below -target inflation  risks having inflation \nexpectations  decline in response .4  As Japan ’s experience has sho wn, once inflation expectations \nreset to a level below target, it can be difficult to alter those expectations.  And there are \nconsequences throughout the economy.  \nA second potential problem is that  the combination of  low inflation rates and low real \nrates of interest provides the central bank very little room to  implement its traditional policy \nresponse to an economic downturn: lowering short -term interest rates .  Currently, the Fed has set \nthe target for its policy interest rate, t he federal funds rate, in a range f rom 2.25 to 2.50 percent , \nand the  effective rate in the marketplace has recently hovered around 2.4 percent.  In react ion to  \nmost recessions, the Federal Reserve’s typical reduction of the federal funds rate has been in the \nrange of roughly 5 to 6 percentage points .  Therefore, t he current  low interest  rate environment  \ngives policymakers  very little “room to maneuver ” in a hypothetical next recession , at least in the \ntraditional monetary policy mode of reducing short -term rates .  \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 8:00 P.M . on Monday, April 15,  2019 U.S. Eastern Time, OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n \n \n4 \n Today , I will discuss  why achieving  an inflation target is important, and , in particular, \nwhy it is important to have  what I will call monetary policy “ space ” to react to econ omic \ndownturns.  Then I will discuss some ways that the Federal Reserve’s  inflation target can be  \nmore firmly ingrain ed.   \nBy the way, t his discussion is particularly relevant this year , because the Federal Reserve \nis conducting a review of its  monetary policy “framework ” – or the set of tools and processes \nthat we use to define and attain high- level economic goals .5  An important part of that discussion \nis how to better reinforce the  2 percent inflation target. \n \nThe Problem: Finding Adequate  Monetary Policy “S pace” \nFigure 1  shows interest rates  in the Euro  Area, Japan, and the United States  since \nJanuary 2000.  In the years since the financial crisis, i nterest rates have remain ed low.  \nCompared to other recoveries , rates have stayed lower for longer throughout this now  quite \nextended  economic recovery.6  Unfortunately, Japan and Europe ’s recoveries have not been  \nstrong enough to justify an increase in short -term rates  to date in the current cycle.  As a result, \nwere these areas to experience economic downturns , the options of the associated central banks \nto cut short -term interest rates to stimulate the ir econom ies would be quite restricted.  In the \nU.S., we have experienced  a stronger reco very, and with the federal funds rate at  2.4 percent  \n(well below the interest rates seen at the peaks of previous recoveries ), monetary policymaker s \nhave more space to lower interest rates , if necessary,  than our counterparts in Europe or Japan.  \nFigure 2  shows the size of peak -to-trough cuts  in interest rates in the previous three \nrecessions.  In  each of  the past three episodes , including the relatively mild 2001 downturn, the \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 8:00 P.M . on Monday, April 15,  2019 U.S. Eastern Time, OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n \n \n5 \n Federal Reserve ha s lowered short -term interest rates by more than 5 percentage points .  As the \nprevious figure and discussion highlighted, this implies that policymakers  now  have much less \nlatitude to use short -term rates  to counter a recession.  The fact t hat other key economies  would \nbe able to respond even less aggressively  adds to the concern.  \nOf course, cuts in s hort-term interest rates are not the only monetary policy tool that \npolicymakers can use to combat economic downturns .  Central banks have  purchase d longer -\nterm assets to reduce the interest rates  on those assets , rates that are arguably much more tightly \nconnected to spending and employment decisions than their policy rates .  Figure 3  shows that as \na result of such asset purchases, desi gned to make economic conditions more accommodative, \nbalance sheets of central banks in the U .S., Euro Area, and Japan all increased significantly in \nthe last recession  and slow recovery  – in an attempt to make monetary policy more \naccommodative.  \nFigure 4  shows that 10- year government bond yield s in the U.S., Germany, and Japan \ndeclined significantly, in part  as a result of central banks purchasing these assets.  (Central bank \npurchase s push up demand, and thus price – and yields move in the opposite direction as the \nprice for debt securities).  However, long- term yields in Japan and in Germany are very  close to \nzero, giving the  monetary authorities  little space to push rates down further from current levels.7  \nIn the U nited States, the 10- year Treasury rate provides more space, but is still quite low by \nhistorical standards.  So this other  monetary policy tool  – influencing long -term rates  – would \nalso have limited power to respond to a hypothetical economic downturn, similar to the case with \nlow short -term interest rates .  \n \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 8:00 P.M . on Monday, April 15,  2019 U.S. Eastern Time, OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n \n \n6 \n The Importance of  a Symmetric I nflation G oal \nAll in all,  we live in a world where central banks in many developed countries have little, \nif any,  traditional monetary policy space with which to operate, should an economic downturn \noccur .  I expect that despite some deceleration from last year, the pace of growth in economic \nactivity will be enough to bring further reductions in the une mployment rate in the near term, so \na recession  is not my modal forecast.8  Nevertheless, the current low interest rate environment \nraises important issues about how to best conduct monetary policy.  For this reason, I will now \nturn to some data to explore further the issue of policy space  – and import antly the role of \ninflation and the inflation target .   \nAs Figure 5  illustrates, the nominal interest rate comprises two components .  The f irst \ncomponent is c ompensation for expected inflation , wherein  one hopes to earn a rate of interest \nthat increases one’s accounts at least as fast as the rate of inflation, otherwise your investment \nwill lose  real purchasing power as prices rise.  This component is shown on the chart as a \nforecast for core PCE inflati on.  The second  component is  the real interest rate.  The real interest \nrate in the long  run will depend on the return to investing in the real economy.  As such, t his rate \nwill be determined by non -monetary factors , like the rate of productivity growth and \ndemographic trends in labor force growth .   \nBoth of these factors have  been  growing more slowly of late, reducing the  real interest \nrate.  A risk in current circumstances is that  if inflation regularly undershoots the central bank’s \ninflation ta rget, inflation expectations may  fall.  In something of a snowball effect , a decline in \ninflation expectations c ould lead to further declines in  nominal  interest rates – ultimately \nproviding  even less policy space.  \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 8:00 P.M . on Monday, April 15,  2019 U.S. Eastern Time, OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n \n \n7 \n Figure 6  shows the core PCE inflation rate in each year since 1999, with the Federal \nReserve’s stated inflation target of 2 percent  indicated by  the horizontal line, although I should \nnote that the Fed first announced a formal 2 percent target in 2012.9  Most of the observations for  \nU.S. inflation since 1999 have been below our current  inflation target.  In the last 10 years , there \nhas only been one year – 2011 – in which inflation has exceeded the target , and then only barely . \nFigure 7  shows the frequency  distribution  of quarterly inflation rates over the past 20 \nyears .  Each bar  represents the number of quarters that the annualized inflation rate has been in \nthat particular range .  The  distribution clearly skews to one side – the bar s representing inflation \nbelow 2 percent have many more observations than the bars  representing inflation above 2 \npercent.  This is just another way of representing the below -2-percent inflation pattern in the \nprevious chart.  \nIn hindsight, i t appears that the 2 percent inflation goal has essentially acted more like a \nceiling , rather than a symmetric target  around which inflation fluctuates .  If the target w ere \nsymmetric, we would expect to see a more balanced distribution, with a roughly equal number of \nobservations above and below 2 perce nt.  This frequency distribution and its skewing below 2 \npercent  illustrates  one of the key reasons to hold interest rates steady  at present , as members of \nthe Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC)  await  stronger evidence that we  can consistently \nand symmetrically attain a 2 percent symmetric inflation target, a goal that has clearly been \nelusive over the past 2 0 years . \n \n \n \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 8:00 P.M . on Monday, April 15,  2019 U.S. Eastern Time, OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n \n \n8 \n Monetary Framework Considerations  \nWhat are the implications of all this for monetary policy?  And not just for current policy, \nbut for the broader ways that monetary  policymakers think about policy and the tools and targets \nthat are used – i n other words, the policy framework?  \nLooking forward, achieving  a symmetric inflation target is like ly to be that much more \ndifficult in a world where interest rates are low, given the constraint on reducing rates e nough to \nmove  inflation back towards (or above) the Fed policymakers’  target.   Low interest rates mean \nlimited monetary policy space, with a greater likelihood of reach ing the  effective lower bound \nfor interest rates  during a downturn.  This , in turn, means that inflation is more likely to underrun \nthan overrun the inflation target.  \nOne possible solution to this difficulty would be  to offset the undershoot of inflation \nduring recessions , whe n constrained by  the effective lower bound on interest rates,  with an \novershoot of inflation during the economic recover ies, as shown in Figure 8 .  Put differently, the \nFed could aim to achieve  its inflation target on average over the economic cycle.  This would \nallow the inflation rate to move within a range  centered around its target .  The figure highlights \nhow this would work in practice.   \nFigure 8 shows an inflation range of 1.5 to 2.5 percent , averag ing 2 percent ( on average  \nhitting the target ).  In contrast, if  inflation slips during periods at the effective lower bound, but \nwe only reach – but don’t exceed – 2 percent inflation during economic recoveries , then inflation  \nwill average below 2 percent over the cycle, as it has recently . \nFigure 9  shows that our below -2-percent average inflation  rate is not an  artifact of \nparticularly bad outcomes during the Great Recession, or any other period.  In fact, we have \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 8:00 P.M . on Monday, April 15,  2019 U.S. Eastern Time, OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n \n \n9 \n averag ed below 2 percent inflation, for both core and  total PCE  inflation measure s, whether \nlooking over the past  5, 10, 15, or 20 years.   \nA closely  related  alternative to focusing on an inflation range  is to more deliberately try \nto hit an inflation average  over a specified period of time.  While the details  of how inflation \naveraging is implemented can matter  – for instance , how m any years go into the average? D oes \nthe average take into account the future or just past outcomes ? When would we start the average \nin current circumstances ? – the bottom line is  that policymakers  would explicitly need more \ninflation outcomes above  2 percent than we have experienced over the recent past.  \nThe desirability of such a policy is that if recession lowers inflation, public expectation \nthat the Federal Reserve will generate higher -than-target inflation in the future should keep \ninflation expectations stable . This, in turn, will provide more policy  space to offset the next \nrecession.  In sum, the benefit of inflation averaging would be to make the extent of recessions \nless severe.  \nThis strategy of increasing the policy buffer is closely related to another alternative, \nwhich is referred to as “ price level target ing.”  Price level targeting attempts to keep the general \nlevel of prices close to an imaginary price line that grows at a fixed rate – say 2 percent.   Figure \n10 shows that if FOMC members  had committed to such a policy starting in 1999, actual prices \nover the next 20 years w ould have been consistently below that imaginary price line  – which is \nthe same thing as saying inflation has averaged below 2 percent over that period.  In order to \nreturn to the 2 percent target line, periods of below -2-percent inflation would need to be offset by \nperiods of above -2-percent inflation.   In that manner, successful price level target ing generally \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 8:00 P.M . on Monday, April 15,  2019 U.S. Eastern Time, OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n \n \n10 \n will engender inflation rates that vary symmetrically around the 2 percent target, somewhat like \nthe pattern depicted in F igure 8 . \nMy own preference is for the Federal Reserve to adopt  an inflation range that explicitly \nrecognizes the challenge of the effective lower bound.  We might be forced to accept below -2-\npercent inflation during recessions, but we would commit to achieving above -2-percent inflation \nin good times, so as to provide more policy space to counteract the next recession.  As an approach , it is eas ier to explain than price level targeting, is consistent with the Federal \nReserve’s  current 2 percent inflation target, and recognizes th at there ar e limits on policymakers’  \nability to be quite so precise in hitting an inflation  target.   \nRegardless  of my preferences , I am very happy to note that over the course of this year, \nthe Fed  will be gathering  input on whether we should change the way we think about our 2 \npercent inflation target  – in a way that would allow us to more effectively stabilize th e economy, \ngiven the constraints  I have discussed today .  Given the history of one -sided misses on inflation, \nand the likelihood of being constrained on the downside in interest rates moves, now is a good time to be having the discussion about the Fed’s  monetary policy framework. \nI would note that there are other ways to create more monetary policy space, i ncluding \nconsidering how the central bank  should allocate its  balance sheet assets , as shown in Figure 11.  \nI recently discussed a number of central bank  balance sheet  issue s in some detail .\n10  The topic is \nsomewhat technical, but very important – given that central banks may need to turn to balance \nsheet tools to stimulate the economy during the hypothetical next recession, given a low -rate \nenvironment with limited room to reduce rates before they reach zero .   \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 8:00 P.M . on Monday, April 15,  2019 U.S. Eastern Time, OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n \n \n11 \n Here, I focus on one aspect that is germane to today’s discussion.  By holding mostly \nlong-term securities, the Federal Reserve is lowering the long -term rate.  This flattening of the \nyield curve may provide more short -term interest rate space, but at a cost – if the Fed’s balance \nsheet had more short -term securities, there would be the ability to change the maturity \ncomposition in a downturn where we reach the effective lower bound, moving from short - to \nlong-term securities in order to push down long- term rates and stimulate the economy.   \nIf we want to have more capacity to lower long- term rates in recessions  without \nincreasing the size of the Fed’s  balance sheet , policymakers may  wish  to hold more short -term \nsecurities  in good times .  Figure 11  shows that the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet  currently \ncontains  no Treasury bills and more long -term securities than were h eld prior to the financial \ncrisis.  I am pleased that t he appropriate asset allocation of the Federal Reserve balance sheet \nwill be a topic in future FOMC discuss ions. \n \nConcluding Observations  \nNow is a good time to reflect  on the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy framework.  T he \nU.S. and many developed economies are likely to be challenged by the implications of a low \ninterest rate environment  for their  ability to offset recessions .  The reality of limited monetary \npolicy space provides important context for why the Federal Reserve should broadly consider its  \ncurrent policies and their  likely outcomes.   \nWhile I would currently prefer moving to an inflation range, I look forward to future \ndiscussions .  A key matter f or me will be considering whether the possible changes to the Fed’s  \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 8:00 P.M . on Monday, April 15,  2019 U.S. Eastern Time, OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n \n \n12 \n monetary policy framework could provide policy space for action in a hypothetical future  \neconomic downturn.  \nThank you again for inviting me to Davidson and for the opportunity to present this \nyear’s Cornelson lecture .  \n \n \n \n1 For more about the Cornelson Lecture series, see:  https://www.davidson.edu/academics/economics/cornelson -\nlecture.  \n \n2 For additional discussion, see Oct. 14, 2016 remarks at Federal Reserve Bank of  Boston annual economic \nconference, by Eric S. Rosengren, After the Great Recession, a Not -So-Great Recovery . \n \n3 The Federal Open Market Committee, or FOMC, is the U.S. monetary policy decision -making body.  \n \n4 Of course, if inflation rises above 2 percent we should be just as worried on the upside.  \n \n5 See https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/review -of-monetary -policy -strategy -tools -and-\ncommunications -fed-listens -events.htm  \n \n6  For example, consider the experience in t he wake of the, albeit milder, 2001 recession: The Federal Reserve kept \nrates at their low point for just under a year, and then raised them quite regularly from 2004 to 2006.  \n \n7  In fact, long -term yields in Germa ny and Japan have recently fallen below zero.   \n \n8 The modal forecast is th e most likely outcome forecasters see for the economy.  \n \n9 Saying “The inflation rate over the longer run is primarily determined by monetary policy, and hence the \nCommittee has the ability to specify a longer -run goal for inflation.

I would like to thank the Economic Club of New York for inviting me to \njoin you today .  It is good to be with you.  \nMy remarks this afternoon will be about today’s economic environment , characterized by \nlow inflation and low unemployment  – and specifically about monetary policymaking in that \nenvironment .  I’ll touch on the outlook for the economy , and the Fed’s “dual mandate” goals  – \nmaximum sustainable employment and stable prices – where in the readings are sending \nsomewhat opposite signals at present.  I’ll spend some time walking you through the data and \nanalysis that underpin my views on the matter  of undershooting the target for inflation  that the \nFed has established .  And I’ll co mment on the implications for current policy , from my own \nperspective of course .  First, however, I’d like to spend a moment on trade, which is on \neveryone’s mind and of course has implications for prices and the broader economy.  \n \nTrade Issues and the U.S.  Economy  \nObviously , the last 10 days featured plenty of market volatility in response to difficulties \nsurrounding the trade negotiations between the United States and China .  It is still unclear \nwhether , and for how long , recently  proposed tariffs by the U.S. and China will be in effect .  \nU.S. tariffs are effectively taxes on imports , and our trading partners’ tariffs  are taxes they pay  \non our exports .1  Even before they are in place, an announce ment of a future tariff  might  affect \ntrade.2  In addition to the effects on imports and exports, policymakers would expect financial \nmarket s to react  to tariff announcements .  And if the tariffs are widespread  and prolonged , the \nfinancial market reaction would likely be greater, as would the overall slowing effect on  growth.   \n\n EMBARGOED UNTIL 12:10 P.M . on Tuesday, May 21,  2019 U.S. Eastern Time, OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n3 \n Of course, t ariffs matter when it comes to inflation , which we at the Fed are mandated to \nmanage .  In general, tariffs will tend to raise prices on imported goods  to the U.S.   Of course , \nthese effects can be mitigated by many factors, such as how easy it is to find alternatives to \ngoods subject to tariffs .  If Chinese produc ts have competitors in non -tariff locations , buyers in \nthe U .S. could simply shift purchases to  those competitors .  The same holds for U .S. exports.   \nBut general ly speaking , price levels for imported goods should rise due to the tariffs.3  \nHowever, for now, I am optimistically assuming that both sides in the trade negotiations will \nwork to reach an agreement .  I am also assuming that while the uncertainty is not helpful, it will \nbe transitory, and thus have only a modest effect on  the forecast  for the U.S. economy overall . \n \nThe Economic Outlook , and the Implications for Monetary Policy  \nSetting aside  recent trade -related  concerns , the broader U.S.  economy seems to  be \ndisplaying  a sounder footing than it was at the beginning of this year.  Equity markets declined \nsignificantly in the fourth quarter  of last year, but had largely recovered  prior to recent events.  \nOther  concerns  – for example , worries about foreign growth slowing as a result of Brexit , and \nabout the Chinese economy faltering  – appear to have subsided since the beginning of the year .  \nAnd first -quarter growth in the U.S. was stronger than many forecasters expected.   \nConsistent with a reduction in some non -trade risks , and improvement in financial \nconditions, the higher -frequency U.S. economic data to date  are consistent with a moderate pace \nof economic growth.  A recent survey of professional forecasters posted  a median growth rate for  \n2019  real GDP of 2.6 percent.4  While this growth rate is a little bit stronger than my own \n\n EMBARGOED UNTIL 12:10 P.M . on Tuesday, May 21,  2019 U.S. Eastern Time, OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n4 \n forecast, both the consensus outloo k and my own forecast suggest a modest step down from last \nyear’s pace but still imply enough momentum to push the unemployment rate  down even further .   \nClearly, h owever, the uncertainty surrounding U.S.-China trade negotiations pose s a \npotential downside risk to this forecast.  If the trade uncertainty is prolonged, financial markets \ncould retrench further , and households and firms could curtail spending .  While m y baseline \nforecast assumes that a trade agreement  will occur  without ser iously disrupting global trade or \nglobal economies, it may be some time before that uncertainty is resolved . \n Assuming that the consensus of private forecasters proves  right , and we continue to have \nsolid growth in the U .S. – with no significant foreign sh ocks – what should that imply for \nmonetary policy?   \nThe U.S. unemployment rate is currently at 3.6 percent, well below the median of Federal \nOpen Market Committee (FOMC) participants’ estimates5 of  the longer-run unemployment  rate,  \n4.3 percent , as described in the Fed’s most recent Summary of Economic Projections ( SEP).6  If \nthe central bank  focused only on labor markets, the current level of  unemployment might  call for \na somewhat more restrictive  monetary policy.   \nBut, of course , Congress has also charged the Fed with the responsibility of attaining a \nlow and stable inflation  rate.  As of the most recent reading, the core PCE inflation rate is 1.6 \npercent, somewhat below the Fed’s  2 percent inflation target .  These latest data foll ow a period \nof several years during which inflation ha d generally under run the 2 percent target , although the \nsame measure nearly reached 2 percent as recently as last December .  Lower than desired \ninflation might imply a somewhat accommodative , or looser,  policy  stance – to ensure that  \ninflation rise s more persistently  to the Fed’s  2 percent target.   \n\n EMBARGOED UNTIL 12:10 P.M . on Tuesday, May 21,  2019 U.S. Eastern Time, OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n5 \n The Fed ’s dual mandate from Congress had not posed this type of  conflict  in the early \nyears after the global financial crisis, as unemployment had  been undesirably high and inflation \nsomewhat low.  Both impl ied the need for monetary stimulus .  But today , the two elements of the \nFed’s  mandate are  sending opposing signals  for monetary policy, with low unemployment \nperhaps suggesting a bit tighter poli cy, and low inflation the opposite.  \n The Federal Reserve’s  current monetary policy framework says that policymakers  will \ntake a “balanced ” approach when the implications of our goals  are conflicting.  That is, \npolicymakers  will weight equally the extent to which employment and inflation deviate from \ntheir goals in setting policy.   \nIn weighing currently conflicting employment and inflation readings , it is important to \nconsider  whether the se opposing outcomes  are likely to persist, or reflect only temporary \ndeviations.  In current circumstances , if one were concerned that the economy would falter  \nsignificantly , the likely rise in unemployment and fall in inflation further  below target might lead \npolicymakers to  ease.   If, alternatively, one expect s the economy to grow quickly  and believes \nthat the recent decline in inflation was only temporary , a further decline in unemployment and \neventual rise in  inflation to target might lead policymakers  to tighten.  \nAnd in fact, c urrently most forecasts envision  the economy growing somewhat above the \nrate considered its “ potential ” this year , then slowing to a growth  rate somewhat below potential  \nin subsequent years .  And most see the current low readings on inflation as temporary.   \nIn this setting, I see no clarion call to alter current policy  in the near term .  I view current \npolicy as slightly accommodative and likely to be consistent with  inflation returning to the Fed’s  \n2 percent inflation target over time.  This is likely to occur more rapidly if tariffs are imposed.  \n\n EMBARGOED UNTIL 12:10 P.M . on Tuesday, May 21,  2019 U.S. Eastern Time, OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n6 \n However, given that inflation has underrun the  target over the last several years, it is wise to \nadmit to some uncertainty about this part of the forecast.  It is my view  that the Fed can afford to \nwait to see if that forecast does  indeed  materialize.  In addition, the  presence of a prominent  \ndownside risk – more disruptive trade negotia tions  – seems to me to  be another important reason \nfor policymaker patience until this source of uncertainty is more  resolved . \n \nChallenges with Undershooting I nflation  \n Now let me walk you through the data and analysis that underpin my views on the matter  \nof undershooting inflation . \nFigure 1  shows inflation as measured by the  core PCE inflation  rate, which excludes \nfood and energy prices, and total PCE inflation , which includes all consumer goods and servi ces \n– from January 2014 through March 2019 .   \nParenthetically, t he Fed’s  inflation goal is couched in terms of total inflation  – because , \nof course , food and energy prices are important components of consumers ’ expenditure s, but \neconomists  often look to core inflation as a measure that may better capt ure the underlying \nmovement of inflation .  As implied by the difference between the core and total inflation \nmeasures shown in Figure 1, f ood and energy prices can move around quite dramatically , but \nmost often those shifts are temporary and not reflective of the underlying inflation trend. Thus , \nthe core measure that excludes food and energy prices  may provide  a more reliable indicator of \nwhere the total inflation rate is heading .   \nBoth series – core and total – hit 2 percent toward the end of last year, but both are \ncurrently undershooting the 2 percent target.   As discussed a moment ago, a n important question \n\n EMBARGOED UNTIL 12:10 P.M . on Tuesday, May 21,  2019 U.S. Eastern Time, OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n7 \n for monetary policy makers  is whether these misses reflect more persistent factors, such as \nreduc ed inflationary pressures or a reduction in inflation expectations, or instead  more temporary \nfactors.  \n Figure 2  shows the same graph  as Figure 1  – now with a third line  representing  the \nTrimmed Mean PCE measure , which is calculated by the  Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas .7  The \nTrimmed Mean PCE inflation rate is an alternative measure of core inflation.   Rather than \nexcluding specific categories that tend to be volatile, like food and energy, the Trimmed Mean \nmeasure is more agnostic about which series are “noisy ,” and instead exclude s those prices that \nmoved up or down dramatically  during  a specific  period.  By excluding these outliers , it is hoped \nthat the Trimmed Mean  measure better captures the underlying trajectory of inflation , by \nfocusing on  the price movements of goods and services that did not experience unusually high or \nlow transient  price level movements that period.  As Figure 2 shows, the Trimmed Mean \nmeasure since 2014 has been gradually returning to the 2 percent inflation target, and is currently \n1.96 percent , which rounds to the Fed’s  2 percent inflation target.  \n Figure 3  provides an example of two prices  that declined  substantial ly recently : indices \nfor clothing and footwear , and for portfolio  management and investment  advice  services.  Note \nthat the scale is much larger than  in the previous two charts.  The behavior of the clothing and \nfootwear  category  is notable , because the price  index registered a decline of more than 2 percent \nin the most recent report. This movement ref lects, in part , changes in the way the government \ncollects information on apparel  prices, a change that presumably does not reflect underlying \npricing trends.  The price for portfolio  management  and investment advice  services is based on \nthe fees paid to asset managers and thus is tied to fluctuations in asset values, so th e downward \n\n EMBARGOED UNTIL 12:10 P.M . on Tuesday, May 21,  2019 U.S. Eastern Time, OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n8 \n movement in asset prices at the end of last year resulted in  a lower index  value  for this \ncomponent .  \nThese are two examples that demonstrate why looking at the Trimmed Mean PCE \ninflation rate  may provide  a better sense of the underlying inflation  trend .  One can see the \nbenefit of  exclud ing these sorts of large , but temporary , price changes.  \n Figure 4  shows the inflation forecasts from the previously mentioned Survey  of \nProfessional Forecasters , for core inflation through 2021.  The median forecast implies that \nrecent declines in inflation are indeed transitory, as the medi an forecast sees  core PCE very close \nto the Fed’s  2 percent inflation target in 2020 and 2021 . \n Given that inflation has been undershooting the Federal Reserve’s  2 percent inflation \ntarget over much of the last several years, it makes sense to ask why policymakers  should have \nmore success achieving the inflation target over the next several years ?  Certainly , one reason is  \nthat labor markets are tight.  Figure 5  shows FOMC participants’  median estimate for the \nunemployment  rate in the long er run, the solid line, along with the range of FOMC members’ \nestimate of  what the unemployment rate will be in the long er run, the shaded region.  The dashed \nline shows the actual unemployment rate.  At 3. 9 percent  for the first quarter of 2019 and more \nrecently 3.6 percent for the month of April , the current unemployment rate  is below not only the \nmedian estimate, but indeed the bottom of the range  of estimates  for full employment.  With \nlabor markets tighter than what is estimated as sustainable in the longer run, wages would be \nexpected to gradually rise.  Of course, w orkers  getting paid more  is good news, and up to a point \naccelerating wages can be paid by productivity gains and shrinking profit margins  – but at some \npoint , accelerating wages result in firms raising prices more quickly.   \n\n EMBARGOED UNTIL 12:10 P.M . on Tuesday, May 21,  2019 U.S. Eastern Time, OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n9 \n  Figure 6  shows that consistent with the recent and likely continued tightening of labor \nmarkets, wages and salaries have been gradually rising.  In the wake of the financial crisis, wage  \ngrowth  was quite low, but ha s now risen to about  3 percent , whether measured by average hourly \nearnings or by  the employment cost index measure of workers’  wages.  Wage growth  at 3 \npercent is consistent with a standard benchmark in which workers are compensated for cost-of-\nliving increases  — roughly 2 percent inflation  — plus the roughly 1 percent increase over the \nsame period in their productivity.  \n If productivity growth increases , wages can rise even further without putting pressure on \nthe net cost to employers, and thus easing the pressure on employers  to raise prices more quic kly \nto cover the higher wage costs .  Figure 7  shows a 20 -quarter moving average of a productivity \nmeasure, the change in real output per hour  worked .  This measure had dipped below 1 percent  – \nwell below productivity gains seen 15 years ago.  However, more recently this measure of \nproductivity has risen somewhat above 1 percent.   Again, i f productivity continues to gradually \nimprove, there should be room for non -inflationary wage increases  of the sort  that are not \n“financed” by low er profit margins .  However, in the absence of continued improvements in \nproductivity, a rising trend in wages could eventually  place upward pressure on inflation.  \n Another potential source of price pressures could be generated if tariffs become more \npreva lent and more persistent .  If virtually all goods imported from China were subject to tariffs, \nthe resulting increase  in prices would likely become much more apparent to consumers.  \n While tight labor markets and the potential for further t ariffs  could cause some upward \npressure on prices, it is interesting to note that inflation has been tracking below 2 percent for \nsome time.  Figure 8  shows the average rate of inflation over a variety of time periods .  For all \nof the periods displayed, average inflation has been below the Fed’s  2 percent target.8  Because \n\n EMBARGOED UNTIL 12:10 P.M . on Tuesday, May 21,  2019 U.S. Eastern Time, OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n10 \n our framework states  that the inflation target is to be  symmetric  — that is, the Fed  cares equally \nabout inflation that exceeds or falls short of 2 percent  — average  measured inflation would not \nbe expected to deviate significantly from  2 percent over long periods of time  in such a \nframework .  \n While policy  should not overreact to temporary inflation misses from the Fed’s  target, it \nwould not be desirable to continue consistently undershooting inflation.  Regularly \nundershooting could cause inflation expectations to decline, a process that has been shown to be \ndifficult to reverse in other developed areas, including Japan and Europe .  For this reason, the \ncurrent stance  of monetary policy, which I view as mildly accommodative, should be helpful in \nrestor ing inflation more convincingly to the 2 percent inflation target over time.  \n \nConcluding Observations  \n In sum, i nflation is  currently  below the Fed’s target, and has fairly consistently  been \nbelow  target  in recent years .  Still , labor markets remain tight , and there is  an upward trend in \nwages.  Given those current outcomes for our dual mandate  goals , I believe the Fed’s  current \nframework and its balanced approach  do not provide much impetus to alter the stance o f \nmonetary policy at this time . \n The Federal Reserve is currently conducting a review of its monetary policy framework , \nincluding  the strategy, tools, and communi cation practices the U.S. central bank  uses in pursui ng \nits dual mandate .  An interesting question for the ongoing discussion of the monetary policy \nframework is whether the Federal Reserve should aim for  somewhat above -target  inflation \nduring recoveries , knowing that it will likely  underrun its inflation goal in downturns or \n\n EMBARGOED UNTIL 12:10 P.M . on Tuesday, May 21,  2019 U.S. Eastern Time, OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n11 \n recessions .  This concern is heightened by the likelihood that prevailing short -term interest rates \nwill be  low, and thus more likely to  hit the effective lower bound  during downturns .   \n Such an approach  would not change the Fed’s  inflation target over the cycle .  Rather, it  \nmight reinforce the notion that policymakers  aim to achieve 2 percent inflation on average , not \nallowing long periods of below -2 percent inflation to reset inflation expectations below the  2 \npercent inflation goal .  \n Thank you.  \n \n \n1 If imposed, retaliatory tariffs affect both the amount  purchased and the prices paid of both imports and exports, \nboth for final purchases and for key inputs to products produced here and abroad. Thus a “trade war” can have a \nvariety of impacts on the economic outlook.  \n \n2 Specifically, imports and exports may  temporarily surge to avoid the tariff. On the other hand, if people assume \nthat a tariff will be temporary, perhaps because they believe that trade negotiations will eventually be successful, \nbuyers in the U .S. and China may defer purchases, awaiting a return to normal prices.  \n \n3 In terms of inflation, temporary tariffs will raise prices on imports. The price effects on imports could be muted if \nfirms can find suppliers with a similar -enough product that is not subject to the tariff, at a price below the after -tariff \nprice of the taxed good. Similarly, if exporters can find alternative markets, the price effect will be muted. But it is \nunlikely that this will be a common occurrence, at least in the short run, so the effect on producers’ and sellers’ costs \nwill often be hard to avoid. In addition, producers of un -tariffed products similar to those that have been so taxed \nmay view the imposition of tariffs as providing an opportunity to raise prices; this would be e specially true in \nindustries in which wages have been rising more quickly, squeezing profit margins.   \n \n4 The most recent survey was released by the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia on May 10 , 2019 .

Central European Summer Time (3:30 A.M. U.S. Standard Time)  \non Friday, June 21, 2019,  OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n1 \n  \nGood Morning.  I am very happy  to be here with you and to be able to offer comments on \nthe paper by Professor Mitsuhiro  Fukao .  I commend the conference organizers for convening \nthese important discussions of macroprudential issues.  \nMany would agree that  the Japanese financial  crisis was perhaps the m ost significant \nfinancial event  of the 1990s.  Indeed, b anking problems that brought about dramatic \nmacroeconomic effects had already been occurring in emerging markets , but the Japanese crisis \ndemonstrated  that developed countries with large financial institutions could experience  \nproblems that affected  not only their domestic economy , but also  global markets  and other \ncountries’ economies .   \nIn many ways, the Japanese banking crisis had a long aftermath and many residual \neffects .  Indeed, I would suggest that many of the fiscal and monetary policy issues that emerged \nin the Japanese c risis are still being grappled with today.  \n The paper by Professor Fukao provides rich details o f what led to th e financial crisis  in \nJapan .1  He emphasizes many of the macroeconomic dynamics  that contributed to financial \ninstitution s’ problems, particularly the asset price bubbles that had emerged in both real estate \nprices and stock prices.   These problems were compounded , of course,  by institutional features \nthat allowed banks to rapidly increase their real estate lending  – both directly, and through \nrelated Jusen,2 which grew as real estate prices rose .  The situation  was exacerbated by  the cross -\nholding s of shares  between banks and their customers, which increased exposure even  as the \nstock market rose.   In addition, many Japanese  banks did not have stable funding models .  The \nlong-term credit banks were particularly exposed to “runnable” sources of funding through their \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 9:30 A.M. Central European Summer Time (3:30 A.M. U.S. Standard Time)  \non Friday, June 21, 2019,  OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n2 \n use of easily -redeemed bank debentures, which  ran as emerging problems became more \napparent.3  These initial problems were compounded by other  factors  that hobbled financial \nintermediation and ultimately lengthened the time to recovery  in Japan  – in particular, the slow \nsupervisory and regulatory response .  (Banks were not forced to address problems,  transparency \nrelated to th ose problems was discouraged , and accounting strategies were adopted that \npostponed their recognition .)   \n I agree with Professor Fakao  that these elements are the primary source of the pre-crisis \nbuild -up, as well as important contributors to  the length of the crisis.  My remarks today , \nhowever, will focus on two aspects of the crisis which receive less attention in the paper.   \nThe first aspect I will cover  has to do with the significant macroeconomic repercussions \nof the Japan ese financial  crisis  of the late 1990s .  These repercussions , I will argue,  highlight the  \nimportan ce of  avoid ing replication of these problems, and why conferences like this one  that \nfocus on macroprudential supervision and regulation are so important.  Indeed, t his is th e second \naspect of the crisis on which I will spend some time today.   I believe  it is important to consider \nhow macroprudential regu lations – including appropriate stress testing and tools such as the \nCountercyclical Capital Buffer, or CC yB – could have mitigated the Japanese banking \nproblems.4  I will conclude my remarks with some observations  about the current Japanese \nbanking landscape . \n \nMacroeconomic Spillovers from Banking Problems  \n At the time of the Japanese banking crisis, much of the focus among economists and \npolicymakers was on avoiding the fiscal  problems generated by bank bailouts.  This focus \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 9:30 A.M. Central European Summer Time (3:30 A.M. U.S. Standard Time)  \non Friday, June 21, 2019,  OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n3 \n resulted in significant work on incentives5 created by deposit insurance and bank ba ilouts, and \nthe implications for taxpayers when these problems occurred.  There was much less focus , \nhowever,  on the  macroeconomic consequences of banking problems . \n Once Japanese real estate prices and stock prices began to decline, the banking problems \nspilled over to the real economy.  With non -performing loans rising, and capital eroding, \nJapanese banks tightened  lending conditions .6  (Loans, of course, are assets for banks so in times \nof diminished capital banks pull back on lending to maintain capital -to-asset ratios.)  At the same \ntime, and somewhat to the contrary, some Japanese  banks lent to weakened firms , temporarily \npropping the m up so as to avoid (or at least postpone) realization of losses , to avoid further \ndepleting bank capital .  This resulted in the allocation of the already -reduced supply of loanable \nfunds  towards “zombie”  firms ,7 a significant misallocation of credit .8  This misallocation of \ncredit even included firms focused on export s, as well as firms operating within the domestic \neconomy.9   \nHowever, the problems did not only affect the Japanese economy.  Because Japanese \nbanks were actively involved in global marke ts, capital -constrained banks that needed to reduce \nassets often reduced  their global lending before restricting domestic lending.10  This constituted \nan additional misallocation, as they often reduced lending to well-performing , collateralized \nborrowers in other countries  that were  not experiencing the sorts of difficulties  that were  being \nexperienced in Japan.11 \n The extent of the problem s revealed by the Japanese banking crisis should have been \nsufficient to lead many countries to enhance their suite of macroprudential tools.  Unfortunately, \nit took an even bigger and more global problem – the financial crisis that began in 2008  – before \ncountries turned to the job of improving macroprudential policies.  Given the polici es that have \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 9:30 A.M. Central European Summer Time (3:30 A.M. U.S. Standard Time)  \non Friday, June 21, 2019,  OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n4 \n been implemented subsequ ent to  the global financial crisis, I think it is fair to ask whether such \npolicies  would  have helped in the Japa nese situation .  While clearly speculative, my own view is \nthat with effective implementation of macroprudential policies, many of the issue s would have \nbeen substantially mitigated.  \n \nMacro prudential Tools \n Perhaps one of the most important policy innovations that grew out of the global financial \ncrisis of 2008 was the development and implementation of bank stress tests.  These  tests address  \nboth prudential and macroprudential goals .  An effective stress test assesse s whether , in the \npresence of a large negative shock, banks will be able to remain well capitalized and continue  to \nprovide intermediation services  so vital to economic activity .   \nAs Figures 1 and 2 show, real estate prices  and stock prices in Japan both began a \nparticularly sharp rise in the middle of the 1980s.  Capital gains on banks’ holdings of stocks and \nlow losses on their real estate portfolios led banks to p ut more money into real estate, amplifying \nthe cycle.  \n Had the Japanese authorities put in place bank  stress tests  – and rigorously applied the \nresults – the banking crisis may have been less severe.  Consider the fact that t he “severely \nadverse ” scenario  in this year’s U.S. stress test envisions a peak to trough decline in stock prices \nof 50  percent  and declines in residential and commercial real estate prices of 25  percent  and 35  \npercent, respectively.   Had Japanese superv isors applied  a similar stress test to Japanese banks , \nthe bank ing institutions  would have been encouraged to retain  much  more capital , giving them \nsignificantly more cap ital as a buffer  when asset prices did decline.  It would have also \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 9:30 A.M. Central European Summer Time (3:30 A.M. U.S. Standard Time)  \non Friday, June 21, 2019,  OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n5 \n highlighted the exposure to Jusen  and to stock ho ldings, potentially forcing  banks  to reduce these \nexposure s, since these areas would carry higher capital charge s.  Since stress tests are normally \nreleased publicly, some of the potential systemic concerns could have been publicly recognized  \nearlier, potentially making it less feasible to  hide losses.  This greater transparency might also \nhave led to a more vigorous recapitalization of banks.  \n A second tool that would have been helpful is the CCyB.   As asset prices rose abruptly, \nsupervisors could have  increased the  CCyB , building  a much bigger bank capital cushion during \nthe period when asset prices rose.  Complementing  the stress test, this capital cushion would \nhave further insulated banks from  the capital -eroding effects  of falling asset prices , and likely \nwould have discouraged aggressive lending into increasingly risky sectors .  Importantly, once \nasset prices began to fall , the CCyB could have been reduced  – easing  binding capital \nrequirements , and therein reducing the pressure on  banks to shri nk domestic and global  lending .  \nWhile buffers  induced by stress tests or the CCyB  would have been unlikely to completely \neliminate the “ credit crunch ” caused by  binding capital  requirements , they would certainly have \nhelped.  \n \nJapanese Banking Problems Today  \n Today, one must acknowledge that the state of the Japanese macroeconomy  poses \nsignificant challenges for Japanese banks.  The country ’s aging population an d very low birth \nrates  reduce the available lending opportunities for banks.  In addition, because these \ndemographic features imply a lower real growth rate for the economy, they have contributed to \nvery low term premia, and this makes less profitable  the traditional role that financial \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 9:30 A.M. Central European Summer Time (3:30 A.M. U.S. Standard Time)  \non Friday, June 21, 2019,  OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n6 \n intermediaries play in transform ing short -term deposits into long-term loans.   With monetary \npolicy keeping both short - and long -term rates very close to zero, the  spread of long over short \nrates that is normally an important source of profits for banks is almost nonexistent .   \nAs Figure 3  shows, the average return on assets for the largest banks  in Japan  is quite \nlow, and significantly lags that of the largest banks in the U .S. and Europe.  As shown in Figure \n4, the difficult  lending environment has also resulted in an average price to tangible book  ratio – \na measure of the market value of the bank  – which  lags international peers.  \n Naturally, a  prolonged period of depressed returns may encourage bank management to \nreach for yield.  One example of this reach -for-yield behavior might be  seen in Japanese banks ’ \ninvest ments  in tranches of collateralized loan obligations, or CLOs.  Although t he AAA tranches \nof CLOs receive high assessments  from rating agencies, they also pay substantial premiums \nrelative to U .S. Treasuries or  the AAA tranches of other securitized products , reflecting the \nmarket’s assessment of their riskiness .  This raises questions not only about the comparability of \nratings across asset classes, but also , more importantly , about how such positions will fare in t he \nnext downturn.  \n Figure 5  shows the CLO holding s of one large Japanese bank  that publicly reports them .  \nThe data are drawn from the bank’s publicly available annual report.   Over the past three years, \nthe bank’s CLO exposure has risen  – as reported in the financial press – and is now larger than \nthe bank’s Tier 1 common equity.  While CLO structures have improved since  the financial \ncrisis, the riskiness their large premiums reflect , as well as  the lack of liquidity , could become \nprobl ematic in a depressed global economy , should such a scenario emerge .12  Even if the \ntranches in question did not default, t heir ratings , along with their market valuations,  would \nlikely migrate lower.  \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 9:30 A.M. Central European Summer Time (3:30 A.M. U.S. Standard Time)  \non Friday, June 21, 2019,  OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n7 \n  The combination of  low returns and seeming reach -for-yield behavior raises important \nquestions about whether Japanese banks will remain resilient  in a possible future global \nrecession , should one occur .  How critical are more vibrant and profitable banks for dynamism in \nthe economy?   And how will  Japan’s banks fare in  an economic downturn given their current \nperformance?    \n \nConcluding Observations  \n In summary and conclusion, I would observe that t he Japanese  financial  crisis  of the late \n1990s  bore significant implications  for the entire Japanese e conomy .  The banking problems \nwere costly to taxpayers, as significant government resources were employed to recapitaliz e the \nbanks .  However, much more importantly, Japan ’s domestic economy was severely impacted , \nwith lasting  effects .  In addition, because of the global reach of the largest Japanese banks, the \nproblems were essentially exported , as Japanese banks pulled back on foreign lending in order to \nbring  assets better in line with their shrunken capital .  Essentially , Japanese banks reduce d their \nglobal footprint.  \n Had macroprudential policies been in place  and exercised , some of these problems might  \nhave been mitigated.  Rigorous stress tests would have revealed emerging problems, required \nretention of more bank capital, and di scouraged aggressive lending.  A CCyB  would  similarly  \nhave brought about a larger capital cushion to absorb shocks , which would  have reduced the \nneed for such dramatic shrinkage of lending when asset prices declined.  \n Despite the passage of time and adoption of better policies, one could argue that the \nJapanese banking system is now, once again , being threatened by adverse economic conditions.  \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 9:30 A.M. Central European Summer Time (3:30 A.M. U.S. Standard Time)  \non Friday, June 21, 2019,  OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n8 \n A shrinking population, aging demographics, and very low interest rates prov ide very little room \nfor Japanese banks to operate profitably .  This of course  provides an  incentive to reach for yield , \npotentially implying  additional risk-taking.   \nAll this raises questions about  how res ilient the banking system is , or could be,  in the  face \nof some future global downturn .  All in all, my view is that  Japan, like the U nited States, might \nbenefit from considering an expanded set of macroprudential tools to enhance  the financial \nsystem’s resilience in the face of potential global economic scenarios.  \n Thank you again for the opportunity to discuss Professor Fukao’s paper and to offer these \ncomments on the macroprudential implications of the 1990s Japanese financial  crisis.  \n \n1 See Causes of Japanese Financial Crisis in the late 1990s , Mitsuhiro Fukao.  \n \n2 Jusen are non -bank financial institutions in Japan, created in the 1970s as subsidiaries of banks.  \n \n3 A Bank debenture is an unsecured loan certificate issued by a company, backed by general credit rather than by \nspecified assets.  \n \n4 For additional  discussion of the CCyB and other financial stability  policy tools , see March 23, 2018 remarks at the \nTenth Conference of the International Research Forum on Monetary Policy by Eric S.

EST on Friday, July 19, 2019, OR UPON DELIVERY  \n1 \n  Good afternoon.  It is a pleasure  to serve on a panel with such distinguished  central \nbankers , to discuss the very important issue of central bank independence.  The experience and \nglobal reach of the panelists serve as reminders that th e issue of independent central banks is \nhighly relevant around  the world.  \n As I begin and throughout my remarks t oday, I hope to clarify  what central bank \nindependence  is, and what it isn’t.1  Doing so requires  distinguish ing between the “what” and the \n“how” of monetary policy in the U.S. – what goals the central bank is supposed to achieve, and \nhow it pursues those goals.2  \nIn the U.S., the what  is the set of Congressionally  mandated  goals for monetary policy , \nfor which the c entral bank is accountable.  The how encompasses the tools authorized by \nCongress and how we use them , which the Fed has altered over time to achieve those goals  as \nconditions change.  To me, central banks need not have independence with respect to the what – \nthe end goals, which are set by the elected representatives.  But central banks should have \nindependence with respect to the how – the means of getting there .  Former Federal Reserve \nVice Chair Stanley Fischer referred to this as having “instrument independence” but not “goal \nindependence.”3 \nRegarding what  a central bank is charged with achieving, I believe t he people’s elected \nrepresentatives in government sh ould set goals for the nation’s central bank.  In many countries \nthere is a single  stated mandate  given to the central bank – for example, achieving  a particular \nnumerical inflation rate , or keeping  the inflation rate within a particular range.4  In contra st, since \n1977 the Federal Reserve in the United States has operated under a dual Congressional mandate , \nwith the two goals essentially summed up as maximum sustainable employment and stable \nprices.5   \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 4:30 P.M. EST on Friday, July 19, 2019, OR UPON DELIVERY  \n2 \n No consideration of independence would be complete wit hout a discussion of \naccountability.  So, before turning to the “how” I’d like to digress for a moment, to provide a bit \nof detail on the Fed’s mandate, as well as the Fed’s accountability for implementing its mandate \nin the public interest.6 \nIn January 20 12, the Fed (through its policymaking Federal Open Market Committee or \nFOMC)  adopt ed a formal monetary policy framework  containing the explicit numerical objective \nthat it views as consistent with its Congressional price -stability mandate.7  The FOMC noted in \nits statement that the Committee judged that inflation at the rate of 2 percent8 was most \nconsistent over the longer run with the Fed’s statutory mandate.9   \nAt the same time it reiterated its commitment to attaining the other aspect of  the dual \nmandate, maxim um sustainable  employment .  On this, let me note that the maximum sustainable \nemployment  rate may change over time depending on variables beyond the Fed’s control, such \nas the demographic  composition of the workforce, and other labo r market characteristics .  As \nsuch, the framework recognizes that the Fed cannot choose a target for maximum employment.  \nSo the Fed aims to achieve its best estimate of maximum sustainable employment, recognizing \nthat the factors that determine it change over time.  \nThe Federal Reserve Reform Act of 1977, which added the dual mandate, also contained \nthe first of several iterations of accountability mechanisms for the Fed’s execution of its dual \nmandate, including reporting to and consultation with Congress.10  Today, under Section 2B of \nthe Federal Reserve Act,11 the Chairman of th e Board of Governors is required  to testify at semi -\nannual hearings before Congress ional committees12 on efforts, activities, objectives and plans of \nthe Fed in conducting monetary po licy.  The Fed is also required to submit written reports to \nCongress on the conduct of monetary policy and economic developments and prospects, taking \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 4:30 P.M. EST on Friday, July 19, 2019, OR UPON DELIVERY  \n3 \n into account develop ments in unemployment, productivity, exchange rates, international trade, \nand other factors .  This appearance and reporting process is a key way  in which Congress \noversees the Federal Reserve and holds it accountable for the responsibilities it has been \ndelegated.    \nWhile in some countries an explicit  numerical  inflation goal is mandated by the \ngovernment,13 in the United States  only the broad  goals of price stability and maximum \nemployment are  set by the government and are somewhat open to  interpret ation  by the Federal \nReserve  – and explicitly answered to in monetary policy hearings.  \n Havi ng touched on the “what,” let me say that how a central bank achieves its goal or \ngoals is inherently a more technical enterprise.  It includes the specific instruments used to \ninfluence the economy, the operating details of how these instruments are to be  implemented, the \nstrategies to weigh various economic conditions in determining the setting of policy instruments, \nthe models used to make sense of economic data and to forecast outcomes over time, and the \ncommunications that the central bank uses to clar ify its intent and augment the transmission of \npolicy through financial markets.  \nSimply put,  monetary policy  decisions center primarily on the technical processes by \nwhich central banks determine how best to interpret and implement the government -mandated \ngoals.  For example, understanding how key economic relationships in the economy work to \ntransmit central bank actions to employment and inflation outcomes, and trying to detect when \nsuch relationships are changing, are both the sorts of technical endeavor s that are central to \nsetting policy.   \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 4:30 P.M. EST on Friday, July 19, 2019, OR UPON DELIVERY  \n4 \n It is important that central banks have flexibility to adjust  their tactics to a changing \neconomic environment .14  This technical work often needs to be completed quickly.  Also , it is \nquite possible that the mandated  goals of the central bank – which center on attaining medium -\nrun economic prosperity – can differ substantially from the understandably shorter -term \npressures facing elected officials.   Allowing  the central bank  the independence to alter its \ninstruments  as it deems necessary in the short - to medium -run reduces the possibility that \npolitical  or partisan  pressures will divert the central bank from its mandated monetary policy \ngoals . \nTo reiterate , central bank independence is not about deciding what to pursue  but rather \nallowing the central bank to determine how best to pursue it  (while  holding the central bank \naccountable for as much) .  For the Federal Reserve, while long -term goals are determined by \nCongress,  the day-to-day implementation of policies is and should be  conducted based on data \nand technical analysis, independent of short -term political objectives .15 \n Now I will briefly cover a few key insights from academic work on central bank \nindependence.  Then I’ll turn to the economic data to consider the im plications of central bank \nindependence, and look at the change over time in certain concepts focus ed on  by the central \nbank, as evidenced by mentions in official meeting records.  I’ll also briefly touch on the Fed’s \nreview, under way, of its monetary policy framework.  This exercise demonstrates, in my view, \nthe Fed’s commitment to using its tactical independ ence, coupled with accountability and \ntransparency, to service the public interest.  \n \n \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 4:30 P.M. EST on Friday, July 19, 2019, OR UPON DELIVERY  \n5 \n Emergence of Formal Studies of Central Bank Independence  in Academic  Literature   \nIn order to understand central bank independence, it is important to take into account  \nsome of the academic literature on the subject.  It is notable that much of this literature emerged \nfrom the study of periods in which inflation was high and variable, and in some cases in which \ncentral governments used their country’s central bank to achiev e fiscal objectives , essentially  \n“printing money” to finance spending without regard for the inflationary consequences.16  \nMuch of the earliest academic literature on central bank independence in the U .S. was \nmotivated by the historical experience of high and variable inflation in the late 1960s and early \n1970s.   In particular , Allan Meltzer’s A History of the Federal Reserve  documents how closely \nFederal Reserve Chairman Arthur Burns consulted with the Nixon administration, and attributes \nthe accommod ative monetary policy of that time to responding to executive branch pressure to \nsupport the expansion of fiscal policy, given the Vietnam War.17     \nAs inflation  rose dramatically  in the late 1960s and the 1970s, economists began to focus \non the institutional reasons behind the failure to contain inflation.  Many of the earliest academic \narticles focused on political economy motivations for a central bank allow ing inflation  to rise .  \nFor ex ample, Robert Barro and  David  Gordon ’s A Positive Theory o f Monetary Policy in a \nNatural Rate Model  provide s a model where in the central bank tries to over-stimulate the \neconomy , pushing the economy  below the natural rate of unemployment, which the public \nanticipates, resulting in higher inflation.18  They suggest, h owever, that this bias can be \nattenuated or even avoided, if the central bank is constrained  to focus on maintaining low \ninflation.  How to constrain the central bank to avoid this inflationary bias is a non -trivial \nproblem, and an issue that Ken neth Rogoff’s The Optimal Degree of Commitment to an \nIntermediate Monetary Target  seeks to address .  Rogoff essentially advocates for a simple model \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 4:30 P.M. EST on Friday, July 19, 2019, OR UPON DELIVERY  \n6 \n where the central banker places more weight on inflation than an elected government would, and \nas a result generates a lower inflation rate.19  \nThis theoretical literature was followed by  empirical studies that focused on empirical \nmeasures of central bank independence, looking in the data for an association between the \nindependen ce of central banks so measured and their countries’ inflation outcomes.20  In general, \nthe studies  found that countries with more independent central banks have lower inflation rates , \ncompared with countries with less independent central banks.  These empirical findings have \nbeen used to  support the international trend toward s central bank independence , but so too have \nthe egregious examples in which some governments use their central bank as a printing press, \nuniformly leading to poor economic outcomes . \n \nThe Evolution  and Implications of  Independen ce  \n In the United States, the independence of the Fed eral Reserve  has evolved along with \ngeneral ly held  views on the benefits of central bank  independence.21  Figure 1  highlights  periods \nwhere actual economic outcomes deviated from maximum employment and stab le prices since \n1960 .  It plots the “loss function” for the Fed, expressed as the sum of squared  deviation s of \nunemployment from an estimate of the natural rate of unemployment , and squared deviations of \ninflation from  two different esti mates of the target for inflation.22  The largest losses , as the chart \nshows,  occur in the 1970s as inflation and unemployment rose ; in the early 1980s when Federal \nReserve Chairman Paul Volcker slowed down the economy, raising unemployment significantly \nso as to bring down the elevated inflation rate ; and in the aftermath of the financial crisis  of \n2008 , when unemployment (but not inflation) was quite elevated .  The losses of the 1970s \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 4:30 P.M. EST on Friday, July 19, 2019, OR UPON DELIVERY  \n7 \n clearly ha d their roots in the lack of independence Al lan Meltzer documented.  The 1980s losses \nwere indirectly related to independence, too, as they stemmed from the painful but necessary \nremedies to the earlier era where independence was compromised.  \n Of course t his figure  reflects the U.S. experience.  But longer e conomic history around \nthe world contains more dramatic examples in which monetary policymakers lack ed \nindependence from the short -term financing constraints faced by fiscal policymakers, sometimes \nresulting in ruinous h yperinflation.  We learn what central bank independence is , not only \nthrough academic studies, but  also through its absence  during such episodes.  \nThe framework the Fed found itself in during th e 1960s and 1970s raised doubts that the \ncentral bank could attain its goals , likely related to the concern that the Fed had not been as \nindependent of short -run goals as it should have been, resulting in elevated inflation .  Figure 2  \nprovides mentions  of the word “credibility” from FOMC meeting transcripts .23  The word  \nreceived little attention during the 1960s and early 1970s, but became increasingly common  as \nthe inflation rate rose after the mid -1970s.  Once th e amended Federal Reserve Act  provided \nmore explicit goal s for monetary policy, the F ederal Reserve sought  to maintain credibility in \norder to achieve price stability.  With a clearer mandate  that delegated the attainment of ultimate \ngoals to the FOMC,  the policy -making body  was empowered to take actions consistent with that \nmandate.  \nHowev er, a clearer mandate also means making unpopular decisions, sometimes at \ninopportune times , as discussed in the seminal Barro and Gordon work .  Specifically, in order to \navoid the tendency to overheat the economy and build inflationary pressures, the cent ral bank \nhas, at times , needed to slow an unsustainably rapid expansion by raising interest rates.  Such \npolicy actions may not be uniformly popular, even if they aim to sustain an expansion and avoid \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 4:30 P.M. EST on Friday, July 19, 2019, OR UPON DELIVERY  \n8 \n the costs of rising inflation.   Such times particularly require greater transparency  about what the \nFed is doing, and why .  As Figure 3  shows, the mentions  of the word  “transparency ” in FOMC \nrecords has risen over the past 20 years.   \nTransparency also improves accountability.  For examp le, increas ed transparency at the \nFed has included clarifying annually our strategy of long -term goals and objectives , at the first \nFOMC meeting  of the year , and adopting an explicit inflation target of 2 percent.  What’s more, \nincreased transparenc y around  goals  make s it easier for the public and Congress to evaluate how \nwell the Fed’s actions are performing relative to those goals .  \nBecause Congress provides oversight  of the central bank , but naturally respond s to public \nconcerns, it has become quite important for the Fed to communicate more clearly not only with \nCongress, but also with the public at large.  This increased focus on clarity and transparency is \nshown by the increased mentions  of the word “ communic ation ” in FOMC meetings , in Figure 4 .  \nCommunication played very little role in the meetings prior to 1990, but has become much more \nof a priority .24  Announcements around FOMC meetings – which  had once  been quite obscure  – \nnow include a statement  describing the policy action and its justification , a press conference  with \nthe Chair of the FOMC,  detailed minutes  released shortly after the meeting,  and, with a lag, \nverbatim transcripts.  In addition, all FOMC members – members of the Fed’s Board of \nGovernors and the 12 Reserve Bank presidents – deliver economic outlook talks that provide \nupdates on the state of the economy and how the economic data align with our dual mandate.  \nGiven all this, the public has the opportunity for much greater visibility  into the actions the Fed  \ntakes, and hopefully a much better understanding of why we believe these actions are necessary \nto attain the public’s long -run goals .   \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 4:30 P.M. EST on Friday, July 19, 2019, OR UPON DELIVERY  \n9 \n With greater clarity on goals, and more transparency and communication around how \npolicymakers  alter policy  to achieve those goals, there has been considerable success in changing \nthe inflation experience .  Figure 5  shows that the FOMC  in its deliberations has focused on \nkeeping inflation expectations well anchored  – by which we  mean ensuring that the public \nbelieves the Fed will act to consistently attain its  inflation target .  The hope is that a highly \ncredible inflation goal will lead to well -anchored inflation expectations which, in turn, will imply \nthat temporary changes in p rices will not lead individuals to alter their longer -run expectations of \ninflation, and thus short -run blips in inflation will be transitory rather than persistent.   Figure 6  \nshows a marked change in the behavior of inflation since the late 1970s.  The hi gh and variable \ninflation of the 1970s has been replaced by a low and remarkably stable rate of inflation since the \nearly 1990s . The Dallas Fed’s Trimmed Mean PCE inflation rate measure, the solid  line, shows \nthat the temporary blips in inflation discussed above have indeed remained temporary, and so \ninflation has remained quite close to policymakers’  2 percent target for most of the past two \ndecades.  \nAn advantage of a stable inflation process with  well-anchored expectations is that it \nprovides the central bank greater leeway to offset bouts of high unemployment during recessions. \nFigure 7 highlights that while monetary policymakers  have more flexibility with well -anchored \ninflation expectations, th ose expectations cannot be taken for granted.  Following periods in \nwhich the economy has stretched beyond full employment, recessions frequently ensued.   \nEarlier in our hi story, increased inflationary pressures forced the central bank to react with \ntighter credit conditions.  More recently, an over -stretched economy has been associated with \nconcerns about financial instability.   \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 4:30 P.M. EST on Friday, July 19, 2019, OR UPON DELIVERY  \n10 \n Indeed, a s Figure 8  highlights, the FOMC  has increasingly discus sed financial stability \nconcerns  at its policy meetings .  The mentions of terms associated with financial instability \nduring FOMC discussions , tracked in the figure , reflect the significant financial -market \nturbulence  that led to, and accompanied, the past two recessions .  Central bankers strive to attain \nsustainable  economic expansions.  Financial instability that arises in part from an overheated \neconomy has been the proximate cause of recent U.S. downturns.  Thus, maintaining a focus on \nfinancial stability concerns remains critical .  \n \nCentral Bank Independence and the Fed’s Monetary Policy Framework  \n Independence is one element of a much broader issue – the monetary policy framework. \nThis year , the Federal Reserve has embarked on a broad  review  of its framework  – that is,  the \nstrategy, tools, and communication practices the Fed  uses to pursue its monetary policy goals .  \nBecause the Fed wants to hear from a broad set of public constituents about its performance in \nattaining goals on their behalf, t his review include s a “listening tour ” with forums featuring a \nwide range of public perspectives at Reserve Banks  across the country  and at the Board of \nGovernors in Washington D.C.  A Federal Reserve System -sponsored conference held at the \nFederal Reserve Bank of  Chicago , for instance, solicit ed viewpoints from both academic \nresearchers and representatives of low -income and under -represented groups .  Later t his year, the \nFOMC  will discuss the economic research and public perspectives offered during  these events,  \nand will  determine whether the F ed should consider  changes to its framework consistent with the \ngoals established  by Congress.  \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 4:30 P.M. EST on Friday, July 19, 2019, OR UPON DELIVERY  \n11 \n  This may seem like an unusual event, and in some respects it is, but i t is important to note \nthat the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy framework has changed signi ficantly over the past 50 \nyears .25  For example , Figure 9 shows how frequently money aggregates and specifically M1 \nand M2 we re mentioned  during FOMC meetings  since the 1960s .  While they received \nsignificant attention during the 1970s and 1980s, they have not been mentioned with any  great  \nfrequency over the past 20 years.  The decision to deemphasi ze money aggregates in \npolicymaking reflected real-world changes in financial markets and financial institutions  – \nchanges  that made aggregates less reliable  indicator s of underlying macroeconomic \nfundamentals , which in turn made monetary policy based on these aggregates less effective at \nachieving the Fed’s goals .   \nMore recently, during the financial crisis, the Federal Reserve aggressively used  asset \npurcha ses (in shorthand,  its balance sheet ) to lower long -term interest rates so as to stimulate the  \neconomy during the  extended financial turmoil and an economic downturn , once short -term \ninterest rates reached the effective lower bound .  Figure 10  shows that the Fed’s balance sheet \ndid not receive  much attention , in terms of mentions during FOMC meetings,  prior to the crisis – \nbut became widely discussed as interest rates approached zero  during the financial crisis .  \nSimilarly, Figure 11  shows that  “forward guidance ” – that is, communications that are used to \nshape expectations about the future path of interest rates – was a tool that was primarily \ndiscussed only when  short -term interest rates approached zero.  Both of these tools reflect ed \nchanges in the Fed’s  framework that were responses to evolving conditions and the realities of \nthe moment – the need to continue to provide monetary stimulus despite short -term interest rates \nbeing at the effective lower bound , yet with an unemployment rate still well above a level \nconsistent with maximum employment.   \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 4:30 P.M. EST on Friday, July 19, 2019, OR UPON DELIVERY  \n12 \n My examples are chosen to demonstrate that the value of independence lies not only in \ndelegating the setting of the policy instrument to the central bank, but also in providing the \ncentral bank the f reedom to change other aspects of its framework as it deems necessary to best \nachieve its mandated goals.  This ability to dynamic ally change the implementation of monetary \npolicy  — flexibility in the how with which I began this discussion  — is a critical aspect of \nindependence that has received less attention in the discourse around central bank independence .   \nImportantly, w hile the tactics  the Fed chose in response to evolving economic circumstance were \ninnovative and new, they did not change the what —that is, they were consistent with meeting the  \noverarching  statutory mandate provided by Congress to return as quickly as possible to \nmaximum  sustainable  employment and price stability.    \nOur history shows that the Fed has frequently changed the instrume nts it uses to attain \npolicy goals, and has changed how the Committee has used communications to explain its \ndecisions, articulate its goals, shape expectations, and improve accountability for its delegated \nauthority.  An issue of particular importance is recognizing that consistently attaining the 2 \npercent inflation target has become increasingly challenging in a world with very low interest \nrates, which implies a higher likelihood that future economic downturns will result in short -term \nrates quickly hit ting their effective lower bound.  The Fed’s  current framework review will try to \nassess whether there are ways in which we might change the how of policy to better address this \nchallenge going forward, ensuring that inflation and inflation expectations remain well anchored  \naround our two percent goal.   \nMy own view is that o pen and transparent discussions of monetary policy issues  will help \nprovid e the public a better understanding of those challenges and how the central bank hopes to \naddress them.  For a central bank to prove the value of its tactical  independen ce, it needs to \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 4:30 P.M. EST on Friday, July 19, 2019, OR UPON DELIVERY  \n13 \n evolve with changes in the economy, and explain clearly why its policie s are consistent with \nachieving the overarching mandate  from the peoples’ elected representatives . \n \nConcluding Observations  \nThe Federal Reserve receives its mandate from Congress and is accountable to the public \nand their Congress ional representatives  for carry ing out that mandate.  The appropriate central \nbank i ndependence for the Fed  is not independence from Congressional oversight or \naccountability , nor is it independence to set some new, broad goals that supersede those \nmandated by Congress .26  However, the degree of independence  the Fed has  over the “how” or \nthe “means” (instrument independence) has included  the flexibility to implement  monetary \npolicy in a way that responds effectively to changing  economic conditions so as to best achieve \nthe Fed’s  Cong ressional dual mandate of maximum employment and price stability.   \nEmpirical work has highlighted that  better economic outcomes occur over the longer term \nwhen the central bank’s policy implementation is independent from the type of cyclicality that \ncan b e induced by trying to meet short -term objectives.   In the U.S., that independence is based \non a combination of delegated responsibility to achieve the legislated mandate, along with a \ndecades -long process of developing understanding among legislators, adm inistrations, the public, \nand the central bank about the long -run benefits of central bank independence – essentially, that \nthe primary goal of the Fed is to attain the long -run goals  that best serve the public’s interests . \nIn closing I will provide a more  colloquial rationale for the delegation of  the “how” that \ncomes with  central bank independence.  In truth, in modern life we  ask people all the time to act \non our behalf , with independence .  For example, lots of very smart people leave it to commercial \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 4:30 P.M. EST on Friday, July 19, 2019, OR UPON DELIVERY  \n14 \n airline pilots to get them to their destination , plot ting the best course and fly ing the p lane through \nany emergencies.  B ut we expect the  pilots  to keep us informed, too.  And we certainly expect \nhomebuilders to construct what i s in our blueprints, but we  leave the plumbing and wiring to \nthem , albeit with frequent reports and updates .  And  speaking from personal experience,  some \npeople hire a wedding planner or caterer to help execute a wonderful event – one that they  \ndescribed and helped to plan,  but in the end  leave to the  wedding planner to execute,  \ntroubleshoot , and also not let things get out of hand.27  All analogies are imperfect, but these \nillustrations bear some similarities to central banking.  \n Thank you again for the opportunity to be part of such a distinguished panel and to offer \nthese comments on central bank independence.  \n  \nNOTES  \n \n1 The focus of this talk is governance issues related to monetary policy.  It is important to note, however, that the \nFederal Reserve also plays an important role in bank supervision, financial stability, and the U.S. payment system.  \nThese remarks do not a ddress governance issues related to these other functions of the Federal Reserve.  \n \n2 Some would suggest it also entails broadening a bit the notion of what is included in the “how.” Traditionally, \nindependence has focused on the freedom to set our policy i nstrument in the way that we think will best achieve our \ngoals. It may well be worth exploring including in the domain of independence additional elements of our monetary \npolicy “framework” — including which policy instrument we use, the tactics we use to s et the instrument, and the \nways we communicate about the rationale for our policy, as well as our intentions for future policy. But that \nexploration is largely beyond the scope of my talk today.  \n \n3 See Nov. 4, 2015 speech by Vice Chair Fischer entitled, Central Bank Independence , at the 2015 Herbert Stein \nMemorial Lecture National E conomists Club, Washington, D.C . In this speech he discussed the difference between \n“instrum ent independence” in which “the central bank has control over the policy instruments it has been assigned ,” \nand “goal independence” in the establishment of operational goals.     \n \n4 Australia is an example of a country that has an inflation range.  Australia's inflation target is to keep the annual \nconsumer price index (CPI) inflation rate between 2 and 3 percent, on average, over time.  \n \n5 The Federal Reserve Act provides the followi ng monetary policy goals, “promote effectively the goals of \nmaximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long -term interest rates.”  The first two are the dual mandate.                                                              \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 4:30 P.M.

See https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/FOMC_LongerRunGoals.pdf .  \n \n8 As measured by the annual change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures.  \n \n9 January 25, 2012 was the first time that the Federal Reserve released a n FOMC statement of longer -run goals and \nmonetary policy strategy that included an explicit inflation target: “The Committee judges that inflation at the rate of \n2 percent, as measured by the annual change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures, is most \nconsistent over the longer run with the Federal Reserve's statutory mandate.”  \n \n10 The Full Employment and Balanced Growth Act of 1978 (better known as the Humphrey -Hawkins Act) amended \nthe Employment Act of 1946.  \n \n11 American Homeownership and Economic Opportunity Act of 2000 (114 Stat. 2 944, 3028), adding a new Section \n2B to the Federal Reserve Act, 12 U.S.C. Section 225b.  \n \n12 The Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs and the House of Representatives C ommittee on \nFinancial Services.  \n \n13 The European Central Bank is mandated to achieve only price stability, but the ECB has provided the specific \nimplementation goal.  The Governing Council adopted this definition in 1998: “Price stability is defined as a ye ar-\non-year increase in the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) for the euro area of below 2 percent.”  It then \nfurther clarified price stability in 2003 as: “It aims to maintain inflation rates below, but close to, 2 percent over the \nmedium term.”  Thus, a verbal mandate with clear implementation guidance by the central bank is consistent with \nthe practice in the United States, though the United States has a dual mandate.  The Bank of England receives an \nannual letter from the government confirming th e explicit mandate they should follow.  The 2018 letter provides an \nexample: “The Bank of England Act 1998 (the Act) requires that I specify the definition of price stability and the \ngovernment’s economic policy objectives at least once in every period of 12 months beginning on the anniversary of \nthe day the Act came into force.  I am doing that today by publishing the remit for the Monetary Policy Committee, \nwhere the only change is an update to the timing of the open letter process.  I hereby re -confirm t he inflation target \nas 2 per cent as measured by the 12 -month increase in the Consumer Prices Index (CPI). The inflation target of 2 per \ncent is symmetric and applies at all times. This reflects the primacy of price stability and the forward -looking \ninflat ion target in the UK monetary policy framework.” See: \nhttps://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/upload s/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/752077/PU2207_\nMPC_remit_web.pdf   \n \n14 For example, as money aggregates became less predictive of inflation, the Federal Reserve stopped focusing \nmonetary policy decisions on growth in money aggregates.  \n \n15 For a more skep tical legal discussion of the need for central bank independence see Conti -Brown, P.

Rosengren  \nPresident & Chief Executive Officer  \nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston  \n \n \nThe Leo J. Meehan School of Business,  \nStonehill College  \n \n \nEaston, Massachusetts   \nSeptember 3 , 2019  \n \n \n \n\n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL  \n5 P.M. U.S. Standard Time on Tuesday, September 3, 2019 OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n \n \n1  Good afternoon .  Let me begin by thanking Stonehill College for i nviting me to speak .  \nAnd l et me also congratulate the College on the opening of the new Meehan School of Business.  \nSummer is usually regarded as a time to be more relaxed, take some vacation time, and \nput your worries aside.   In summertime,  Gershwin suggested , the livin’ is easy.    \nUnfortunately, this year, the financial markets didn’t get the memo.  August saw a  series \nof announcements regarding  possible  additional tariffs ; discussions about possible future tax \ncuts; a significant fall in the 10-year Treasury rate , which now stands at 1.5 percent ; and a one -\nday decline in the Dow Jones Industrial Average of over 800 points,  followed by elevated \nvolatility in the Dow over subsequent days.   \nIndeed, i t has not exactly been a low -key, calm summer  in the markets .  Which begs the \nquestion – what are these financial market gyrations telling us about the economic outlook ? \n Let me point out that d espite the se headline -grabbing swing s in financial  conditions , \ndomestic economic  conditions have remained relatively benign :   \n The economy grew by 2 percent in the second quarter, and forecasters are expecting \ngrowth in the next two quarters to be similar.   \n The unemployment rate reached a nearly  50-year low of 3.6 percent in April , and \ncurrently stands at 3.7 percent .  Forecasters are expecting th ese near -record lows to \ncontinue for at least the next two quarters.   \n Inflation , as measure d by the PCE price index , is running below the Federal Reserve’s  2 \npercent target, but an alternate measure that remov es outsized moves that are likely to \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL  \n5 P.M. U.S. Standard Time on Tuesday, September 3, 2019 OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n \n \n2 represent one-off changes – known as the Dallas trimmed mean  PCE – shows inflation \nrunning at 2 percent .1\n \nSo, with economic conditions relatively strong,  why has financial market volatility \npicked up  so markedly  this summer ? \nFinancial market participants are certainly concerned that risks related to international \ntrade and geopolitic s have intensified.  Tariffs are a tax on imported goods  and, along with t he \nimpact of retaliatory tariffs, they increase the risk that the earnings of firms reliant on foreign \ntrade will be hurt.  The reduction in earnings for these firms could affect asset valuations.2    \nIn addition , and perhaps more important ly, potential trade disruptions are emerging  at a \ntime when many U.S. trading partners are facing mounting economic challenges.  For example , \nChina, t he world’s second -largest economy , faces a number of concerns about the future \nrobustness of its economy .  China is heavily reliant on trade, so trade restrictions will take a bite \nout of the country’s economic activity.  Moreover, t he situation in Hong Kong is raising \nconcerns on many levels, including  from an economic standpoint .  Other countries are vulnerab le \nto possible U.S. tariffs  as well.  Japan , South Korea,  and ma ny European economies are even \nmore  dependent on trade  than the United States  and face a number of unusual challenges of their \nown.3  \n \n  \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL  \n5 P.M. U.S. Standard Time on Tuesday, September 3, 2019 OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n \n \n3 Exploring t he Yield Curve  \n In addition to the se important global  headwinds , we see that  yields  on the 10 -year U.S. \nTreasury bond have fallen below many short -term yields, resulting in an inverted yield curve.  In \nthe past , yield curve inversions have often  preceded economic downturns.   \nHowever, the current situation is somewhat different, in my assessment .  Previously , \nmost of the yield curve inversions were driven by the Federal Reserve raising short -term rates \nwell above the level expected to prevail in the long run , in order to slow the economy down and \nprevent inflation from accelerating .  Today, the short -term interest rate that the Federal Reserve \ntargets, the federal funds rate, is at a level roughly equal to our 2 percent inflation target and still \nbelow its exp ected level in the long run.  Rather than policy actions by the Fed that raise the \nshort -term rate, what is currently driving the yield curve inversion is the decline in the longer -\nterm rate.  \nThe depressed long -term yield , in part , reflects the challenging  economic conditions in \nmuch  of the  rest of the  world.  Currently, U .S. government bond yields (determined, of course, in \nthe marketplace, not set by policymakers) are higher than  those  in most other developed \ncountries.  This provides an incent ive for foreign investors  to buy U.S government securities , \nespecially if the risk of a dollar depreciation is perceived as low.  But such an increase  in demand \npushes the prices of U.S. government securities up, and yield s down . \n \n  \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL  \n5 P.M. U.S. Standard Time on Tuesday, September 3, 2019 OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n \n \n4 Weighing the Risks, and Considering  Policy  \n The core question of my remarks  today , then , is this: As we all look ahead and evaluate \nthe economy’s  prospects, how should the relatively good domestic economy and forecasts for the \nsecond half of this year be seen against signific ant risks  from trade, a slowdown in some of our \ntrading partners , and the low long -term rates creating an inverted yield curve ?   \nAt times like this, it is important to carefully study  incoming economic data.  If the risks \nbecome pronounced and threaten the U.S. outlook , then further  monetary  easing may be \nappropriate.  However , if the data continue to indicate a  U.S. economy growing slightly above \nthe level considered  to be the economy’s potential  growth  rate (an estimate of the  econom y’s \nmaximum sustainable output over the long term4), with continued gradual increases  in wages and \nprices, then in my view , no immediate policy action would be required.    \nIn fact, the gradual slowing of GDP growth that  we are seeing  is really not surprising  –\nand is not necessarily a signal of a weakening economy headed for a recession, but  instead  a \nnatural pattern .  As resource constraints (like the availability of workers) become more binding  \nand the effects of the fiscal stimulus wan e, and with monetary policy onl y marginally \naccommodative, economists  would expect actual economic growth to settle in the vicinity of  the \ngrowth rate associated with the economy’s potential.  \n \nEconomic Forecasts  and Indicators  \n In the spirit of the data dependence , let’s now turn to the numbers .  Figure 1  shows the \ngrowth in real GDP for the first two quarters of 2019 and the Blue Chip consensus forecast \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL  \n5 P.M. U.S. Standard Time on Tuesday, September 3, 2019 OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n \n \n5 through a  year from now .  The Blue Chip  panel  comprise s roughly 50 professional for ecasters \nwho provide their estimates  of the future state of a variety of economic variables . \nActual s econd quarter growth in real GDP was 2 percent.  The Blue Chip forecasters \nexpect real GDP to grow at a 2 percent annualized rate for each of the next two quarters.  My \nown forecast is quite s imilar, anticipat ing growth in the second half of this year of 2 percent  – \nwhich is somewhat above my estimate of the potential growth rate in the economy.   Growth \nabove that potential rate is what drives unemployment lower , which may further  boost wage and \nprice  inflation . \n Figure 2  illustrates some of the drivers of s econd quarter growth .  Real GDP  growth  was \n2 percent , despite weakness in business fixed investment , residential investment , and exports, as \nvery strong growth in consumer spend ing offset the weakness in these other components of real \nGDP.  If the consumer continues to spend, and global conditions do not deteriorate further,  the \neconomy is likely to  continue to  grow around  2 percent , in part because the underpinnings of \nconsumption growth  — household income growth and household wealth  — remain strong, and \nconsumption accounts for about  70 percent of GDP  in the U.S .   \n To that end, Figure 3 shows that data we have to date on retail sales are consistent with \ncontinued relat ively strong consumption.  In fact, retail sales growth for July was stronger than \nthe growth in any of the previous three months.   \n However, Figure 4 shows that the University of Michigan consumer sentiment survey \ndid decline in August, suggesting  consumers may have focused their attention on  gyrations in the \nstock market and the possibility of another round of tariffs , although the measure has not yet \ndeviated meaningfully from its range since the beginning of 2017 .  By contrast , the Conference \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL  \n5 P.M. U.S. Standard Time on Tuesday, September 3, 2019 OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n \n \n6 Board Consumer Confidence i ndex was little changed in August relative to July.   But in sum , as \nlong as employment continues to expand as it has  – even recently  – the consumer should remain \na source of strength for the economy.  \n However, tariff -related trade disruption  and weakness in the global economy remain key \nrisks for the U.S. economy.   That said,  Figure 5 shows exports as a percent of GDP  for a number \nof nations .  Countries with a large export share of GDP will be highly sensitive to slowing global \nmark et conditions and the imposition of tariffs.  Among the countries shown, the United States \nstands out as having a relatively small export share of GDP , at just 12 percent.  In contrast, \nGermany , South Korea,  and Italy are much more highly exposed to global  trade.5   \n To date, economic forecasts and the underlying data are consistent with a  U.S. economy \ngrowing slightly above its potential  rate.  However, the forecasts and recent data highlight that \ncontinued strong  consumption is key to that outlook.  Becau se of tariffs and slowing global \ngrowth, both business fixed investment and exports  have been weak.  Clearly , there is a \ndownside risk that trade or geopolitical problems could escalate, resulting in a much weaker \nsituation  than is currently anticipated in  economic forecasts.  \n \nFinancial Market Indicators  \n As I mentioned earlier, o ne source of concern with the economic outlook i nvolves  recent  \nmovements in financial markets.  Figure 6 shows the 3-month and 10-year Treasury yields , with \nrecession shading .  The 10 -year Treasury yield  rose to 3.24 early last November and is currently \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL  \n5 P.M. U.S. Standard Time on Tuesday, September 3, 2019 OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n \n \n7 about 1.5 percent.  This is obviously a very sizable  decline , and  much more substantial than the \ndecline in short -term rates.   \nThe current rate configuration in the United States, with the yield curve inversion, should  \nbe placed in the context of the interest rates prevailing in other developed economies .  Figure 7 \nshows the  monetary authority’s  policy rate in Europe, Japan, and the United States.  While the \nU.S. central bank has raised the policy rate over the past several years, in Japan and the Euro \narea the policy rate has not been raised , reflecting the weakness of these economies relative t o \nthe U nited States. \n Because the policy rate remains near the effective  lower  bound in Europe and Japan, the  \ncentral banks there  have been providing monetary stimulus by purchasing long -term securities.  \nFigure 8 shows rates o n 10-year government bonds in the U .S., Germany, and Japan.  \nParticularly striking is the 10 -year German rate , which is now more than 200 basis points lower \nthan the comparable U .S. rate, and is more negative than the European central bank’s short -term \npolicy rate.  \nThe weakness in Ja pan and Europe, and the associated easing across the yield curve, \ncauses foreign investors to search for higher yields in the United States.  This has encouraged \nforeign investors to buy 10 -year U.S. Treasuries .6  In addition to the higher yield , U.S. Treasuries \nprovide a “recession hedge ” — in an economic downturn  here or abroad , the safety and \nrelatively high yields of long-term U.S. government bonds would like ly become even more \nattractive to investors , so their prices would rise and yields decline f urther.   Holding long bonds \ntoday thus offers the prospect of capital gains during a downturn , which  would partly insulate \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL  \n5 P.M. U.S. Standard Time on Tuesday, September 3, 2019 OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n \n \n8 investors  against the losses  on other assets in their portfolios  that would likely arise in such \ncircumstances.  \n These alternative explanations for what makes U.S. Treasuries attractive today are \nchallenging  to disentangle, making  the decline  in long -term U.S. Treasury rates somewhat  open \nto interpret ation .  To the extent that the decline  reflects weakness in foreign  economies with \nlimited policy space, that foreign weakness is likely already incorporated into economic \nforecasts.  If instead the rate is falling due to perceptions that an economic downturn here is \nbecoming more likely, then one would have to say that t he view from bond markets diverges \nfrom that of most economic forecasters  and constitutes a downside risk to the forecasts . \n But the financial markets are sending mixed signals about economic risks. If one thought \nthat the economy was going into an economic downturn, one would expect such concerns to be \nreflected in equity  prices, as corporate earnings tend to decline significantly in a recession.  \nFigure 9 shows the S&P  500 and Dow Jones average s.  While both indices are down a little \nmore than  3 percent from the ir July highs, overall stock prices remain robust .  Recession \nconcerns do not seem to be reflected  in the current pricing of stocks.  \n Another market indicator that can reflect recession concerns is the spread between  yields \non BAA -rated  corporate bonds (bonds with the lowest of the “ investment grade ” ratings ) and 10 -\nyear Treasury yields , as shown in Figure 10.  This spread , which would grow  if perceived risks \nabout priv ate sector investments were heightened,  is not unusually elevated, as we would expect \nif bond investors were concerned about a near-term recession.  \n In sum , one widespread interpretation of the inversion in the Treasury yield curve is that \nit portends a likely economic downturn  in the U nited States .  I would say, however, t hat such a \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL  \n5 P.M. U.S. Standard Time on Tuesday, September 3, 2019 OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n \n \n9 view does not seem to be strongly echoed in equity markets, bond spreads , or economic \nforecasts.  A plausible alternative explanation would be weakness among U.S. trading par tners \nhas depress ed long rates in their countries , which ha s, in turn , depressed long -term Treasury rates \nin the United States  by shifting demand to long-term Treasuries , inverting  the yield curve . We \nare wise not to place too much confidence in either int erpretation, but instead watch closely for \nsigns of risks materializing in the economic data.  \n \nInflation  Considerations  \n Another potential concern is that inflation has remain ed consistently below the 2  percent  \ngoal that the Fed has announced and intends  to deliver .  Figure 11 shows core PCE inflation and \nthe Dallas trimmed  mean PCE.  Both measures try to remove “noise ” from the measured \ninflation  rate.  The Dallas trimmed mean, as previously stated,  removes any unusual outliers in \nthe inflation series and is currently at 2 percent.  Core PCE , which removes the often -volatile \nfood and energy prices,  is at 1.6 percent.  During previous periods when the series have diverged, \ncore PCE has tended to move toward the Dallas trimmed mean.  This would be consist ent with a \nsituation where the recent low reading s in core PCE reflect transitory changes  in prices (other \nthan food and energy ) that  are removed by the Dallas trimmed mean  measure . \n Figure 1 2 shows that wages and salaries , using either average hourly earnings or the \nEmployment Cost Index , have been slowly increasing.  As wages rise, unless productivity rises \nas well  to offset the increase in production costs , firms will need to decide whether to reduce \nmargins or raise prices.  Th e gradual increase in wages and salaries is consistent with a tight \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL  \n5 P.M. U.S. Standard Time on Tuesday, September 3, 2019 OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n \n \n10 labor market.  With the unemployment rate at 3.7 percent, this tightness in labor markets should \nalso gradually cause inflation to return to the Federal Reserve’s  2 percent target.  \n  \nConclu ding Observat ions \n Concerns over tariffs and geopolitical uncertainties have  increased discussion around a \npossible economic downturn.  It is clearly reasonable to make the assess ment  that r isks are \nelevated.  Should those risks become a reality , the appropriate monetary pol icy would be to ease \naggressively.  However, to date, these elevated risks have not become reality , at least for the U .S.  \neconomy .  Economic forecasts – and, as I’ve demonst rated,  many financial market indicators – \nremain benign, consistent with a forecas t of growth slightly above potential.    \nIn my view, one  should not be overconfident that the economy will be just fine or that an \neconomic downturn is inevitable.  As a result, t his is a particularly good time to carefully watch \nincoming data  – to determine whether any additional policy adjustments are necessary to achieve \nthe Fed’s Congressionally mandated goals of maximum employment and stable prices.   \nReturning to where I started my remarks, I’ll just say that is how I plan to spend the last few days \nof summer, and beyond.  \n Thank you.  \n \n \n1 For more discussion, see the Dallas Fed’s Two Measures of Core Inflation: A Comparison , by Jim Dolmas and \nEvan F.

But these countries also \nface a number of domestic challenges of their own, from trade disrupt ions between Japan and South Korea and \nbetween the U.S. and China to an unsteady recovery in the Euro area combined with a variety of political challenges \nin European countries and the U.K.   \n \n4 For context on the estimate of the economy’s potential growth rate, see the Congressional Budget Office, for \nexample https://www.cbo.gov/publication/53558 . \n \n5 There are other ways that international co nditions affect U.S. firms. For example, multinational firms, many of \nwhich produce goods and services in foreign countries, will also be affected by foreign economic activity and may \nface reduced earnings.  \n  \n6 With the implicit bet that the interest rate differential will not be offset by a future dollar depreciation .",

U.S. Standard Time on Friday, September 20, 2019 OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n1 \n              Good Morning, i t is a pleasure to be here at NYU ’s Stern School of Business  to \nparticipate in this conference  on credit markets .  I want to thank the Salomon Center for the \nStudy of Financial Institutions for inviting me to share my view s of the economy.  \nI’d like to begin with a few remarks about monetary policy  which I believe are relevant to \nthe discussions taking place here today .  At the Federal Open Market Committee ( FOMC ) \nmeeting  earlier this week, the Committee voted to reduce the federal funds rate by 25 basis \npoints.  I dissented, and  in my remarks today I will explain my views on the appropriate degree \nof monetary accommodation at this time .  I will also share my perspectives on the potential \nbuildup of some finan cial-stability co ncerns .  \nI will  take a few minutes to  summarize my argument  as I begin, and then delve into a \nlittle more detail to show you the data which  inform my views.  \n \nFirst, the stance of policy is already accommodative.    \nThe latest policy action of the Committee reduces the short -term interest rates the  Federal \nReserve  controls  to a range from 1. 75 to 2  percent .  This  rate on unsecured overnight credit  is \nvery close to current readings on inflation , and thus holders of federal  funds will earn a nominal \nreturn  that does little more than compensate them for the prevailing rate of inflation . The \nCommittee a lso provides information on what they expect the federal funds rate to be in the \nlonger run , and that estimate  is 2.5 percent.  These two factors suggest that  the stance of \nmonetary policy is currently accommodative .  Yet, i t is notable that the federal funds futures \nmarket  is pricing in a significant probability of another decrease  by year end . The market \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL  \n11:20  A.M. U.S. Standard Time on Friday, September 20, 2019 OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n2 \n apparently believes the economy needs added stimulus to continue the expansion.  My own view \nis different.1  \n \nSecond, the economic data suggest continued expansion . \nIt is not unusual to have a sequence of decreases in the federal funds rate  when the \neconomy is in an economic downturn, often when interest rates have become too contractionary  \nand there is concern that the economy is slowing too much . The data we have in hand suggest \ninstead that the recovery would continue apace  even with little monetary policy accommodation .  \nConsider , as we always do,  the Fed eral Reserve ’s dual mandate  from Congress – maximum \nsustainable employment, and price stability.2  With respect to those goals, t he national \nunemployment rate is currently  3.7 percent, a rate that is very low by historical standards  and \nlikely well below the natural rate of unemploy ment .  Regarding price  stability , which we define \nas 2 percent inflation, it is true that earlier in the year inflation  was running below target .  But as \nthe Consumer Price Index ( CPI) release last week indicated, those low readings seem to have \nbeen temporary.  The 12-month change in the core CPI reported last week rose to 2.4 percent,  \nreflecting the more rapid price increases of  the past three months.  \n \nThird, risks to the economic outlook are of concern, to be sure.   \nGiven economic results that seem  broadly in line with the  Fed’s  dual mandate, why the \nconcern?  Well c learly , there are elevated risks.  The trade dispute with China is having an \nimpact on both the U nited States  and global econom ies.  While manufacturing is a relatively \nsmall sector in t he U .S. economy,  it is a cyclically  sensitive sector, and  tariffs and slower global \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL  \n11:20  A.M. U.S. Standard Time on Friday, September 20, 2019 OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n3 \n growth are stressing it .  Related  to the trade disputes , business fixed investment has been \naffected, as firms are uncertain about  which tariffs will be imposed – and the potential retaliation \nby countries impacted by the tariffs.   \nBut even with these trade -related impediments , real GDP grew 2 percent  in the second \nquarter, a bit above my estimate of its sustainable rate .  And economic forecasts, which \nincorporate the effects of tariffs and slower global growth  on the U .S. economy , expect growth to \ncontinue in real terms at close to 2 percen t.  So the risks, while of concern,  have not slowed the \neconomy below its sustainable rate of growth . \n \nFourth, r esponding to risks  to the economic outlook  with too much monetary accommodation \nentails  costs , and thus introduces risks of its own  – one such risk is  the potential build up of \nfinancial instability.  \nIt is appropriate for policymakers  to respond to risks in the outlook . The response should \ndepend, of course,  on how likely one think s the outlook is to deteriorate , and by how much , and \nalso what  you believe  are the likely costs of reducing rates.  As I suggested a moment ago, so far \nthe economy seems to have weathered the  impact of trade disruptions and slowing foreign \ngrowth.  \nOne potential cost  of increased accommodation  is that very low rates can encourage \nhouseholds and firms to take excessive risks.  This could show up in the form of  increased \nhousehold and firm  lever age, with prices for risky assets reach ing levels  that may not be \nsustainable over time.   \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL  \n11:20  A.M. U.S. Standard Time on Friday, September 20, 2019 OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n4 \n  Assessing those risks and costs is challenging, to be sure, and a matter of judgment on \nwhich people  may disagree .  Still, I would argue that having such an accommo dative stance  of \nmonetary polic y is unusual  in what appears to be a fairly robust economy .  Typically , the federal \nfunds rate is pushed  below the level policymakers expect it to be in the long run only during \neconomic downturns .  During a downturn, t he costs of lowering rates are relatively modest, as \nfears of rising inflation are low and the concern is usually that too little credit is being extended.  \nHowever, the current situation involves pushing rates low er when asset prices, and in particular  \nsome  risky asset prices , already seem  inflated .  I don’t see current financial risks as causing  a \ndownturn , but such conditions have  the potential to amplify a  downturn , should it occur . \n \nCurrent Economic Condition s \n Having laid out the outlines of my argument, let me  walk you through  some of the key \ndata on the current economic situation and private -sector forecasts.   \nFigure  1 provides recent economic data for employment, inflation, and stock prices , as \nwell as the consensus  Blue Chip forecast for eco nomic variables  for 2019 as of June and \nSeptember .  The table shows that from May through August, the fundamentals rema ined quite \nstrong and have shown very little variation.  The unemployment rate is currently at 3.7 percent, \nwhere it has been all summer,  and private forecasters expect we will end the year slightly lower , \nat 3.6 percent.  While  the core PCE  measure of  inflation (which removes the often -volatile food \nand energy prices ) has been a bit below the Fed’s 2 percent  target , core CPI has been  firmer over \nthe summer, consistent with the interpretation that the softer readings on inflation that we saw in \nthe spring  will likely be temporary.  Finally, the most recent consensus forecast for real GDP for \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL  \n11:20  A.M. U.S. Standard Time on Friday, September 20, 2019 OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n5 \n the year is 2.3 percent, which is above the estimate of its sustainable rate, and thus  consistent \nwith somewhat tighter labor markets  (as reflected in the Blue Chip’s small decline in the \nforecasted  unemployment  rate).3 In sum, current economic conditions are quite favorable, and \nstable, and private  forecasters expect those conditions to remain quite similar through the end of \nthe year .   \nFigure 2 shows the target federal funds rate  in the second half of  this year relative to the \nFed’s  inflation target of 2 percent.  We began the year with the federa l funds rate somewhat \nabove the inflation target.  With this most recent reduction in the federal funds rate , it is now \nbelow where we expect the inflation rate will converge to over time.    \n Figure 3  shows the target federal funds rate since June , along with a projection of its path  \n(the forecast is calculated using the CME Group probabilit y for the most likely outcome  for the \ntarget range),  and the median of the FOMC participants’ federal funds rate expect ation  over the \nlong run, currently 2.5 percent . With this week’s reducti on, the federal funds rate is trading in the \ntarget range of 1.75 to 2 .0, notably below its long -run “neutral” level . In sum, w hether judged \nrelative to inflation or relative to its long -run neutral level,  monetary policy is currently \naccommodative.   \n \nMonetary Policy and Economic Conditions  \n Now I would like to explore how unusual it is to have such accommodative monetary \nconditions while the economic outcomes suggest continued above -trend expansion . \nThe top  panel in  Figure 4  show s the unemployment rate and the Congressional Budget \nOffice’s (CBO ’s) estimate of the natural rate of unemployment.  When  a recession occurs, shown \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL  \n11:20  A.M. U.S. Standard Time on Friday, September 20, 2019 OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n6 \n as shading, the unemployment rate rises above the natural rate – and during the recovery the \nunemployment rate eventually tends to fall below the natural rate.  The figure shows  that at \npresent , the unemployment rate is below the CBO’s estimate of the natural rate.  \nThe bottom panel in Figure 4 provides a gauge of where  the federal funds rate  is relative \nto what we call “r star” ( r*), the real short -term interest rate that is neither contractionary nor \nstimulative  when the economy faces no headwinds or tailwinds. That interest rate  is consistent \nwith an economy  that is at full employment with stable inflation .4  The previous chart showed \nthat the nominal  federal funds rate  expected by the Committee  in the long run is 2.5 percent . \nWith an inflation target of 2 percent, this implies that the Committee sees an  r* in the  long-run of \n0.5 percent.   \nBy comparing the top and bottom panels of Figure 4, we see that over time when the \nactual unemployment rate is high relative to the natural rate  of unemployment , the real federal \nfunds rate tends to be low relative to r*; in the chart,  the real federal funds rate minus r* tends to \nbe low, reflecting  the fact  that monetary policy needs to be accommodative to help the economy \nrecover  from the headwinds it is facing during recessions .  When the unemployment rate is quite \nlow, the real federal funds rate tends to be above the long run real rate; the real federal funds rate \nminus r* tends to be high.  While this relationship is only shown through the second quarter, \nwith the last two reductions in the federal funds rate , we are below the 0.5 percent r* we expect \nin the long  run.  S imply put , we normally do not have monetary policy this accommodative when \nthe unemployment rate is this low.   \n Figure 5  has the same bottom  panel , but a t op panel  that shows  two measures of inflation \n– the core PCE inflation rate and the Dallas Trimmed Mean PCE inflation rate  (which removes \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL  \n11:20  A.M. U.S. Standard Time on Friday, September 20, 2019 OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n7 \n outlier observations, regardless of the category ) – and the Federal Reserve’s  2 percent inflation \ntarge t.  As in Figure 4, t he bottom panel show s the real federal funds rate minus r*.   \nComparing the top and bottom panels, we see that when inflation is high relative to the \ntarget, monetary conditions are tightened – the real federal funds rate minus r* tends to be high.  \nSimilarly, when inflation is quite low, monetary policy tends to be accommodative and the real \nfederal funds rate minus r* tends to be low.  Currently , the Dallas Trimmed Mean PCE is at 2 \npercent .  In my view, with inflation near target,  this level of accommodation is not needed.   \n Of course , there are risks  to the current favorable conditions and forecasts , including  the \nrisks brought on by current trade policy  – and those risks  might  make one more concerned about \na possible downturn .  However, I take some solace in a few facts.  M ost of the U.S. trade dispute \nis currently with one country .  And while the trade dispute has the pot ential for painful impacts \non some industries in the U.S., in total the estimated direct impacts for the U.S. macroeconomy \nto date are not particularly large —perhaps several 10ths  of a percentage point on GDP  (in part \nbecause exports are only 12 percent of U.S. GDP  and tariffs are not on all goods from all \ncountries ).   \nBut the potential for trade disputes to  undermin e confidence in the economy for \nbusiness es and households is a concern.  One warning signal would be if  economic data that tend \nto be leading indicators of  recession  showed signs of  stress.  \n To that end, Figure 6 shows building permits.  Before the 1990 and 2007 recession s (and \nmany other recessions, not shown in the figure) , building permits plummeted.  Currently, w hile \nbuilding permits have leveled off, they have not shown significant declines.   \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL  \n11:20  A.M. U.S. Standard Time on Friday, September 20, 2019 OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n8 \n  Figure 7 shows initial claims for unemployment insurance.  As firms become worried \nabout a recession , they slow down hiring  – and some firms need to lay  off workers.  As a result, \ninitial claims for unemployment insurance were  on the rise before previous recession s.  Today, \ninitial claims are still falling  and are near the low for the period shown.  \n Of course, many observers are concerned about the inverted yield curve, which is a topic \nI explored in a speech earlier this month. My own view is the inverted yield curve may be driven \nby different forces this time.5  \nIn sum, it is fairly unusual to have monetary policy this accommodative at a time when \nthe economy still appears to be expanding  fairly  robustly .  While risks are elevated, many of the \nnon-manufacturing indicators of recession are not showing magnified concern.   \n \nFinancial Stability  Concerns  \nNow , I will turn to addressing some of the financial stability -related risks and costs that \ncan result from monetary policy  being too accommodative.   Figure 8 shows the average debt \nmultiples of highly leveraged loans.  It’s important to note that h igh leverage does not  generally  \ncause  recessions, but high leverage can be an amplifier that makes recessions more severe.  \nGoing into the 2007 recession, highly leveraged loans had increased significantly to a multiple of \na bit below five.  Once the recession occurred , borrowers and lenders pulled back , and debt \nmultiples decreased significantly.   \nThe decade -long period of very low interest rates has led highly leveraged firms to \ngradually increase  their debt multiples to very high levels .  Importantly, t he low interest cost of \nleverage today masks the true costs of leverage that only become visible once the economy \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL  \n11:20  A.M. U.S. Standard Time on Friday, September 20, 2019 OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n9 \n deteriorates.  During good times , higher leverage increases returns ; it is not until the downturn \nthat the problem becomes apparent, and then the  costs are  borne not only by the shareholders, but \nalso by the employees  of firms and the communities in which the affected firms operate.  \n Lowering  interest rates not only decreas es the cost of credit , it also encourag es a greater \nquantity of credit.  Households and firms are incented by the lower rates to take on more \nleverage, and this can be to their detriment when the next downturn occurs . \n Furthermore, the c osts of  credit conditions that are too-accommodative can sometimes \nappear in unexpected places.  Figure 9 shows the capitalization rates for different  types of  \nproperty.  The capitalization , or “cap ,” rate is the ratio of net operating income produced by a \nproperty to the price paid for the property, calculated at the time of a transaction.  S o falling \ncapitalization rates imply lower expected returns on the property , or equivalently a high multiple \nof a pro perty’s valuation relative to its expected income stream . Part of these low cap rates can \nbe explained by low interest rates generally, but very low cap rates can indicate an overly \noptimistic valuation of real estate assets that makes these investments vu lnerable in a downturn.  \n I will also point out that evolving  market models , along with low interest rates, are \ncreating a new type of potential financial stability risk in commercial real estate.   One such \nmarket model is the development of co -working spaces in many major urban office markets.    \n A stylized model of co -working office space arrangements appears  in Figure 1 0.6  What \nmakes this form of development a potential financial stability risk is two -fold.   \nFirst, c o-working companies – which enter into long -term leases with the property \nowners – have tended to re -lease to smaller -sized and less mature companies on a shorter -term \nbasis.  This segment of the economy is likely to be particularly susceptible to an econo mic \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL  \n11:20  A.M. U.S. Standard Time on Friday, September 20, 2019 OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n10 \n downturn, potentially resulting in office vacancies rising more quickly than they have \nhistorically.  Thus, in a downturn the co -working company would be exposed to the loss of \ntenant income, which puts both them and the property owner at risk if they cannot make lease \npayments to the owner of the building.   \nA second reason for concern is that some companies may utilize  bankruptcy -remote \nspecial purpose e ntities, or SPEs, for lease s.  This structure may allow  the co -working company \nto potentially walk away from unprofitable lease arrangements in an economic downturn without \nthe property owner having recourse to the ultimate parent , the co-working company.  Simply put, \nI am concerne d that commercial real estate  losses will be larger in the next downturn b ecause of \nthis growing feature of the real estate market, which could ultimately make runs and vacancies \nmore likely  due to this new leasing model .  \n The fact that the shared office model relies on small -company tenants with short -term \nleases , combined wit h the potential lack of recourse for the property owner , is potentially \nproblematic in a recession.  This also raises the issue of whether bank loans to property owners \nin cities with major penetration by co -working models could experience a higher inciden ce of \ndefault and greater loss -given -defaults than we have seen historically.   \nThe potential for increased losses accruing to property owners comes not just from the \nlimited liability arising from the SP E structure, but also from the change in the composi tion of \ntenants.  The owner of the building may be willing to take on this added risk because shared \noffice space often pays higher rent, which is p articularly attractive in a low -interest -rate \nenvironment.  Thus , this new model for offices has the potential for a run on commercial real \nestate  as revenues decline  (small lessees  not renewing) combined with reach ing-for-yield  \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL  \n11:20  A.M. U.S. Standard Time on Friday, September 20, 2019 OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n11 \n behavior  (owners willing to lease to an SP E to get higher rents).  It will not be until a recession \nthat this evolving  model will be  truly tested.   \n These are just two examples of the potential costs of very low interest rates in a relatively \nstable  economic environment.  The incentive to take on more leverage and to reach for yield can \nbe costly  – but the  costs  are apparent  only when a downturn occurs.   \nIn sum, this is an important time in the cycle to be thinking about structures and \nsituations that could challenge financial stability in a downturn.   The combination of reaching for \nyield with ru nnable liabilities is a common problem in financial stability situations.  It’s \nimportant to think about the potential for runs on commercial real estate stemming from a \nsituation where short -term leases might not be renewed in recession, and long -term lea ses are no \nlonger economically viable.   Interest rates play into the situation, as low rates potentially lead to \na reach for yield, and building owners are more willing to lease to SPEs to get higher returns \n(rents) at a time when capitalization rates are quite low.    \n \nConclu ding Observat ions \n I voted  against the reduction in interest rates at the most recent  FOMC meeting.  The \neconomic data that we have seen so far suggest that the economy remains  healthy and robust to a \nnumber of shocks and uncertainties .  While risks  clearly exist  related to  trade and geopolitical \nconcerns , lower ing rates to address uncertainty is not costless.   In my view,  there are clearly \nrisks of headwinds hitting the economy, but  the stance of monetary policy is already \naccommodative. There are also risks of tailwinds and costs to monetary policy being too \naccommodative.  Additional accommodation is not needed for an economy where labor markets \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL  \n11:20  A.M. U.S. Standard Time on Friday, September 20, 2019 OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n12 \n are already tight  – and risk s further inflating the prices of risk ier assets , and encouraging \nhouseholds and firms to take on what may be too much leverage.  \n Thank you.  \n \n1 For additional discussion, see https://www.bostonfed.org/news -and-events/speeches/2019/weighing -the-risks -to-\nthe-economic -outlook.aspx . \n \n2 The Federal Reserve Act provides the following monetary policy goals, “promote effectively the goals of \nmaximum employment, stable prices, and moder ate long -term interest rates.”  The first two are the dual mandate.   \nModerate long -term interest rates are generally viewed as a product of the first two, provided that the maximum \nemployment is a sustainable maximum employment.  \n \n3 My own forecast is quite  similar, anticipating growth in the second half of this year of 2 percent – which is \nsomewhat above my estimate of the potential growth rate in the economy.   \n \n4 For more on the Laubach -Williams model, s ee: https://www.newyorkfed.org/research/policy/rstar .    \n \n5 For additional discussion, see https://www.bostonfed.org/news -and-events/speeches/2019/weighing -the-risks -to-\nthe-economic -outlook.aspx . \n \n6 This figure refl ects information gathered from  CB Insights, Colliers, CreditSights, Cushman & Wakefield, JLL, \nRCA, SEC filings, and major media cove rage.",

U.S. Central Time (1: 35 P.M.  Eastern Time) on Friday, October 11, 2019 - OR UPON DELIVERY  \n  \n \n1 \n  Good Afternoon.  It is wonderful  to be back on campus at the University of Wisconsin -\nMadison .  I appreciate the opportunity to  take part in today’s  American Economic Challenges \nSymposium , and congratulate the Department of Economics and the Juli Plant Grainger Institute \nfor Economic Research on putting together such a terrific program .  I am pleased to be able to \nspeak with you today about the current state of the  economy , and the  implications for monetary \npolicy and interest rates .   \nLast Friday , we all noted with interest the publication of the September employment \nreport  from the U.S. Department of Labor .1  Interpretation of the report seems  to have varied , \ndepending on the observer.  To those concerned with and focused on risks to the economic \noutlook, the payroll -employment number of 136,000  – which is slower growth than earlier this \nyear – as well as the weakness in the manufacturing s ector, supported the narrative  that tariffs  \nand weakness globall y are slowing down the domestic economy.  However, other s noted  that the \npreceding months were revised a bit higher, the unemployment rate had declined to 3.5 percent  – \na nearly 50-year low  – and that slower employment  growth may instead reflect an economy \ngrowing beyond capacity and facing hiring constraints associated with a very tight labor market.  \nMy own view is that the September employment report highlights trends we have b een \nseeing since the spring : the presence of elevated downside risks, but actual economic outcomes \nthat are not much different than what most forecasters  expected six month s ago  or longer . \n To be sure, the economy faces a number of  downside risks .  In an a lready slowing global \neconomy, t he imposition of tariffs and the prospect of additional tariffs are together  resulting in \nslower exports and weakness in the manufacturing and agr icultural sectors.  Indeed, the high-\nfrequency  incoming economic  data have been consistent with a slowdown that is largely \n\n  EMBARGOED UNTIL  \n12:35 P.M. U.S. Central Time (1: 35 P.M.  Eastern Time) on Friday, October 11, 2019 - OR UPON DELIVERY  \n  \n \n2 \n concentrated in manufacturing  – which has reduced business fixed investment , as firms wrestle \nwith the implications of higher  trade barriers .  In addition, geopolitical concerns remain elevated.  \nThe recent attack on Saudi oil production and the potential for a difficult  Brexit , in a Europe that \nis already growing slowly , highlight that the global recovery faces risks that make it somewhat  \nfragile.  \n Despite these clear risks, second -quarter U.S. eco nomic growth was above the estimated  \n“potential ” rate (that is, an estimate of the economy’s maximum sustainable output over the long \nterm).2  Looking forward, Fed policymakers ’ September Summary of Economic Projections  \n(SEP)  and the consensus of private forecasters both anticipate growth around potential .   \nHow can the economy continue to expand  at potential with the sort of weakening in \nexports and investment  that we are seeing ?  To date , the answer has been strong consumer \nspending.  The U.S. consumer has been bolstered by plentiful jobs in tight labor markets, strong \ngrowth in personal income , and increases in household wealth due to rising prices of assets like \nstock s and ho mes.  An important question remains whether consumption can continue to offset \nthe negative effects of trade problems  and slower foreign growth . \n While  U.S. consumers have been resilient to date, continued  resilience is not guaranteed . \nSo it is important to consider  whether the economy can continue on its quite favorable pa th – \nwith grow th around potential , tight labor markets , and inflation near the Fed’s target of 2 percent.  \nThe stance of monetary policy is already accommodative, so my view is that policymakers can \nbe patient  and continue to evaluate incoming data before taking additional action .  My forecast \nfor the economy  does not envision  additional easing being  necessary .  However,  should  risks \n\n  EMBARGOED UNTIL  \n12:35 P.M. U.S. Central Time (1: 35 P.M.  Eastern Time) on Friday, October 11, 2019 - OR UPON DELIVERY  \n  \n \n3 \n materialize and econom ic growth  slow materially , to below the potential  rate, I would be \nprepared to support aggressive easing. \n \nCurrent Economic Conditions  \n Figure 1  provides the median forecast of Fed policymakers for key economic variables \nfrom the SEP s from March and September  2019 .  How different are the forecasts of economic \noutcomes in September , compared with what we anticipated before the recent increase in  tariffs \nand the cuts in  the federal funds rate?  What is striking  to me  is how little the forecast s for 2019 \nhave changed.   \nOf course , this is due  in part  to the significant easing actions that the Federal Open \nMarket Committee ( FOMC ) has already put in place, which will continue to stimulate the \neconomy this year and next.  More recently, Fed  policymakers have  added a couple of interest \nrate cuts to the mix.  These actions , to some extent , help to keep the forecast in the healthy zone.  \nInterestingly, t he forecast for real GDP growth for 2019 has actually increased over this \nperiod, though only by 0.1 percent age point .  In March and September , the median forecast  for \nthe unemployment rate at the end of this year was 3.7 percent, an unemployment rate that looks \ntoo pessimistic now , given the September employment report ’s reading of  3.5 percent.  While \ntotal and core PCE inflation are lower than had been expected, core PCE inflation (which \nremoves the often -volatile food and energy prices) has risen 0.3 percent age points  from its lows \nearlier this year.  \n\n  EMBARGOED UNTIL  \n12:35 P.M. U.S. Central Time (1: 35 P.M.  Eastern Time) on Friday, October 11, 2019 - OR UPON DELIVERY  \n  \n \n4 \n Overall,  then,  the economy has evolved about as expected, despite the unanticipated \nincrease in tariffs and the slower growth of exp orts and business fixed investment .  Moreover , \nrecent monetary policy easing is likely to provide some stimulus over the next several quarters . \n Not only has the economy evolved about as expected, but it is currently close to where \npolicymakers  had hoped i t would be at this time.  Figure 2  shows the recent path s for some \nalternative measures  of inflation.  The dashed line indicates  the Fed’s 2 percent inflation target.  \nThree different measures of inflation are shown  on the chart .  On a 12 -month basis, c ore CPI is \ncurrently at 2.4 percent .  Core CPI  has risen over the past several months , settling at 2.4 percent \nfor August and September .  The Dallas Trimmed Mean, which removes extreme observations, \nrounds to  2 percent.  Core PCE is at 1.8 percent, slightly below the Fed’s  target  – but has also \ntrended up recently.  With tight labor markets and an already accommodative  stance of  policy, it \nseems likely that inflation will remain close to target as long as the economy does not \nunexpectedly slow down.  \n Figure 3  provides the Committee’s most recent  estimate of full employment (the dashed \nline) at 4.2 percent.  While the level of unemployment associated with full employment is \ndifficult to estimate, and the FOMC  has lowered its median estimate of full employment over the \npast several years, we see that the September unemployment rate  of 3.5 percent is well below \npolicymakers ’ best current estimate of full employment.  \n In sum, t he U.S. economy is now very close to meeting the Fed ’s Congressional  mandate \nof full employment and stable prices (which we define  as 2 percent inflation ).  In addition, I \nwould note that the Committee’s September median forecast for 2019 real GDP growth was 2.2 \npercent , consistent with no significant slowdown in the second  half of this year.  So as we look at \n\n  EMBARGOED UNTIL  \n12:35 P.M. U.S. Central Time (1: 35 P.M.  Eastern Time) on Friday, October 11, 2019 - OR UPON DELIVERY  \n  \n \n5 \n economic performance, forecasts, and risks to the forecast s, the overriding  policy question is \nwhether the risks are so elevated that further easing is required , despite already accommodative \npolicy.  \n \nFinancial Consideration s \n Certainly , one reason for concern about the economic outlook is the movement of the 10 -\nyear U.S. Treasury yield .  The yield on 10-year Treasury bond s has declined significantly, \nleading  many financial market participants  to express concern that this signals a more significant \nimpending slowdown.  An alternative explanation that I have discussed in recent talks  is that \nvery low (and in some cases negative) long-term foreign rates  are playing a role in pushing down \nU.S. long rates , as foreign investors move money from low -rate economies into the (relatively) \nhigh-rate U.S. markets, pushing down U.S. yields.3 Also, it seems like g lobal  investors are using \nU.S. Treasuries to partially hedge against  the possibility of an economic downturn  in their \ncountry or region , since the prices of  long-duration U.S. Treasury securities normally rise during \neconomic downturns .  I see both of these as  more likely explanations  of the recent movements  \nthan an impending  U.S. slowdown . \n Other financial indicators do not portend a significant slowdown.  Despite high leverage \nin the corpo rate sector and more issuance at  the bottom  end of investment -grade ratings, the \nspread between yields on corporate bonds and Tre asury bonds, shown in Figure 5 , remains \nbelow the average spread of the past 25 years.  Similarly, the stock market, shown in Figure 6 , \nremains close to all -time highs.  \n\n  EMBARGOED UNTIL  \n12:35 P.M. U.S. Central Time (1: 35 P.M.  Eastern Time) on Friday, October 11, 2019 - OR UPON DELIVERY  \n  \n \n6 \n  Recent developments in oil markets are more consistent with apparent risks to the glob al \neconomy.  As shown  in Figure 7 , oil prices have fallen  – usually a sign that investors see \nadditional weakness developing in the global economy  – despite  the supply disruption caused by \nthe attack on Saudi oil production .  The dollar has continued to appreciate  against various \ncurrencies, and relative to the pound  – as Brexit concerns remain elevated – which is shown in \nFigure 8 .  And Figure 9  shows the continued impact of the trade war with China, as both \nexports  to and imports  from  China have declined significantly.  \n \nImplications of the R isks \n Given that the economy is close to achieving the Fed’s dual mandate , should the risks \nthat are clearly present cause policymakers at the Fed  to alter monetary policy?  At this  point in \nthe cycle, s hould risks be addressed preemptively, or should FOMC participants  wait until  they \nmaterialize ? \nDespite the clear risks to the econom ic outlook , most professional private forecasters \nexpect the economy to continue to grow around its potential.  Figure 10  provides the most recent \nBlue Chip forecast  – a summary of  the views of  approximately 50 private forecasters  -- for real \nGDP over the next several years  on the left, as well as a comparison to the earlier March forecast \non the right .  In the chart on the left, t he solid line shows the average forecast for real GDP , \nwhich at about  1.7 percent  is the same as my estimate of the potential growth of the economy.  \nThe d ashed line s reflect the average of the 10 lowest and 10 highest forecasts  for real GDP.  \nEven the lowest 10 forecasts still expect positive economic growth, though slower than my \nestimate of potential.   The chart on the right compares the average of the 10 lowest from the \n\n  EMBARGOED UNTIL  \n12:35 P.M. U.S. Central Time (1: 35 P.M.  Eastern Time) on Friday, October 11, 2019 - OR UPON DELIVERY  \n  \n \n7 \n current forecast (the dark blue dashed line on both char ts), with the average of the 10 lowest \nfrom the March forecast.  The lowest forecasts have not become more pessimistic.  \n With both the Fed ’s forecast and private forecasts expecting the economy to grow at \nclose to potential, the decision to ease further or keep rates as they are  rests on how much \ninsurance to take out against  the risks  that I have outlined .  To answer that question, one should \ntake into account how much insurance is already in place – that is, what is  the current stance of \nmonetary policy ?  Figure 11  shows the federal funds rate relative to the SEP estimate of what \nthe federal funds rate will be in the long run  – roughly speaking, the interest rate that FOMC \nmembers believe is neither stimulative nor contractionary, other things equal .  The median \nestimate of the long-run federal funds rate is 2.5 percent .  The target for the federal funds rate  \nwas set by the FOMC at a range of 1.75  to 2.0 percent  at its most recent meeting, after two one-\nquarter -percentage point reductions in the rate in July and September  of this year.  In short, the \ncurrent level of the federal funds rate is already below the FOMC’s estimate of the long -run rate.  \nIn sum, monetary policy is already accommodative .  This is especially notable  given that \nthe average forecaster expects gr owth close to potential, with  already -tight labor markets.   But \nnote, too, that Figure 11 shows the funds rate is not that far from zero, which suggests the Fed , at \ncurrent rates , has limited scope to lower rates in the event of a down turn. That limited policy \nspace – which some see as reason to “keep powder dry ,” and others as reason to act early – \nshould also figure into the Fed’s  determination of appropriate policy today.  \n \n \n \n\n  EMBARGOED UNTIL  \n12:35 P.M. U.S. Central Time (1: 35 P.M.  Eastern Time) on Friday, October 11, 2019 - OR UPON DELIVERY  \n  \n \n8 \n Conclu ding Observations  \n In summary and conclusion, I would  note that a fter two recent rate easings of 25 basis \npoint s each , monetary policy is already accommodative.  Sustaining g rowth at potential depends \non the U.S. consumer continuing to offset  the weakness we are seeing in exports and business \nfixed investmen t.  To me , it seems appropriate to continue to closely monitor incoming data to \ndetermine if the forecast of growth around potential is likely t o be achieved , or if the risks I have \noutlined are indeed materializing .   \nWhile the risks to the global and U .S. economies  remain , there are also risks to easing too \naggressively, as I’ve highlighted in previous speeches .  Ever -lower interest rates could encourage \nreach ing-for-yield behavior at exactly the wrong stage of the economic cycle.   This remains an \nimportant consideration factoring into my view s on the elements  policymakers must weigh and \nbalance at this complex time for our economy.  \nThank you  for having me back to Madison . \n  \n1 For more, s ee Employment Situation Summary , released Oct. 4, 2019 .  \n \n2 For context on the estimate of the economy’s potential growth rate, see the Congressional Budget Office, for \nexample https://www.cbo.gov/publication/53558 . \n \n3 For additional discussion, see: R osengren, Eric:  “Weighing the Risks to the Economic Outlook ,” Sept. 3, 2019, and \n“Assessing Economic Conditions and Risks to Financial Stability ,” Sept . 20, 2019.",

Rosengren  \nPresident & Chief Executive Officer  \nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston  \n \n \nKeynote address at the Norges Bank and \nInternational Banking, Economics and Finance \nAssociation Workshop: “Prepared for the Next \nCrisis? The Costs and Benefits of Financial \nRegulation”  \n  \n \nOslo , Norway   \nNovember  11, 2019  \n \n \n \n\n\n  EMBARGOED UNTIL  \n8:15 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time (2 :15 P.M. Norway  Time) on Mon day, November 11, 2019 - OR UPON DELIVERY  \n  \n \n1 \n  Good afternoon .  I would like to thank the Norges Bank for inviting me to participate in \nthis timely and important conference.  As someone with a background in both economic research \nand bank supervision,  I believe  the conversations taking place over these two days around re-\nexamining bank regulation and financial stability are  very important .  It is particularly important \nat this stage of the business cycle to assess  whether our economies  are prepared for a \nhypothetical  next downturn , and consider whether policymakers  have  built sufficient resilience \ninto the financial system – so it can withstand the kinds of stability problems that were so \nprevalent in the last recessio n.  \n One significant  difference between  now and previous cycles  is the low level of interest \nrates in the United States, Germany, and  Japan . The low -rate environment  is particularly striking \nbecause it occurs at a time whe n all three  countries’ labor markets  remain relatively tight by \nhistorical standards.   \nPolicy rates in the United States  are currently quite low.  This is partly  a result of low \nequilibrium real rates globally , and low inflation targets.  But it is also due to the Fed eral \nReserve  setting its policy rate quite low , to offset risks to the U.S. economy stemming from \ntariffs an d the global slowdown.  Although  core PCE inflation is 1.7 percent and the \nunemployment rate sits near a 50 -year low, nominal interest rates have been reduced and short -\nterm real rates  are now negative.   \nWith rates  this low, there is  very little room to reduce short -term rates  should the \neconomy stumble , as the Fed normally cuts rates well over 4 percentage points during a \nrecession .  Similarly, the 10-year U.S. Treasury rate ha s declined, which limits the  room to push \nlong-term sovereign  rates down in a  hypothetical economic downturn.  \n\n  EMBARGOED UNTIL  \n8:15 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time (2 :15 P.M. Norway  Time) on Mon day, November 11, 2019 - OR UPON DELIVERY  \n  \n \n2 \n Taken together, one might characterize the situation as one where monetary policy \n“buffers” have been diminished quite significantly.  This limitation on monetary policy ’s ability \nto buffer the eco nomy in a downturn is a key consequence  of economies operating in a low \ninterest rate environment.   In the U.S., the likelihood that this low interest rate environment will \npose a persistent challenge for conventional interest rate policy is one reason  the central bank  has \nbegun  to re-examin e its monetary policy framework .1  \n And the Fed eral Reserve  is not the only developed -economy central bank  facing this \nissue .  Increasingly, there are questions about  whether too much is , even now,  being asked of \nmonetary policy  in Germany and Japan , for example.  In these countries, the room for monetary \npolicy to react to significant negative shocks is even more meager  than in the U.S. , given that \nboth short -term and long -term nominal interest rates are already negative .   \n With the constraints on traditional monetary policy ’s ability to buffer or help reduce the \neffects of a downturn,  many countries have begun to re-examine  other ways monetary policy  can \nbe pursued  to stimulate their economies.  Besides the tools  that have already been deployed at \nthe effective lower bound , I would suggest that the low rate environment and the diminished \ncapacity of monetary  policy to offset shocks  implies that we also need to just as carefully \nexamin e regulatory  and financial stability  tools .2  Today, I will argue that policies and tools that \nmay have been appropriate in a high interest rate environment will likely not be sufficient in the \ncurrent environment.  \n For several reasons, a  low interest rate environment make s it more difficult  to exit \nrecessions .  This difficulty is due not just to the smaller monetary policy buffer, but also to the \n\n  EMBARGOED UNTIL  \n8:15 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time (2 :15 P.M. Norway  Time) on Mon day, November 11, 2019 - OR UPON DELIVERY  \n  \n \n3 \n fact that  a low interest rate environment encourages greater household and firm leverage  that will \namplify the severity of a downturn, should it occur.   \nThe consequences of a low rate environment also make it difficult for monetary policy to \nplay a solo role in countercyclical policy .  A low -rate environment  implies  a greater need  to \nutilize  coun tercyclical fiscal  policy, as well as a need for  larger  regulatory and financial -stability \nbuffers .  For example, the recent and prospective decline in some capital ratios puts banks in a \nless advantageous position, particularly if one expect s a low interest rate environment  to prevail \nfor some time.   \nIn short, the low interest  rate environment  that many developed countries face  require s \npolicymakers  to re-examine other economic buffers .  And those buffers,  in my view, are not \nadequate at pres ent in many countries represented at this conference.  \n \nLow Interest Rates and the Implications of a Diminished Monetary Policy Buffer  \n Figure 1  shows the short -term policy rates in the United States, the Euro Area, and \nJapan.  In the U .S., prior to the last recession , the federal funds rate was over 5 percent.   On \naverage over the past six recessions, the Fed has lowered the funds rate by about 5 percentage \npoints.  Had the Great Recession not been quite so severe, the 5 percentage points of fed eral \nfunds decrease available at its start might have been sufficient  to offset the downturn .  But \nbecause of the financial crisis and the severity of the ensuing recession, despite dropping  the \nfederal funds rate quickly to zero, the recession was still historically severe  and sustained .  The \nfunds rate was pinned at just above zero for seven years , far longer than any model predicted \nwould be necessary before the recession .  Even as the  eleventh  year of the recovery  begins , the \n\n  EMBARGOED UNTIL  \n8:15 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time (2 :15 P.M. Norway  Time) on Mon day, November 11, 2019 - OR UPON DELIVERY  \n  \n \n4 \n federal funds rate has never exceeded 2.4 percent , and as I noted a few moment s ago, the Fed has \nonce again lowered the funds rate to mitigate the risks of a global slowdown and trade disputes.   \nAs a result, while the macroeconomic environment in the U.S. is relatively beni gn, short -\nterm interest rates in the U .S. have limited room to react to a significant adverse  shock.  In \nGermany and Japan , where the economic outcomes have not been as encouraging , short -term \nrates remain negative , despite being over a decade  from  the financial crisis.   \nSo how is policy to respond?  \n One reaction to the limitations on lowering short -term policy rates in the wake of the \nGreat Recession has been for central banks to use their balance sheets to push down long-term \nrates.   These quant itative easings and maturity transformations  could be considered  the \n“traditional nontraditional\" policies.   However, Figure 2  shows that  the buffer  for this alternate \nmonetary  policy  tool is also in a somewhat diminished  state.  In the U .S., the 10 -year Tre asury \nrate has fluctuated recently between 1.5 and 2 percent, below the Fed’s  2 percent inflation target.  \nIn Germany and Japan , 10-year nominal rates are already negative, providing very little , if any , \ncapacity for monetary policy stimulus using  balance sheet actions.  \n While we don’t know exactly how long low rates will last, some of the underlying factors \nproducing low equilibrium rates are likely to persist .  Slowing population  growth  and aging \npopulations are with us for the duration.  We can hope for improved productivity gains , and that \nmay happen, but we do not  see signs yet of a convincing resurgence in trend productivity growth.  \nFigure 3  provides the median and central tendency  around what the Federal Open Market \nCommittee (FOMC), the U.S. monetary policy decision -making body,  expects the federal funds \nrate to be in the long er run.  The estimate of the long er-run nominal federal funds rate has \n\n  EMBARGOED UNTIL  \n8:15 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time (2 :15 P.M. Norway  Time) on Mon day, November 11, 2019 - OR UPON DELIVERY  \n  \n \n5 \n declined significantly just since 2014, and  the most recent median estimate of 2.5 percent is the \nlowest it has been over the past five years.  \n The implications of th e diminished monetary policy buffer are  significant .  Monetary \npolicy has been the tool of choice to provide countercyclical stimulus  during much of the \npostwar era.  Given the  current  diminished monetary  policy  buffer, recessions  may be deeper and \nrecoveries slower than what we have experienced historically , unless additional buffers  are \nprovided by fiscal, regulatory , and financial stability policies  and deemed appropriate to utilize \nby policymakers .  \n \nImplications for the Bank ing System  \n One implication of a low interest rate environment with limited monetary policy buffers \nis that recoveries from future recession s may be more shallow, possibly resulting in a prolonged \nperiod of relatively poor economic performance , and an extended episode of policy rates at the \neffective lower bound .  The implications for the banking system are important to consider.  \nMany bank s tress tests , such as those conducted in the U.S., do not  capture the  effects of \nprolonged economic underperformance  on banks , as the  tests often consider a span of only a \ncouple years (in the U.S., nine quarters) .  If the tests underestimate the full impact of sluggish \nrecoveries in a low rate environment, they might correspondingly indicate  capital buffers that are \ninsufficient to protect banks against losses .3  \n Figure 4  shows the path of three capital ratios  for U.S. Gl obal Systemically Important \nBank Holding Companies, or GSIBs .  Equity capital to total assets and the tier 1 leverage  ratio \nboth leveled off in early 2016 and have declined somewhat since then.  The common equity t ier \n\n  EMBARGOED UNTIL  \n8:15 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time (2 :15 P.M. Norway  Time) on Mon day, November 11, 2019 - OR UPON DELIVERY  \n  \n \n6 \n 1 risk -based capital ratio is now modestly higher than in  2016.  It’s worth recalling the equity \ncapital and tier 1 leverage ratios were focal points for many investors during the financial crisis.   \nThe recent declines  in these key capital ratios  raise  the question of whether the level of capital \nrepresents an adequate  and appropriate buffer , if a low interest rate , constrained monetary policy  \nenvironment  continues . \n Figure 5  shows the profitability of the largest banks in the United States, the Euro Ar ea, \nand Japan.   In both the Euro Area and Japan, the challenging macroeconomic environment has \nresulted in very depressed interest rates.   In the U.S., which is no longer at the effective lower \nbound, the macroeconomic environment has been more favorable.   Differences in bank \nprofitability reflect, in part, the impact of these macroeconomic differences.   In an environment \nof a hypothetical global recession, it is unlikely that the profit opportunities would be any better \n– in fact, the loan losses could pro vide a very challenging environment.  \n With capital ratios in the U .S. leveling off  – and in some instances falling  – and \nprofitability depressed  in certain regions , it is important to ask whether the financial system is  \nprepared for a  hypothetical  global economic downturn .  In addressing that question, i t is \ninteresting to consider  banks ’ payout ratios, as shown in Figure 6 .  In the United States, even as  \ndividends have been increasing, share repurchases have also been accelerating, resulting in qu ite \nhigh payout ratios  (specifically, dividends and repurchases as a share of net income) .  If the \nstress test no long er requires U.S. banks to pre -fund dividends and share buybacks  – that is, if \nbanks are no longer required to meet capital ratios after payouts in stress conditions  – one can \nexpect payout ratios to rise further , dissipating the volume of capital that would be available to \nensure solvency .4  \n\n  EMBARGOED UNTIL  \n8:15 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time (2 :15 P.M. Norway  Time) on Mon day, November 11, 2019 - OR UPON DELIVERY  \n  \n \n7 \n  One way to avoid such  a difficult operating environment for banks is to activate the  \nCounter cyclic al Capital Buffers (CCyB) .5  By increasing capital requirements during an \neconomic expansion, the CCyB would put b anks in a better position  to handle an economic \ndownturn  in an era in which monetary policy buffers  are limited .  Hopefully , better -capitalized  \nbanks would help compensate for limited monetary and fiscal policy  buffers .   \nFigure 7  shows the CCyBs  currently in effect and announced by jurisdiction.6  There is \noften a long transition period between the announcement of a Countercyclical Capital Buffer \nchange and its implementation.  The chart shows  that many countries have increase d their \nCCyBs , and some are planning further increases .  In the U .S., in sharp contrast , the CCyB  \nremains at zero.   \nIn my view, proposals that would substitute CCyBs for capital adequacy buffers could \nhave undesirable effects. 7  Although the CCyB could provide an offset for the lack of monetary \npolicy buffer in a low interest rate environment, banks would likely be undercapitalized at the \ntrough  of the economic downturn once the CCyB has been reduced – due to the lower capital \nrequirements going into a recession.  \nIn the last recession, banks were unwilling to stop dividend  payout s in a proactive way.  \nThis is not surprising ; no bank wants to sign al it is in distress, but this potential reputational risk \nresults in banks being slow to retain needed capital.  Regulatory stress tests can help by requiring \nall banks to be able to fund dividends and share buybacks in stressed situations .  Given the lik ely \ninability of banks to raise funds sufficient to pre -fund high dividend payouts, this would likely \nresult in most banks reduc ing payouts to meet the regulatory pre-funding requirement  as their \ncapital is eroded.   \n\n  EMBARGOED UNTIL  \n8:15 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time (2 :15 P.M. Norway  Time) on Mon day, November 11, 2019 - OR UPON DELIVERY  \n  \n \n8 \n Indeed, Figure 8  examines the 2007 -2010 period and compares cumulative cash \ndividends paid on common stock by the largest banks to the capital infusions they received \nthrough the Capital Purchase Program.  The chart illustrates that roughly half of the capital \ninfus ions into the largest banks during the financial crisis could have been avoided with a more \nproactive reduction in dividend payouts as economic problems ar ose.   \nThere is little reason to believe that banks will be more proactive in the next crisis if they \nare no longer required to pre -fund payout s as a mean s of managing the risk attending stressed \nconditions .  I also see the historical record arguing against the recently proposed change to no \nlonger require pre -funding of payout  amounts . \n In summary, I am not sur e that recent developments and proposals  in bank regulation \nproperly reflect the risks we are likely to face in a low  interest  rate environment that challenges \nbank profitability and provides less by way of monetary policy buffers.  Specifically, capital \nbuffers should be rising now so that there is more room for them to decline if the economy \nfalters.  While this is true for the United States, it may be even more true in Japan and Europe . \n \nLeverage in the Corporate Sector  \n In a low i nterest rate environment  with robust capital market conditions, corporations  are \nincented  to take on more leverage.  And leverage  potentially amplifies the  economic problems \nthat arise in a downturn .8  Outside the U.S., in some jurisdictions, there are mor e opportunities \nfor regulators to influence or limit excessive leverage.  I believe U.S. policymakers would do \nwell to explore ways that policies could be used to prevent the buildup of leverage in a low -rate \n\n  EMBARGOED UNTIL  \n8:15 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time (2 :15 P.M. Norway  Time) on Mon day, November 11, 2019 - OR UPON DELIVERY  \n  \n \n9 \n environment, hopefully reducing the  macroeconomic spillover that could result from over-\nlevered  households and firms.  \n Figure 9  shows the ratio of nonfinancial corporate business debt to GDP in the U .S.  This \nratio now exceeds its peak prior to the last recession and is at a n all-time high for the series.  As \nworrisome as this level of debt is , as the financial crisis highlighted , the distribution of risks to \nleverage across types of borrowers  may be as important as the level of leverage  itself.  \n Figure 10  shows the share of investment grade bonds rated BBB, the lowest rating that \nstill qualifies as investment grade.  Prior to t he past two recessions , the share of BBB -rated \ninvestment -grade bonds was much lower, and then increased significantly during and following \nthe recessi on. In those episodes, the rising share of BBB -rated debt  initially  reflected , in part, \ndowngrades of what were formerly higher -rated securities.  However, as this long recovery  has \nprogressed , the share of BBB securities has instead risen steadily , as fir ms have chosen to issue \nsignificant quantit ies of debt securities . \n Figure 11  shows the share of loan  issuances  with high leverage, used here to refer to  six \nor more times earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization ( EBITDA ).  While \nthe share of highly leveraged loans out of to tal loans has increased significantly since 2010, the \nshare of highly leveraged loans used to finance leveraged buyout s has risen even more \ndramatically .  In the United States , guidance – including the leveraged lo an guidance  – is not \nitself legally enforceable on banks.  In addition, unlike in other countries where regulators may \nlimit leveraged lending for financial stability reasons, the suite of macroprudential  tools is more \nlimited in the U.S. and U.S. bank reg ulators have sought to address bank s’ provision of \nleveraged loans through consideration of safety and soundness of the individual banks.  As a \n\n  EMBARGOED UNTIL  \n8:15 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time (2 :15 P.M. Norway  Time) on Mon day, November 11, 2019 - OR UPON DELIVERY  \n  \n \n10 \n result, we see that the low interest rate environment, and the global willingness to “reach for \nyield,” have pro vided a ready market for corporations  issuing highly leveraged loans.   \n Thus , corporations are not only becoming more leveraged relative to GDP, but the \ndistribution of credits is much more skewed towards the riskier credits than in the past.  In sum, \none implication of this low interest rate environment has been that it appears to have encourage d \nlenders to look for higher -risk and higher -return loans .  That desire has been met by a  ready \nmarket for corporations willing to fund themselves with this riskier debt.  Unfortunately, t his \nstate of affairs  is likely to lead to  more corporations being in financial distress – or even being in \nbankruptcy – in a hypothetical recession because they are no longer able to service their high \ndebt lev els.  Greater corporate losses in a downturn, in turn , will exacerbate the negative \noutcomes relative to those that would have occurred with a less risky state of leverage.  The \nlimited monetary policy buffers available magnify the problem.  So I consider it impo rtant to ask \nwhether such high leverage, and the potential collateral damage it may cause in a downturn, \nrequire s more significant public policy responses.  \n \nConcluding Observations  \n While a low interest rate environment has implications for the sufficiency of monetary \npolicy buffers  – a topic of the  current  monetary policy framework discussion in the United States  \n– it also has implications for regulatory policies and financial stability policies.  A low interest \nrate environment is likely to  depress bank profits and , separately,  make monetary policy less able \nto offset shocks.  This combination suggests a higher capital buffer is required  now than what \nwould  be need ed in a higher interest rate environment , so that capital  ratios will have more room \n\n  EMBARGOED UNTIL  \n8:15 A.M.

At least to date, it is my view that capital regulations may not \nfully reflect this increased risk.  \n Similarly, financial stability concerns stemming from  leverage in the economy may \nrequire some  rethinkin g in a low interest rate environment.

Rosengren  \nPresident & Chief Executive Officer  \nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston  \n \n \nThe Forecasters Club of New York  \n \n \n \nNew York , New York  \nDecember  17, 2019 \n \n \n \n\n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL  \n1:00 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Tuesday, December 17, 2019 - OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n1 \n  \nGood afternoon.  Than k you for inviting me to N ew York to address the Forecasters \nClub.  A s we close out a year and begin to look to a new one , it is a  great time to be talking about  \nforecasts  and the economic outlook .   \nI’ll begin with a summary overview, and then walk you through some key data.  \nThe economy continues to perform quite well , as the December employment report from \nthe Labor Department highlighted .  We have strong  labor markets , with the unemployment rate \nreturning to its 50 -year low .  And the reported  job growth of 266,000 was a nice surprise , \nparticularly for  retailers hop ing for strong holiday sales.  Consistent with the positive news in the \nemployment report, retailers I have talk ed with have been optimistic  about h oliday sales .  \nFortunately for the  economy, m any consumer s seem to be  in a buying mood.  \n Since April , the economy  has performed  pretty much as many professional forecasters \nexpected  – this, despite recent concerns with downside risks , notably those  associated with  \nslower global growth and uncertainty about  trade policy .  While the composition  of real GDP has \nbeen somewhat different th an expected by many forecasts from late spring , GDP growth and \nunemployment have generally been quite close to what was forecast  – for example in  the Survey \nof Professional Forecasters , the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia’s quarterly survey of \nroughly 50 forecasters . \n Several months ago the  financial news  seemed to highlight  the increasing likelihood of an  \neconomic downturn, but more recently  those concerns appear  to have subsided .  In fact, the \noutlook s of most private forecasters ha ve consistently centered on continued growth in the  \neconomy, even while the prognosticators who focus on financial variables such as the slope of \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL  \n1:00 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Tuesday, December 17, 2019 - OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n2 \n yield curve have placed a higher probability o n an economic downturn.  In other words , financial \nmarket  practitioner s may have priced in slightly more risk to the economy, but economic \nforecasters saw the most likely outcome as economic expansion.    \nMy own view is that it is unlikely we will have a n economic downturn  in the coming \nyear, given the  generally  positive financial conditions and the continued accommodative \nmonetary and fiscal policies.  Of course , this outlook  assumes that we do not have a significant \nnegative shock from abroad , or experience a negative shock from a sharp ra tcheting up  of trade \ndisputes with major trading partners.1 \n With the recent positive economic news, and with monetary and fiscal policy al ready \naccommodative, I see no need to make the current stance of monetary policy  more \naccommodative  in the near term.  Given that monetary policy works with lags, and Federal \nReserve policymakers have already eased monetary policy three times in 2019, my view is that it \nis approp riate to take a patient approach to considering any policy  changes,  unles s there is a \nmaterial change to the  outlook . \n I would like to turn now to why my perspective  on the economy is optimistic.  I’ll review \nboth the  forecast s and economic data , to explain  my outlook . \n \nThe Economic Outlook  \n Turning to the data, Figure 1  shows the Survey of Professional Forecasters’ outlook for \nthe unemployment rate , and the actual data for the first three quarters  of the year .  Since  April, \nthe unemployment rate has moved  in a tight range.  In April , the unemployment rate was 3.6 \npercent, and in November the unemployment rate was  little change d at 3.5 percent.  In the \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL  \n1:00 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Tuesday, December 17, 2019 - OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n3 \n intervening period , it fluctuated in a range from 3.5 to 3.7  percen t.  November’s Survey of \nProfessional Forecasters show s that forecast ers expect the unemployment rate to remain in th is \nrange  for the next year .  In addition, the shaded region shows the spread between the 25th and \n75th percentile forecasts  is quite  narrow.  My own forecast is quite similar , in that I believe the \nunemployment rate will likely fluctuate narrowly around its current value.  \n Figure 2  provides actuals for the first three quarters  of the year and the Survey of \nProfessional Forecasters expe ctations  for core inflation  – which is measured using the Personal \nConsumption Expenditures , or PCE , price index .2  In early  2019 , core PCE inflation was lower \nthan expected.  However, most forecasters continue to believe  that shortfall  reflect ed temporary  \nfactors  – and thus they expect the  core PCE, which has subsequently risen , to remain  close to the \nFed’s  2 percent inflation target in 2020.3  My own forecast is quite similar .  I expect that given \nthe strong  labor market, PCE inflation should move in a narrow range around the Fed’s 2 percent \ntarget.  \n Figure 3  provides actual and forecast real GDP growth.  The economy has grown  at close \nto a 2 percent  annual rate  over th e past two quarters , as strength in the household sector has \nlargely offset  the weakness in business investment.  That pattern is likely to continue, as \nconsumer  spending is  bolstered by job creation, increases in personal income, and increases in \nwealth.  In addition, the recent monetary policy easing is likely to continue to bo lster the housing \nsector.  \n Overall the median forecasts from the Survey of Professional Forecasters look quite \nsimilar to my own.  The U.S. economy is quite solid, and barring  an unexpected adverse  shock, \nmy view is that the economy is currently well positioned for the coming year.   And, depending \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL  \n1:00 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Tuesday, December 17, 2019 - OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n4 \n on one’s view about potential GDP growth  – because growth above potential implies lower \nunemployment – it is an economy where labor markets might be expected to strength en further.  \nRisks to the Economic Forecast  \n Of course,  the global economy still faces a number of downside  risks. Yet, s ome of the \nconcerns surrounding trade and global growth that were elevated earlier this year appear to have \nabated somewhat .  As you may recall , earlier this fall there wa s significant discussion about a \nrising probability of a recession in 2020.  These concerns were particularly elevated around the \ntime that  trade discussions seemed to falter , and financial market participants became concerned \nthat the  temporarily  inverted  slope of the yield curve was portending an imminent slowdown.4 \n Despite the concerns  raised by financial market participants , most economic forecasters \nassessed a lo w probability of a recession.  The Survey of Professional Forecasters asks \nparticipants in the survey to provide their assessment  of the probability distribution of outcomes \nfor variables such as real GDP , for the coming year .  Figure 4 provides the average of \nprobabilities based on that survey.  The f igure shows most of the distribution of forecasts for  real \nGDP  fall in the 1 to 3 percent range.  Very  little of the distribution  is associated with \nprobabilities of negative real GDP , which is consisten t with a low likelihood of a recession next \nyear. \n To a large extent, these  probabilities likely reflect the strong household sector numbers I \nmentioned earlier .  Figure 5  shows the growth in real consumer spending , which has been quite \nstrong over the pas t two quarters.  As previously mentioned, p lentiful jobs and growth in income \nhave provided improvements in confidence and bode well for holiday sales  and beyond .  \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL  \n1:00 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Tuesday, December 17, 2019 - OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n5 \n  Trends in the saving rate and household wealth (net worth) shown in Figure 6  also \nhighlight why the consumer is well positioned to spend.  Both the saving rate and household net \nworth are trending upward simultaneously and have been for some time now, bringing their \nlevels to near highs.  As you can see from the portion of the cha rt before the last recession, t he \ntwo don’t typically move in the same direction.   \nFigure 7 shows that after a series of quarters in which  real residential investment  fell, the \nhousing sector appears to be responding to lower inte rest rates  in the marketp lace.  Of course,  the \nlower mortgage rates are partly spurred by the F ederal Open Market Committee ’s 75 basis  point  \nreduction in the federal funds  rate, as shown in Figure 8. \n Figure 9 shows one reason that a measure of the slope of the yield curve may not always \npredict an economic down turn, as I  have discussed in recent talks .  The blue line displays one \nmeasure of the slope  — the 10-year U.S. Treasury rate minus the 3 -month Treasury rate.  The \ngreen line shows the real federal funds rate , minus the estimated real e quilibrium  rate.  Positive \nvalues of this series are meant to capture times when  the Fed is pursuing restrictive monetary \npolicy, and vice versa for negative values.   In the  periods preceding the previous two recessions , \nthe Federal Reserve took a more restrictive monetary policy stance in respons e to rising wages \nand prices .  The more restrictive monetary policy in these episodes raise d the short -term interest \nrates enough to cause  an inversion of the yield curve.  \nIn each of the past three recessions, the green line has been in  positive  territory  – simply \nmeaning that  monetary policy became more restrictive ( the policy rate set by the Fed was higher \nthan the estimate of the equilibrium rate ) at the same time that the yield curve flattened  or \ninverted .  In the most recent period, the real federal funds rate has remained below the \nequilibrium interest rate  estimate .  Of course, the true value of the equilibrium interest rate (“r -\n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL  \n1:00 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Tuesday, December 17, 2019 - OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n6 \n star” or r*) is uncertain, and estimates have been declining for some time.  Yet i f the estimate is \naccurate, w ith the  recent  75 basis  point s of reduction the federal funds rate  is now much lower \nthan the estimated equilibrium rate .5   If a negative  slope of the yield curve was , in part , \npredictive because of its association with tightening monetary policy , it may be less predictive in \ncurrent circumstances  – because unlike the other historical episodes, monetary policy continues \nto be accommodative . \n An inverted yield curve isn’t the only risk  to the economic outlook , however.  Figure 10 \nhighlights another reason why some analysts have been concerned about a possible  recession.  \nThe purchasing managers ’ survey from the Institute for Supply Management  provides both \nmanufacturing and  nonmanufacturing ind ices, where observations above 50 indicate increases  in \nactivity , and observations below 50 indicate declines.  A decli ne in manufacturing is sometimes  a \nleading indicator of a potential recession.   And at times, such declines  have sometimes predicted \nrecessions that never occurred.   \nAs an alternative, n ote that the past two recessions were associated with sub-50 readings \nfor both the manufacturing and nonmanufacturing surveys.  As just noted , when only the \nmanufacturing sector has fallen below 50, it has not been a reliable predictor of  a recession.  One \ncould argue that the current reading has the potentia l to be another such false signal, given \ncurrent events.  In particular, s ince tariffs are particularly focused on traded goods, it is not \nsurprising that manufacturing has been weak.  However, the services that account for the \nnonmanufacturing index movem ent have held up quite well, since these industries have not been \nas directly impacted by the trade disputes.  \n Figure 1 1 illustrate s another indication t hat financial conditions remain  accommodative : \nthe very low 10 -year Treasury term premium.  In other words , not only is the federal funds rate \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL  \n1:00 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Tuesday, December 17, 2019 - OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n7 \n below the equilibrium rate, but long rates also remain quite low by historical standards.  The \nterm premium is likely low, at least in part, because many developed countries are still \nconducting quantitative easing , making U .S. Treasuries look quite attractive by comparison, \nboosting their demand and depress ing the 10-year U.S. Treasury rate.   \n With both fiscal and monetary policy being accommodative, financial conditions \nsupportive, and recent data positive, I agr ee with the  surveyed  professional forecasters that the \nlikelihood of a recession in 2020  is relatively low.  However, a low probability does not mean it \ncannot happen, and certainly a negative shock from abroad or a significant flare up in trade \ndispute s could change the outlook significantly.   Hence, as always, i t is appropriate to continue \nto closely monitor incoming data.  \n \nConcluding O bservations  \n In summary and conclusion, my view is that the economy is currently in a good place.  \nLabor markets are strong , inflation is moving to target, and growth is likely to be somewhat \nabove potential.  Particularly given the recent cuts in the federal funds rate, and the fact that \nmonetary actions take effect with some lag, I would say that this is a good time to  patiently \nassess the economy.  In the short run, I do not see a need for additional policy easing  unless there \nis a material change to the forecast.  \n Thank you , and best wishes for a happy and healthy New Year.   \n \n1 For additional discussion, see: Rosengren, Eric: “ Exploring Economic Conditions and the Implications for \nMonetary Policy ,” Oct. 11, 2019.                                                              \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL  \n1:00 P.M.

It is a pleasure to be here at Brookings.  I’d like to thank David Wessel \nof the Hutchins Center  for inviting me to participate in this forum.  I t is also my pleasure to be \nhere with John David Murra y of the Bank of Canada , to provide some observations in response  \nto his comments .1   \nAt the outset, let me note as I always do that the views I express  are my own, not \nnecessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal Reserve Board or the Federal Open Market \nCommittee (FOMC).  \n\n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 4:25 P.M.  Eastern Time on Monday, January 8 , 201 8 OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n3 \n The monetary policy framework ad opted by the Federal Reserve is rooted squarely in our  \n“dual mandate ” from Congress,  which directs the Fed to seek maximum sustainable employment  \nand stable prices .2  And i n the spirit of today’s conference, I want to pose a couple of questions  \nthat tee up my remarks.  G iven that the Congressional mandate has not changed, why might it be \nbeneficial to evaluate the  Fed’s monetary  policy  framework periodically?  And relatedly, w hy is \nthe framework not as durable as the Congressional mandate?  \nImpor tantly , the Congressional mandate is quite broad.  It wa s not until 2012 that the \nFederal Reserve explicitly defined the stable -prices component of the mandate in numerical \nterms , as a 2 percent inflation target tied to total PCE inflation .3  The second half of the man date, \nmaximum employment, was  not assigned  a numerical  target  given that the Fed does not , of \ncourse,  set the natural rate of unemployment – and estimates of the natural rate have changed \nconsiderably over time , with  changes in  demographic and labor -market characteristics .  \nSince 2012, the FOMC has voted at the beginning of each year on a statement of  longer -\nrun goals and monetary policy strategy , which provides a long- run goal for inflation (the 2 \npercent target ) and broadly defines a monetary policy strategy.  Currently, the strategy involves  a \nso-called balanced approach : the Committee gives equal weigh t to deviations of employment \nfrom an estimate of full employment, and to deviations of inflation from the  2 percent target.    \nIn light of this , one could argue that the U.S. version of the Bank of Canada’s five -year \nreview actually occurs at a yearly frequency at the Federal Reserve.   However , the Federal \nReserve’s  annual  reaffirmation of the longer -run inflation goal and monetary policy strategy has \nnot regularly  involved the  extensive discussion, and  incorporation of outside commen ts, that are \npart of  the Bank of Canada ’s process .   \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 4:25 P.M.  Eastern Time on Monday, January 8 , 201 8 OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n4 \n From my perspective, i t is possible that th e absence of m ore involved debate regarding \nthe Federal Reserve’s inflation goal and monetary policy strategy reflect s the fact that the FOMC \nis broadly comfortable with the status quo framework for achieving monetary policy goals and \nour mandate .  Still, with this in mind , I would suggest that there are several compelling \nargument s for a more robust periodic review of the  Federal Reserve’s  monetary policy \nframework.  \nFirst, admittedly the choice of the 2 percent inflation target reflected a commonly used \ntarget of other central banks , and was consistent with a literature that viewed a 2 percent target as \nlikely to be in the neighborhood of optimal.  However, much of that literature was based on pre -\ncrisis research that estimated that the effective lower bound for the policy interest rate would \nrarely  be hit, and that interest rates would remain at the effective lower bound only briefly.  That \nresearch appears to  have significantly underestimated  the real -world probability of hitting the \neffective lower bound.  Moreover, the probability of hitting the effective lower bound is higher \nin an economy with a low equilibrium real interest rate, as would be associated with our current \ncharacteristics of s low productivity growth, slow population growth, and  aging demogra phics .  \nIn fact, the optimal rate of inflation may move around just as does the natural rate of \nunemployment . \nSecond, t he ability to achieve an inflation target over a reasonable amount of time has \ncome into question as the U.S., Euro A rea, and Japan have all fallen short of their inflation \ntarget s, regularly  and quite consistently, since the onset of the financial crisis.  Notably, \nundershooting on inflation has occurred despite  aggressive  use of  less-traditional monetary tools  \ndesigned to make policy more  accommodative in the aftermath of the financial crisis, Great \nRecession, and very slow recovery .4 \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 4:25 P.M.  Eastern Time on Monday, January 8 , 201 8 OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n5 \n Third, U.S. policymakers must take into account complicating factors. .  W ith fiscal \npolicy constrained by rising debt -to-GDP  ratios, and questions about the potency of \nnontraditional monetary policy tools in generat ing robust recoveries, the trade -offs between the \ngoals  – and even the optimal level of the goals  – may be different now than when the FOMC  \nadopted the  framework.  \nIn light of al l this , in my view it may be a good time to consider putting in place a \nperiodic Federal Reserve led assessment of the U.S.  monetary policy framework that would \ninclude  input from a variety of sources inside and outside the central bank.  Such a periodic r e-\nevaluation could consider whether changed economic fundamentals (such as the equilibrium real \ninterest rate) should alter how best to satisfy the Congressional mandate given to the central \nbank.  \nFurthermore, a  periodic reassessment could involve consider ation of  whether alternative \nframeworks woul d better meet the mandate, and evaluate the costs and benefits of  transition ing \nto the new framework  – as well as  the longer -run implications .  For example, in recognition of \nthe challenges the Federal Reserve has  experienced with our  current framework , a reassessment \nmight include discuss ion of  whether an inflation range , nominal GDP targeting, or price -level \ntargeting  would help the Fed  better achieve its Congressionally -mandated goals.    In fact, my \nown view is that we should be focused on an inflation range , with the potential to move with in \nthe range as the optimal inflation rate changes.  This will be the topic of a talk I am giving later \nthis week, when I will have an opportunity dis cuss the suggestion more fully.  \nSimilar to the Bank of Canada, a U.S. review c ould include research  papers  by Fed \neconomists, as well as input from academics  and other macro -policy institutions .  This type of  \nperiodic  exercise could reinforce the Federal Reserve’s  commitment to attaining the \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 4:25 P.M.  Eastern Time on Monday, January 8 , 201 8 OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n6 \n Congressional mandates , while providing  a more public and transparent  forum for evaluating our \nperformance in attaining these goals.  \n Finally, I would note that a number of  process details could influence the efficacy of such \na review process .  The Bank of Canada has a full review every five years.   One does not want to \nevaluate a monetary policy  framework  too frequently , given that  changes in underlying \neconomic fundamentals are relatively  infrequent and take time to fully a ssess.  At the same time , \nit is important to make changes if the existing framework is no longer consist with how the \neconomy has evolved.   \nIt would also be extremely important to design a review process that appropriat ely \nbalances  the central bank ’s accountability to Congress for the mandate with  its independence  to \npursue policymaking and technical refinements .  Review s would need to focus on the structural  \nchanges that have reduced the efficacy of the Fed’s  monetary policy framework, not the injection \nof short -term partisan political influence .  While any significant change in the framework should \ninvolve active consultation with Congress  – as was the case when the Fed formally adopted its \nnumerical price ob jective  in 2012 – the review  should be focused on the technical framework \nthat the central bank employs to achieve the Congressional mandate ’s goals  and would need to \nbe seen as such .   \nMy own personal preference would be to conduct a full review with a specified frequency \n– possibly longer than the five years used by the Bank of Canada – but to make it possible to call \nfor an earlier review when warranted.  Given the unpredictability of changes in the optimal \ntargets, providing the option to call for a special review would be important.  This would allow \nfor a re -examination when needed – specifically when most participants view economic events \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 4:25 P.M.  Eastern Time on Monday, January 8 , 201 8 OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n7 \n as justifying a full re -examination of the framework.  Clearly, however, this is just one a pproach \nand there are a variety of other permutations that could be considered by the FOMC.  \nIn summary and conclusion, the Bank of Canada provides a process which I view as quite \ninstructive.  My own view is that the costs of hitting the effective lower bo und, and staying there \nfor a prolonged period, should cause a reassessment of whether a specific 2 percent inflation \ntarget is still warranted.  The optimal inflation rate is unlikely to be 2 percent if economic \nfundamental s cause the central bank’s policy  rate to regularly hit the effective lower bound \nduring economic downturns.  As a result, having a process that can fully and more transparently \nexamine the monetary policy framework would be a process improvement, and would allow the \nFederal Reserve to sy stematically examine and alter its framework when needed.  \nThank you.  \n \n                                                           \n1 As John Murray illustrated in his presentation, the Bank of Canada has a process for revisiting its inflation target \nand monetary policy framework that has been in place for quite some time. This process occurs at a regular five -year \nfrequency, it seeks comments from academics and the general public and, though not legislated, it features the \nexplicit involvement of the government.  See http://www.bankofcan ada.ca/core- functions/monetary -policy/.  \n \n2 The dual mandate is derived from The Federal Reserve Reform Act of 1977.  Among the changes made to the \nFederal Reserve Act was a directive to \"maintain long -run growth of the monetary and credit aggregates \ncommensurate with the economy's long -run potential to increase production, so as to promote effectively the goals \nof maximum employment, stable prices and moderate long -term interest rates.\"  The shorthand for this is the goal of \nmaximum employment consist ent with stable prices.  \n \n3 In order to provide more clarity about how the Federal Reserve implemented t he dual mandate, t he FOMC issued \nthe Statement on Longer -Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy , which  is important for clarifying to the public \nwhat mon etary policy is about, and also for providing FOMC members with a common framework when conducting \npolicy. FOMC members will have different opinions about economic conditions and where the economy is headed. \nStill, according to the strategy document, the w ay these differences are translated into different policy \nrecommendations should be consistent across FOMC members, in that members agree to share the same inflation \ngoal and assign the same penalty to deviations of inflation and unemployment from their lo nger-run values.    \nThe statement became effective January 24, 2012 , and  was subsequently amended , effective January 31, 2017 . See \nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/faqs/statement -on-longer -run-goals -monetary -policy -strategy -fomc.htm .  \n \n4 As already mentioned, the statement on longer -run goals and monetary policy strategy specifies a balanced \napproach on stabilizing inflation around the inflation target and the unemployment rate around its natural level.

He was courageous in \nMoney, Models, & Digital Innovation Conference   \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 4:15 P.M.  Eastern  Time , and 1:15 P.M. Pacific  Time  on Friday, January 12,  2018  OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n3 \n the Dutch Underground in World War II, success ful as a banking leader, a passionate advoca te \nfor invest ment  in inner cities, and committed to many civic and philanthropic causes . \nBefore I begin my remarks today , let me note as I always do that the views I express are \nmy own, not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal Reserve Board or the Federal \nOpen Market Committee (FOMC).    \nI would like  to start by  reflecting on the past year ’s economic performance , which was \nbetter than most forecasters were expect ing a year ago.  U.S. l abor markets have continued to \nimprove ; and with the unemployment rate now at 4.1 percent , I think we have clearly lef t the \nperiod of the Great Recession behind.   Real GDP growth in the second and third quarters of 2017 \nwas over 3 percent  – well abov e the level of growth economists call “ potential .” By definition,  if \nabove -potential growth  continues , as expected by many forecasters, labor market s will tighten \nfurther , likely pushing the unemployment rate well below its sustainable rate .   \nInflation has also been subdued, especially considering that it has already  been  a fairly \nlong economic recovery b y historical standards.  Low inflation  has enabled the Federal Reserve  \nto pursue  a very gradual exit from the extraordinary monetary policy accommodation  under taken \nto address the financial crisis, the Great Recession, and the slow recovery . The Fed’s policy \naccommodation, along with a well -recovered economy, ha ve been generally good for asset  \nprice s, including stocks . \nWhile the economic news has remained  positive , the extent of  the forecast “ misses ” by \nFOMC participants and private sector forecasters  – our forecast errors for both inflation and \nunemployment – are relevant for the topic of this conference on money and models.  On a \nquarterly basis, FOMC participants provide their economic forecasts for key economic variables, \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 4:15 P.M.  Eastern  Time , and 1:15 P.M. Pacific  Time  on Friday, January 12,  2018  OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n4 \n called the Summ ary of Economic Projections or SEP.  At the December 2016 FOMC meeting,  \nthe median SEP forecast  was that  2017  would finish with the unemployment rate at 4.5 percent \nand core inflation (measured using the Personal Consumption Expenditures or PCE price index) \nat a rate of  1.8 percent .  Instead, the unemployment rate ended up 0.4 perce nt lower than \nexpected ; and core PCE inflation , based on the data through November, was 0.3  percent lower \nthan expected.  While these are not overwhelming forecast errors by historical standards, t he \ninflation miss, in particular, has  received significant attention by some observers  – as inflation \nhas been lower than expected , despite labor markets  that are tighter than expected . \nMy own perspective on this is that the recent miss es in the Fed’s  inflation forecast ha ve \nnot been particularly large, taken in the context of the forecast errors made historically in \nforecasting infla tion.  The forecast errors for inflation also have not been particularly consistent \nor persistent , which would  be expect ed if the Fed’s  inflation models were missing some \nfundamental change in the inflation process.  As a result,  I would argue that  it does not seem \njustified to assum e there have been  changes in the underlying inflation process , based on  \nrelatively modest recent miss es.  Of course, if we continue to experience one -sided forecast \nerrors for another year or two, the possibility of struc tural change should be considered more \nseriously.   \n           Thus, I do not view the somewhat lower than expected  recent inflation rate as particularly \ntroublesome for near-term monetary  policy .  But looking to the medium and long run, I do see \nlow and fixed inflation targets  as a potential problem  – particularly if we continue to experience \nlow productivity  growth , a low equilibrium interest rate, and the  near-certainty of a slowly \ngrowing  and aging  workforce .  In such an environment, with a two percent inflation goal, \nnominal interest rates are likely to be low , on average.  As a consequence, when a recession \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 4:15 P.M.  Eastern  Time , and 1:15 P.M. Pacific  Time  on Friday, January 12,  2018  OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n5 \n eventually does occur , policymakers  would likely start with a low policy rate  – perhaps 3 percent \nor so  – leaving little room to  lower rates to offset the effects of the recession.  The desire to \nretain an adequate “policy buffer”  – by which I mean the amount of room we have to lower rates \nto offset recessions  – lies at the heart of my evolving thoughts on the appropriate monetary \npolicy framework.2   \nIf, as a result,  we seek to avoid a prolonged low  interest rate environment in the future, \nthen my view is that polic ymakers  should start studying and discussing alternative frameworks  to \nmake this outcome less likely.  While there is little that monetary policy can do to impact \nproductivity or labor force growth, policymakers  can influence the prevailing level of interest \nrates by adjusting our medium -term inflation goal.3  One option woul d be targeting a higher \ninflation rate,4 so that nominal interest rates would be higher than otherwise  – and there have \nbeen other more technical proposals  (for example  price -level targeting and nominal GDP \ntargeting)  designed to provide a greater buffer .5  \nI would also suggest that t he optimal inflation rate is not likely to remain constant over \ntime.  An alternative , which  would recognize that the inflation target should not necessarily be \nconstant, is an inflation range with an adjustable inflation target.  W ithin this framework, one \ncould  think of our inflation goal as defined by two components: A range  of inflation rates  that \npolicymakers  would find acceptable across many economic circumstances, and a medium -term \ngoal within that range that policymakers  would set , perhaps year by year, depending on specific \neconomic circumstances.   \nIn my view, a dopting an inflation range  that allows for movement in the effective \nmedium -run inflation goal might be a helpful addition to the Fed’s  monetary policy framework.6  \nAn inflation range that allows some movement in the inflation target , depending on economic \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 4:15 P.M.  Eastern  Time , and 1:15 P.M. Pacific  Time  on Friday, January 12,  2018  OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n6 \n fundamentals , would be treating the Fed’s  inflation goal more like the natural rate of \nunemployment, where we recognize that the natural rate will shift over time with demographic \nand other workforce characteristics.  \nOf course, the advantages of greater inflation targ et flexibility would likely be partly \noffset by some costs .  For instance, i t is likely  that such  flexibility would generate more \nuncertainty about inflation in the medium to long run, since we cannot know for sure how long  \nproductivity and demographic tre nds would persist.7  However, if we set the range to  – for \nexample  – 1.5 to 3.0 percent, and were successful in  keep ing inflation mostly in that range, this \nwould represent a set of inflation outcomes that are similar to those  the U.S.  has experienced \nover the past 20 years.   \n \nPerspectives on Recent Forecast Misses  \n          As previously mentioned, o nce a quarter, FOMC participants provide their economic \nforecasts for key economic variables.  Among the charts that are included are the so called “fan \ncharts, ” shown in Figure 1  for PCE inflation.   The fan chart  show s that even at a 70 percent \nconfidence level, the forecast errors for PCE inflation are quite large.   Thus, w ith the current 2 \npercent forecast, it would not be at all surprising to have actual inflation turn out to somewhere \nbetween  1 to 3 percent.   \nThe sources of these forecast misses are many: large , unexpected changes in energy, \nfood, import or other volatile  prices can temporarily disrupt overall inflation measures relative \nto the forecast; the economy can grow faster or slower than we expect; or our assessment of what \nis relatively fast or slow can be off.  A good examp le of an unexpected price change is the \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 4:15 P.M.  Eastern  Time , and 1:15 P.M. Pacific  Time  on Friday, January 12,  2018  OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n7 \n modification  in wireless service pricing by many U.S. mobile carriers  that occurred last spring . \nThis change  is one of the factors that lowered the PCE inflation rate relative to the  forecast in \nDecember 2016.    \n Figure 2 provides some history on SEP8 and private -sector  forecast errors , comparing the \nmedian core PCE inflation rate forecast for one -year-ahead to the actual rate,  based on both the \nSEP and the Survey of Professional Forecasters’ fourth  quarter forecasts for  each year .9  While \nthe forecast error (based on the 2016  fourth -quarter forecast for the core inflation rate10 for the \nfourth quarter of 2017 ) was clearly a miss, it certainly was not outsized relative to other one-\nyear-ahead forecast errors made over the past 10 years.  In addition, forecasters made  both \npositive and negative forecast errors  during this period , not persistently missing in one direction.  \nThis forecast record  seems inconsistent with concerns of some obser vers who argue  forecasters  \nare missing some fundamental attribute of inflation dynamics.  \n Figure 3 provides forecast errors for the unemployment rate forecast, by comparing both \nthe SEP and the Survey of Professional Forecasters ’ median  unemployment rate  forecast for the \nfourth quarter of the next year with the actual rate, for each fourth -quarter forecast.   While the \n2016 fourth -quarter forecast  error for the unemployment rate in the fourth quarter of 2017 is not \nparticularly large relative to previous y ears, there do seem to be persistent , consistent forecast  \nerrors  in the same direction for the unemployment rate, unlike for the inflation rate .  That is, \nsince 2010 , forecasters have  regularly anticipated the unemployment rate would fall less than \nactuall y occurred.  \n From a short -run policy perspective, the inflation forecast errors do not seem to be \nparticularly noteworthy, and would not seem to indicate serious forecast biases over the past \ndecade .  In contrast , the persistent forecasts that unemployment  will not fall as much as has \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 4:15 P.M.  Eastern  Time , and 1:15 P.M. Pacific  Time  on Friday, January 12,  2018  OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n8 \n occurred should provide  policymakers pause , since at 4.1 percent the unemployment rate is \nalready well below most estimates of the sustainable long -run unemployment rate .  The most \nrecent median estimate for the natural rate from the Survey of Professional Forecasters is 4.5 \npercent; the corresponding median longer -run unemployment rate estimate from the December \nSEP is 4.6 percent.  \n \nModels and the Monetary Policy Framework  \nSince January 2012 , the FOMC has publish ed a statement  of longer -run goals and \nmonetary policy strategy11 that it reaffirms, sometimes with small modifications, at each January \nFOMC meeting. The statement provides the FOMC ’s tactical approach for meeting the Federal \nReserve’s dual mandate provided by Congress : foster ing economic conditions to achiev e both \nstable prices and maximum sustainable employment .   \nThe statement  explicitly define s the inflation goal as being a 2 percent inflation target.12  \nThe employment mandate does not have a numerical target because  the natural rate  of \nunemployment  is primarily determined by non -monetary factors , must be inferred from other \neconomic data, and has moved significantly over time .13  The statement also clarifi es that when \nthere are misses in both elements of the dual manda te, the Committee should follow a balanced \napproach , by which we mean that we will give  equal  policy  attention to  deviations of \nemployment from an estimate of full employment, and to deviations of  inflation from its 2 \npercent target.  \nAt the time of adoptio n of the statement o n longer -run goals , the 2 percent inflation target \nwas quite similar to the target set by most other central banks in developed economies.14  Many \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 4:15 P.M.  Eastern  Time , and 1:15 P.M. Pacific  Time  on Friday, January 12,  2018  OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n9 \n academic studies advocate d for a 2 percent inflation target as being consi stent with price \nstability, although  many of the m were conducted prior to the Great Recession.  Most of this \nresearch that attempted to determine how large a policy buffer  would be sufficient  – and thus \nhow high a target inflation rate would be best  – generally estimated that  interest rates were \nunlikely to reach the effective lower bound, but if they did, the expected duration at near -zero \ninterest rates would be measured in quarters, not years .   \nUnfortunately, the economic history of the past 10 years has shown that many developed \ncountries in the wake of the Great Recession and financial crisis were forced to hold interest \nrates  near zero for many years, much longer than the earlier model estimat es suggested .15  Such \nlow interest rate  environments  make it difficult to conduct counter -cyclical monetary policy , and \ncan potentially undermine financial stability , as households and firms “reach for yield” in the \nface of  low interest rates , almost always  taking on additional risk as a consequence . \nIt is not surprising , in my view, that many estimates assumed that a period of prolonged \nlow interest rates w as unlikely.  In an economy with rapid increases in productivity and an \nexpanding  labor force, periods  of prolonged low interest rates are likely to be  avoided  in most \nrecessions .  However, the size of the negative shock from the Great Recession , along with  \nfundamental changes in the economy ,16 have made it much more likely that future recessions \ncould also result in prolonged low interest rates and a need to conduct monetary policy with  \nnontraditional methods , such as asset purchases on  central banks’  balance sheet s – rather than \njust through movement of short -term interest rates.  \nFigure 4  shows FOMC participants’ assessments of the longer -run rate that the federal \nfunds rate will settle to when the Fed has achieved both elements of the dual mandate. \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 4:15 P.M.  Eastern  Time , and 1:15 P.M. Pacific  Time  on Friday, January 12,  2018  OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n10 \n Recognizing the effects of slower productivity  growth and labor force growth on this so -called \n“neutral” rate of interest, SEP submissions have gradually lowered this measure since 2012.   \nIn early 2012, both the median forecast and the central tendency of FOMC participants \nwas that the federal funds target rate in the longer-run would be at least  4 percent.  As of \nDecember  2017 , both the median forecast and most of the central tendency expect  that the \nfederal funds target rate will be below 3 percent.17  Since most recessions involve lowering the \nfeder al funds target rate by more than 300 basis points, this makes it seem quite likely that a low \ninterest rate environment will become a more common occurrence.  \nFigure 5  illustrates one possible reason for the decline in the expectations of the longer -\nrun or neutral federal funds rate.  Productivity growth is much lower now than it has been for \nmuch of the previous 50 years.  This lower productivity  growth, as long as it persists,  implies \nthat real interest rates are likely to be lower  on average . \nFigure 6  provides another reason to expect lower real interest rates, which is the \nreduction in the growth in the civilian labor force.  With slower population growth, fewer \nimmigrants, and an aging population , the growth in the labor force is expected t o be much lower \nfor quite some time than it has been in previous decades.  Again, this implies lower real interest \nrates.  \n One way to avoid periods of prolonged low interest rates would be to alter the inflation \ntarget  in response to changes in our estimates of real interest rates  – estimates that have been \nchanging of late.  This would make inflation, like the natural un employment rate, a target that \ncould vary over time.  If , for example , the monetary policy framework set an inflation range  of, \nsay 1.5 to 3.0 percent, the FOMC could vary its medium -term inflation target to be high, low , or \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 4:15 P.M.  Eastern  Time , and 1:15 P.M. Pacific  Time  on Friday, January 12,  2018  OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n11 \n in the middle of the range depending on economic factors that the Committee could determine at \nthe beginning of each year.  For example, in the current environmen t, with low population \ngrowth and low productivity  growth , policy could move even more gradually to remove \naccommodation, and allow inflation to be somewhat higher in its range.  Should the labor force \nor productivity grow more quickly, the Committee could  seek to gradually reduce the inflation \ntarget  within its range . \nUsing an inflation range would trad e off the costs of more effective policy responses to \nrecessions (and the potential financial stability risk that may attend prolonged low interest rate \nperiods), with the costs of having somewhat less certainty about what the inflation rate would be \nin the long  run.  But a s long as the inflation rate w ere in a relatively narrow band , such as 1.5  to \n3.0 percent, the range would not be a dramatic change from a ctual experience and would \ntherefore be less likely to impact inflation expectations.  If changes in productivity and labor \nforce growth occurred very infrequently, the inflation target would be stable  – but at a level more \nconsistent with avoiding prolong ed low interest rates.  \n \nConclu ding Observations  \nRecent forecast errors of inflation and unemployment have not been particularly large, \nand do not pose much challenge to continuing on the current path of gradual increases in the \nfederal funds rate.  Perhaps  the bigger risk for short -run policy  is the fact that the unemployment \nrate continues to fall further below sustainable levels , and will likely continue to do so going \nforward, risking the sustainability of the recovery . \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 4:15 P.M.  Eastern  Time , and 1:15 P.M. Pacific  Time  on Friday, January 12,  2018  OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n12 \n A more significant longer -run matter, from my perspective,  is the opportunity  for the \nFederal Reserve’s  current monetary policy framework to adapt to the recent experience with \nprolonged low real interest rates.  If the U.S. economy is  to avoid a scenario in which the \neffective lower bound is reached and the central bank must use its balance sheet for asset \npurchases rather than  move  short -term interest rates for counter -cyclical monetary policy , then \npolicymakers  should consider alternative monetary policy frameworks that would make such \noutcomes less likely.  \nAn inflation range with an adjustable medium -run inflation goal is one way to address \nsuch concerns, but there are a variety of alternative frameworks also worth considering .18  In my \nview, we are approaching a time when a comprehens ive reconsideration of the monetary policy \nframework is likely  warranted , given the experience o f the past 10 years.   Any change we make \nshould be designed to provide policymakers  with the flexibility to set monetary policy \nappropriately as key features of the economy change, as they have repeatedly over U.S. \neconomic history . \nThank you.  \n \n \n1 See https://www.interdependence.org/wp -content/uploads/2013/10/Heldring -\nObituary.pdfh ttps://www.interdependence.org/wp -content/uploads/2013/10/Heldring -Obituary.pdf . \n \n2 For additional discussion, see Jan. 8, 2018 remarks at the Brookings Institution by Eric S.

Or would we expect to adjust the medium -term \ninflation goal down when real rates are un usually high? And what status does the center of the range hold? Do we \nintend for inflation to average somewhere near the center of the range over a longer span of time ?, Do we always \nplan for inflation to return to the center of the range at some horizon?  \n \n7 In addition, FOMC participants  would no doubt consider adjusting our medium -term inflation goal up or down \nonly when we (and others) had estimated that a persistent  change in real rate determinants had occurred and was \nlikely to continue. Such an asses sment is of course difficult and entails uncertainty  \n \n8 Prior to the June 2015 medians, SEP medians are only available with a five -year lag.  Proxies for the medians for \nthe December 2013 and 2014 one -year-ahead forecasts for the fourth quarters of 2014 and 2015, for core PCE \ninflation and the unemployment rate used in the forecast error calculations for Figures 2 and 3 are calculated from \nthe d istribution of FOMC participants’ projections reported in ranges of tenths in the FOMC meeting minutes.   \n \n9 Of course, the actual values are revised over time.  We have used the most up -to-date figures in the calculations.   \n \n10 While total PCE is the target for this exercise, we used core PCE to avoid outsized errors that would be related to  \nthe often volatile food and energy prices . \n \n11 In order to provide more clarity about how the Federal Reserve implemented the dual mandate, the FOMC issued \nthe Statement on Longer -Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy, which is important for clarifying to the public \nwhat mone tary policy is about, and also for providing FOMC members with a common framework when conducting \npolicy.  FOMC members  will have different opinions about economic conditions and where the economy is headed. \nStill, according to the strategy document, the way these differences are translated into different policy \nrecommendations should be consistent across FOMC members, in that members agree to share the same inflation \ngoal and assign the same penalty to deviations of inflation and unemployment from their longer -run values.

Looking at the indi vidual observations from the SEP “ dot plot ” shows that the majority of \nthe central tendency expects a rate of 2.75 percent.  \n \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 4:15 P.M.

Others have proposed using price -level targeting or some variant of it, which is a way of \npromising future inflation when the economy is weak, thus (in theory) adding stimulus by lowering real interest \nrates. This policy also has the advantage of ma king the price level  – the cost of living  – more predictable. And some \nhave suggested following a nominal GDP  target . The virtue of this framework is that it is flexible with respect to the \nmix of overall nominal growth that comes from real growth versus inflation. When real growth is slow, inflation is \nallowed to rise higher, similar to the flexible target range approach I have outlined.",

Rosengren  \nPresident & Chief Executive Officer  \nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston  \n \nSpringfield Regional Chamber Outlook 2018  \n \nSpringfield, Mass achusetts   \nMarch 9 , 2018  \n \n \nIt is great to be back in Springfield, one of the winners of the Boston Fed’s  Working \nCities Challenge1 competition . Springfield’s  winning proposal  focuse s on providing better \nworkforce development opportunities for low er-income individuals to obtain meaningful \nemployment.  Achieving the goals that Springfield has set for itself is , of course , much easier in a \nrobust economy, and the economic outlook I will share today is  consistent with an economy that \nwill require even more workers in the labor force .   \n\n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 12:40 P.M.  Eastern  Time on Friday, March 9, 2018  OR UPON  DELIVERY  \n3 \n Before I begin my remarks , let me note as I always do that the views I express are my \nown, not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal Reserve Board of Governors or the \nFederal Open Market Committee (FOMC).    \nOver the past year, the unemploy ment rate has fallen and is now below even the lowest \nestimates made by Fed eral Reserve policymakers ( FOMC participants ) for the level that  is likely \nto be sustainable in the long er run.  As  labor markets  have tightened , we have seen a gradual \nincrease in  wages and salaries .  While inf lation2 is still a bit  below the FOMC’s  target, most \nforecasters expect  inflation to rise to, or near, the Fed’s  2 percent target by  the end of 2018.  \nDespite this  good news, the stock and bond markets have be come much more volatile  in \nrecent weeks . This likely reflects , in part , the realization that  financial markets need  to factor in \nthe risk  that wages and prices could grow too quickly , if there were  too much fiscal and \nmonetary stimulus  – particularly with the economy currently at or beyond full employment and \ninflation approaching the Fed’s goal .  I view the underlying insight as a healthy realization  by \nmarket participants  that the risks are two -sided : Unsustainably strong growth that leads to \nexcessive inflation or financial imbalances  is now as much a risk as growth that falls shor t.  And \nthere is a realization that monetary policy makers  need to be vigilant  in calibrating the level of \naccommodation , if continued sustainable growth is to be achieved . \nTo be more specific, a s inflation  approaches  the Federal Reserve’s  2 percent target and \nunemployment remain s below what we see as a sustainable rate, it is appropriate for the Fed to \ncontinue to remove monetary accommodation by gradually raising interest rates .  At the \nDecember FOMC  meeting , the median of  Fed policymakers ’ estimates of “ appropriate monetary \npolicy ” called for  75 basis points of additional rate increases over the course of 2018.  My own \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 12:40 P.M.  Eastern  Time on Friday, March 9, 2018  OR UPON  DELIVERY  \n4 \n view , at that time , was actually that somewhat further removal of accommodation might well be \nneeded  in 2018.  That assessment remained dependent on the tenor of incoming data, of course.  \nAnd s ince th e December FOMC meeting , we have all observed  a mix of news: fiscal \nspending, a large tax cut, and continued strengthening of economies around the world provide \nsupport to U.S. growth.  But, on average, household and business spending data have come in a \nbit weaker than expected, leading many to revise down their forecasts for the current quarter. \nEven so, most forecasters currently expect growth this year to exceed its sustainable pace, which \nimplies further tightening of labor markets and more wage and price pressures over time. Thus, \non balance, developments since December generally reinforce my view of the need for s omewhat \nmore removal of accommodation than was reflected in the December median S ummary of \nEconomic P rojections  (SEP) .  Of course, following through on this expectation is conditional on \nthe economy unfolding about  as expected, and that unexpected events such as a trade war or a \nsubstantial change in the geopolitical situation do not surprise on the downside.  \n \nRecent Developments in the E conomic O utlook  \n Improvements in the economy over the past year have , in large part , been driven by \nstrong consumer spending.  This is not unusual  for the U.S. economy , of course, since consumer \nspending accounts for roughly two- thirds of real GDP.  As Figure 1 highlights, consumption \ngrowth in the fourth quarter of 2017 was quite strong , at 3.8 percent.   \nHowever, as the figure also shows, f orecasts for the first quarter of 2018 are for much \nslower consumption growth.  Th is forecast, from the Blue Chip E conomic Indicators , preceded \nthe relative ly weak retail sales reported for January . If retail sales continue to disappoint, \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 12:40 P.M.  Eastern  Time on Friday, March 9, 2018  OR UPON  DELIVERY  \n5 \n consumption for the first quarter  of this year  may well be below that projected by forecasters in \nearly February .   \nWhat is the likelihood that we will continue to get weak readings on consumer spending? \nThat is difficult to say, but my view is that the data we have seen so far most likely reflect a \ntemporary pause in this quarter, following unexpectedly strong growth in the fourth quarter  of \n2017 – and as a consequence, we will probably continue to see solid consumption growth over \nthe balance of this year.    \n My optimism in this regard  is driven by  the relatively strong fundamentals that support \nconsumption growth.  Figure 2  shows that household wealth has been rising, and is well above \nthe level from the beginning of 2016.  This gain reflects continued increases  in housing wealth \ndue to rising house prices  in many areas of the country , as well as steady gains in the stock \nmarket.  While there have been some sizable  stock market declines in recent days, Figure 3  \nshows that  current  stock prices remain at roughly the levels they achieved in December  2017.  \n Outside of  stock  market  levels, there has been a notable increase in volatility.  One \nmeasure of stock volatility, the  Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) Volatility Index  \n(VIX), had been unusually low in 2017.  This very low market volatility  can lead  investors to \ntake on more risk, and in a period of still relatively low interest rates, to “reach for yield”  – that \nis, buy riskier assets than one would otherwise, in order to achieve a desired profit or savings \ngoal.  Clearly , as can be seen in Figure 4 , stock market volatility has increased significantly  in \nrecent weeks .  From a financial stability standpoint, I view the increased volatility as a n \nimportant reminder to market participants  that stock prices can be quite sensitive to economic \ndata.3 \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 12:40 P.M.  Eastern  Time on Friday, March 9, 2018  OR UPON  DELIVERY  \n6 \n  Figure 5  illustrates that despite an  increase in  market  volatility , consumers ’ confidence in \nthe strength of the economy  remains high, well above index levels for 2017.  W hile there has \nbeen some weakness in the higher -frequency consumer data, I view high consumer confidence  as \nconsistent with the fundamental underpinnings of consumer spending that I discussed a moment \nago, and suggestive that what we are seeing now will turn out to be a pause by consumers after a \nvery strong fourth quarter.  \n Figure 6  shows that the Blue Chip f orecast ers seem to share my optimism.   For much of \n2017, the forecasters had expected U.S. real GDP for 2018 to result in growth of 2.4 percent.  \nHowever, with the significant reduction in taxes and the increases in government spending, as \nwell as the continued improvement  in the national economies  of trading partners, the  consensus \nforecast  now anticipate s real GDP growth to be 2. 8 percent for the year.  Such a rapid increase is \nlikely to be primarily driven by the fiscal stimulus .  It remains to be seen, however, what signal \nBlue Chip forecasters may take from the more recently released weaker consumption data .  \n \nOutlook for Inflation  \n Some observers of Federal Reserve policy have been concer ned about the low inflation \nreadings for much of 2017.  I have viewed those soft data as likely to be transitory, reflecting \nsharp temporary changes in relative prices  – such as modifications  in wireless service pricing by \nU.S. mobile  carrier s last s pring .  Recent data have given me more confidence in that assessment . \n Figure 7  shows the Blue Chip consensus forecast for inflation as measured by the \nConsumer Price Index ( CPI) for 2018.  The Blue Chip survey focuses on the CPI, which tends to \nrun approximatel y 20 to 30 basis  point s higher than the Federal Reserve’s preferred inflation \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 12:40 P.M.  Eastern  Time on Friday, March 9, 2018  OR UPON  DELIVERY  \n7 \n index, the  personal consumption expenditures  (PCE) index.  The f igure shows that in the first \nquarter of 2017, forecasters expected that 2018 CPI would be running at 2.3 percent, consistent \nwith the Fed’s 2 percent inflation target using the PCE measure of inflation.  However, in the \nspring  of 2017, with some  large relative price changes, forecasters  began to  lower their \nexpectation s for 2018 inflation – reaching estimates as low as 1.9 percent  by late summer .  More \nrecently , their forecasts for 2018 CPI inflation are back where they were in early 2017.  \n Figure 8  illustrates how the data have changed more recently , by averaging the PCE \ninflation data over one year, over six months , and over three months.  The year-over-year change \nin the PCE index remains somewhat  below the Federal Reserve’s 2 percent  target , as some of the \nsoft data from last s pring have lowered this 12- month change .  However , more recent readings \nthat exclude those s pring observations (that is, the six month data and the three month changes) \nshow a rate of inflation above our 2 percent target.   \nOne final factor that may have temporarily elevated the index is oil prices.  Figure 9  \nprovides a similar chart for the inflation measure that excludes the volatile food and energy \nprices , the so- called core  PCE inflation rate.   More recent readings for core inflation suggest that \nwe have been right at our 2 percent target for the past three and six months. \n \nLabor Market D evelopments  \n Another factor  that gives me some confidence that  the Fed will continue to hit the  \ninflation target is the strength of the labor market.  Figure 10  shows that the number of \nindividuals filing initial claims for unemployment insurance is  at low levels not seen since the \nlate 1960s  and early 1970s , when the labor force was considerably sm aller than it is today .  This \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 12:40 P.M.  Eastern  Time on Friday, March 9, 2018  OR UPON  DELIVERY  \n8 \n likely reflects a number of positive factors, including: strong demand for workers that derives \nfrom a strong pace of sales for goods and services; employer s’ reluctance to lose employees , \ngiven the difficulty they would face in hiring  replacement workers; and  the fact  that potential \nemployees who lose or switch jobs are able to find new employment  without suffering a spell of \nunemployment.  \n Another way to assess labor market tightness is to look at labor flows  – in other words, \nhow workers move between being employed, unemployed (not working , but looking for work), \nand out of the labor force (neither  employed , nor looking for work).4  Figure 11  shows the flow \nfrom being employed to unemployed.  Official data for gross worker flows begin in the early \n1990s, and consistent with the data on initial claims, the employment- to-unemployment flow is \nnear a recent low.    \nFigure 12  shows the flow from being out of the labor force to being unemployed.  Thi s is \nnear the early 2001 series low , reflecting that when workers decide to enter or reenter the \nworkforce, they find employment opportunities quickly.  \n Figure 13  shows the flow from being out of the workforce into employment.  This series  \nis at a recent high, reflecting that in a tight labor  market more potential workers are being drawn \ninto the workforce .  While this is a particularly good sign for hard- to-employ workers, it also \nhighlights a potential future problem : the supply of  workers outside of the labor force and willing \nto reenter the labor market will be come a constraint over time.5   \n As we experience the welcome development of more workers enter ing employment from \noutside of the work force, there will be a n increasing need for training and other aspects of \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 12:40 P.M.  Eastern  Time on Friday, March 9, 2018  OR UPON  DELIVERY  \n9 \n workforce development.  As I mentioned at the outset of the talk, that is one of the areas that the  \nSpringfield team has chosen to focus on for their Working C ities Challenge  initiative .6  \nOf course, with labor markets tight, some employers will attempt to attract new \nemployees by offering higher wages and benefits, raising the average compensation paid to many \nemployees over time.  Figure 14  shows the employment cost index measure of wages and \nsalaries for private industry workers, excluding incentive -paid occupations .  This wage measure, \nalong with a number of others , has been gradually trending up ward  over the past several years .  \nAs the labor market continues to tighten  – which would be consistent wit h the  2.8 percent Blue \nChip forecast  for 2018 real GDP growth – one would expect to see continued upward pressure on \nwages and salaries.  \n \nConclu ding Observations  \n In summary and conclusion, I would say that t he economic data have been quite good, \nmonetary policy remains accommodative , and fiscal policy has just become quite a bit more  \nstimulative.  While a  tight labor market provide s definite advantages  – such as  employment \nopportunities for workers  who have struggled to find a job – nonetheless, providing too much  \nstimulus from either  monetary or fiscal policy  at this stage of the economic cycle could threaten \nto create a so -called “ boom and bust ” economy , which policymakers  certainly want to avoid.   \nTo keep the economy on a sustainable path, I expect that it will be appropriate to remove \nmonetary policy accommodation at a regular but gradual  pace – and perhaps a  bit faster than the \nthree, one -quarter point increases envisioned for this year in the assessment of appropriate policy \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 12:40 P.M.  Eastern  Time on Friday, March 9, 2018  OR UPON  DELIVERY  \n10 \n from  the De cember  2017  FOMC meeting . This expectation assum es, of course, the data continue \nto come in more -or-less consistent with my  outlook.  \nThank you.   \n  \n \n \n                                                           \n1 The Working Cities Challenge is  an initiative of the  Federal Reserve Bank of Boston , designed to lead smaller \ncities through a rigorous process that builds cross -sector collaboration to solve issues impacting the lives of these \ncities’ lower -income residents. Grounded in Boston Fed research, the Challenge encourages leaders from the publi c, \nprivate, and nonprofit sectors to advance proposals that tackle complex challenges facing smaller post -industrial \ncities and achieve large scale impact across communities. Included in the initiative  is a grant competition designed \nto accelerate promisin g work already underway.  For more information, see:  \nhttps://www.bostonfed.org/workingcities .  \n \n2 The Federal Reserve measure s inflation  by the annual change in the price index for personal consumption \nexpenditures, or PCE.  \n \n3 In some ways, increased volatility may help to enhance financial stability if it moves market participant s to more \nappropriately assess the risks in their investment s. \n \n4 The stock of unemployed workers, as well as the net job creation in any month, are the net result of a huge number \nof such flows among employment, unemployment, and those not in the labor force.  \n \n5 Because many of those not in the labor force are pursuing education, retired, disabled, or attending to family care, \nthere is a limit to the number of workers not currently in the labor force who can plausibly meet the demand for new \nworkers. At some poin t, the available supply of workers will become a constraint on our ability to grow, although I \ndo not believe that we are there just yet.  \n \n6 For more information on the Springfield Working Cities Challenge effort, see:  \nhttps://www.bostonfed.org/workingcities/massachusetts/round2/cities/springfield .

I would like to thank the conference organizers for inviting me to speak \nat this , the tenth conference of the International Research Forum on Monetary Policy .  I would \nlike to commend all of today’s presenters for their research contributions, and I am looking \nforward to Saturday’s sessions .   \nBefore I begin my remarks, let me note as I always do that the views I express are my \nown, not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal Reserve ’s Board of Governors or the \nFederal Open Market Committee (FOMC).   \n\n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 7:00 P.M.  Eastern  Time on Friday, March 23, 2018  OR UPON  DELIVERY  \n \n3 \n I particularly appreciate  the chance to focus today on monetary policy and financial \nstability.  Much of my own research has focused on the ways that problems in the financial \nsystem can ripple through to the real economy.  Certainly the last financial crisis  – and the \nensuing Great Recession and very slow recovery  – underlined the role that  financial instability  \ncan play in disrupting the economy and in slowing its recovery.  These episodes  also helped \npolicymakers sharpen their thinking about the need for policy tools  that can be deployed to \nattempt to prevent  financial instability,  as well as  minimize  the effects of instability when it doe s \nemerge .  \nFinancial stability policy  is generally associated with regulatory and supervisory \nmeasures , so the exercise  of financial stability  policy is often seen as being independent from the \nstance of monetary and fiscal policy.  However , I am going to suggest that policymakers  should \nview  financial stability tools more holistically .  Indeed, I would like to  suggest  that the ability to \nappropriate ly set financial stability tools  is integrally related to the ability to fully utilize fiscal , \nmonetary , and financial stability  policy tools  to respond to a large adverse financial shock . \n Figure 1  provides a chart that shows how often from 1987 to 2008  the FOMC \nparticipants used words associated with financial stability concerns .  The analysis  of FOMC \nmeeting transcripts  is taken  from a paper I wrote with Federal Reserve Bank of Boston \neconomists  Geoff Tootell and Joe Peek .1  While there are mentions of financial instability terms \nduring the time s when markets are doing unusually well, the largest  spikes in the series are \nassociated with the occur rences of adverse  financial shocks  – particularly when they are \naccompanied by an economic downturn.   \nTools intended to enhance the resilience of the financial system, such as increased capital \nand liquidity requirements, are important  – and in my view , should be emphasized more  \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 7:00 P.M.  Eastern  Time on Friday, March 23, 2018  OR UPON  DELIVERY  \n \n4 \n throughout an economic cycle .  But  the analysis we did suggests that the focus  on financial \nstability  concerns is most intense when the adverse consequences are apparent.    \nCrisis prevention is an important matter for further discussion, and one on which I \nbelieve we  have made progress through implementing key aspects of the Dodd -Frank Wall Street \nReform and Consumer Protection Act  – but prevention is  not really the  focus  of my remarks this \nevening .  Tonight , I would like to focus  on the tools that are available  to policymakers  once a \nsignificant adverse financial shock occurs  (that is, crisis response ).  \n If an adverse financial shock occurs, fiscal, monetary, and financial tools can all play a \nrole in offsetting the economic fallout that often results  – even though maintaining financial \nstability is not the primary goal of monetary or fiscal policy .  But if monetary and fiscal policy  \nhave limited capacity to respond to such shocks  – because public debt is already high, or because \ninterest rates are alread y low, for example  – then this should figure into policymakers’ thinking \nabout how and when to use financial stabili ty tool s.   \nTo be a bit more specific, I have in mind using a broad set of tools to respond to any large \nadverse financial shock that could have a broad impact on the economy .  On the fiscal side, \nwhich of course the Fed does not control, that would likely include cutting taxes  and increas ing \ngovernment spending .  Monetary policy tools would include conventional  tactics  (reducing \ninterest rates ) and less conventional  ones (like expanding the central bank ’s balance sheet  \nthrough asset purchases ).  Finally, I would note how important it is that financial stability tools  \nprovide sufficient buffers.    \nThe use of financial stability tools is generally seen as being co nditioned on and \ncalibrated to the severity of likely  economic stress es – but I would argue that it is also critically \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 7:00 P.M.  Eastern  Time on Friday, March 23, 2018  OR UPON  DELIVERY  \n \n5 \n important to take into account the extent to which monetary and fiscal policy are equipped to \nrespond to an adv erse financial shock, so that policymakers  can best coordinate the response to a \ncrisis across all available tools.   Much of what I have in mind has to do with assessing each \npolicy tool’s capacity to respond . \n For example, suppose that a country’s government -debt-to-GDP ratio is high , limit ing the \nability or willingness to use fiscal tools  to offset financial and other shocks.  If that country has  \nalso not develop ed sufficient  financial stability response tools, then most  of the  countercyclical \npolicy  response  will likely fall to monetary policy.  Alternatively, if the government -debt-to-\nGDP  ratio is extremely high and interest rates are already at or near the effective lower bound , \nand the country is unable or unwilling to use less-conventional monetary tools  like quantitative \neasing , then financial stability tools are likely to be more important .  In sum , it is important to \nconsider whether there is sufficient capacity  in the toolkit for policymaker s to adequately (let \nalone optimally ) respond to severe financial shocks.  \n Turning to current conditions in t he U nited States , our economy is now experienci ng a \nvery low  unemployment rate  – in fact, a rate below the level many would associate with  full \nemployment .  In part due to relatively tight labor markets, we are beginning to see modest \nincreases in  wage  and price  inflation , and  a more rapid increase in  asset prices .  Most economists \nexpect continued solid growth and strong labor markets, so this may be the tim e to focus on \nwhether we have adequate buffers among the available  policy tools  – to be prepared, should \nanything disrupt the r ecent trajectory .   \nUnfortunately, I would argue that rather than building sufficient capacity  for possible \ndownturns  – which, by  the way, I am not expecting or predicting  – the U.S. has actually  seen a \nreduction in the capacity of these so-called “ buffers ” across the policy tools .  If fiscal and \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 7:00 P.M.  Eastern  Time on Friday, March 23, 2018  OR UPON  DELIVERY  \n \n6 \n monetary policy tools are likely to be limited in the event  of a large advers e shock, I would \nsuggest that policymakers  need to think about  and act on  creating greater capacity and flexibility \nwithin the tools currently available  – including those most directly related to financial stability . \n  \nMonetary Policy Response to Large Advers e Financial Shocks  \n Figure 2  shows the federal funds rate, cover ing the same period – 1987 to 2008 – as the \nearlier chart depicting  mentions of financial instability terms by FOMC  participants , and \nindicating the same episodes of financial disruption .2  One can see that w hen a significant \nfinancial stability shock occurs , the Fe d usually lowers the fund s rate out of concern that the \nshock might precipitate slow growth or a recession .  During the 2008 financial crisis, the federal \nfunds rate was  reduced  to zero and the  central bank’s  balance sheet was expanded.   In prior \nepisodes, the funds rate was high enough that the Fed had plenty of room to reduce it  – that is, \nplenty of cushion.  When  the monetary policy cushion is substantial, the need for very large \nfiscal or financial stability buffers may be co rrespondingly  reduced .   \n Simple math suggests that the ability of conventional monetary policy to respon d to a \ncrisis is currently somewhat constrained , given low prevailing rates.  Figure 3  shows FOMC \nparticipants ’ forecasts  of the federal funds rate likely to prevail in the long er run from the \nSummary of Economic Projections (SEP) .  As real interest rates have been depressed by slow \nproductivity and by demographic changes, FOMC participant s’ estimates of the federal funds \nrate in the long er run have declined ; the median is currently 2. 9 percent.  \n Such a low “neutral” or long -run federal funds rate  suggests a monetary policy cushion \n(again, the leeway to lower the funds rate) that is small by  historical standards.  As is shown in \nFigure 4 , in most recessions the Fed lowers the nominal federal funds rate by much more than 3 \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 7:00 P.M.  Eastern  Time on Friday, March 23, 2018  OR UPON  DELIVERY  \n \n7 \n percent age points .  So in an economy like ours with low equilibrium interest rates, there is a \nstrong likelihood that in a hypothetical future recession , policymakers will run out of room to \nlower the federal funds rate, and we will hit the effective lower bound .   \nWhile my own view is  that unconventional policy can be a very important tool to provide \nstimulus  once the effective lower bound  is reached , it is fair to acknowledge that policymakers \nknow far less about the effectiveness of unconventional monetary policy than th ey do about \nconventional, short -term interest rate policy.  Perhaps even more constrai ning is the political \nunpopularity in many countries of  central bank balance sheet actions .  All this means that such \npolicies could be avoided by policymakers , or even constrained by lawmakers,  in the  future .3 \n As I suggested earlier, i f the monetary policy cushion available to offset  financial shocks \nis smaller, policymakers should consider how the  full array of policy tools might be used to \naddress such shocks.  Sticking with monetary policy for a moment, one approach could be to \nchange the monetary policy operating procedures to make it less likely that the effective lower \nbound is hit in the futu re, perhaps by using an inflation range with an adjustable inflation target , \nas I have discussed in a recent talk .4  If this  monetary policy approach  is not feasible, \npolicymakers may wish to consider whether Countercyclical Capital Buffers  should be incre ased, \nor other financial stability tools employed , to provide greater buffers to adverse shocks.  \n  \nFiscal Policy Response to Large Adverse Financial Shocks  \n Figure 5  shows the U.S. federal government surplus or deficit , measured as a percentage \nof GDP .  Fiscal policy has tended not to respond to financial stability shocks unless they are \naccompanied by a recession.  Fiscal policy response s include  “automatic stabiliz ers,” such as \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 7:00 P.M.  Eastern  Time on Friday, March 23, 2018  OR UPON  DELIVERY  \n \n8 \n unemployment benefits, which  rise automatically as newly -unemployed workers file for benefits \nduring significant economic downturns.   While fiscal policy tools normally are not deployed for \nfinancial stability shocks, we can surmise that , were an accompanying recession  to be  large \nenough, a possible  inability or unwillingness of fiscal policy makers  to offset financial stability \nshocks  with expansionary policy  could  exacerbate  the problem.  \n Furthermore, we should recognize that  fiscal limitations can impact the choices that \npolicymakers have to utilize potential financial stability tools.  In response to the financial crisis, \nthe U.S. was much more willing than Europe or Japan to provide direct capital infusions into the \nfinancial system, which arguably limit ed the severity of credit crunches and promoted a quicker \nrecovery in the financial sector in the U.S., relative to Europe.   \n There was sufficient fiscal capacity during the financial crisis to expand the deficit and \nengage in fiscal actions that promoted  a faster recovery, but naturally such actions require a \nfiscal buffer that makes it possible to finance the effort .  Figure 6  shows the general government \ngross debt as a percentage of GDP for the U.S. and several European countries.  The U.S. fiscal \nresponse to the financial crisis placed the government -debt-to-GDP ratio much closer to that of \nEuropean countries .  What’s more , the Congressional Budget Office’s current projections , done \nbefore  the recent tax changes  and increases in the federal budget,  indicate that were a financial \ncrisis to occur in the near-term, the U.S.  would potentially have less fiscal capacity to respond as \naggressively as it did  during the last financial crisis.  \nThe U .S. fiscal situation is noteworthy because of the experience of some European \ncountries during the last recession.  In particular, those European countries with  severe banking \nproblems were most ly southern European countries,  and they experienced  serious fiscal \nproblems in addition to  serious banking problems.   Those  countries in Europe with less severe \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 7:00 P.M.  Eastern  Time on Friday, March 23, 2018  OR UPON  DELIVERY  \n \n9 \n banking problems  but substantial fiscal capacity did not want to use their fiscal capacity to \nresolve banking problems in other European countries .  As a result, the banking problems could \nnot be easily resolved with capital infusions from governments, resulting in banking problems \ndragging out and many European banks tightening credit availability in the middle of an \neconomic downturn , in order to improve their capital -to-asset s ratios.  Thus the fiscal capacity \nproblems caused difficulties in resolving financial stability problems, making both worse.  \n In sum, r unning large fiscal deficits can potentially have ramifications for the ability to \nrespon d to possible future financial stability shocks.   If fiscal policy responses to financial \nstability crises are likely to be more constrained  in the presence of larger government -debt-to-\nGDP ratios , it seems prudent  to consider bolstering the tools available to monetary policy and \nfinancial stability policy . \n  \nFinancial Stability Response to Large Adverse  Financial Shocks  \n In many countries, a variety of financial stability tools are available,5 but this is not the \ncase in the United States.  The two primary financial stability tools available to the Federal \nReserve  to respond to financial shocks are, first,  altering the s cenarios used in  the bank stress \ntests that are applied to the largest banks , and second, the setting of the Countercyclical Capital \nBuffer.    \nThe stress test  is primarily a micro prudential  tool, designed to ensure sufficient capital for \nbanks  in the event of a large financial shock , and is dependent on the risk characteristics of the \nindividual institution .6  By “stressing ” particular assets, the test  alters the cost of capital for that \nasset class, with the overall impact on any financial institution depending on its exposure to the \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 7:00 P.M.  Eastern  Time on Friday, March 23, 2018  OR UPON  DELIVERY  \n \n10 \n asset class and its sensitivity to changes in cost of capital.  Thus, the stress  test does not alter  the \namount of post -stress  capital relative to the bank’s reported capital for all firms in the same way.  \nFirms’ post-stress capital may decrease (or increase) relative to reported  capital by varying \nmagnitudes , depending on the mix of assets and hence the mix of risks.   \n The Countercyclical Capital Buffer , on the other hand,  is intended to be a \nmacroprudential tool.   The buffer  increases  capital for all financial firms it applies to during \nperiods of financial excess , but is intended to release capital during stressful periods .7  Because it \nis not related to particular stress scenarios, it does not alter the cost of capital for specific assets \nand does not impact institutions differentially depending on exposure to specific assets.8  \nMoreover , it is intended to be lowered during stressful times in order to release capital for \nstronger banks , so that binding capital constraints are not addressed by reducing credit \navailability  to firms and households . \n Figure 7  provides the peak unemployment rate included in the severely adverse scenario \nsince the stress tests began in the U.S. in 2009, the current level of the unemployment rate at the \ntime of the development of each scenario, and the difference between th e two.   The stress test \nhas quite high unemployment rates  in its scenarios , even during periods whe n the actual \nunemployment rate is already high.  As the actual unemployment rate has fallen, the change from \nthe current rate to the scenario peak has increased.  As a result,  the stress test as currently utilized  \nmay not effectively release capital in a crisis.   It is certainly possible that the stress tests could \nencourage  banks to reduce credit availability to shrink assets to satisfy binding capital \nconstraints .  As always , we have to examine the possibility of unintended consequences and \nassess whether it may work at cross purposes to other tools designed to speed the recovery from \na negative financial shock .  While t his reflects its focus on ensuring the solven cy of individual  \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 7:00 P.M.  Eastern  Time on Friday, March 23, 2018  OR UPON  DELIVERY  \n \n11 \n institutions relative to particular stress scenarios , it highlights why other tools may be better \ndesigned to release capital to avoid reductions in credit availability.  \n In contrast, a  financial stability tool that is designed to be countercyclical is the aptly \nnamed Countercyclical Capital Buffer.  Once an adverse  financial stability shock occurs, the \nbuffer would be  reduced, releasing bank capital so the institution  does not need to s hrink its \nlending  – and thus reduce credit availability  to firms and consumers  – by shrinking assets to \nsatisfy a binding  capital constraint.   \n Of course, the Countercyclical Capital Buffer has to be raised in times  of financial excess  \nif it is to  build capital that can  be used when adverse shocks do occur.  Figure 8  shows that many \ncountries have indeed raised their Countercyclical Capital Buffer.  In the U.S., the \nCountercyclical Capital Buffer remains  at zero.9 \n Even if one were to ignor e the opportunity to strengthen financial stability tools, in my \nview an argument can be made  for increasing  the Countercyclical Capital Buffer.  Figure 9  \nshows that commercial real estate valuations are quite stretched , as indicated by capitalization \nrates reach ing series lows, particularly for apartment buildings  (recall that the “cap” rate is the \nratio of net operating income to the price paid  for the property  at the time of a transaction  – a \nshorthand for the income yield that the property is expected to provide ).  While low cap rates are \nto be expected in a low -interest rate environment,  Figure 10  shows that the ratio has been \nimportantly driven by price increases, particularly for apartment buildings.  \nTurning to equities, Figure 11  shows that by histori cal standards current S&P 500 \ncomposite price -to-earnings  ratios are at the high end of what we have observed  since 1968 .  \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 7:00 P.M.  Eastern  Time on Friday, March 23, 2018  OR UPON  DELIVERY  \n \n12 \n This is even clearer if we use the Shiller cyclically -adjusted  price -to-earnings  ratio shown in \nFigure 12 . \n With asset valuations high, a non -zero Countercyclical Capital Buffer can in my view  be \njustified.  However, the case is even stronger  in the U.S. if one considers that should a shock \noccur, monetary policy and fiscal policy may not be e xpected  to respond as forcefully as t hey did \n– appropriately so, I would add  – in the last financial crisis  and its aftermath .   \n     \nConclu ding Observat ions \n In summary and conclusion, I would argue that n ow is the time to  assess and strengthen  \nthe various policy tools available to respond to adverse financial shocks  – and y et, the tools have \nactually  been diminishi ng.  The Federal Reserve’s  monetary policy buffer has essentially been \ndepleted as the nominal equilibrium interest rate in the United States has fallen.  This makes it \nmore likely that the effective lower bound will be hit in the U .S. if we experience  an adverse  \nfinancial stability shock  (or any other adverse shock) at some point in the future .  Since monetary \npolicy can do little  to prevent the demographic or productivity changes  that lead to lower \nprevailing rates , I believe that  policymakers should consider adjust ing the monetary policy \nframework , to address the possibility  that the capacity of conventional policy tools may be too \nquickly deplet ed.10 \n Fiscal policy buffers are being bolstered  in some European countries as the ir econom ies \nimprov e.  However, we must acknowledge that the same can not be said for the United States.  \nThe government -debt-to-GDP ratio is high by historical standards in many countries , but we see \nthat it is rising  in the U .S.  My view is that U.S. fiscal policy we have seen since the crisis  \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 7:00 P.M.  Eastern  Time on Friday, March 23, 2018  OR UPON  DELIVERY  \n \n13 \n emerged in 2008 will simply  give future policymakers less flexibility to respond to a \nhypothetical large fina ncial stability shock  with fiscal policy tools . \n Some countries have been using macroprudential tools to increase their policy buffers.  \nWhile capital ratios in the U .S. are much improved, the Countercyclical Capital Buffer , which \nwas designed to be releas ed in response to a large adverse financial shock , is currently set at \nzero.  \n Many countries are not well equipped  to address a n adverse financial stability shock.  In \nthe United States, one can see that monetary, fiscal, and macroprudential buffers are modest , and \nin many cases are being drawn down  further .  In my view, n ow should be the time that \npolicymakers  carefully consider this state of affairs, and assess which tools could  provide more \npotent buffer s to draw upon  should  a large adverse financial shock occur.   While that is, again, \nnot my expectation or prediction, my view is that it is an opportune time  to prepare for such a \npossibility.   \nThank you.  \n \n \n1 Peek, Rosengren, and Tootell.

Rosengren  \nPresident & Chief Executive Officer  \nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston  \n \nGreater Boston Chamber of Commerce  \nEconomic Outlook Breakfast 2018  \n \nBoston, Massachusetts   \nApril 13 , 2018  \n \n \n Good morning. It’s a pleasure to be back with the Greater Boston Chamber of Commerce \nto share my  economic outlook .   \nBefore  I begin my remarks, let me note as I always do that the views I express are my \nown, not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal Reserve Board of Governors or the \nFederal Open Market Committee (FOMC  or Committee ).   \nLast Friday the Bureau of Labor Statistics released  the monthly employment report .   \nWhile only 103 ,000 new jobs were created in March, the first quarter as a whole held quite \nstrong  job growth.  O ver the first three months of 2018, the U .S. economy added an average of \n\n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 8:10 A.M. Eastern  Time on Friday, April 13, 2018  OR UPO N DELIVERY  \n3 \n 202,000 jobs  per month  – which , over the long er run, is roughly  twice as many as would be \nrequired  to keep the unemployment rate  stable  at current levels  of employment , given the growth \nin the labor force .   \nThis strong first -quarter job growth occurr ed even though the l abor market  is already \ntight, as indicated by an unemployment rate at  4.1 percent , a rate that most economists consider \nto be below the sustainable rate of unemployment .  Consistent w ith tight labor markets , wages \nhave been  rising , albeit gradually  – average hourly earnings rose 2.7 percent over the past year , \nabout three -quarters of a percentage point faster growth than in 2013 and 2014 .   \nThe tight national labor market is also reflected in New England .  When I talk to \nemployers ar ound the Federal Reserve’s First D istrict , which includes the six New England \nstates,  I increasingly hear of the difficulty in attracting employees – and more and more business \nleaders mention  the additional tactics  their organizations  must  use to attract the talent necessary \nto move their  businesses forward.  \n The relative  strength of the first-quarter  employment growth  is consistent with the strong \neconomic forecast provided by monetary policymakers after the Federal Reserve’s FOMC  \nmeeting  in March.  The median forecast of Fed policymakers  was for the economy to grow \nsomewhat  faster in 2018 than earlier in the recovery – specifically,  2.7 percent  in 2018  (versus \n2.2 percent on average since the recovery began in the second quarter of 2009) .1   \nWith t his growth projected to be fairly strong , the unemployment rate  is expected to fall \nbelow 4 percent , with inflation rising close to  the Federal Reserve’s  2 percent target by the end \nof 2018 .  These forecasts, it should be noted,  also incorporate the assumption  of two additional \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 8:10 A.M. Eastern  Time on Friday, April 13, 2018  OR UPO N DELIVERY  \n4 \n 25-basis -point rate increases in the short -term interest rate during the balance of  2018, beyond \nthe one that occurred at the FOMC’s  March meeting.    \nMy own view s are that labor markets may tighten more  than the median SEP forecast  \nsuggests , and that inflation is likely to increase a bit more than the current median forecast by  \nFOMC  participant s.  Therefore,  I expect somewhat more tightening may end up being needed \nthan is currently reflected in the  projected  median  for the  federal funds  rate. \n Of cours e, I am talking here about  forecast s, not outcome s.  Economic forecasts  often \nprove imperfect , with actual results varying from the forecast in part because economists need to \nmake assumptions about variables that are quite hard to predict.  Simply put, m any important \neconomic decisions are not straightforward .  For example, what will happen with tariffs  around \nthe world  over the course of this  year?  Will the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting \nCountries  (OPEC ) significantly alter its pr oduction of oil ?  And how will foreign e conomies ’ \nmonetary policy change?  Many of these question s require the forecasting of political outcomes \nrather than underlying economic relationships  – and this is not an area of comparative advantage  \nfor economists . \n Given this reality , I will spend more time this morning  discussing the risks  around \nforecast s than I will the forecast s themselves .  In particular, I will highlight two important  risks \nto the economy in the short  run (trade and overheating) and two potential  risks in the long  run \n(reduced capacity of both fiscal and monetary policy to act against downturns) .   \nLet me be cle ar that  I am identif ying risks , not making a prediction that they will happen .  \nI think it is important to identify  risks worth thinking about and watching for, and underline why \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 8:10 A.M. Eastern  Time on Friday, April 13, 2018  OR UPO N DELIVERY  \n5 \n policymakers  need to continuously monitor incoming economic data and make adjustments \nshould the data come in other than expected.  \n \nExploring the Forecasts from the S ummary of Economic Projections (SEP)  \nFigure 1  provides the actual inflation rate for the  core personal consumption \nexpenditures or PCE (the solid line) , and the median PCE inflation  forecast  from FOMC \nparticipants at the March meeting  (the dashed line) .  As is clear from the chart, we have been \nundershooting the Federal Reserve’s  2 percent inflation target .  This undershoot ing has been \nlargely due to the decline in the relative price of imports from 2014 to 2016 , and the decline in \ntelecommunications prices in early 2017.  But that shortfall is forecasted to end soon – and it is \nnotable that Committee members expect an overshoo t of the Fed’s  inflation target in the medium \nterm.  \n Figure 2 shows that the unemployment  rate has been declining relatively quickly  since \nthe first quarter of 2015 , and that Committee members expect the path to level off in the medium \nterm at well below 4 percent.  Notably, t he median expectation  for the longer -run rate of \nunemployment – usually taken to be policymakers’ estimate of the sustainable rate – is 4.5 \npercent  in the March SEP (the horizontal  line).  Clearly , policymakers expect very tight labor \nmarkets in the short and medium term relative to what we expect to prevail in the long er term. \n Figure 3 shows the actual path of the federal funds rate from the first quarter of 2015 to \nthe first quarter of 201 8, and the median of SEP projections of the federal funds rate ’s path \nthrough the fourth quarter of 2020 .  The median forecast is for three  25-basis -point increases in \n2018  (including the increase which followed the March FOMC meeting ) and another three  in \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 8:10 A.M. Eastern  Time on Friday, April 13, 2018  OR UPO N DELIVERY  \n6 \n 2019 .  So again , it is worth noting that  the gradual rise of inflation toward – and then above – its \ntarget, and the projection for a falling unemployment rate that dips well  below  its estimated  long-\nrun sustainable level , occur despite the gradual tightening of monetary policy assumed in FOMC \nparticipants ’ forecasts .  Importantly, some of the underlying economic strength in these forecast s \ncomes from the projected effects of substantial fiscal stimulus , generated both by tax cuts and by \nthe higher government spending incorporat ed in the recent federal  budget.  \n In summary , the Committee ’s median outlook is fairly optimistic .  My own forecast calls \nfor an even more pronounced decline in the unemployment rate , given my expectation that \ncyclical  strength in labor force participation will provide only a partial offset to solid gains in \npayrolls.   Despite this positive outlook, I think it is important to consider the risks around this \nforecast.  So now  I will touch on what I see as some short -run risks, and then some longer -run \nrisks.  \n \nShort -run Risks  \n The first risk I want to discuss  today  is one that has been on the front pages of \nnewspapers and has also been reflected in  the increased volatil ity of  financial markets recently : \nthe outlook for international trade.   Figure 4 shows exports of goods and services relative to \nGDP  from the first quarter of 2015 through the fourth quarter of 2017 .  While the United States  \nis less dependent on exports for growth than are many of our major trading partners, exports are  \nstill a relatively large component of total goods and services pro duced in the U.S.  economy.  At \nroughly 12 percent of total goods and services, exports play a  much smaller role in the overall \neconomy than consumption, which is roughly two-thirds of the U.S. economy .  But exports play  \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 8:10 A.M. Eastern  Time on Friday, April 13, 2018  OR UPO N DELIVERY  \n7 \n a larger role than , for example , housing , which accounts for  roughly 4 percent of the overall \neconomy.  Of course , here  I am taking a macroeconomic view o f the economy ; I recognize that \nsome industries and firms will feel more acutely any changes in the export and trade \nenvironment.  \nSome context is important.  It would take a significantly broader set of trade actions than  \nthose reported to date to materially reduce the roughly $2.4 trillion in annual U.S. exports .  Still, \nspillover  effects are possible,  beyond just the industries wh ere exports could be  affected by \npossible trade barriers.  There could  also be indirect economic effects from trade disputes  with \nimportant , but difficult to measure , impact s.  For example, concerns about possible supply \ndisruptions might  cause firms to source supplies from other countries  – and the  new capacity in \nthese other countries  could  potentially  mean less U.S.  investment and employment.    \n A second possible impact is on prices.  As Figure 5 shows, prices of imported goods  \ngrew at a slower pace than overall inflation, thus  holding down overall inflation over the last \nseveral years.  Indeed, imported goods prices fell until about the beginning of 2017, in part \nbecause of a strong dollar , although that trend appears  to be changing more recently .  Of course \nthe imposition of  tariffs also pushes up prices that consumers  pay for goods impa cted by the \ntariff.  In addition, actions to avoid possible tariffs can cause precautionary stockpiling , which \ncan disrupt the flow of order s and cause production bottlenecks.  Concerns about these possible \ndisruptions likely explain some of the  heightened  volatility in stock price s of late .  \n Beyond trade issues, t here is a second short -run risk  to the outlook, and it  moves in the \nopposite direction.  While I expect the unemployment rate to drop to 3.7 percent by the end of \nthis year, it is possible that unemployment will fall even more rapidly in the short -term.  An \nundesirable  “boom -bust” scenario may be come  more likely if unemployment move s far below \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 8:10 A.M. Eastern  Time on Friday, April 13, 2018  OR UPO N DELIVERY  \n8 \n where we expect labor markets to settle in the long -run.  Figure  6 shows the difference between \nthe actu al unemployment rate and the C ongressional Budget Office’s (CBO)  estimate of the \nnatural rate of unemployment  from 1970 to the first quarter of 2018, with recessions shaded .  \nToday, u nemployment  is already below the CBO estimate of the natural rate .  As the graph \nshows, periods in which unemployment dipped significantly and persistently below the estimated \nnatural rate historically have tended to generate conditions that resulted in a recession.  \n While labor markets provide important indicator s of potenti al unsustainab ility, it is \nimportant to be alert to  financial  stability issues as well. As Figure 7 shows, the spreads between \ncorporate bonds and 10-Year U.S. Treasuries have fallen to relatively low levels, and several \nacademic studies have highlighted that the investor confidence that generates low credit spreads \noften precedes  subsequent economic reversals .2 \n Let me reiterate that  I am not forecasting signifi cant trade disruptions or substantial \nboom -bust problems .  But the risk that they could develop means  we must be v ery c arefully  \nmonitor ing incoming data  to see if they  indicate an increased probability that these risk scenarios \ncould occur .  \n \nLong -run Risks  \n There are also longer -run risks that should be considered at this juncture in the economy .  \nWith monetary policy still relatively accommodative , and fiscal policy quite accommodative, it \nseem s unlikely that the economy would perform poorly in the near term.  However , it is \nimportant to consider whether some of that accommodation may potentially  generate risks  that \nplay out over the longer term . \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 8:10 A.M. Eastern  Time on Friday, April 13, 2018  OR UPO N DELIVERY  \n9 \n  One of the risks is illustrated by the CBO projection  of public debt levels  that was \nrecently released .  Gross federal debt as a percentage of GDP, shown in Figure 8, has been rising \nover the past decade.  The dotted line shows the current projection through 202 8.  This debt-to-\nGDP ratio will rise to levels not seen since just after World War II .  My conce rn is this: b y using \nup so much fiscal capacity now  – by which I mean the ability to lower tax rates or boost federal \nspending to offset economic weakness – the country  risks not having sufficient fiscal capacity in \nthe future when it might be needed.  And this lack of fiscal  capacity would be particularly \ntroubling if monetary  policy could not aggressively offset adverse shocks.3 \n Figure 9 shows that there is also some reason to be concerned  about  how aggressively \nmonetary policy can respond to a large adverse shock.  At the onset of m ost previous economic \nrecession s, short -term interest rates were quite high.  This provided plenty of room to reduce \ninterest rates as the economy went into recession.  The one time  that short -term interest rates \nreached zero  in recent history  was in the aftermath of  the Great Recession.  Once the FOMC cut \nthe short -term policy rate to its effective lower bound, reaching the limit of stimulus from that \ntool, the Federal Reserve employed its balance sheet to purchase longer -term assets, thus \nlowering longer -term interest rates and providing further monetary accommodation and stimulus.  \nThese actions, which I fully supported, were nonetheless politically controversial  and the subject \nof some debate among economists .4 \n So how much  room do we expect to have to lower interest rates in response to future \nrecessions?   The Federal Reserve’s SEP includes a forecast of where short -term interest rates \nwill settle  in the long  run.  The most recent median forecast for the long er-run federal funds rate \nis 2.9 percent , which is quite low by historical standards .  The underlying reason for this is that \nmost Committee members expect real interest rates to be quite low, due to a demographically \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 8:10 A.M. Eastern  Time on Friday, April 13, 2018  OR UPO N DELIVERY  \n10 \n driven slowing in labor force growth cou pled with slow growth in productivity.  Combined with \na 2 percent inflation goal, this implies low long -run, short -term policy rates, implying that on \naverage we could lower rates by less than 3 percentage points in response to a recession.  Since \nin many recessions we lower rates by as much as 5 percentage points, it is quite likely that \ninterest rates would reach zero again in a downturn.     \nCertainly expanding the Federal Reserve ’s balance sheet , and perhaps using other less -\nconventional monetary policy interventions , can help support the economy , should it be needed.5   \nHowever,  several questions and concerns exist.  H ow effective will these unconventional tools \nbe in offset ting adverse shocks ?  Is there significant opposition among the public and  Congress  \nto the Fed using nontraditional tools ?  How limited will fiscal policy  be in  buffer ing a n adverse \nshock or downturn?  These questions, while a bit sobering, highlight the need to increase  the \npotential of  policy buffers to respon d to possible future problems.  \n \nConclu ding Observations  \n The outlook for the economy projected by participants in  the Ma rch FOMC meeting is \nquite positive.   My own forecast is somewhat stronger in terms of unemployment rates  and \ninflation outcomes than the SEP forecast, which is why I am in favor of somewhat more \ntightening than the median FOMC member.   However, a forecast  of the most likely outcome  is \nnot a promise, and there are important potential  risks to that forecast.  Disruptive international \ntrade actions  or increasing the risk of a boom -bust economy by overextending could , in my view,  \nprove problematic  for the economy .  And the status of fiscal and monetary “buffers” call into \nquestion their ability to work against a shock or downturn.  \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 8:10 A.M. Eastern  Time on Friday, April 13, 2018  OR UPO N DELIVERY  \n11 \n  I am hopeful that the risks  I have discussed  can be avoided .  Assuming the se near term \nrisks are avoided , my own forecast is somewhat stronger than the SEP  forecast .  Of course , I \nwould support  a somewhat faste r increase in the federal funds  rates if that  stronger growth  does \nindeed occur.   \n In sum, the economic outlook is good, but we must all be attuned to what could go wrong \nin the short term and in the long term , and what that implies for appropriate monetary policy . \nThank you.  \n  \n   \n1 Measured as the percent change in real GDP  from the fourth quarter of 2017 to the fourth quarter of 2018.  \n \n2 See for example, López -Salido, David, Jeremy C.

It also \nhighlights the importance of macroprudential tools such as the countercyclical capital buffer.  \n \n4 That debate included disagreement over the efficacy of such actions, as well as concerns about whether the Federal \nReserve was engaging in credit allocation b y purchasing mortgage -related securities. In my view, there is room for \ndebate over the former, especially as the Fed  embarked on more and more rounds of asset purchases; I am less \nconcerned that the Fed has any intention of allocating credit to particular sectors in this way.  I for one am a \nproponent of such actions when necessary.  \n \n5 For additional perspective, see rem arks by Eric S.

John Olcay Lecture on  \nEthics and Economics at the  \nPeterson Institute for International Economics   \n \nWashington, D.C.   \nJune 27 , 2018  \n \n \nGood afternoon.  I want to thank the Peterson Institute for International Economics for \ninviting me to join you today.  I am truly honored to  be asked to give a talk in memory of John \nOlcay , whom I met through his connection to Harvard  University  professor Benjamin Friedman . \nI would see John on his periodic trips to Boston ; our first meeting occurred in 2007, just as \nfinancial markets were starting to show stress .  John and I shared rising concerns during this \nperiod  and, unfortunately, through what turned into the  global financial crisis and “Great \nRecession. ”   \nIn those days, John was troubled by the condition of financial markets , and also had a \ndeep concern about the  human  implications of serious economic downturn s – a topic I am going \n\n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 12:30  P.M.  Eastern  Time on Wednesday, June 27, 2018  OR UPO N DELIVERY  \n2 \n to focus on  today.   Before I do, however, let me note that the views I express are my own, not \nnecessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal Reserve Board of Governors , or the Federal \nOpen Market Committee (FOMC).  \n Given the matters with which John was concerned,  it is very fitting that this lecture series \nis focused  on “Ethics and Economics. ”  I should note that  many academic disciplines  incorporate \nethics  into required coursework (take medicine, philosophy,  or psychology , for example ), but I \nwould argue that ethics  is not an especially prevalent part of the curriculum  of economics.  In \nmost  courses, c ore economic concepts tend to  overwhelm the syllabus and  displace  the study of  \nethical issues.  If there is any discussion of ethics in profit - or utility -maximizing  frameworks, \nmy sense is that it might take place in the last week of an introductory economics class .  Given \nthis underweighting in the profession , I think it is wonderful that the Peterson Institute hosts this \nseries dedicated to ethics and economics.  \nToday , my remarks will focus on some of the ways in which the impact of negative \noutcomes in the economy are distributed  – disproportionately, I’ll argue .  These distributional \neffects have ethical dimensions that should motivate economic policymakers to do more to \nreduce the negative outcomes.   \nGiven the Fed’s dual mandate  – stable prices and maximum sustainable employment  – it \nmakes sense for us to look at  inflation and unemployment as we begin today.  First, inflation:  \nFigure 1  shows that there has been quite a change in the pattern of inflation over the past 50 \nyears , as measured by the change in the core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price \nindex .  In the United States, as in many advanced economies, the cyclical inflation pattern has \nbeen significantly muted.  This moderation beginning around 1980 reflect s, by the way,  the \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 12:30  P.M.  Eastern  Time on Wednesday, June 27, 2018  OR UPO N DELIVERY  \n3 \n important role that independent central banks c ould and did play in d ampening the inflation \ncycles seen in the past.   \nHowever, Figure 2  shows that the economic cycle, as measured by the unemployment  \nrate, has not been muted  and has not steadily moderated like inflation .   \nTo preview my main point s, in my view  the costs of high unemployment are \ndisproportionately born e by those who can least afford them , and a variety of actions could be \ntaken by policymakers to make periods of high unemployment less likely.  This brings us to  the \nethical dimension  of economics .  This is not just about thoughts or feelings – I want to talk today \nabout manifesting those ethical decisions in very tangible policymaking.  While there are many \nexamples of policies that could mitigate periods of high unemployment, today I will address  \nthree specific realms of policy – state and local government spending ; bank regulatory policy ; \nand finally , monetary policy.   \nFirst, however, I will touch on the impact of high unemployment and its distribution  \nacross several dimensions of the population . \n \nThe Distributional Impact of Periods of High Unemployment  \n The United States has  spent the past nine years recovering from a severe recession.  Some \npopulations  in particular  suffered disproportionately , and despite the recovery, historic gaps \npersist .   \nFigure 3  provides the unemployment rate by racial and ethnic background  from 1972 to \n2018 .  The overall U.S unemployment rate hit 10 percent in the most recent  recession  – the \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 12:30  P.M.  Eastern  Time on Wednesday, June 27, 2018  OR UPO N DELIVERY  \n4 \n second such time since  1972 in which the overall unemployment rate reached 10 percent.1  \nHowever, it is striking that in every  recession over this period, Black or African -American \nunemployment rates have exceeded 10 percent.  Moreover , in the 1982 recession the  Black or  \nAfrican -American unemployment rate exceed ed 20 percent ; and in the most recent recession, the \nBlack or African -American unemployment rate exceeded 15 percent.  Similarly, Hispanic \nunemployment during recessions is much more elevated than that of the overall population, \nalthough not as elevated as for Black or African -Americans.  \n Economic r ecessions also disproportionately impact unemployment for those with less \neducation , as shown in Figure 4 .  The figure shows  the unemployment rate by educational \nattainment (ranging from less than a high school diploma , to a bachelor’s degree or higher) from \n1992 to 2018 .2  While the unemployment rate for those with a college education  reached 5 \npercent  during the most recent recession , the rate exceeded 15 percent for those without  a high \nschool education . \n Furthermore,  while unemployment significantly impacts individuals , it also affects  \nfamilies.  As Figure 5  shows, the share  of U.S. children under age 18 who are below the poverty \nline increased significantly in the two recessions where the unemployment rate exceeded 1 0 \npercent  – with more than 20 percent of children below the poverty level during the Great \nRecession.   Another sobering  observation I take from  this chart is that th e child poverty rate  in \nthe U.S.  has dropped to 15 percent only once in the past nearly 60 years  – hovering just ab ove or \njust below 15 percent from 1969 to 1973 . \n In sum , the sad reality is that  unemployment disproportionately affects  minorities, the \nless educated, and children  whose families are experiencing unemployment .  The costs to both \nthe entire economy and to parts of our population are significant.  In my view,  if policies could \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 12:30  P.M.  Eastern  Time on Wednesday, June 27, 2018  OR UPO N DELIVERY  \n5 \n mitigate  the severity of economic slowdowns , some of those costs could be avoided – and taking \nactions now , when the economy is strong , could be particularly important  to lessening the \nseverity of  a hypothetical future downtur n and its impact on individuals . \n \nState and Local Government Spending  \n Fiscal policy is certainly not in the Fed’s portfolio of mandated responsibilities, but it has \na major impact on the economy so we must take it into account.3  Drawing on the historical \nrecord , I want to suggest some opportunities for fiscal policy to address the issues I have just \nhighlighted .  In my view, s tate and local  government  financing should be designed to buffer the \neconomy during recessions, or at a minimum should not reduce the stimulative effects of \nspending when the economy is most troubled.   \nHowever, Figure 6  shows that since 1960 , state and local government spending tend s to \ndecline when the unemployment rate is high, and increase when the unemployment rate is low.  \nThis pattern likely arises from the fall in state and local tax revenues during economic \ndownturns, coupled with a desire to spend within one’s means  – after a ll, most state and local \ngovernments face balanced  budget requirements .  But it tends to aggravate economic downturns  \nor add additional fuel to a n already  humming economy ( scenario s that would be characterized as \n“procyclical” in the parlance of economists ).  And for context, s tate and local government \nspending is significant in the overall economy, account ing for 11 pe rcent of U.S. GDP, compared \nto 4 percent for residential investment  (which also tends to fall in economic downturns)  and 7 \npercent for federal government spending.  \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 12:30  P.M.  Eastern  Time on Wednesday, June 27, 2018  OR UPO N DELIVERY  \n6 \n  As I have just suggested, state and local governments likely reduce spending in \nrecessions for good reasons .  I would suggest , however,  that a number of steps can be taken by \nofficial s that would lessen the problematic impact .   \nFirst, the cyclicality of revenue sources for state and local governments can be lessened – \nin other words, revenue streams might  be redesigned to move less cyclically  if other competing \ngoals allow .4  For example, state s that are  highly dependent on c apital gains taxes are much more \nlikely to experience funding shortfalls during economic downturns , so if possible, reducing this  \ndependence c ould help.5   \nSecond, steps can be taken so that the fiscal health of a state does not drive substantial \ncuts during downturns.  A number of large states  (such as Illinois or New Jersey ) have seen \ndeterioration in their financial conditions over the past several years , as represented by declines \nin their credit rating s (Figure 7 ).  This is, in part,  the resul t of chronic underfunding of pension \nliabilities  in some states .  Ideally, a time like now – when the national economy is growing and \nemployment is robust  – would be an opportunity, it seems to me,  to prepare for the next \ndownturn.  This would perhaps include shoring up state finances, reducing unfunded pension \nliabilities, and significantly increasing “rainy day ” funds.6  I am not suggesting it would be easy, \neven in these economic times.  But progress could be made.  A similar argument could be made \nfor the federal government , given how beneficial it would be to  have the capacity to be more \nfiscally expansive in a future  recession .7 \nIn sum,  my view is that in the long run, states should consider how  to balance the various \ncompeting goals  of their fiscal approach – for example the goal of having stable rev enue streams \nand of achieving progressivity .  But to return to my main point, state and local governments \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 12:30  P.M.  Eastern  Time on Wednesday, June 27, 2018  OR UPO N DELIVERY  \n7 \n should reassess their revenue structure and fiscal approach with an eye on cyclic al downturns \nand the potential to lessen their impact on people, through policy . \n \nBank Regulation  \n While it may seem somewhat counterintuitive, b anking regulation can also amplify  the \nbusiness cycle , and policymakers can look for ways to lessen these effects .  For example, \nlenders’ losses on loans tend to increase significantly during economic downturns, reflecting \nrising unemployment and the difficulty that many households and firms have in meeting debt \nobligations during  hard economic times .  Figure 8 shows that  nonperforming loans at U.S. banks \ntend to rise during periods of high unemployment and fall during periods of low unemployment.8   \nCertain aspects o f bank regulation can actually exacerbate the consequences of this trend.  \nFor example, capital regulations set a threshold on how low a bank ’s capital – that is, its total \nassets (e.g.  loans) less its total liabilities (e.g. deposits) – can fall.  While this is well-intended  – \nand designed  to ensure that banks can m eet all their obligations  – certain aspects of capital \nregulations  can actually cause banks to act in a manner that essentially extend s their problems to \ntheir customers  in a downturn .   \nWhen the ir capital -to-assets ratio gets too low , banks can choose to  either  raise their \ncapital level, or shrink assets , to restore the ratio .  Raising additional capital is especially costly \nduring economic downturns, and is generally opposed by existing shareholders who do not want \ntheir ownership stake d iluted.  \nAs a consequence , banks most often raise the capital -to-asset s ratio by shrinking  assets  – \nand of course, loans are key assets for banks .  Thus raising the capital -to-asset s ratio can mean \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 12:30  P.M.  Eastern  Time on Wednesday, June 27, 2018  OR UPO N DELIVERY  \n8 \n less lending at just the time the economy may need stimulus.  And banks may try to reduce  \ndownturn -related  losses  by raising interest rates or tightening lending standards – both of which \ncan hurt otherwise credit -worthy borrowers.  \nIn light of all this , I would suggest that – just as state and local governments need to \nshore up their finances and build their rainy day funds during a boom – it is incumb ent on a bank \nto raise more capital during good economic times  so that it can deplete that fund during a \nrecession , rather than shrink loans when  the economy  most needs them .  An important regulatory \ntool that can be  used to ensure that a bank builds up this so -called  rainy day fund during good \ntimes  is known as the Countercyclical Capital Buffer (CCyB).9   \n Figure 9  shows two different ways to implement capital re gulations  – one using a static \ncapital requirement and one using a variable capital requirement .  We see a hypothetical scenario \nin which an economic downturn leads to a loss of 300 basis points  (or 3 percen tage points) on \ncapital.  On the left, this  causes the bank to fall below its capital requirement , given that the bank \nwas holding 200 basis points of excess capital .  As just described, banks often react by shrinking \ntheir assets  to try to satisfy their capital requirement, reducing lending when borrowers most \nneed it.   \nOn the right  side of Figure 9 , we see an alternate scenario in which the bank has \naccumulated a CCyB of 250 basis points during the good economic times that preced e the \ndownturn , as required by regulation upon the activation of the CCyB.  If the CCyB is deactivated \nwhen the economic downturn occurs  and losses are realized , the bank has an additional capital \nbuffer of 450 basis points.   As a result of the bank’s loss es stemming from the economic \ndownturn, th e buffer  is consumed and reduced to zero.  But the 300 basis point loss does not \npush the capital ratio below what is required, and thus the incentive to reduc e lending  is lessened .   \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 12:30  P.M.  Eastern  Time on Wednesday, June 27, 2018  OR UPO N DELIVERY  \n9 \n While this type of CCyB is currently being used in many Eur opean countries  and in Hong \nKong , the CCyB  in the United States remains  at zero.10  Given the overall health of the economy \nand the relatively rich asset valuations now  prevailing , it is my view that  this would be the ideal \ntime to build up capital buffers  in the U.S .  Doing so could help address the incentive that  banks \nwill have to pull back on lending to shrink  assets  in a future economic downturn.11 \n \nMonetary Policy  \n Monetary policy is primarily conducted by moving short -term interest rates.  During \ngood times, the interest rate is set to keep the economy at maximum sustainable employment and \nat the inflation target , which is 2 percent in the United States.  However, w hen a recession occurs \nand the unemployment rate rises, policymakers push down interest rates.  This has the effect of \nlower ing payments for households and firms that are borrowing, and ideally  mitigate s the \nsever ity of  the economic cycle.  As Figure 10  illustrates , since the Volcker disinflation episode \nin the late 1970s  and early 1980s, the short -term federal funds  rate has been lowered \nsignificantly , particularly during periods of very high unemployment rates.  \n However, in the last economic cycle  the inflation rate was relatively modest , and real \ninterest rates were low because of slow growth in population and productivity, so the federal \nfunds rate began the downturn  at an already  relatively low level. This meant that when the \nrecession hit, as the funds rate was reduced  in response,  it fairly quickly hit zero . Because short -\nterm interest rates  started off low, the extent to which they could be reduced to offset high \nunemployment rates  was limited .   \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 12:30  P.M.  Eastern  Time on Wednesday, June 27, 2018  OR UPO N DELIVERY  \n10 \n As Figure 11  shows, estimates of the equilibri um interest rate12 have been declining .  \nAccording to the FOMC’s Summary of Economic Projections (SEP), currently Fed policymakers \nanticipate that the median federal funds interest rate in the long run is expect ed to be only 2.9 \npercent  in nominal  terms .  Subtracting the Fed’s 2 percent inflation goals, this implies a long-run \nreal interest rate of just 0.9 percent .   \nWhile the central bank  has other tools  to offset economic downturns , such as expanding \nits balance sheet  to lower long -term interest rates , many economists view short -term interest \nrates as a more effective (and certainly a better -tested and understood) countercyclical tool.  The \nFederal Reserve can do little to change the equilibrium real interest rate in the long  run, since it  \nis determine d more by factors such as productivity and demographics .  So it is appropriate to \nconsider other ways  to avoid hitting zero with short -term interest rates.  One possibility is to \nconsider more flexibility with the inflation target, perhaps focus ing more on  an inflation range  \nthan a specific number.13  One might allow the inflation target to rise within the range during \nperiods of low real rates, thus providing more room for the funds rate to fall during an economic \ndownturn.  \nSuch a change in the monetary pol icy framework is something that should be considered, \nalong with a careful assessment of the potential costs and benefits.  However, if the monetary \npolicy framework is not changed, policymakers  should look at other policy tools that can more \neffectively reduce the severity of recessions.  \n Current policy also has a role in preparing  for, or postponing, the next recession.  As \nFigure 12  shows, over the time period since 1960 , whenever the economy  significantly exceed ed \nfull employment , a recession ensue d.  The one counter -example is the 1960s, whe n fiscal policy \nwas quite expansionary because of the deficit -financed Vietnam War, even though the economy  \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 12:30  P.M.  Eastern  Time on Wednesday, June 27, 2018  OR UPO N DELIVERY  \n11 \n was already running strong with the unemployment rate below the level associated with  full \nemployment.  However, that period was also characterized by rising inflation , which triggered  \nsignificant problems in the following  decade  related to  elevated inflation and inflation \nexpectations.   \nWhether imbalances appear as higher wages and prices, or higher asset prices, correcting \nimbalances in the economy (for example, if  unemployment falls below a sustainable rate)  \nwithout a recession is a challenge for central banks to accomplish.   As a result,  I think the policy \npath that will increase the probability of a longer recession -free period is the path where the \neconomy does not run above capacity and thus , fall far below the  sustainable unemployment rate. \nI put these notions forward as policymakers  continue to seek ways to lessen the severity and \nimpact – particularly the disparate impac t – of cyclical economic downturns.  \n \nConclu ding Observations  \n In summary and conclusion, w hile ethics is not generally a central focus of the discipline \nof economi cs, my view is that the costs of economic downturns – and the uneven distribution  of \ntheir impact  – are, in fact, ethical issue s.  I suspect  our friend John Olcay would concur .  Both in \nthe spirit of ethics and to sharpen policy effectiveness, I believe a  more active discussion should  \nbe occurring among fiscal, supervisory, and monetary policymakers .  All of them , as I have \nsuggested today, could continue and perhaps expand their efforts to make cyclical downturns – \nand resulting periods of high unemployment – less severe.   \nThank you.  \n  \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 12:30  P.M.  Eastern  Time on Wednesday, June 27, 2018  OR UPO N DELIVERY  \n12 \n   \n1 1972 is the first date for which this breakdown is available.  \n   \n2 1992 is the first date for which this breakdown is available.  \n \n3 For additional perspective, see remarks by Eric S. Rosengren:  “Monetary, Fiscal, and Financial Stability Policy \nTools: Are We Equipped for th e Next Recession? ” delivered on March 23, 2018, in Washington D.C.    \n \n4 Tax policies have multiple, often competing goals and therefore policymakers fa ce tradeoffs. One important goal is \nto reduce income inequality. While income taxes (especially capital gains taxes) are very cyclical, they are often \nmore progressive (i.e., tax as a share of income is higher for higher -income households) than sales taxes  and other \ntax vehicles.  \n \n5 Capital gains taxes are a large revenue source for many states. Cutting or eliminating capital gains taxes will \nautomatically require a very large increase in sales taxes and other taxes and fees if we talk about a revenue -neutral \nscenario.  \n \n6 Linking cyclical revenue sources (such as capital gains taxes) to rainy day funds could be a good comp romise \namong maintaining high revenue -raising capacity, improving progressivity, and reducing cyclicality.  In my view, \nthe macroeconomic effects have probably been underwei ghted. For additional discussion on the needed siz e of state \nrainy day funds, see 2014 Working Paper by Boston Fed Senior Economist Bo Zhao: “Saving for a Rainy Day: \nEstimating the Appropriate Size of U.S. State Budget Stabilization Funds. ”   \n \n7 It is worth noting that  despite long -run fiscal challenges, lack of support during serious recessions extends the \nrecessio n, and thus extends the period of lost tax revenue, and exacerbates underlying woes in the state. I n my view,  \na short -term investment in a modest increase in indeb tedness may pay back over time.  \n \n8 Furthermore, the combination of nonperforming loans and lower interest rates during recessions have the effect of \nadding pressure to banks’ earnings.  \n \n9 For more info on the CCyB, see: https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/bcreg20160908b.htm .  \nIn addition to the CCyB, other bank regulatory tools include the Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review \n(CCAR) and the Dodd -Frank Stress Tests  (DFAST). There are countercyclical elements to the stress tests.  More \nstressful scenarios in good times require banks to build more capital.  For more on CCAR and DFAST see \nhttp://www.federalreserve.gov/bankinforeg/stress -tests-capital -planning.htm .  \n \n10 As Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome H. Powell noted in his recent press  conference on June 13, 2018, “ …the \ncountercyclical capital buffer gives us the ability to raise capital requirements on the largest institutions when \nfinancial stability vulnerabilities are meaningfully above normal. ”  I am suggesting  a slightly different application  \nmight also be appropriate . (See transcript of the Chairman’s press conference here.)    \n \n11 For additional perspective, see remarks by Eric S. Rosengren:  “Monetary, Fiscal, and Financial Stability Policy \nTools: Are We Equipped for th e Next Recession? ” delivered on March 23, 2018, in Washington D.C.    \n \n12 It is important to note that the equilibrium interest rate isn’t precisely known.  \n \n13 For additional perspective, see remar ks by Eric S.

(somewhat speculative)\n▶Recognizing weaknesses, changing structure is \ninherently difficult\n▶Once a convention is established, hard to change, \nespecially with a large, consensus- driven Committee\n▶A process that institutionalizes a periodic step \nback to devote significant time to evaluate \ncurrent framework and consider alternatives, \nmay lead to more timely improvements in \nframework when necessary\n▶These considerations motivate the need for a \nregular, formal, transparent review that includes \noutside perspectives\n\n12What Would a Review Look Like?\n▶Review should normally be at a fixed frequency\n▶Suggest every four years –second year of Chair’s term\n▶Flexibility to review off -schedule when needed\n▶Agenda for review set by FOMC –changes to \nframework require vote of FOMC\n▶Review would include evaluation of current framework –\nand consideration of alternatives that might improve on \ncurrent framework\n▶Open process –general call for papers\n▶Costs to regularly evaluating framework?\n▶Loss of credibility, uncertainty about inflation goal?\n▶Given that we already change frameworks, could also \nlower the cost by making the process more transparent\n\n13How Would Such a Review Differ \nfrom Current Practice?\n▶Review should normally be at a fixed frequency:\n▶Annual January review\n▶No specific recommendations for alternatives to \nvote on\n▶Agenda for review:\n▶Minimal agenda for the annual discussion, not set \nby FOMC.

It is a pleasure to be speaking with you today at the 60th annual meeting  \nof the National Association for Business Economics.  Let me also welcome you to our wonderful \ncity of Boston.  \n Before I begin my remarks, let me note that the views I express are my own, not \nnecessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal Reserve Board of Governors or the Federal \nOpen Market Committee (FOMC).  \nLast week the FOMC  raised the federal funds rate by 25 basis points , a move consistent \nwith the very strong economic performance seen over the l ast two quarters .  With this latest \nmonetary policy action, the federal funds rate  has now been increased  three  time s this year  – and \n\n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 12:55 P.M.  Eastern  Time on Monday, October 1, 2018  OR UPON DELIVERY  \n2 \n at 2 to 2- 1/4 percent , it is now  above the Federal Reserve’s inflation target of 2 percent for the \nfirst time since the financial crisis and Great Recession.   \nToday, U.S. m onetary conditions  remain mildly accommodative , with short -term market \nrates barely higher than the inflation rate (thus barely positive in real terms).  A nd given tax cuts \nand spending realities, f iscal policy remains quite accommodative.    \nGiven t he accommodative stance of monetary and fiscal policy, it is not surprisin g that \nmost private forecasters, as well as most members of the FOMC, expect the economy to grow \nstrongly for the second half of this year .  Many economist s expect  real growth for the second half \nof this year to be approximately 3 percent.  That is strong enough to further tighten  labor markets \nand further push down  the unemployment rate , currently at 3.9 percent .  Consistent with this \nexpectation , the Blue Chip f orecasters  anticipate  the unemployment rate fall ing to 3.5 percent  by \nthe end of next year . \n This strong U.S. economic growth is occurring despite some clear risks to the global \neconomy , which I’ll touch on today .  The announcement of increased tar iffs by both the U .S. and \nChina last  Monday heighten ed concerns that trade disruptions could be come a significant \nheadwind over time.  In addition, several emerging market economies  are now more stressed – \nparticularly those such as  Turkey, whose corporations ’ U.S. dollar -denomi nated debts have \nbecome costlier as  their currency has depreciated  against the dollar .  And w hile Europe has \nshown some signs of improving, there is still the possibility of more significant disruptions \nemerging from a  potential ly disruptive Brexit , or from  the exposure  of many European banks  to \nsome of the troubled emerging market economies. \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 12:55 P.M.  Eastern  Time on Monday, October 1, 2018  OR UPON DELIVERY  \n3 \n  How should U .S. monetary policy makers  respond to the se conditions – a strong U .S. \neconomy , but clear signs of rising risks emanating from  other economies?  I a m carefully \nwatching factors  that could pose risks to the  continued U.S.  economic expansion.  But  my own \nassessment is that the most likely outcome will be a  U.S.  labor market that continues to tighten  \nand the  likely build up of economic imbalances, including , but not limited to , inflationary \npressures.   \nWhile inflation remains well contained to date, pushing the economy too hard risks \ninflation ary concerns  or financial -stability risks .  Either of these outcomes might necessitate a \nmore f orceful  monetary policy response.  While a more forceful policy might be appropriate \nunder such conditions, it is not a risk -free strategy  and could put at risk the  continued expansion. \nThe history of rapid rate increases in the U .S. suggests that such a risk is real, and as a result  my \npreference for a strategy that allows a continued , but gradual , pace of monetary tightening.   \nAssuming the potential  global  risks I mentioned do not materialize and disrupt strong \nU.S. GDP growth , I believe that continuing to raise short -term rates gradually , until monetary \npolicy becomes mildly restrictive , is likely to be appropriate  and beneficial over the long term . \n \nLabor M arkets  \n Conditions in labor markets  are, of course, foundational  to my analysis .  In every  \ndiscussion I have with business people  in New England, a  theme that continually comes up is the \ntightness of the labor market.  Turning to the data, Figure 1  shows that the number of initial \nclaims for unemployment insurance is now near a series low and much lower than it has been \nduring all but one of the  previous recoveries since 1967.  It is not surprising that f irms are not \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 12:55 P.M.  Eastern  Time on Monday, October 1, 2018  OR UPON DELIVERY  \n4 \n laying people off , because the economy  continues to be quite strong, but another factor is the \ndifficult y finding  someone  to replace a worker who is laid off or leaves .  So l ayoffs may remain \nuncommon even if firm s experience some  slowdown  in their business . \n Figure 2  shows the so -called “ quits rate, ” the number of people who  voluntarily leave  \ntheir job as a share of  total employment, since 2003.  Keep in mind that if you quit your job, you \ndo not qualify for unemployment insurance.  So, essentially , the quits rate provides an indication \nof workers ’ confidence in their ability to find a new job.   \n Figure 3  shows the job openings rate  – which is the number of job openings at the end of \nthe month, relative to total employment plus job openings , monthly since 2003 .  The job \nopenings rate is now significantly higher than at the peak before the crisis and  recession .  This \nmeasure of firms’ demand for labor is at its highest level since the series was first repor ted in late \n2000. \n Figure 4  shows the unemployment rate , which has fallen to 3.9 percent .  The Blue Chip \nconsensus forecast  expect s it to fall to 3.5 percent by the end of next year.  Such an outcome \nwould be well below most estimates of the natural , or long -run, rate of unemployment.  At \npresent, the FOMC’s Summary of Economic Projections (SEP) suggests that  no FOMC  \nparticipant  estimates the long -run unemployment rate to be lower than 4 percent .  The median \nlonger -run unemployment rate projected by FOMC participants  is 4.5 percent.  I would suggest \nthat a  forecast where  the unemployment rate fal ls well below its estimated long -run sustainable \nlevel for a significant period of time is a sign of macroeconomic imbalance, which poses a risk of \nrising inflation or increasing  financial stability concerns  – or both.  \n \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 12:55 P.M.  Eastern  Time on Monday, October 1, 2018  OR UPON DELIVERY  \n5 \n Wages and P rices  \nTurning to wages and prices, Figure 5  provides the average hourly earnings of  \nproduction and nonsupervisory private -industry employees  from January 2003 to August 2018.  \nOver the past five years, earnings have gradually risen, and are currently roughly consistent with \nthe sum of 2 percent inf lation , plus the somewhat subdued productivity gains  of roughly 1 \npercent .   \nInterestingly, if you examine service- providing industries and goods -producing \nindustries , you see that earnings in both have been increasing.  The service -providing industries ’ \nearnings closely match th ose of the total , while goods -producing industries  (which include those \nthat are more export -intensive and thus  more likely to be directly impacted by tariffs ) have seen \nearnings increase more quickly of late – although I should note that the volatility of these \nearnings is always higher than that of services .  Should the upward trend in wages  continue, one \nwould expect  firms to either  shrink their profit margins or begin to pass  on some of the costs as \nprice increases.  \n Figure 6  shows total and core PCE  measures of inflation.  The inflation measures have \nfluctuat ed recently  around the Federal Reserve’s  2 percent inflation target , although there is a \nmodest upward trend over the past three years .  Private forecasters in the Survey of Professional  \nForecasters  now expect PCE  inflatio n to be just above  2 percent both this year and  next.  \nConsistent with my earlier comments on tight labor markets, I personally believe there are some \nupside risks to this outlook. \n Figure 7  shows PCE  inflation separately for  goods and services  from 2003 through the \nsecond quarter of  2018.  While s ervices  PCE  inflation has been a bit above 2 percent over the \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 12:55 P.M.  Eastern  Time on Monday, October 1, 2018  OR UPON DELIVERY  \n6 \n past two years , the more volatile g oods PCE  inflation has , for the most part , been below 2 \npercent  – although it  has been rising recently.   \nAs we study price movements, we need to consider trade and tariffs.  T ariffs may be \npassed through, at least in part, to prices in goods -producing industries over time.  But tariffs \nmay also be used as “cover” for passing through the rising cost of labor1 as labor markets tighten \nfurther.   Indeed, many of our  business contacts in New England have highlighted that they now \nreceiv e little resistance to passing on price increases.  These anecdotes  may reflect an unintended \nconsequence of the tariffs: suppliers may now feel they have more pricing flexibility, posing an \nupside risk to measured inflation. \n \nReal GDP  Growth  \n Figure 8  shows the pattern of real GDP growth.  At 4.2 percent growth, t he second \nquarter of 2018 was quite strong.  However, some of this growth likely reflects shifts in the \ntiming of spending in expectation of the imposition of tariffs on some goods.  For example, \nsoybean shipments increased in the second quarter , apparentl y to beat  the imposition of tariffs ; \nshipments are likely to fall now that the tariffs are in place.   \nOver the second half of this year, private forecasters are expecting that real GDP growth \nwill average around 3 percent, with growth next year ranging fr om 2 to 2.5 percent.   Since that \nexceed s what economists call the economy’s potential rate of growth (somewhat below 2 \npercent ), I would expect to see further declines in the unemployment rate over this horizon. \n Figure 9  provides the pattern of consumption.  While consumption growth slowed \nunexpectedly  in the first quarter, it rebounded in the second quarter.  Most forecaster s expect \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 12:55 P.M.  Eastern  Time on Monday, October 1, 2018  OR UPON DELIVERY  \n7 \n consum er spending to be a key  driver of the economy , reflect ing high consumer confidence, \nrising stock and housing prices, and continued growth in personal income.  \n Given the uncertainty surrounding tariffs and foreign growth, the trajectory for e xports of \ngoods and services  remain s uncertain.  Exports represent  a sizable s hare of GDP, as shown in \nFigure 10 .  If retaliatory tariffs  roughly match the tariffs imposed by the United States , the result \ncould be a roughly equal reduction in exports and imports , leaving the trade deficit \napproximately the same.   \nHowever, tariffs i ncrease the uncertainty around the path of net exports.  Trade \ndisruptions could cause countries to source their purchases from new countries , for instance  – but \nin many cases this is not a change that could happen easily or quickly.  M oreover, uncertainty  \nabout how long the tariffs might be in place  makes the decision about whether to relocate \nproduction or  to find new supply sources or markets even more difficult.   \nOver the past 20 years , supply chains have become increasingly interconnected across \nmany countries for any one good.  As suggested above, the threat of tariffs may disrupt the \nglobal supply chains , causing firms to source from more costly  (without tariffs) – but potentially \nmore dependable – suppliers.  T hese complex supply adjustments are likely to play out over an \nextended period.  This implies  a modest upward bias to the  inflation forecast over the next \nseveral years.  In an environment of strong growth and tight labor markets , these staggered one -\ntime price changes  run a greater risk of  becom ing more solidly incorporated into inflation \nexpectations.   \nAn added concern for exporters is the high er value of the dollar , which makes it more \ndifficult for our goods and services  to remain competitive, as shown in Figure 11 . \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 12:55 P.M.  Eastern  Time on Monday, October 1, 2018  OR UPON DELIVERY  \n8 \n Risks  \n There are certainly significant  risks to the forecast.  I will mention three here.   First, the \nstrength of the U.S. dollar has generated complications for some emerging market economies.   \nFigure 12  shows the significant currency devaluation s for two emergi ng economies, Argentina \nand Turkey.  Businesses in th ese countries that have borrowed in dollars  will of course find it \nmore difficult to pay their debts as the value of their own currency  falls relative to the dollar .   \nA second challenge for emerging markets is the increase in oil prices.  Many of the \nemerging economies are importers of oil that is priced in dollars ( Figure 13 ), so rising oil prices \nonly complicate matters , as both higher  dollar  prices and a rising  value of the  dollar act as a tax \non these countries’ incomes .  To the extent that emerging market growth is slowed by rising oil \nprices, this in turn will pose a challenge to  U.S. growth. \n There have also been increased concerns over  a potential slowdown in China. Perhaps \nreflecting such unease , Chinese stock prices have declined recently ( Figure 14) .  As a  highly \nleveraged economy faced with significant tariffs , the risk of a more significant slowdown in the \nworld’s second largest economy  should be considered.  \n \nConcluding Observations  \n I will conclude with a few final observations on policy.  Figure 15  shows the median \npath of interest rate  projections through 2021from  the SEP .  The median forecast in the  SEP has \nthe federal funds rate rising to 3.4 percent.  T he median estimate for longer -run or equilibrium \ninterest rates in the SEP is 3 percent, so this implies interest rates gradually rising to become \nmildly restrictive.   \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 12:55 P.M.  Eastern  Time on Monday, October 1, 2018  OR UPON DELIVERY  \n9 \n My own view is generally  consistent with the SEP  forecasts .  I believe that Federal \nReserve policymakers  will likely need to move interest rates gradually from a mildly \naccommodative stance to a mildly restrictive stance  in order to best fulfil our mandate – stable \nprices and maximum sustainable growth.   \nWhile this amounts to one person’s  forecast, it is important to note that it is fully \nconsistent with a forecast of GDP growth above potential that leads to  further tightening of labor \nmarkets , and inflation mildly overshooting the Federal Reserve’s  2 percent target.   Of course, if  \nsome of  the risks that I have highlighted today  become more germane to the outlook, a different \npolicy path would be warranted . \n Thank you.  \n \n                                                           \n1Adjusted for productivity.",

I would like to thank the Connecticut Business &  Industry Association  \nand the MetroHartford Alliance for having me here today to share my views on the economy.  At \nthe outset, let me note as I always do that the views I express today are my own, not necessarily \nthose of my colleagues at the Federal Reserve’s Board of Governors or on the Federal Open \nMarket Committee (the FOMC).  \n\n\n*EMBARGOED UNTIL Monday , January  9, 201 7, at 8:55 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time, or UPON DELIVERY*  \n \n2 \n  In the  two years since I last addressed this gathering , much has changed.  For those who \nhave heard me speak here over the years , you may recall  that from 2007 to 2014 , I was a strong \nadvocate for exceptionally accommodative  monetary policy to combat the severe recession we  \nexperienced  in the wake of the financial crisis .  More recently , my comments  have moved in the \nother direction, advocating for a gradual return to a more normal monetary policy.  It is not that \nmy underlying views or economic analysis have changed ; rather, economic c ircumstances have \nevolved  and now imply the need for a different stance of monetary policy . \n Today I will discuss how my earlier p reference for “easy” monetary policy and my \ncurrent desire to gradually normalize the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy stance  reflect a \nsingle, consistent framework.  I would note that my views  on the stance of policy , while  evolv ing \nwith the shifting economic conditions, have remained  fully consistent with the Fed’s dual \nmandate  of stable  price s and maximum sustainable employment . \n As everyone likely knows, the Federal Reserve’s policymaking body, the FOMC,  raised \nthe federal funds rate by 25 basis points twice since the recovery began – first in December  2015 , \nand then in  December 2016 .  I was strongly supportive of both move s and see them  as reflecting \nthe strength of the U .S. economic recovery.   \nFor reasons that I hope to  make clear in my remarks today , I expect that appropriate \nmonetary policy  will need to normalize more quickly than over the past year, but certainly not as \nrapidly  as in the last tightening cycle , which began in 2004 .  The current unemployment rate is at \nmy estimate of what is likely to be sustainable in the long  run, and total and c ore PCE inflation \nmeasures are  approaching the Federal Reserve’s  2 percent inflation target  (which is defined in \nterms of total PCE inflation) .  Without further gradual increases in interest rates, one might be \n\n*EMBARGOED UNTIL Monday , January  9, 201 7, at 8:55 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time, or UPON DELIVERY*  \n \n3 \n concern ed that the unemployment rate could drift below its long -run sustainable level  – and as a \nresult,  inflation could eventually exceed the Fed’s 2 percent target.  So the stance of monetary \npolicy will need to adjust  – to prevent the economy  from  dramatically overshoot ing on both \nelements of the dual mandate , which would place the economic recovery  at risk . \n \nRecent Financial Market Movements  \n Figure 1  shows the federal funds rate over the past 15 years.  It places the recent increase \nof 25 basis points in context , and contrasts  recent policy actions with those of  the last tightening \ncycle.  In the previous tightening cycle  that began in 2004 , the FOMC  raised the federal funds \nrate by 25 basis points at each meeting.  This was described in FOMC statements at the time as \nincreasing rates at a “me asured pace.”  Clearly the last two increases , in December  2015 and \nDecember 2016 , represent  quite a patient policy stance relative to the “measured pace” in the \nprevious cycle.   \nSuch a slow normalization path has been appropriate for several reasons. The significant  \nloss of jobs during the Great Recession ensured the recovery to full employment would not be \nquick.  Real GDP has been growing only slightly faster than potential over most of the recovery, \nalthough the growth of potent ial GDP is certainly slower than it used to be. And through the \nrecovery period, inflation rates both here and abroad have remained well below  the inflation \ntargets  set by central banks. Because policymakers consistently missed on the weak side of both \nelements of the dual mandate, it is my view that the very patient and gradual approach to raising \nthe funds rate has been entirely appropriate.  \n\n*EMBARGOED UNTIL Monday , January  9, 201 7, at 8:55 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time, or UPON DELIVERY*  \n \n4 \n  Consistent with the FOMC having raised interest rates quite gradually , expectations for \nadditional increases  assumed by markets remain quite modest .  Figure 2  shows the federal funds \nrate projections through 2017 implied by the futures  market  at three points  – at the time of the \nfirst tightening in December 2015, at the beginning of last July after the Brexit vo te, and as of \nlast Friday.  The financial markets have indicated skeptic ism about how quickly the Federal \nReserve  will be able to normalize  rates , and  imply a path only somewhat  faster than the past two \nyears . \n Despite the relatively slow pace of increases  reflected in market expect ations  for the \nfederal funds rate, longer -term rates have increased significantly since the November FOMC \nmeeting.  The bar chart in Figure 3  shows that the 10 -year U.S. Treasury rate has increased by \nmore than 50 basis points, and long rates in the U nited Kingdom , Germany , and Japan have also \nincreased  – although by much  less.  These results  may reflect the expectation of potentially more \nstimulative fiscal policy, greater confidence that inflation will increase  toward targets , and more \noptimism about global prospects.  \n An indicator  of greater confidence in inflation rates rising to targets is seen in the “break -\neven ” inflation rates that are implied by  the difference between five-year Treasury rates and rates \non five-year Treasury Inflation -Protected Securities  (TIPS) .  As shown in Figure 4 , over the past \nfive years  the break -even inflation rate has been well below the Fed eral Reserve ’s 2 percent \ninflation target, but since early November the implied inflation rate has risen  quite close to that \ninflation target.  This indicates a growing confidence by financial market  participan ts that the \neconomy will successfully reach the Fed’s 2 percent  inflation target, and should average quite \nclose to 2 percent inflation over the next five years.  \n\n*EMBARGOED UNTIL Monday , January  9, 201 7, at 8:55 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time, or UPON DELIVERY*  \n \n5 \n  The recent movement in financial market prices should provide greater confidence that \nthe Federal Reserve is  finally closing in on both elements of its dual mandate, and that an \nincreased pace of the gradual  monetary policy  normalization in the United States is appropriate.  \nThis is particularly noteworthy considering that central banks in other developed countries are \nstill easing monetary policy  in attempts  to reach their inflation targets.   \n \nThe Labor Market Outlook  \n Figure 5  shows the path of two measures of unemployment – the U-3 and U -6 \nunemployment rate s – since 2006.  The widely reported and closely followed U-3 measure of \nunemployment was 4.7 percent  in December.  My own definition of full employment  – meaning \nthe unemployment rate associated with full employment  – is 4.7 percent, so we have now in \neffect reached the level of unemployment that I think is likely to be sustainable in the long -run.   \nThe U -6 measure of unemployment is a broader gauge that includes work ers who are \nemployed part  time for economic reasons and potential workers who have become discouraged .  \nThe measure has fallen quite dramatically , to 9.2 percent , but is still somewhat above pre -\nrecession levels.  An open question is whether structural changes in the economy, including the \nincreased use of contractors and part -timers in the so-called “ gig” economy, are likely to impact \nwhether we see a return  to earlier  levels  of the U -6 measure . \n One can see  other indications that labor markets are continuing to tighten.  Figure 6  \nshows the unemployment rates since 2006 for those with a bachelor’s  degree or higher and those \nwith only a high school diploma.  For those with high er educational attainment , the \nunemployment rate is approaching the lows last seen prior to the recession.  With the \n\n*EMBARGOED UNTIL Monday , January  9, 201 7, at 8:55 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time, or UPON DELIVERY*  \n \n6 \n unemployment rate for this group at 2. 5 percent, and with m any jobs requiring higher \neducational attainment, it is fair to expect that we will begin to see pressures in labor markets for \nscarce talent.  \nThose with  only a high school diploma have an unemployment rate of 5.1 percent , which \nis also slightly elevated relative to pre -recession levels.  While there are clearly returns to higher \neducational attainment in terms of labor market outcomes, additions to the labor force for the \nhigher -skilled positions will likely require more attention to workforce development and possibly \nmore forms of encouragement to achieve higher educationa l outcomes.  \n Figure 7 shows the 12 -month moving average growth in the labor force from 2006  to the \npresent . The labor force is defined as the sum of those who are currently employed and those \nwho are searching for employment (that is, are unemployed).  Recently, increases in payroll \nemployment have resulted in smaller declines in the unemployment  rate because the U.S.  has \nbeen experiencing relatively strong growth in the labor force.  Indeed, an i ncrease in the labor \nforce is a potential benefit of relatively tight labor markets.   \nTo look a bit further , Figure 8  shows the 12 -month moving average of entry and exit to \nthe labor force as a percentage of the population.1  The growth in the labor force  has resulted \nfrom declining exits rather  than entries – that is, the percent of the population exiting the labor \nforce has declined more than the percent of the population entering the labor force.  Given the \ndemographic trends of a larger cohort of people reaching retirement age , and thus more likely to \nexit t he labor force , this trend of declining exits is unlikely to continue to be a source of labor \nforce  growth . This in turn implies that, with sustained employment growth, the unemployment \nrate will likely decline faster than it has in recent months.  \n\n*EMBARGOED UNTIL Monday , January  9, 201 7, at 8:55 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time, or UPON DELIVERY*  \n \n7 \n  Turning to the wage implications, Figure 9  shows growth in two measures of labor \ncompensation from 2006.  The first is average hourly earnings, from the payroll survey, which \nsimply divides total wages  paid by total hours  worked . Because it is an economy -wide average, \ncompositional changes in the labor force across industries  and occupations, or across high - \nversus low -wage  jobs will influence  the growth rate  in this measure .  The second measure is the \nEmployment Cost Index  (ECI) for wages and salaries. Data for the ECI is generated by asking \nfirms about the compensation they must pay for workers in specific occupations, so it can hold \nthe occupational mix constant in a way that the average hourly earnings measure of wages \ncannot. Both series show that wa ges have been increasing over the past two years, consistent \nwith strong labor market demand.  \n Overall, labor market data are consistent with tight ening  labor markets.  With the \nunemployment rate near or below most estimates of full employment, and with wa ges continuing \nto increase, this part of the  Federal Reserve’s  dual mandate – maximum sustainable employment  \n– seems largely fulfilled.  \n \nThe Inflation Outlook  \n Turning to the inflation side of the Fed’s dual mandate, Figure 10  shows total and core \nPCE inflation rates since 2006.  Over the past year, total and core inflation have been increasing ; \nhowever, both measures are currently below the  Fed’s  inflation target of 2 percent  – the level \nmonetary policymakers  associate with stable prices .  My own forec ast is for both measures to be \nat 2 percent by the end of 2017.  While the Fed’s inflation target is defined in terms of total PCE \n\n*EMBARGOED UNTIL Monday , January  9, 201 7, at 8:55 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time, or UPON DELIVERY*  \n \n8 \n inflation, other measures of inflation that often anticipate the direction of total PCE inflation \nhave also been trending up recently.  \n Figure 11  shows total and core CPI prices since 2006.  CPI is focused on the basket of \ngoods pur chased by consumers,2 and has increased r oughl y 0.3 percent faster than the PC E \nmeasure  over the past 10  to 15 years .3  Both measures have been increasing over the past two \nyears.  \n Alternative inflation measures that try to capture the underlying inflation process by \nremoving outliers  are shown in Figure 12 .  The Dallas Federal Reserve Bank comput es the \ntrimmed -mean  PCE.  By removing the outliers,  the series is less volatile  – but again  it has been \nincreasing over the past two years, although it remains below the 2 percent inflation target.  The \nCleveland Federal Reserve Bank provides the trimmed -mean  CPI.  It, too, has been  gradually \nincreasing over the past two years.  \n Overall, the inflation indices provide a fairly consistent pattern of gradually increasing \ninflation rates.  The combination of tighter labor markets and the gradual increases in inflation \nrates , measured in a variety of ways, should provide  more confidence that the economy  will \nattain the Federal Reserve’s inflation target over the next year.  \n \nImplications for Monetary Policy  \n  Figure 13  provides the estimates of the likely  federal funds rate path from the June and \nDecember  Surveys of Primary Dealers , and from Federal Reserve policymakers ( FOMC \nparticipants ).  The dots are the median federal funds  rate projections for year -end as provided by \n\n*EMBARGOED UNTIL Monday , January  9, 201 7, at 8:55 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time, or UPON DELIVERY*  \n \n9 \n FOMC participants in the Summ ary of Economic Projections (SEP) at the June and  December \nFOMC meeting s.  Two observations stand out.  First, over the past six months, both the primary \ndealers and the FOMC participants have seen conditions improve sufficiently to expect  \ncontinued normalization of monetary policy.  Second, m arket participants continue to expect less \ntightening than do FOMC participants.   \n My own view is that the SEP median forecast seems reasonable if we continue to see real \nGDP growing faster than the so -called “ potential ” rate .  My own forecast is that we will achieve \nboth elements of the dual mandate by the end of 2017  – and as a result , I believe that a still \ngradual but somewhat more regular increase in the federal funds rate will be  warranted.  \n In addition to short -term interest rates , the Federal Reserve has a second policy tool at its \ndisposal, the balance sheet , shown in Figure 14 .  The central bank’s balance sheet has been \nroughly level over the past two years.  With the federal funds rate expected to continue its  \ngradual ris e from the zero lower bound, the risk of returning to  the zero  lower bound should \ndiminish .  The FOMC has published a statement on its policy normalization principles and \nplans.4  As part of the monetary policy normalization strategy, the FOMC should, of course, \ncontinue to consider whether it needs to maintain such a large balance sheet.    \n \nConclu ding Observat ions \n Given where it was in recent years, t he economy has shown remarkable progress.  We \nnow are quickly approaching  employment and inflation levels consistent with both elements of \nthe Fed’s  dual mandate  – price stability and maximum sustainable employment .  I firmly believe \nthat t he aggressive policy actions taken by the Fed during the financial crisis and recession m ade \n\n*EMBARGOED UNTIL Monday , January  9, 201 7, at 8:55 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time, or UPON DELIVERY*  \n \n10 \n a huge difference  – our economy would not be as healthy as it is and we would thus not be near a \ntightening cycle now if we hadn’t been so aggressive then .  As a result , the U .S. is closer to \nachieving its goals for monetary policy than  are most other developed countries.  Looking ahead , \nI see the Federal Reserve as  likely to continue to gradually normalize U.S. monetary  policy, even \nas many other countries  may need to continu e to pursue  more expansionary monetary policies.  \n Thank you for as king me to be with you today.  Best wishes for a very good year  in 2017 .   \n  \n                                                           \n1 As previously noted , the labor force is defined as the sum of those who are currently employed and those who are searching for \nemployment (that is, are unemployed). Civilians 16 years and over who are not employed or unemployed are categorized as not \nin the labor force.  For  example, civilians 16 years and over who are without jobs but are not actively seeking work are \nconsidered not in the labor force.  Labor force entries are flows into employment and unemployment from not in the labor forc e.  \nLabor force exits are flows fr om employment and unemployment to not in the labor force.  Other inflows and outflows are also \nincluded in this calculation of entries and exits.  These include persons just turning 16, estimated deaths, and adjustments to \npopulation totals.  \n \n2 The CPI is perhaps better known to the public, but its focus on out-of-pocket consumer expenditures makes it somewhat less \ncomprehensive than PCE, which also includes purchases made on behalf of consumers – for example, by health -insurance \ncompanies.   \n \n3 Over the last five years, it has increased only 0.1 percent faster.   \n \n4 See https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/monetary/20140917c.htm .",

I would like to thank th e New York Association for Business \nEconomics for having me here today to share my  views on the economy.  At the outset, let me \nnote as I always do that the views I express to day are my own, not necessarily those of my \ncolleagues at the Federal Reserve’s Board of  Governors or on the Federal Open Market \nCommittee (the FOMC).  \nThe economy continues to grow moderately – at  about the same 2 per cent pace that it has \nfor the past several years.  This rate of expansion is slower than the historical average, but that \nappears to be largely due to dec lines in the rate of growth of  productivity and the labor force.1  \n\n\n \n *EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, February 15, 2017, at 1: 10 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time, or UPON DELIVERY* \n \n \n3 Over the next year or two, I expect real GDP to grow somewhat faster than 2 percent, the \nunemployment rate to continue to  gradually decline, and inflati on to gradually return to the \nFederal Reserve’s 2 percent target.   \nRecent data have been quite co nsistent with this outlook.  Re al GDP for the fourth quarter \nof 2016 grew at a 1.9 percent annual rate, with c ontinued strength in consumer spending offset \nby an export slowdown. Weak exports were, in tu rn, the result of leth argic growth among many \nof our trading partners, as well as a relatively strong dollar.  The labor market report for January \nshowed that the economy added 227,000 new jobs, a nd an unemployment rate of 4.8 percent – a \nreading that is close to most economists’ estimat e of full employment.  What’s more, total and \ncore PCE inflation measures are approaching the Federal Reserve’s 2 percent inflation target, at \n1.6 percent and 1.7 percent, respectively.2   \n While my forecast envisions a continuation of the economic growth we have seen over \nthe past several years, it is important to note that the “starting point” is now quite different than it \nwas a few years ago.  The current 4.8 percent rate  of unemployment is the same as the median \nforecast for unemployment in the long run by Fe deral Reserve policymakers (in the Federal \nReserve’s Summary of Economic Projections, or SEP)3 and only 0.1 percent above my own \nestimate of full employment.  This would suggest that there is limited room for further tightening \nin labor markets before one might see more infla tionary pressures.  Also, inflation is now close \nenough to the Federal Reserve’s 2 percent target that it is possible that we will reach the target as \nsoon as the end of this year.  However, infla tion is not the only consequence of reaching or \nexceeding full employment: Another possibility is th at imbalances will manifest themselves in \nasset prices, such as the price of  commercial real estate.     \n\n \n *EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, February 15, 2017, at 1: 10 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time, or UPON DELIVERY* \n \n \n4  As I will discuss today, with the economy at or approaching both elements of the Federal \nReserve’s dual mandate (price stability and ma ximum sustainable employment), it is my view \nthat it will likely be appropriate to  raise short-term interest rates at least as quickly as suggested \nby the Fed’s current SEP median forecast, and possibly even a bit more rapidly than that forecast.   Importantly, if GDP is  growing faster than potential and we reach both elements of the \ndual mandate, the Federal Reserve risks “overs hooting,” potentially jeopardizing the very \nsignificant progress of the U.S. ec onomy since the financial crisis. \n \nRecent Trends in the Labor Market \n I would like to walk you through the data that unde rpin my perspective.  Figure 1  shows \ninitial claims for unemployment insurance.  In 2005 and 2006, the years immediately preceding \nthe financial crisis, initial cl aims for unemployment insurance were averaging a bit over 300,000.  \nThey rose sharply, more than doubling, during the wo rst of the financial crisis and recession, but \nhave declined quite consistently over the past se veral years.  The most recent weeks’ data have \nseen initial claims hovering around 250,000 – below the level seen before  the last recession. \n As job prospects increase, workers become mo re confident that they will have the ability \nto improve their employment situation.   As overa ll job prospects in the marketplace improve and \nworkers’ confidence rises, employers may well n eed to pay current employees higher wages to \nreduce the incentive for workers to quit in search of wages reflecting the rising market.  As such, \na rising “quits rate” is one gauge  of how workers feel about th e labor market’s robustness and \nmay also be a sign of emerging wage pressures.    \n\n \n *EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, February 15, 2017, at 1: 10 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time, or UPON DELIVERY* \n \n \n5 Figure 2 shows the quits rate. Not surprisingly, th e quits rate plunged during the financial \ncrisis, as employees were primarily concerned with keeping their jobs  in a significantly \ndeteriorating labor market.  As labor markets ha ve improved, the quits rate has risen.  The quits \nrate is still somewhat below the level prior to  the recession – likely due to the aging of the \nworkforce, and the lingering memory of recent concerns about employment security.  But it \nshows a significant improvement in how employees are viewing the labor market. \n Recent payroll employment, shown in Figure 3,  has also been consistent with continued \nstrength in the labor market.  In January, th e economy added 227,000 jobs. Over the past three \nmonths, the average has been 183,000 jobs – only sli ghtly below the average for the last year.  \nThis growth rate will likely produce further declines in the unemployment rate, since \nemployment is growing faster th an the growth in the labor forc e that we expect over time.   \n The widely reported U-3 measure of civilian unemployment, shown in Figure 4 , now \nstands at 4.8 percent, which co incides with the median long-r un unemployment rate expected by \nFOMC participants in the Fed’s SEP.  The char t also shows the Blue Chip consensus forecast \n(the green dots) for the next two years, as well as the SEP median forecast (the dark blue dot) of \nthe path of the unemployment rate.  The SEP me dian and the Blue Chip consensus forecasts \nexpect the unemployment rate to end the year at 4.5 percent.   \nWhile the SEP assumes the unemployment rate w ill level off at that rate in 2018, the Blue \nChip forecasters expect it to continue to fall somewhat below 4.5 percent.  My own forecast is \nmore consistent with the path of the Blue Chip consensus forecast, in that I expect real GDP to \ngrow faster than potential, continuing to pl ace downward pressure on the unemployment rate. \n\n \n *EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, February 15, 2017, at 1: 10 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time, or UPON DELIVERY* \n \n \n6  One feature of the recovery from the Great  Recession has been the decline in the labor \nforce participation rate, shown in Figure 5 .  The labor force participa tion rate is defined as the \npercentage of the working-age population (16 an d older) that is either working or actively \nseeking work.   Over most of the recovery, the labor force participation rate has declined.  At \nfirst, the cyclical respons e of the participation rate had been reinforcing the tre nd associated with \nmore people in the U.S. reaching retirement ag e.  But as the recovery progressed, the trend \ndecline due to an aging population has been offs et by a positive cyclical  response of increasing \nparticipation. Thus, the recent leve lling off of participation, as seen  in the chart, should be read \nas a sign of labor market strength. \n Another feature of the labor market has been the median duration of unemployment, \nshown in Figure 6 .  The median duration of unemploymen t peaked after the Great Recession and \nhas been steadily declining duri ng the recovery.  It is now onl y somewhat higher than it was \nprior to the last recession, a lthough there remain an elevated  number of people who have \nexperienced a long duration of unemployment.4 \n In summary, the labor market has signif icantly improved during the recovery, and my \nown assessment is that there is  very limited slack remaining.  Th e unemployment rate is now at \nthe SEP median forecast for unemployment in th e longer run, and employees are becoming more \ncomfortable switching jobs, and the duration of unemployment has normalized.  Were the \neconomy to grow much faster than potential, employers w ould likely encounter increasing \ndifficulty in finding labor with the skills they need  to grow.  This potential labor shortage will \nplace a premium on workforce development – which is consistent with comments I am \n\n \n *EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, February 15, 2017, at 1: 10 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time, or UPON DELIVERY* \n \n \n7 increasingly hearing from business and govern ment contacts about the need for enhanced \ntraining for potential employees. \n \nEconomic Growth \n Turning to growth, Figure 7  shows the past two quarters of real GDP growth and the \nforecast of real GDP growth over the next four quarters from the Blue Chip consensus forecast. \nWhile the 2016 fourth-quarter real GDP grow th was only 1.9 percent, it followed a very \nstrong 3.5 percent growth rate in the third quarter.  As you can see, the Blue Chip forecast \nexpects real GDP growth above  2 percent. Given my 1.75 per cent estimate of the rate of \npotential growth, the Blue Chip growth fo recast would yield a falling unemployment rate. \n One source of the strength in the outlook is robust consumer spending, which accounts \nfor roughly two-thirds of real GDP.  Consumpti on was strong in the second half of 2016, as \nshown in Figure 8 , and is likely to continue to be re latively robust, reflecting strong payroll \nemployment, continued real income growth, and significant wealth gains over the past several \nyears. \n This growth in consumption is likely to offs et areas of the economy that remain relatively \nweak.  One important source of wea kness has been exports, as shown in Figure 9 .  As monetary \npolicy in the United States has become less acco mmodative, especially relative to our key \ntrading partners, the exchange va lue of the dollar has risen.  This  appreciation, coupled with the \ngeneral weakness of the economies of many U.S. trading partners , has caused real exports to \nslow.   \n\n \n *EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, February 15, 2017, at 1: 10 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time, or UPON DELIVERY* \n \n \n8  Figure 10  shows the SEP median and Blue Chip consensus forecasts for real GDP \ngrowth over the next two years.  The Blue Chip forecast is more optimistic than the SEP, with \nthe median forecast of Federal Open Market Committee participants expecting only 2.1 and 2.0 \npercent real GDP growth in 2017 and 2018, respectiv ely.  My own forecast is more consistent \nwith the Blue Chip consensus forecast, whic h is one reason why I am concerned about a \npotential overshoot of a sustainable fu ll-employment outcome for the economy.   \n Figure 11  provides the SEP median forecast for th e federal funds rate from the December \nFOMC meeting.  The path of interest rates in th e SEP median forecast may well be reasonable if \nthe U.S. economy averages about 2 percent growth  over the next two years.  However, if real \nGDP grows faster than that – as I expect it ma y – it is reasonable to expect additional labor \nmarket tightening, gradual increases in inflati on and, potentially, emerging imbalances in some \nasset markets.  Should this forecast for somewh at faster growth than projected in the SEP \nmaterialize, my own view is that the U.S. economy may need somewhat less monetary policy \naccommodation. \n \nConcluding Observations \n The economy has continued to improve.  Most  forecasters are predicting above-potential \ngrowth and a gradual tightening in  labor markets.  In my view , such a path would justify a \ncontinued, gradual removal of monetary policy a ccommodation at least as quickly as suggested \nby the current SEP, and possibly even a b it more rapidly than that forecast.   \n\n \n *EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, February 15, 2017, at 1: 10 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time, or UPON DELIVERY* \n \n \n9 However, as with any forecast, there remains great uncertainty.  Significant risks to the \nU.S. economy still exist, particularly from cond itions in overseas economies.  Also, the future \nstance of fiscal policy in the United States is still unknown.  Th ese areas of uncertainty can \nmaterially impact the forecast, and by extens ion, the path of policymaking that would be \nconsistent with those forecasts.   \nThank you. \n  \n                                                            \n \n1These have lowered my estimate of the so-called potential rate of GDP growth.  The quite modest growth rate we \nhave seen over the course of the recovery has been accompanied by a significant decline in unemployment.  This \nconfirms that even historically modest 2 percent growth has exceeded the potential growth rate, throughout the recovery.  \n \n2 The target is defined in terms of total PCE inflation. \n \n3See https://www.federalreserve.gov/moneta rypolicy/files/fomcprojtabl20161214.pdf . \n \n4In January, more than 24 percent of the unemployed had been out of work for 27 weeks or longer.  While that is \ndown from a peak of 45 percen t following the recession, it is  still elevated relative to a pre-recession average of 18 \npercent.   ",

Given that the topic of financial stability is rather less es tablished than \nmonetary policy, it is particular ly important to have ongoing opport unities to share analysis and \nperspectives on what works, and what does not, around the world.   \nIn that spirit, I would like to share my own views on the sources of financial instability \nthat have, historically, led to widespread ec onomic disruption not only in large economies like \nthe United States, but in many parts of the world as  well.  I would like to specifically address the \nproblems that arise when the value of commerci al or residential real estate fluctuates \nsignificantly – a dynamic that often leads to episodes of financial instability. \nMy comments should be placed in some very im portant context, however.  First, I am not \nhere today to predict problems, but rather to su ggest we continue working to head them off.  \nSecondly, it is important to not e that we see much safer fina ncial systems in many countries \ntoday, as a result of regulatory e nhancements that were enacted si nce the financial crisis of 2008.  \nMany of the largest banks in the world are much better capitalized and have much more liquidity \nthan they did during the period l eading up to the financial crisis .  This has undoubtedly made the \nglobal financial system more stab le; being both less likely to be th e source of a major disruption, \nand better prepared to withstand an  external shock, should one occur.  \nDespite having a more resilient financia l system, I would suggest that other \nmacroeconomic factors may – unfortunately but pe rhaps inevitably – have some unintended side \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 9:45 P.M. on Tuesday, March 21, 2017 U. S. Eastern Time which is 9:45 A.M. on Wednesday,  \nMarch 22, 2017 in Bali, Indonesia OR UPON DELIVERY \n \n  \n4 \n effects that are less supportive of  financial stability.  For exampl e, very low interest rates in \nmany parts of the world – which were wholly ne cessary to propel the global economy out of the \nGreat Recession, and I strongly supported – may inev itably encourage a “reach for yield” in a \nworld with an increasingly global flow of i nvestment funds.  Demographically, we are seeing \naging populations whose need for reasonable yields  on retirement assets may further incent a \nreach, often in riskier assets.  So while increased regulatory sc rutiny has established important \n“fire breaks” against financial fl are-ups, other trends could actu ally mean more frequent and \npossibly more intense “fires.”  My point is just  that we should not feel overconfident, thinking \nthat strengthening the resilience of global banks is, by itsel f, sufficient.  Further thoughtful \nactions may be called for. \nCertainly, one risk to be mindful  of has been the acceleration of real estate values in some \nparts of the world, and I will use the United St ates as an example in my remarks today. \n \nReal Estate and Financial Stability \nIn the years since the financia l crisis of 2008, there has been a coordinated effort to make \nthe financial sector more stable, given the wide spread difficulties of many of the very large \nfinancial institutions in developed countries durin g the crisis.  Many regulators now require more \ncapital, greater liquidity, and detailed resoluti on plans.  The absence of these defenses \ncontributed to the severity of th e financial crisis, and the disrupti on of the availability of credit \nfrom financial intermediaries contributed to th e dramatic contraction in the broader economy, \namplifying problems.   \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 9:45 P.M. on Tuesday, March 21, 2017 U. S. Eastern Time which is 9:45 A.M. on Wednesday,  \nMarch 22, 2017 in Bali, Indonesia OR UPON DELIVERY \n \n  \n5 \n Make no mistake, the steps taken to increase the stability of financ ial intermediaries and \nthe financial system are vital.  While such st eps will likely mitigate the severity of future \nproblems and recessions, I would however sugge st that they may not be sufficient. \nAs helpful as steps taken to date have been, policymakers and market participants need to \nstay focused on several issues, including what I would consider the root cause of the financial \ncrisis.  I would argue that the root cause of the financial cris is was a significant decline in \ncollateral values of residential and commercial real estate.  This was not particularly unusual; in fact, financial crises of the past 70 years ha ve generally been caused by exposures across the \nbanking system that are correlated and sizeable  – primarily either exposure to foreign-\ndenominated debt that is subject to exchange rate  risk, or exposure to re al estate that becomes \nvulnerable when its value d eclines precipitously.    \nIn the former scenario, the Mexican peso cr isis (in 1994) and Asian financial crisis (in \n1997) are two examples where large exposure to debt denominated in foreign currency became \nproblematic when the home country’s currency de valued, making repayment in foreign currency \nprohibitively expensive.    \nThe other main triggering mechanism has been a rapid and sizeable decline in real estate \nvalues.\n1  Because many financial intermediaries le nd to households and businesses with real \nestate as the collateral, recessi ons that are accompanied by signif icant declines in real estate \nvaluations can lead to broader problems.  Because recessions or rapid changes in asset values \nentail a loss or reduction of income for many households and busi nesses, and a loss of equity that \ncan leave loans underwater, the li kelihood of borrower default increases, adding to problems.  \nExamples include the decline in  real estate values that oc curred during periods of banking \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 9:45 P.M. on Tuesday, March 21, 2017 U.

I \nwould note that over the past roughly 70 years,  there have been 11 recessions in the United \nStates.  Of those recessions, two featured a significant financial stab ility component, where \nbanking problems significantly aggravated  the severity of  the recession.   \nIn the early 1990s recession in the U.S., commerci al real estate values – particularly on \nthe two coasts – declined significantly.  The large losses in commercial real estate values triggered a wave of bank failures and an ensuing credit crunch.  While a large number of banks \nfailed, as shown in Figure 1 , most of the banks involved were re latively small.  In the recession \nthat began in December of 2007, the loss in residen tial real estate values also caused a notable, \nbut not as large, jump in the number of bank fa ilures – but this time the affected banks were \namong the largest.  Figure 2  shows that the value of failed-ba nk assets in real terms was much \nmore severe as a result of the large-bank failures.   \nIn terms of the real economy, both recessions were quite severe.  The unemployment rate \npeaked at 7.8 percent in June 1992; and in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis, the \nunemployment rate peaked at 10 percent (in October 2009).  \n Figure 3  shows that commercial and residential r eal estate prices behaved differently \nduring these two periods.  First, commercial real estate prices have b een more volatile than \nresidential real estate prices, and actually dec lined during both the earlier credit crunch period \nand during the more recent financial crisis.  S econd, commercial real estate prices did diverge \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 9:45 P.M. on Tuesday, March 21, 2017 U. S.

While the credit crunch period had \nmore than 8 percent of commercial real estate  loans as delinquent, there was only a modest \nincrease in the delinquency of residential loans.  In contrast, both commerci al and residential real \nestate loan delinquencies rose sharply during the more recent financial crisis. \n \nLeveraged Banks and Real Estate \n Real estate has a significant financial stabilit y implication because real  estate tends to be \nleveraged by the owners, and those loans re present a significant exposure for financial \ninstitutions that are themselves highly leveraged.   When large losses have occurred because of \ndeclines in real estate values,3 banks have historically shrunk  their lending to meet binding \ncapital-to-assets ratios (given that loans are assets for financial institutions).   \n Such a tightening of lending has several com pounding effects.  In addition to negatively \nimpacting economic activity, tighter lending cond itions also make it more difficult to sell \nimpaired assets, given that pot ential buyers would need  bank loans at a time when banks would \nbe much less willing to lend.  \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 9:45 P.M. on Tuesday, March 21, 2017 U. S. Eastern Time which is 9:45 A.M. on Wednesday,  \nMarch 22, 2017 in Bali, Indonesia OR UPON DELIVERY \n \n  \n8 \n  As Figure 5  illustrates, banking institutions continue to hold a significant share of loans \nrelated to real estate.  I would note the share of commercial real  estate mortgages held by banks \nwith under $50 billion in assets.  However, even the largest banks  have a significant exposure to \nthe real estate sector.4  Importantly, even though the commer cial real estate  cycle has been \ntrending up for some time, the more-recent growth in  lending has been quite significant.  Over \nthe past year, holdings of commercial mortga ges by the banking sector have increased 8.9 \npercent, while bank holdings of multifamily mortga ges have increased 12.0 pe rcent.  This growth \nhas occurred while bank supervisors have been cautioning about the potential risks emanating \nfrom the high valuations in some s ectors of the real estate market. \n  \nRegulatory Response to Real Estate Lending Exposures \n In 2006, commercial real estate guidance was issued by U.S. bank regulators that \nencouraged institutions to improve their risk ma nagement if their exposure to commercial real \nestate became large relative to their risk-based capital.5  As of the end of 2015, as commercial \nreal estate activity and lending b ecame more buoyant in the United States, bank regulators issued \na statement on Prudent Risk Management for Co mmercial Real Estate Lending.  The statement \nreemphasized policy issued in 2006 and other existing guidance, a nd further required enhanced \nrisk management and commensurate capital levels for banks with large commercial real estate \nexposures.  The statement noted that “the ag encies have observed that many CRE asset and \nlending markets are experiencing substantial growth, and that increased competitive pressures are contributing significantly to historically lo w capitalization rates a nd rising property values.”\n6 \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 9:45 P.M. on Tuesday, March 21, 2017 U. S. Eastern Time which is 9:45 A.M. on Wednesday,  \nMarch 22, 2017 in Bali, Indonesia OR UPON DELIVERY \n \n  \n9 \n  Even with the issuance of real estate gui dance, loans held by banks have increased.  \nWhile the risk management of banks with larg e commercial real estate exposures has likely \nimproved, the impact of the guidance on the trajector y of commercial real estate prices appears \nmodest, as Figure 6  shows.  In particular, apartment build ing prices have increased sharply and \nare now significantly above the peak prior to the financial crisis.  While there have been changes \nin home ownership rates and household formation th at may reflect a secula r shift to apartments, \nand large apartment buildings in major United Stat es cities have become  quite trendy (including \nin my area, Boston), the increase in prices may suggest a need for further consideration of the \npotential financial stability implicatio ns if this trend were to continue. \n Other sectors of commercial re al estate have also experienced  significant price increases.  \nThe only sector to show some moderation is reta il, a sector that has be en impacted by the very \nsizable movement from brick-and-mortar retail sales to online retail purchases – a secular trend \nthat may still be playing out.   \n Increases in prices would not be as problematic if rental income were rising \ncommensurately.  However, Figure 7  provides the capitalization or  “cap” rates – defined as net \noperating income7 divided by the price of th e property – for different property types.  All the \ncapitalization rates have fallen substantially, which means that price increases have been \noutpacing growth in net operating income.  Apartm ent capitalization rates are particularly low, \nand are at their lowest point over the past 16 years. \n  As the economy improves, higher market  interest rates would normally slow new \nconstruction as well as valuations in interest-sen sitive sectors.  However, the slow recovery and \nthe possibility that equilibrium interest rates ma y remain relatively low, reflecting demographic \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 9:45 P.M. on Tuesday, March 21, 2017 U. S.

This  would require a greater empha sis on macroprudential tools if \nvaluations became a source of concern.  However, with limited macroprudential tools available \nand only a modest price response to  date to guidance, it is pr udent to keep a healthy, ongoing \nfocus on the sufficiency of these t ools and their ongoing enhancement. \n \nConcluding Observations  \n In summary and conclusion, I would observe that  real estate has play ed an important role \nin past periods of financial instability.  Its us e as collateral by leveraged institutions has factored \ninto significant problems in countries that ha ve experienced a significan t revaluation of real \nestate asset values.  As I have noted today, in the United States the two most significant recent \nperiods of financial instability were accompanied by declines in real estate values that impacted \nfinancial institutions and intensified the business cycle. \n Currently, commercial real estate capitalizati on rates are very low by historical standards, \nmeaning that price increases have been outpaci ng growth in net operating income.  This is \noccurring despite the gradual tighten ing of short-term interest rates and the issuance of real estate \nguidance by bank regulators.   \n Because real estate holdings are widesprea d, and the monetary and macroprudential tools \nfor handling valuation concerns are somewhat li mited, I believe we must acknowledge that the \ncommercial real estate sector has the potential to amplify whatever problems may emerge when \nwe at some point face an economic downturn.  I am not expecting such problems in the near \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 9:45 P.M. on Tuesday, March 21, 2017 U. S.

Although the national index shows relatively little movement in \nresidential real estate prices on average during that period, it is worth noting New England housing prices did experience a decline. See https://www.fdic.gov/bank/historical/history/337_378.pdf .  \n \n3 Banks and banking systems have generally fared poorly when values of large exposures boom and bust. Another \nfacet of the problem for banks is when residential bo rrowers or distressed commercial borrowers become “under \nwater.”  \n   \n4 Also notable is that smaller banks hold a larger share of commercial and multifamily residential mortgages than \nlarge banks, whereas large banks hold a larger share of home mortgages than smaller banks.    \n \n5 See https://www.federalreserve.gov/boa rddocs/srletters/2007/SR0701.htm .  \n \n6 See https://www.federalreserve.gov/new sevents/press/bcreg/20151218a.htm , which includes the following: \n“Recent Supervisory Findings : The agencies have observed that many CRE asset and lending markets are \nexperiencing substantial growth, and that increased competitive pressures are contributing significantly to \nhistorically low capitalization rates and rising property values.

I would like to thank the Bo ston Economic Club for inviting me to share \nmy views on the economy today.  At the outset, let me note as I always do that the views I \nexpress today are my own, not necessarily those of  my colleagues at the Federal Reserve’s Board \nof Governors or on the Federal Open Market Committee (the FOMC). \nAs everyone is likely aware, the FOMC raised the federal funds rate targ et range by 25 \nbasis points at its March meeting.  The committee had previously increased the interest rate \ntarget range just twice in this tightening cycle – in December 2015 and in December 2016.  \nWhile the FOMC has used the term “gradual” in its official policy actions,1 I think it is important \n\n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 11:30 A.M. on Wednesday, March 29, 2017 U.S. Eastern Time, OR UPON DELIVERY \n \n \n2 \n to be reminded that the term gradual is not synonymous with once a year just before Christmas.  \nKidding aside, I view four increases this year as fully consistent w ith comments from FOMC \nparticipants stating that the path of normalizing rates will be gradual.  Clearly, such a pace would \nbe slower than the previous  tightening cycle, beginning in  June of 2004, when the FOMC \nincreased interest rates at each meeting for 17 meetings.2   \nBefore I walk you through the data and analys is, allow me to preview my bottom line.  \nMy own view is that an increase at every other  FOMC meeting3 over the course of this year \ncould and should be the committee’s default, unle ss economic data come in inconsistent with \nforecasts.   \nAt present, the perception seems to be that  the outcome of each FOMC meeting depends \non nuances of incoming data, with  the base case being no change  in rates.  I would like to \nsuggest a somewhat different stance for policy over  this year: an expectation to tighten at every \nother meeting unless incoming data are materially inconsistent with the forecast.  Importantly, \nthis would still be a fully data-dependent approa ch, not a preset path, as  it would hinge on the \nincoming data – but the base case would be four  tightenings, reflecting the strength of the \neconomy that I believe justifies more regul ar normalization of interest rates.   \nSuch a gradual, but more regular, tightening of  rates is consistent with both the improved \n“starting” conditions and the continued good news  about the economy.  As I will describe today, \nit seems likely that the economy will have achieve d both elements of the Federal Reserve’s dual \nmandate by the end of this year – full employment  and stable prices (which the Federal Reserve \ndefines as 2 percent inflation).  Even as the economy approaches the Fed’s dual mandate goals, \nwe still have a federal funds rate that is less than 1 percent, while in flation is approaching 2 \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 11:30 A.M. on Wednesday, March 29, 2017 U.S. Eastern Time, OR UPON DELIVERY \n \n \n3 \n percent, which implies a negative real interest ra te (simply because the inflation rate exceeds the \nnominal interest rate).  While it is not unusual to have negative  real interest rates when the \neconomy is quite weak, as I will show today, it is unusual to still have negative real interest rates \nlate in a recovery when the economy is close to fu ll employment and nearing the inflation target.   \nWith this as overview, I will walk you thr ough my analysis and describe why I believe a \ngradual but more regular move to  normalization is now appropriate. \n \nThe Real Federal Funds Rate \nFigure 1  shows the nearly 50 years of the real federal funds effective rate – which is \nsimply the effective nominal federal funds rate mi nus the core PCE inflation rate.  As the figure \nshows, it is by no means unprecedented to see a negativ e real rate.  In such cases, the real federal \nfunds rate becomes negative because the Federal Reserve lowers interest  rates to help the \neconomy recover from a recession.   \nHowever, the figure shows that the current period is unusual, both in just how negative \nshort-term real rates became and in how long real  rates have remained negative.  In truth, the \nchart understates how negative equilibrium short- term real interest rates would have become, \nbecause the federal funds rate fe ll to nearly its zero lower bound in late 2008.  At that point, \nmovements in the real rate were  determined exclusively by fluctu ations in the inflation rate \nalone.  This is one reason why the Federal Rese rve needed to expand its balance sheet – with \nshort-term nominal rates at th e zero boundary, additional monetary stimulus could be generated \nonly by lowering longer-term interest  rates using a sset purchases. \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 11:30 A.M. on Wednesday, March 29, 2017 U.S. Eastern Time, OR UPON DELIVERY \n \n \n4 \n Figure 2  shows the same chart, but adds an in dication of the unemployment rate at the \ntime the real federal funds rates turned positive,  and the current unemployment rate.  What is \nclear in this figure is th at prior to the last rece ssion, the real federal funds  rate was negative only \nwhile the unemployment rate was well above 5 percent.  Thus, the current period is quite \nunusual, in that the unemployme nt rate is now 4.7 percent (which is my estimate of full \nemployment), but the nominal federal funds eff ective rate is roughly 0.88 percent while the total \nand core PCE measures of inflation are 1.9  a nd 1.7 percent, respectivel y, yielding essentially \nabout negative 1 percen t as the real rate. \nThere are several reasons w hy the federal funds rate has remained so low.   \nFirst, Figure 3  shows real GDP growth smoothed over the previous four quarters.  The \naverage growth rate for each of the seven recoveri es within the timeframe of the chart is also \nindicated.  The figure emphasizes th at during this recovery, real gr owth has remained very close \nto 2 percent.   This is much slower than in the past, and the steady downward trend in the \nrecoveries’ growth rates is clear.  Also, typically we see very str ong growth in the initial stages \nof a recovery, before the real GDP growth ra te slows down as the economy approaches full \nemployment.  In part because of the severity of the financial crisis of 2008, the economy never \nexperienced strong growth during this recovery – but  rather a slow, al beit steady, recovery. \nSecond, we normally see inflationary pressures bu ild up in the latter stage of a recovery.  \nFigure 4  shows total PCE inflation smoothed over the pr evious four quarters.  Again, the current \nperiod has been unusual in how low the inflation rate has been th roughout this recovery.  Despite \nthe economy being at full employment, inflation remains just below the Federal Reserve’s 2 \npercent target.  Normally, we might have expe cted to see more infl ationary pressures. \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 11:30 A.M. on Wednesday, March 29, 2017 U.S. Eastern Time, OR UPON DELIVERY \n \n \n5 \n Thus, with inflation approaching target, a nd a slow but steady recovery, the monetary \npolicy tightening cycle has been  quite gradual.  However, how gradual the normalization process \nshould be depends importantly on wher e one thinks the economy is going. \n \nForecasts of the Economy \nFigure 5  shows the PCE inflation outlook for the Survey of Professional Forecasters, \nwhich surveys roughly 50 private forecasters on th eir expectations for the economy.  The median \nforecast for total PCE inflation is 2 percent in the first three quarters of 2017, before rising above the Federal Reserve’s 2 percent inflation target in the fourth quarter of 2017.   \nWhat is perhaps even more striking is that the shaded region shows the 25 percent of the \nforecasts above and below the median.  Focusing  on the shaded region above the median in the \nsecond half of the forecast, one sees that many fo recasters now expect the inflation rate will rise \nabove 2.2 percent toward the end of  this year and the beginning of  next year (recall that another \n25 percent of forecasts lie at or above, and at or  below, the shaded area – which represents the \ninterquartile range or middle 50 percent).  This  highlights that a fair number of forecasters \nbelieve the focus of the Federal Reserve will sh ift from striving to move up to the 2 percent \ntarget, to worrying about overshooting it.  Moreov er, this pattern is consistent with Federal \nReserve statements that 2 pe rcent is a target, not a ceiling, for the inflation rate.  \nFigure 6  shows that the Survey of Professional Fo recasters anticipates relatively healthy \ngrowth.  While the previous f our quarters have been relativel y choppy, and the revised real GDP \ngrowth for the most recent quarter was just 1.9 percent, survey participants are expecting real GDP growth to exceed 2 percent for each quarter of this year.  The fact that the unemployment \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 11:30 A.M. on Wednesday, March 29, 2017 U.S. Eastern Time, OR UPON DELIVERY \n \n \n6 \n rate has fallen while the economy has been gr owing by roughly 2 percent for most of this \nrecovery implies that the potential GDP growth  rate is somewhat below 2 percent; my own \nestimate is about 1.75 percent.  (Unemployment falls when growth is above the so-called \npotential rate).  So the private forecasters in th e Survey of Professional Forecasters are expecting \ngrowth that is on average nearly 60 basis points fa ster than the estimate of the potential growth \nrate. \nFigure 7  shows the unemployment rate forecast.   Growth above the potential rate \ncontinues to exert downward pressure on unemp loyment.  The median unemployment rate \nforecast falls to 4.5 percent by the end of 2017 in the Survey forecast.  The shaded region again \nshows the 25 percent of the forecasts above and be low the median.  As the forecast stretches into \n2018, there are more survey participants expe cting the unemployment rate to be below 4.4 \npercent, with one-quarter at  or below 4.3 percent.   \nIt is important to place this all in the context of the unemployment rate that is likely to be \nsustainable in the long term.  The Federal Re serve’s Summary of Economic Projections (SEP) \nprovides estimates of what the participants  at this month’s FOMC meeting thought the \nunemployment rate would be in 2017, 2018, 2019, and in the longer run – as shown in the table \nin Figure 8.   The policymakers’ estimates for the longer-run unemployment rate are shaded.  \nThe median estimate for the longer run is 4.7 pe rcent.  The range of estimates is 4.5 to 5.0 \npercent, and if you drop the three highest and lo west estimates, the centr al tendency is 4.7 to 5.0 \npercent.  It is important to note that no FO MC participant currently expects an unemployment \nrate below 4.5 percent to  be sustainable.   \n \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 11:30 A.M. on Wednesday, March 29, 2017 U.S. Eastern Time, OR UPON DELIVERY \n \n \n7 \n Unsustainably Low Unemployment Rates \nI now turn to a discussion of the potentia l costs of an unemployment rate below the \nsustainable rate.  Figure 9  highlights the states that have unemployment rates below 4 percent – \na level well below the national rate that the FOMC participants expect will  be sustainable in the \nlong run.  There are currently 16 states with an un employment rate below 4 percent, and four of \nthem are in New England – Massachusetts, Ma ine, New Hampshire, and Vermont.  Three \nadditional states have rates at 4.0 percent.  \nOf course there are some states with low natu ral rates of unemployment.  For these states, \na rate near 4 percent would not be unusual.  At  the same time, comparing where states are now \nrelative to their 20-year averages, as shown in Figure 10 , we see that 28 states are at least one \npercentage point below their 20-year average.  In addition, 15 states ar e within 0.5 percentage \npoints of their 20-year minimum unemployment rate.4    \nOne of the issues I often hear raised by busin esspeople is the shortage of workers.  A \ncommon complaint I hear is that they would expand their business,  which is doing well, but they \ndo not feel they can find enough staff with the requi site skills to allow them to expand.   I also \nhear about firms considering moving to citie s such as Boston, because the colleges and \nuniversities in the area provide a ready workforce for firms seek ing highly skilled workers. \n The natural response of firm s facing tight labor markets is  to start raising wages.  Figure \n11 shows the average hourly earnings for the country overall, and for two industry groups –\nconstruction, and professional and business serv ices.  These industries show that as labor \nmarkets have become tighter, ea rnings have been rising.    \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 11:30 A.M. on Wednesday, March 29, 2017 U.S. Eastern Time, OR UPON DELIVERY \n \n \n8 \n  Rising wages are likely a factor behind some private forecasters’ expe ctations of inflation \nexceeding 2 percent next year.  However, ther e are concerns beyond wage and price inflation, \nsince an overheating economy can le ad to other instabilities.    \nFigure 12  shows the price to earn ings (P/E) ratios for the S&P 500 since 1990.  The high \nP/E ratio may reflect that after-ta x earnings are likely to be much  stronger in the future; however, \nit might also be an indication of growing invest or confidence, which of course may or may not \nbe ratified over time. \nFigure 13  shows the spread betw een high-yield corporate bonds and the 10-year \nTreasury rate since 1995.  Recent academic studies have found that very tight spreads for higher-\nrisk bonds can be an indication of potential problems in the future.5  The current high-yield \nspread is now below the twenty-plus year aver age and trending lower, somewhat unusual for an \nenvironment when monetary policy has entered a tightening phase. \nFigure 14  shows the capitalization rate for multifamily housing.  The capitalization rate – \nnet operating income relative to the price paid fo r the property – is unusually low.  While there \nare secular changes in housing preferences, refl ecting both demographic tr ends and a persistent \nhangover from the housing crisis, such low cap ra tes can call into question commercial real \nestate valuations should the econom y experience a shock or slow-down. \nAll in all, a potentially overheating econom y may be reflected in movements in the \noverall price level, in asset pr ices, or both.  If the economy ru ns too hot, it could ultimately \nrequire a less gradual monetary policy adjustme nt – which could potentially place at risk the \nsignificant progress the economy and labor mark et have made since the Great Recession. \n \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 11:30 A.M. on Wednesday, March 29, 2017 U.S. Eastern Time, OR UPON DELIVERY \n \n \n9 \n Concluding Observations \nRecent economic reports have been consistent  with continued steady improvement in the \neconomy.  The most recent U.S. employment repo rt featured payroll employment growing by \n235,000, the unemployment rate declining by 0.1 per centage points to 4.7 percent, and an \nincrease in average hourly earnings of 2.8 percen t.  With the economy at my estimate of full \nemployment, and with wages and pr ices rising, in my vi ew it was entirely appropriate to raise the \nfederal funds rate target range  by 25 basis points in March. \nLooking ahead over the course of this year, I be lieve it is likely to be appropriate for the \nFOMC to raise rates at a more regular  – though still gradual  – pace.  With the nominal rate still \nlow and inflation approaching 2 percent, the resu lt is a real rate below zero.  With the real \neffective federal funds rate still quite negative, I consid er it appropriate to m ove the nominal rate \n– gradually but more regularly – so th e real rate becomes less negative.   \nAs some of my colleagues on the FOMC have  emphasized, conditions do not require the \nFOMC to rush policy actions.  With real GDP growth expected to be only modestly above 2 \npercent and total inflation in the short run expect ed to just reach the Federal Reserve’s 2 percent \ntarget, I certainly believe the FOMC can be gradual in removing accommodation.  Nonetheless, \nit is important to avoid creating an over-hot economy that could require a more rapid tightening \nof monetary policy – which would place at ri sk the economic improvements seen to date. \nThank you. \n                                                            \n1 See https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevent s/pressreleases/monetary20170315a.htm .  \n \n2 See https://www.federalreserve.gov /monetarypolicy/openmarket.htm.  \n \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 11:30 A.M. on Wednesday, March 29, 2017 U.S. Eastern Time, OR UPON DELIVERY \n \n \n10 \n                                                                                                                                                                                                    \n3 FOMC meetings with a press conference give an opport unity to better explain the data and the rationale of the \ndecision; however, the Committee may decide on an interest rate change at any FOMC meeting if the data determine \nso.    \n4 The most recent 240 months were used to calculate th e 20-year average – from March 1997 through February \n2017.

I would like to thank the Le vy Economics Institute of Bard College for \ninviting me to share my perspectives today.  At the outset, let me note as I always do that the \nviews I express today are my own, not necessari ly those of my colleagues at the Federal \nReserve’s Board of Governors or on the Fede ral Open Market Committee (the FOMC).  \n \nIntroduction and Overview \nThe economy has continued to improve – and with the labor market achieving measures \nassociated with full employment, and inflation now fluctuating around1 the Federal Reserve’s 2 \n\n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 12:30 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Wednesday, April 19, 2017 OR UPON DELIVERY \n \n  \n2 \n percent inflation target, some observers of th e macroeconomy and monetary policy have turned \ntheir attention to a policy tool actively deployed in the United States during the financial crisis: \nthe Federal Reserve’s balance sheet.   \nAs short-term interest rate s approached zero in  2008, it became difficult for monetary \npolicy to further stimulate th e economy through short-term rates alone.  Policymakers were \nlargely constrained from further reductions by the zero boundary.  However, by purchasing long-\nterm Treasury securities and agency mortgage-b acked securities – and thereby increasing the size \nof the Fed’s balance sheet – l ong-term rates could be reduced.  Lower rates provided additional \nneeded stimulus, encouraging firms and individu als to incur more long-term funding and spur \neconomic activity that was desperately needed  in the Great Recessi on and the long, slow \nrecovery that followed. \nWhile asset purchases were deployed during a period of extraordinary economic distress, \nnow that the gradual normalization of moneta ry policy is underway it is a good time to re-\nevaluate the costs and benefits  of a large balance sheet.  I would note that the FOMC has \npublished a statement on its policy no rmalization principles and plans.2 \nMany observers suggest that central banks’ use of their balance shee ts should be limited \nsolely as a response to the type of severe econo mic conditions that occurred during the financial \ncrisis and in its aftermath.  Others suggest – as  I will today – that stru ctural changes in the \nmacroeconomy may necessitate more frequent use of large scale asset purchases during \nrecessions.   \nThis latter view hinges on the argument that the combination of low inflation, low rates \nof productivity growth, and sl ow population growth may imply an economy where normal or \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 12:30 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Wednesday, April 19, 2017 OR UPON DELIVERY \n \n  \n3 \n equilibrium short-term interest rates remain rela tively low by historical standards, even once the \neconomy has fully normalized.  This notion of lower equilibrium rates has in fact been reflected \nby the policymakers partic ipating in the Federal Reserve’s Summary of Economic Projections \n(SEP).  The median forecast of Fed policymakers in March was that in th e longer run, the federal \nfunds rate was likely to be only 3 percent, down more than a percentage point from assessments \nby Fed policymakers from a few years ago.   \nLow equilibrium rates would have noteworthy implications in a downturn.  Consider the \nfact that during most of the previous economic downturns, th e Federal Reserve has reduced \ninterest rates by substantially more than 300 basi s points.  So a 3 percent federal funds rate \nwould imply a high probability that  short-term interest rates woul d have to be lowered again to \nzero in response to future recessions.  As a resu lt, the central bank may ne ed to again deploy its \nbalance sheet to augment traditional policy, sp ur economic activity, and achieve its mandates \nfrom Congress associated with em ployment and price stability.   \nOne important implication, then, is that the exit from a large balance sheet may not prove \nto be a one-time event.  So if  done appropriately, the exit from  the current large balance sheet \ncan serve as an important “playbook” for future recovery periods should it prove necessary. \nIn contrast to balance sheet use of this sort, central banks  have significant historical \nexperience with moving short-term interest ra tes to achieve macroeconomic objectives.  As a \nconsequence, it makes sense to continue to use sh ort-term interest rates as the primary tool for \nmonetary policy.  If central bank balance sheet activity is to be a secondary tool, then the exit \nfrom a large balance sheet should be conducted in ways that mainta in the primacy of using short-\nterm interest rates to either slow  down or stimulate the economy.   \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 12:30 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Wednesday, April 19, 2017 OR UPON DELIVERY \n \n  \n4 \n To preview my argument a bit, while the FOMC  is still carefully considering its balance \nsheet exit strategy, in my own view an ideal po licy would take a very gradual approach to \nbalance-sheet reduction.  In my view that process could begin rela tively soon and should not \nsignificantly alter the FOMC’s c ontinuing gradual normalization of short-term interest rates.  \nThat is, by initially retiring only a small percen tage of maturing securities, and then very \ngradually shrinking the volume of the securities being reinvested, the tightening of short-term \ninterest rates should not need to  be much different than it woul d be in the absence of shrinking \nthe balance sheet. \nToday, I will cover a bit of background and anal ysis on the use of th e balance sheet as a \nmonetary policy tool.  I will then discuss why I believe balance-sheet activity will likely continue \nto be deployed as a monetary po licy tool in recessions, as long  as short-term interest rates \nnormalize at relatively low levels.  Low infla tion and low growth in both the working-age \npopulation and in productivity seem likely for many developed economies in the future, so balance sheet expansions – and ex its – are likely to become more  standard monetary policy tools \naround the world.   \n \nBackground on Balance Sheet Activity \n By way of background, Figure 1  shows the overnight policy rates for the United States, \nEurope, and Japan.  During the fina ncial crisis, the Federal Reserve reduced short-term interest \nrates rapidly in the U.S., as the economy slowed  during the recession.  Inte rest rates were pushed \neventually to zero as the financial problems asso ciated with the Lehman failure led the central \nbank to deploy a large increase in reserves to counteract signifi cant disruptions in short-term \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 12:30 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Wednesday, April 19, 2017 OR UPON DELIVERY \n \n  \n5 \n financial markets, bringing short-term rates to  the effective lower bound.  The European Central \nBank kept short-term rates somewhat higher fo r longer, but eventually also pushed their \nrefinancing rate to zero.  And the Bank of Japan, which had set ra tes very low even prior to the \nGreat Recession, has maintained their call rate close to zero  or slightly negative.   \nThe United States has been the first country  to begin the process of exiting from \nextraordinary monetary accommodation, raising short- term interest rates as a first step in the \nnormalization process.  The Federal Reserve made an initial increase in short-term interest rates in December 2015, followed by additional 25 basis point increases in December 2016 and in March 2017.  In contrast, both Europe and Japan have yet to reach the point of raising their \nhistorically low short-term interest rates. \n Figure 2 highlights the use of central bank balanc e sheet expansion in the United States, \nEurope, and Japan.  As you can see, all three cent ral banks significantly increased their balance \nsheets, as they all found loweri ng short-term interest rates in sufficient to rekindle economic \ngrowth and slow disinflation.  The Federal Reserv e’s balance sheet first began to increase as the \nfinancial crisis spread to a severe macroeconomic  crisis.  By indexing th e changes in the three \nbalance sheets to their levels in 2000, the figure shows that the balance-sheet expansion in the \nU.S. was much more aggressive than the other ce ntral banks’ in the fall of 2008.  However, when \nviewed relative to GDP, Figure 3  shows that Japan especially ne eded to do more, relative to the \nsize of its economy.   \nImportantly, perhaps because it was more aggr essive with monetary  easing initially, the \nUnited States has recovered more quickly.  The Fe d’s balance sheet expansion stopped in 2014.     \nIn contrast, both Japan and Europe have not  yet stopped expanding their balance sheets. \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 12:30 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Wednesday, April 19, 2017 OR UPON DELIVERY \n \n  \n6 \n  Figure 4  shows 10-year government bond yields in  the United States, France, Germany, \nand Japan since 2000.  Long-term rates have fallen, for a variety of reasons.  One factor was that \nthe balance sheets of central ba nks expanded – with purchases of  longer-term Treasury securities \nand agency mortgage-backed securities in the U.S., and with purchases of a wider set of assets in \nEurope and Japan.  In the U.S., rates on 10-year  Treasury securities ha ve generally remained \nabove 2 percent once the Federal Reserve stopp ed expanding its balance sheet, while 10-year \nrates continued to fall in  Japan, Germany and France, as Europe and Japan continued to purchase \nassets. \n \nThe Balance Sheet as a Monetary Policy Tool \n As I noted in my introduction, some obser vers consider balance-sheet use as an \nextraordinary tool, deployed as an emergency res ponse to the severity of the financial crisis.  \nHowever, other observers suggest th at if low, short-term interest rates are likely a feature of the \neconomy even when monetary policy is normali zed, it is possible that  expanding the balance \nsheets of central banks will become a tool more commonly utilized during recessions. \n Figure 5  shows how the participants  at FOMC meetings have  viewed the likely longer-\nrun value of the federal funds rate.  On a quart erly basis, FOMC par ticipants are asked to \nforecast a variety of economic variables, including  the federal funds rate they expect in the \nlonger run.  As the figure shows, policymakers’ me dian view of the longer-run federal funds rate \nas recently as 2012 was that it was expected to be over 4 percen t.  However, that view has \nevolved significantly, with the median view in Ma rch of this year being for a federal funds rate \nof only 3 percent in  the longer run. \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 12:30 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Wednesday, April 19, 2017 OR UPON DELIVERY \n \n  \n7 \n The shaded band on the figure represents the central tendency, which provides the range \nof views of the participants omitting the top three and bottom three estimates.  It is notable that \nin the March projections, while the median was 3 percent, many participants viewed the federal \nfunds rate as likely to be below 3 percent in th e longer run.  Assuming that  the Federal Reserve is \nsuccessful in achieving 2 percent in flation in the longer run, a nomina l rate of 3 percent implies a \nreal federal funds rate of only 1 percent. \n Figure 6  provides some perspective on a longer-run federal funds rate of 3 percent.  \nDuring recessions, it is not unusual for the federal funds rate target to be cut by more than 3 \npercentage points; in fact, in many recessions, the federal funds ra te target was reduced by more \nthan 5 percentage points.  However, going into most  recessions the federal funds rate was higher \nthan 5 percent, and as a result, despite the sh arp declines the rate did not approach zero. \n Figure 7  provides similar information in tabular form.  It emphasizes that other than \nduring the 1960 recession, all of the decreases in  nominal federal funds rates have exceeded 3 \npercentage points.  On average, from the peak to  the trough of interest rate s, the declines average \nroughly 7 percentage points. \n Figure 8  shows the real federal funds rate, which is simply calculated  by subtracting the \ncore PCE inflation rate from the nominal federal funds effective rate.  Wh ile there are periods of \nnegative real federal funds rates – particularly after severe re cessions – the most recent period \nhas featured negative real federal funds rates for an extended period of time.  If the SEP median \nforecast is correct about the possibi lity of a real federal funds rate  of only 1 percent in the long-\nrun, it will be much more common for short-term real interest rates to  become negative during \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 12:30 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Wednesday, April 19, 2017 OR UPON DELIVERY \n \n  \n8 \n recessions, when the Federal Reserve normally r eacts by lowering short-term nominal interest \nrates.   \n Figure 9  provides similar information as Figure 7, but in tabular form.  Parenthetically, it \nis worth noting that one reason the real rate could become so  negative in the 1974 recession is \nbecause the inflation rate was so high.  During much of the recent recovery, with the nominal \ninterest rate lodged close to zero, the real rate was determined by the value of the inflation rate.  \nBut notably, a real short-term rate close to nega tive 2 percent was not sufficient to generate a \nrapid recovery. \n The clear implication of very low short-term in terest rates is that there will be a limited \nbuffer for monetary policy to respond to economic slowdowns.  I believe that real short-term \nfederal funds rates are likely to be negative more frequently, and the nominal  federal funds rate \nis likely to reach zero more frequently.  And if policy rates do remain as low as currently \nexpected, it is likely to be mo re common for central banks to engage in asset purchases to \nstimulate the economy by re ducing longer-term rates. \n \nReasons for Low Prevailing Rates \n Several economic factors have contributed to the widespread  expectation of lower short-\nterm rates prevailing in the foreseeable future.  The inflation rate, shown in Figure 10 , has \nfollowed a very different pattern since the mid-1990s.  For much of the 1970s and 1980s, the inflation rate was above 3 per cent.  However, since the mid-1990s, inflation has generally \nfluctuated in a band much closer  to 2 percent.  And for much of the period since the Great \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 12:30 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Wednesday, April 19, 2017 OR UPON DELIVERY \n \n  \n9 \n Recession, the inflation rate has be en below the Federal Reserve’s 2 percent target.  While this \nlow and stable inflation rate has been beneficial  in many respects, it has also provided less room \nfor interest rates to fall before hitting zero.  T hus, there may be a trade-off with a low inflation \ntarget that policymakers may be willing to make, depending on their willingness to manipulate \nthe balance sheet. \n Two other factors that lead to lower equili brium rates involve an important link between \nthe economy’s potential growth rate, and real intere st rates.  Anything that  lowers the potential \nrate of growth in the economy will both lower the incentive to invest (as real returns to investing \nwill fall on average with lower potential growth) and increase the incentive to save (as lower \nfuture returns on savings imply a greater need to save today) .  Lower investment demand and \nhigher savings both engender lower real rates of inte rest, so a fall in the potential growth rate will \ngenerally lead to a fall in equilibrium real interest rates.   \n Several other recent features have contributed to a lower ra te of potential growth in the \neconomy.  One such feature is a reduction in productivity growth, highlighted in Figure 11 .  \nWhile quarter-to-quarter fluctuations in produc tivity are quite volatile, the smoothed productivity \ngrowth over the last several ye ars has been noticeably lower than has been experienced over \nmuch of the previous 50 years.  Lower productivity growth implies lo wer real interest rates, and \nagain this would suggest less of an inte rest-rate buffer during economic downturns. \n Another factor impacting potential growth is  the change in demographics in the United \nStates.  The robust birth rates, immigration rates, and movement of women into the labor force \ncontributed to significant increases in the U.S. labor force – trends which have become much \nmore muted of late, as shown in Figure 12 .  Slower growth in th e labor force lowers the \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 12:30 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Wednesday, April 19, 2017 OR UPON DELIVERY \n \n  \n10 \n potential growth rate of the economy and, through the channels I just articulated, implies a lower \nreal interest rate.3  And, given the strong downward trend sh own in the figure, slower labor force \ngrowth is expected to continue.   \n These factors are not unique to the Un ited States.  Many developed countries are \nexperiencing low inflation rates and demographic trends that have  resulted in lower short-term \ninterest rates.  This implies that tools other than  movements in short-term interest rates, such as \nbalance-sheet tools, are likely to be a more co mmon and necessary feature of monetary policy in \ncombating future recessions in many economies around the world.    \n \nConcluding Observations  \n While the extensive use of central bank balance sheets has been a distinguishing feature \nof the most recent downturn and slow recovery, I see it as quite likely that this tool will be \nnecessary in future economic downturns.  Unless  productivity growth and demographic trends \nchange, or monetary policymakers set a higher infl ation target, the feasible reductions in short-\nterm rates to combat recessions will not be suffici ent.  Thus, monetary policymakers are likely to \nneed to use balance-sheet tools. \n If monetary policy is to rely primarily on s hort-term interest rates to normalize policy, as \nseems prudent given the historic al experience, in my view th e Federal Reserve should adopt \nbalance sheet exit strategies that reinforce the pr imacy of interest rate policy.  Starting to shrink \nthe balance sheet earlier – and doing so in a very  gradual fashion – implie s very little reduction \nin the degree of monetary stimulus coming from the U.S. central bank’s balance sheet.  This, in \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 12:30 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Wednesday, April 19, 2017 OR UPON DELIVERY \n \n  \n11 \n turn, will allow policymakers to focus on gradual in creases in the federal funds rate target as the \nprimary mechanism for normalizing moneta ry policy and calibrating the economy.   \n Thank you.  \n \n \n                                                            \n \n1 Measured by the core Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index or PCE, inflation is at 1.8 percent, but \nmeasured by total PCE inflation is just over 2 percent, specifically 2.1 percent.    \n \n2 See https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/monetary/20140917c.htm . \n \n3 With a slower growth in the labor force, capital become s relatively less scarce and therefore the return on capital \ndecreases.

I would like to thank the S tern School of Business  for inviting me to \nshare my perspectives today.  Before I begin , let me note as I always do that the views I express \ntoday are my own, not necessarily those of my colleagues  at the Federal Reserve’s Board of \nGovernors or on the Federal Open Market Committ ee (the FOMC).  \n As with almost any market where prices have risen quickly , commercial real estate \npresents  a variety of positive fundamentals .  While my remarks today focus on commercial real \nestate, other asset classes have experienced increases in valuation, including the equity markets \n\n\n \nEMBARGOED UNTIL 1 :05 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time on  Tuesday, May 9, 2017 OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n \n \n2 \n and certain fixed -income markets.  I would like to begin my talk today by  highlighting some of \nthe positive f undamentals or  strong “tailwinds. ”   \nFirst, macroeconomic conditions during this economic recovery have been favorable  in \nsome respects .  Inflation has remained quite stable , fluctuating around 2 percent.  M onetary \npolicy has been quite accommodative, with the federal funds rate still quite low by historical \nstandards , and the central bank maintaining an enlarged balance sheet that has held down longer -\nterm rates.   \nA second favorable factor is the relative strength in the United States compared with the \nrest of the world.  Many f oreign economies ’ recoveries  have lagg ed behind the U .S., where we \nhave seen stabl e and solid, if unspectacular , economic growth .  These relative international \nconditions have made real estate opportunities in the United States  appear quite attractive to \nforeign investors . \nA third favorable contributor  has been a variety of demographic factors that I will only \nbriefly discuss  today .  But suffice it to say , trends toward greater urbanization and a preference \namong  the large cohort  of millennials  to seek multifamily accommodation s have provided \nsupport for multifamily housing in particular.  \nDespite these favorable conditions  for commercial real estate, it is probably useful to \nconsider what could cause a reversal in commercial real estate prices.  I will focus on just a few \npotential concerns.   \nThe first involves  potential changes to government -sponsored enterprise s or GSE s.  It is \nwell known that the GSEs play a very important role in the single -family housing market.  \n\n \nEMBARGOED UNTIL 1 :05 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time on  Tuesday, May 9, 2017 OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n \n \n3 \n However, it is somewhat less well known outside of the real estate industry how active the GSEs \nare in multifamily  housing.  Given that GSEs and their s ecurit ized vehicles currently hold or \nguarantee 44 percent of multifamily loans , any GSE  reform proposal that caused them to alter \ntheir participation in  this market would likely leave a significant imprint on the industry.  \nA second concern could be that an economic downturn might have  a disproportionate \nimpact on commercial real estate.  V ery significant declines in commer cial real estate values  \nwere associated with both the 1990 and 2007 recessions .  The occurrence of this type of event is \nactually part of the 2017 “stress tests”  that the largest banks are now undergoing.  \nA third potential concern  could arise  if inflation and interest rates moved much higher , \nand at a faster pace.  While that is certainly not my expectation, and is not in the projections of FOMC participants, some priva te-sector forecasters have been placing odds o n such an outcome \nso that it is worth considering.  \nWhile I do not expect that a downturn in commercial real estate prices would by itself \ncause a significant problem for the economy, in some past recessions such an occurrence  has \npropagated an initial adverse shock – and by constraining financial intermediaries, made the \nextent of the subsequent economic downturn more severe for a wide range of households and businesses that depend on intermediaries for credi t.\n1  Given the very low capitalization or “cap” \nrates2 currently seen in the commercial real estate sector , it is important for  holders of  debt or \nequity related to commercial real estate (CRE)  to carefully consider how their positions would be \nimpacted if tailwinds were to give way to headwinds.  And perhaps most importantly, in my view the regulatory community must also remain attuned to developments, understand how a \n\n \nEMBARGOED UNTIL 1 :05 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time on  Tuesday, May 9, 2017 OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n \n \n4 \n reversal may propagate th rough the financial system, and consider whether the system is resilient \nenough to withstand such shocks, should they occur.   \n \nDomestic Macroeconomic Factors S upporting U .S. Commercial R eal Estate  \n Figure 1  shows the strength of the rebound in commercial real estate prices following  the \nfinancial crisis.  While all four categories of commercial real estate have seen a substantial \nrebound in prices, the rebound in multifamily housing  is particularly notable .  The chart is \nindexed to the price peaks prior to the financial crisis, and it shows that multifamily commercial real estate has surpassed the peak from prior to the financial crisis.  In fact, by this measure \nmultifamily prices are now more than 25 percen t higher than the pre -crisis peak.  \n There are a number of factors that have been particularly helpful for the commercial real \nestate recovery.  Figure 2  shows  the federal funds rate  – the short -term interbank rate targeted by \ncentral bank monetary policy  – for the period since 2000.  As a result of the severity of the \nfinancial crisis , policymakers brought short -term rates down to zero.  As the economy has \nrecovered from that very severe recession , the FOMC  has raised the federal funds target to its \ncurrent  range of 75 to 100 basis points .  However, the rate remains quite low by historical \nstandards , as do other rates of both short and longer maturity .  For interest -sensitive sectors, such \nas commercial real estate, this has no doubt contributed to the recov ery. \n Figure 3  shows the assets on the Federal Reserve’s  balance sheet.  Prior to 2008, the \nFed’s balance sheet  was rarely discussed , since i t increased only very gradually .  During the \nfinancial crisis  and its aftermath , the Federal Reserve provided vital liquidity programs and \n\n \nEMBARGOED UNTIL 1 :05 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time on  Tuesday, May 9, 2017 OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n \n \n5 \n purchased long- term Treasury securities and agency mortgage -backed securities  in order to \ncreate appropriately accommodative conditions .  With short -term interest rates effectively at \nzero, it was difficult to further influence  long -term rates using traditional monetary  tools, so the \nFederal Reserve’s large -scale asset purchase program s were implemented  to further lower long -\nterm rates.  Again, this policy action was inherently supportive of interest -sensitive sectors  like \nreal estate.  \n Figure 4  shows the personal consumption expenditure s (PCE) measure of total  inflation , \nas well as the core PCE  measure of inflation.  Unlike the 1970s, inflation over the past two \ndecades has been quite stable, fluctuating around 2 percent.3  One reason for monetary policy to \nremain accommodative for so long has been that inflation has only gradually returned to the \nFederal Reserve’s  2 percent target.  A nd, of course, a  low and stable inflation  rate makes it much \neasier to make longer -term investments.  \n \nInternational Factors S upporting U .S. Commercial R eal E state  \n As mentioned in my opening summary , international conditions have made the  United \nStates  an attractive place to invest in commercial real  estate.   Figure 5  shows the unemployment \nrate in the U .S. compared to the Euro A rea.  While the U.S. recovery has exhibited  only modest \ngrowth compared to previous  recoveries, the unemployment rate – at 4. 4 percent – is now below \nmy own estimate (4.7 perc ent) of the so -called full employment level .  In contrast, much of the \ndeveloped world has yet to significantly recover, with Euro Area  unemployment – which was \n\n \nEMBARGOED UNTIL 1 :05 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time on  Tuesday, May 9, 2017 OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n \n \n6 \n about even with the U.S. in late 2009 – now approximately double that of the United States4 and \nstill well above pre -recession lows.  \nThe rather weak recover y in many developed countries and the prevalence of very low \ninflation rates ha ve caused central banks to continue to hold short -term interest rates near zero – \nand to expand  their balance s heets.  As Figure 6  shows, the se policies by central banks have \ncontributed to low longer -term yields, with 10- year Treasur y yields in the United States currently \naround 2.3 percent , while 10- year government rates in Japan, Germany , and France are much \nlower.  \n These very low short - and long -term interest rates have caused some international \ninstitutional investors to look abroad to generate higher returns.  Given the relatively strong  U.S. \neconomy, some of these investors have come to view U.S. commercial real estate investments as \nattractive ways to generate higher returns.  \n \nDemographic Trends  \n Demographic trends have also provided a  favorable tailwind for some  commercial real \nestate, particularly multifamily  projects .  The increased  movement to urbanize in the United \nStates , due to the many amenities provided by cities  for those families with rising incomes , has \nbeen supportive of commercial real estate.  Certainly , my home town of Boston has benefited \nfrom the trend  of firms and households moving  to increasingly attractive cit y environments .  \n \n\n \nEMBARGOED UNTIL 1 :05 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time on  Tuesday, May 9, 2017 OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n \n \n7 \n  Figure 7  shows two other favorable trends for multifamily commercial real estate.  On \nthe left is the median age of males and females when first married.  Because a first home \npurchase is often related to  marriage, a later marriage age results in more young adults living in \nmultifamily rather than single -family homes.  The figure on the right shows the number of 25-  to \n34-year-old head -of-households , over time.  The demographic  trends that have expanded this age \ngroup are a positive for multifamily real estate.  \n These charts suggest  that it should not be surprising that trends have supported rising \ncommercial real estate prices.  These  macroeconomic and demographic trends are qualitatively \nconsistent with the strong commercial real estate markets we see in many parts of the country.  \nHowever, it is harder to know if these conditions warrant the extent  of price increase we have \nseen to date.  We all know that for almost any asset category, p ositive trends can sometimes \nevolve into prices that increase more than fundamentals justify .  It is very hard to distinguish \nhow much of the price gain is  the result of the favorable fundamentals, and how much reflects an \nabundance of opt imism by investors.  S o the next section of my talk explores  the possibility that \nlow cap rates could experience a significant reversal.  \n \nGSE Reform and Multifamily  Real E state  \n One potential risk to multifamily commercial real estate  prices  could come from GSE \nreform.  While the timing and nature of such reform s are quite uncertain, the GSEs have been \nexpanding their role in the multifamily mortgage market.  Figure 8  illustrates that the GSE s, \nincluding the ir securitized  vehicles, hold or guarantee approximately 44 percent of multifamily \n\n \nEMBARGOED UNTIL 1 :05 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time on  Tuesday, May 9, 2017 OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n \n \n8 \n loans outstanding, and th eir role has increased notabl y over the past two decades.   GSE holdings \nof multifamily  loans outstanding now materially exceed th ose of the banking sector.  \n The multifamily segment is also a significant source of income for the GSEs.  Figure 9  \nprovides the percentage of income that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac derive from  their activities \nin the multifamily commercial real estate  mortgage market .  Clearly , both GSEs earn a \nsignificant share of income from the multifamily segment of their business .5  \nA potential concern would be that with high and rising prices  for multifamily commercial \nreal estate, policymakers  looking to reform  the GSEs  might look at the GS Es’ large and growing \nfootprint in the market  and ask whether this level of government -sponsored exposure is safe, and \nwhether that level of government support is appropriate .  Whether , or how , future reform \nproposals will impact commercial real estate is unclear  – but a potential  and significant shock to \nthis sector of the commercial real estate market could occur if proposals require the GSEs to \nreduce their holdings of multifamily loans.  \n \nExample f rom Bank Stress Tests  \nThe largest banks in the United States undergo stress tests annually to see if they have \nsufficient capital to weather a severe economic shock.  The 2017 stress test includes , among \nother things, a scenario of a significant decline in commercial real estate prices  – as shown in \nFigure 10 .  The severely adverse stress- test scenario includes more than a doubling of the \ncurrent unemployment rate , and declines in aggregate commercial real estate prices of 3 5 percent  \nthrough the first quarter of 2019.6  Consistent with my comments earlier , the stress tests also \n\n \nEMBARGOED UNTIL 1 :05 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time on  Tuesday, May 9, 2017 OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n \n \n9 \n suggest that in their own calculations, banks take into account that these losses could be \nconcentrated in areas that have experienced rapid price gains  – specifically noting multifamily \nproperties.7 \nWhile this is only a hypothetica l scenario, it is designed to be consistent with economic \nrelationships that have occurred historically.  Both the 1990 and the 2007 recessions exhibited  very significant declines in commercial real estate prices that aggravated significant negative shocks to the economy.  The potential  exists for  commercial real estate price declines to \nsignificantly weaken the economy  – particularly by weakening institutions  that are critical to the \ncredit extension vital to the  economy , and that have large and leveraged  exposure to CRE .  As a \nresult,  many regulators have increased their focus on commercial real estate as valuations have \nrisen substantially . \nHow likely is a  recession  as severe as in the stress test  scenario ?  And w hat are the \nconditions that might lead to  a large shock to commercial real estate?   It is indeed worth \nconsidering what type of economic conditions might lead to an eventual negative shock of the \nsort that is being modeled in the stress test.  While the  severely adverse stress- test scenario does \nnot have a probability attached to it, it is possible to look at private sector forecasts that provide probability assessments of some “ tail events ” and related conditions, as well as their most likely \noutcome.   \nFigure 1 1 provides the information from the Survey of Professional  Forecasters  – \nroughly 50 private sector forecasters  – about their assessment of the probability of core PCE \ninflation rising above 2.5 percent.  The  forecasters  assess a probability of over 10 percent for this \nyear and over 20 percent for 2018.    \n\n \nEMBARGOED UNTIL 1 :05 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time on  Tuesday, May 9, 2017 OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n \n \n10 \n Figure 1 2 provides one reason for this elevated risk.  The private forecasters see a \nroughly 10 percent probability of unemployment declining below 4 percent.   Such an overheated \neconomy would likely be accompanied by  higher inflation, which in turn would likely elicit  \nhigher interest rates.  \n While  the downward trend in Figure 13  of long -term Treasury yields and multifamily \ncap rates has been quite favorable, an overheated economy could risk a significant reversal.  This \nwould cause investors to demand much higher 10 -year Treasury rates to compensate for the \npotential of higher inflation.  Since multifamily rents would likely be slow to respond, significant \ndeclines in commercial real estate prices could result.8 \n \nConclu ding Observations  \nFigure 14  shows capitalization rates  by commercial real estate sectors.  A very low cap \nrate reflects a high valuation of real estate relative to net operating income.  Valuations have \nrisen substantially  by historical standards.  Certainly a number of positive factors account for \nsome of the elevated  valuations, but at such times it is worth asking  what could go wrong.  \n  While an overheated economy followed by a recession is only one  possible scenario,  and \ncertainly not my prediction, it helps to illustrate one way in which low cap rates might be of  \nconcern  in the event of such a reversal.  While al l market participan ts should consider how their \npositions would be impacted by adverse scenarios, Figure 15  shows that leveraged institutions \nand government -sponsored entities have significant exposures to commercial real estate.   In the \n\n \nEMBARGOED UNTIL 1 :05 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time on  Tuesday, May 9, 2017 OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n \n \n11 \n event of an advers e scenario such as a recession, these exposures could pose significant risks to \nthese institutions.    \nWhile I am certainly not expecting such a scenario to occur, central bankers are charged \nwith thinking  about adverse risks to the economy .  So current valuations in real estate are one \nsuch risk that I will continue to watch carefully.  \n Thank you.  \n \n                                                           \n \n1 See “Financial Stability: The Role of Real Estate ,” remarks by Eric Rosengren at the Asia -Pacific High Level \nMeeting on Banking Supervi sion, March 22, 2017.  \n \n2 Capitalization or “cap” rates on real estate represent the ratio of net operating income produced by a property to the \nprice paid, calculated at the time of a transaction.    \n \n3 Measured by the core Personal Consumption Expenditures  Price Index or PCE, inflation is at 1.6 percent , and \nmeasured by total PCE, inflation is 1.8 percent.    \n \n4 The unemployment rates for the U.S. and E uro Area are defined somewhat differently.  One difference is based on \nage; the U.S. civilian unemployment rate tallies the unemployed share of the labor force age 16 years and older, \nwhereas the E uro Area’s harmonized unemployment rate calculates the unemployed share of the labor force age 15 \nto 74. For both definitions, unemployed persons must be actively see king work. Other differences between the \ndefinitions have to do with the definition of “actively” seeking work and whether individuals waiting to start a new \njob or awaiting recall after a layoff are counted as unemployed.  \n \n5 GSEs earn a significant share of income from the multifamily segment of their business, d espite  the fact that the \nmultifamily lending is a much smaller piece of their business than residential real estate.  \n \n6 See page 6 of 2017 Supervisory Scenarios for Annual Street Tests Required under the Dodd -Frank Act Stress \nTesting Rules and the Capital Plan Rule .  \n \n7 See page 5 of 2017 Supervisory Scenarios for Annual Street Tests Required under the Dodd -Frank Act Stress \nTesting Rules and the Capital Plan Rule .   \n \n8 As described, the cap rates for multifamily are currently very low, having been driven by both demand for the \nproduct and rental growth rates. It is important to note, however, that in addition to the general overheated economy \nscenario, slowing or declining rental rates for mu ltifamily units will place upward pressure on cap rates.  That is, if \ninvestors are no longer able to count rental growth in their return assumptions, they will turn to demanding a higher \ncap rate on current cash flows. Additionally, increases in interest rates that provide investors with other investment \nopportunities will serve to place upward pressure on the cap rates demanded for the multifamily product.   \n\n \nEMBARGOED UNTIL 1 :05 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time on  Tuesday, May 9, 2017 OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n \n \n12 \n                                                                                                                                                                                            \nTherefore, a combination of both slowing rental growth and higher interest rates could move the cap rates higher \nmore rapidly than either single factor alone.",

U.S. Eastern Time on Wedn esday, May 10, 2017 OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n1 \n  \n \n \n“Exploring the Economy’s Recent Progress , and the \nImplications for Policy ” \n \nEric S. Rosengren  \nPresident &  Chief Executive Officer  \nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston  \n \nLake Champlain Regional Chamber of Commerce  \nand the Central Vermont Chamber of Commerce  \n \nSouth Burlington, Vermont  \nMay 10, 2017  \n \n  \nGood afternoon.  It is a pleasure to be  back in Vermont , and to be able to provide  an \nupdate on the economic outlook.  At the outset, let me note as I always do that the  views I \nexpress today are my own, not necessarily those of my colleagues at the Federal  Reserve’s Board \nof Governors or on the Federal Open Market Com mittee (the FOMC).  \n  I increasingly hear from business leaders about a shortage of qualified workers  – \nparticularly  here in n orthern New England, where unemployment rates are now at or below 3 \npercent .  This is , of course , a welcome change from 2008  and the years that followed , when far \ntoo many workers experienced great difficulty finding jobs .  But my primary message today is \nabout the importan ce of achiev ing positive , but long-run sustainable , economic conditions  – full \n\n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 1 2:45 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Wedn esday, May 10, 2017 OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n2 \n employment and s table  price s (which the Federal Reserve defines as 2 percent inflation) – and, \nby extension , that monetary polic y support s such an outcome . \n Before I turn to these issues, I would highlight that economic data for the first quarter  \nhave been weak er than many  expected .  As the FOMC statement released last week1 suggested , \nand in my own view  as well,  this is  probably  a temporary lull  – and it is likely that the economy \nwill grow  at an average somewhat above  2 percent for  the rest of this  year.   \nOne reason is that much of the weakness in the first quarter was related to  consumption, \nyet personal income and wealth have continued to rise, and consumer confidence indices remain \nquite positive .  So m y expectation is that consumption  will re -emerge  in the second quarter  and \nwe will continue to have a consumption -led recovery . \n The employment report for April was also published last Friday.  Payroll employment \nbounced back from March, with 211,000  new jobs  – and the unemployment rate was reported as \n4.4 percent nationally, which is below my estimate of full employment in the longer run  (4.7 \npercent) .  In addition, the broader U-6 measure of unemployment  (which takes into account \nmarginal attach ment  to the labor force and employment that is  part time for economic reasons ), \ndeclined to 8.6  percent  – a new low for this recovery.  \n All in all , I do not regard the weakness in first quarter data as a harbinger of softness in \nthe underlying economy , and the strength of the labor market report on Fr iday provides some \nstrong confirmation of that view .  With real GDP growth in the remainder of the year likely to \nexceed 2 percent, and robust labor markets, and measures of inflation near 2 percent, I think it is \nimportant that the Federal Reserve  continu e to gradually normalize interest rates , and also to \nbegin to normalize the central bank’s  balance sheet .  Doing so, I believe, is the best way to help \nthe economy remain on a sustainable path.    \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 1 2:45 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Wedn esday, May 10, 2017 OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n3 \n Some of the downside risks that observers have cited – such as relatively slow loan \ngrowth , and weak ness in the economies of foreign trading partners – do not seem  to me  \ncompelling reasons to slow down the gradual normalization of monetary policy .  I will return to \nthese topics in a moment, but let me share  my overall view that it is important to avoid creating \nan over -hot economy (one that could require a less gradual monetary policy  adjustment ).  And in \norder to avoid doing so , the Federal Reserve should  continue gradually normalizing monetary \npolicy .   This would imply beginning a very gradual reduction of securities held on the Federal \nReserve’s  balance sheet relatively soon, while continuing to use short -term interest rates  as the \nprimary monetary  policy  tool for maintaining sustainable growth – growth that is consistent with \nthe Fed’s  dual mandate  of maximum sustainable employment and stable prices .     \n \nGrowth Likely to Exceed Potential  \n \n With real GDP growth averaging just over 2 percent  during the recovery  – which is  \nmodest by historical standards  – labor markets  have nonetheless become tight.  For the \nunemployment rate to steadily fall even with such restrained growth  rates  implies that the so -\ncalled potential growth rate for the economy is now below  2 percent  (given  that the \nunemployment rate falls when actual economic growth exceeds potential ).2   \nFigure 1  provides a chart showing  Congressional Budget Office ( CBO ) estimates of \npotential growth , as well as population growth , by decade.  I n the 1980s and 1990s , the CBO  \nestimate d that potential growth was  over 3 percent, while their  estimate for this decade is well \nbelow 2 percent.  \n  \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 1 2:45 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Wedn esday, May 10, 2017 OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n4 \n A number of factors explain the downward trend in potential GDP , which is determined \nby the number of available workers and the amo unt of output that each worker produces .  \nSlowing p opulation growth accounts for some of the decline , as does slowing labor force growth , \nwhich has been affected by the baby boomers retiring and leaving the labor force.  Another \nfactor behind the slowdown in potential GDP growth has been productivity.  Most measures of \nproductivity growth have been declining, so that there is less growth in goods and services per \nunit of labor.  Given these developments in population growth, labor force , and productivity, m y \nown estimate of potential  growth  is 1.75 percent.  \n Figure 2  shows the Blue Chip consensus forecast for real GDP through 2018 , as of May.   \nBlue Chip provides forecasts based on a survey of roughly 50 private -sector forecasters.  Their \nconsensus projection has growth more than  half a percentage point higher than my estimate of \nthe potential  rate.  As I suggested a moment ago, growth in excess of potential  would likely have \nthe effect of further tightening labor markets.  The green dotted border indicates the average of \nthe 10 highest and 10 lowest estimates  for real GDP.  Note that n early all  of the shaded region \nexceeds  the 1.75 percent  estimate of the potential growth rate . \n Figure 3  shows the Blue Chip consensus forecast for the unemployment r ate.  Consistent \nwith their real GDP forecast, most Blue Chip forecasters expect the unemployment rate to \ncontinue to trend down.  It is worth noting that the average of the 10 highest forecasts  is only 4.7 \npercent unemployment, which is also my estimate o f the full employment  level , at the outset of \nthe forecast period .  For most of the forecast period, the average of the 10 highest forecasts is just \n4.6 percent. The shaded region between the 10 highest and 10 lowest forecasts l ies entirely \nbelow my estimate of full employment .  The average  of the 10 lowest forecasts for \nunemployment falls to 4 percent by the end of 201 7 and falls below 4 percent in 2018 .  Such low \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 1 2:45 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Wedn esday, May 10, 2017 OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n5 \n unemployment rates would likely cause increased pressure on wages and prices , and signa l an \neconomy on a pace exceeding its sustainable level . \n In sum, m ost forecasters are expecting growth above potential and unemployment below \nthe full-employment  level .  This would represent an unsustainable , “overshooting”  pace – and \nprovides an important  rationale for continuing the process of normalization of monetary policy \nthat is currently underway.  \n \nPotential Risks to the Forecast  \n One concern that has been raised about the robustness of the recovery i nvolve s the \ngrowth rate of bank loans , shown in Figure 4 .  The growth in bank l oans has been less rapid  than \nin earlier recoveries , and o ne can look at both demand and supply issues for explanations .   One \nreason for the relatively slow growth is that , in the wake of  the Great R ecession , many firms and \nhouseholds sought to decrease their debt burden – which resulted in a depressed demand for \nloans.  In addition, many firms – if they survived the recession – found themselves with impaired \nbalance sheets that made them less able or qualified  to borrow .  Turning to issues with the supply \nof loans , I would note that historical ly, recover ies characterized by  weak initial lending also were  \nperiod s where a large number of financial institutions became troubled .  To maintain capital -to-\nassets ratios after  losse s – say in commercial real estate  – financial intermediaries have pared \nback lending (because loans are assets for banks) . \n While loan growth  has been slower  than in other recoveries, Figure 5  provides some \ncontext for the recent growth in  total and commer cial and industrial ( C&I) loans held by banks .  \nLoan growth for 2016 exceeded  5 percent, a pace  faster than the growth in nominal GDP.   \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 1 2:45 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Wedn esday, May 10, 2017 OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n6 \n In addition, it is important to note that bank loan growth can understate overall credit \ngrowth , because many firms with access to capital markets satisfied their borrowing needs \nthrough bond issuance, ta king advantage of the historically low interest rates and lock ing in low, \nlong-term rates.   Figure 6  shows the gross issuance of investment grade nonfinancial corporat e \nbonds .  Issuance has grown and remain s robust.   I would also note that increasingly , smaller \nfirms have alternatives to banks to meet their financial needs.  Many smaller firms are turning to \nnon-bank lenders and “fintech ” companies or are able to access capital markets directly.  This \ngreater access to capital markets is very likely substituting for what otherwise might have been \nbank loans.  \n Many firms seek ing bank loans us e real estate as collateral.  Figure 7 shows the growth \nof commercial real estate loans.  Banks are rapidly expanding lending in the multifamily and \nconstruction and land -development  sectors , despite the relatively high valuations for commercial \nreal estate in many markets.  \n In sum , while bank loan growt h has not been as robust as in previous cycles, this likely \nreflects the nature of the crisis, recession, and recovery – and the continued substitution of credit \nfrom capital markets  and non -bank lenders for bank loans  – rather than particular  weakness in \nunderlying economic conditions.  In some bank loan categories  – such as commercial real estate  \n– it is actually surprising how rapidly loans are growing , given the prevalence of high valuations.  \n  \nRisks  from Overseas  \n Another source of concern  over the past several years has involved weak  economic \nperformance in  countries that are  trading partners  with the U.S .  Indeed, geopolitical concerns  \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 1 2:45 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Wedn esday, May 10, 2017 OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n7 \n are likely to pose some  potential risk to the U.S. forecast  for the foreseeable future .  However, on \nbalance, the risks from abroad seemed to have abated somewhat.  \n Figure 8 shows the increases in stock prices in emerging markets, Europe , and the United \nStates since the beginning of this year.  While U.S . stock prices have advanced, European stocks \nhave seen similar improvement s – and emerging markets have increased more than the U .S. or \nEuropean indices.  All this likely reflects increased investor optimism that the economic recovery \nin many countries is beginning to take hold , and the data for economic activity in the Euro Area \nand many other developed and emerging economies supports that assessment . \n Figure 9 shows the International Monetary Fund ( IMF) forecast for real GDP growth this \nyear compared to last year  – for the U .S., the Euro area , and emergi ng markets.  In the United \nStates  and in emerging markets , the IMF is expecting stronger growth over the next two years , \nwhich is consistent with the improvements in stock markets  that we see .  The  IMF outlook for \nEurope is essential ly unchanged, but given  the recent turmoil generated by elections in several \nEuropean countries, continued positive growth is better than some had been expecting.  \n While the risks of a slowdown from abroad will probably always be present in some \ndegree , this risk does seem to be  abating  of late .  Economic forecasts for growth are increasing \nand investor sentiment has improved.  \n \nThe Stance  of Monetary Policy  \n Figure 10 shows the federal funds rate  targeted by the Federal Reserve.  The Fed  began \nthe normalization process in December 2015 by raising the federal funds target range to 25 to 50 \nbasis points.  Since that initial hike, the FOMC has  increased the rates two  additional times, in \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 1 2:45 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Wedn esday, May 10, 2017 OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n8 \n December 2016 and March 2017.  The target range for th e federal funds rate is currently between \n75 and 100 basis points.  \n Despite the three  25-basis point increases in the federal funds rate  target  range , U.S. \nmonetary policy remains quite accommodative.  Short -term nominal interest rates are below the \ninflation rate, so the real interest rate remains negative  (the real rate is simply the nominal rate \nminus inflation) .  In addition, as mentioned earlier, most forecasters expect growth to exceed  \npotential.  With  conditions now consistent with full employment and the Fed’s  inflation  target , in \nmy view , monetary policy makers  should certainly continue on the path of gradual normalization , \nand continue to explore its pace . \n The Federal Reserve has a nother monetary policy  tool, as depicted  in Figure 11.  During \nthe financial crisis  and its aftermath , when short -term interest rates approached zero the central \nbank  needed to find other ways to return the economy to full employment and the 2 percent \ninflation  target associated with price stability .  Since short -term rates were essentially at zero, the \nFed lowered long -term interest rates by buying long -term Treasury securities and agency \nmortgage -backed  securities  (MBS) .  The result was an expanded central ban k balance sheet  that \nreach ed roughly $4.5 trillion  in assets . \n Looking ahead, t he federal funds rate would  obviously exceed 1 percent after one more \n25 basis -point increase.  In my view, that seems an appropriate point to consider beginning a \nvery gradual normalization of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet.  I believe the Fed should do \nso gradually, so that the reduction in the balance sheet is not disruptive, and so that it c an occur \nlargely in the background .  This would maintain the Federal Reserve’s focus on the federal funds \nrate as the primary instrument of monetary policy.  \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 1 2:45 P.M.

The dark \nline, the median forecast for the federal funds rate , increases gradually  over the next two and a \nhalf years, peaking at 3 percent .  The median forecast among policymakers is for  two more \nincreases for this year.  My own view remains  that along with a gradual reduction in the level of \nthe balance sheet , it would  still be reasonable to have three rate increases over the remainder  of \nthis year , assuming the economy evolves like my forec ast envisions . \n \nConclu ding Observations  \n In summary and conclusion, I would point out that t he first quarter ’s real GDP and \ninflation numbers proved to be  somewhat weaker than many  expected, but I do view these as a \ntransitory phenomenon .  My expectation is that the economy will remain on solid footing , with \nthe unemployment rate likely to continue falling  and already likely  below its sustainable level, \nand inflation fluctuating around 2 percent.   \nMy view is that such conditions justify continuing a gradual increase in the federal funds \nrate and also beginning to reduce gradually the level of the assets on the Federal Reserve’s \nbalance sheet.   As long as the balance sheet reduction is not steep , it should have only modest \neffects on cred it markets  – in other words it  can be gradually reduced “in the background .”  That \nwill allow Fed policymakers  to focus primarily on gradual normaliz ation of  the federal funds \nrate, using it as the primary vehicle for attaining sustainable growth , full employment , and price \nstability at 2 percent inflation.   \nThank you.    \n  \n \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 1 2:45 P.M.

In particular, \na stable unemployment rate is an indication that the economy is growing at potential. Periods of declining \nunemployment rate signal that GDP is growing above p otential, and vice versa when the unemployment rate is \nincreasing. In the earlier stages of the recovery, it was important for the economy to grow faster than potential in \norder to raise the degree of resource utilization and bring the unemployment rate do wn. At the current stage of the \nrecovery, however, continued growth above potential runs the risk of overheating the economy. The potential \ngrowth rate of the economy needs to be inferred from the data, and it depends on the long -run growth rate of the \nlabor force and productivity. While in the short run labor force and productivity can be affected by cyclical factors, \nin the longer run labor supply is largely driven by demographic trends and productivity by technological progress. \nThere is uncertainty asso ciated with the rate of growth of potential, despite the fact that some demographic \ndevelopments are relatively easy to predict. This uncertainty notwithstanding, the average pace of GDP growth \nduring the recovery has been enough to bring the unemployment rate down. As a result, over this period the \npotential growth rate of the U.S. economy has been less than 2 percent.",

Rosengren  \nPresident & Chief Executive Officer  \nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston  \n \nThe Money Marketeers of New York University  \n \nNew York, New York  \nSeptember 27, 2017  \n \n  \nGood evening .  It is a pleasure to be back in New York .  I’d like to thank the Money \nMarketeers for inviting me to share my perspectives  this evening .  At the outset, let me note as I \nalways do that the views I express  are my own, not necessarily those of my colleague s at the \nFederal Reserve’s Board of Governors or on the Federal Open Market Committee (the FOMC).  \nAfter last week’s FOMC meeting , the Committee  announced that it would begin  to shrink \nthe Federal Reserve’s balance sheet  in October .  In my view , this was a well -communicated \nannouncement designed to minimize any disruption  – which was advisable, given that there is  no \nprecedent for  the process of  shrinking the central bank’s balance sheet , at least at this magnitude .  \nThe announcement went smoothl y, and now with the balance sheet essentially  on “automatic \n\n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 7:00 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Wednesday, September 27, 2017 OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n2 \n pilot,” Federal Reserve policymakers  can resume using  short -term interest rates as the primary \ntool for monetary policy.  \nAs policymakers  think about appropriate policy , it should be noted that discerning the \nunderlying trends in unemployment and inflation – looking through  transitory effects – is likely \nto be quite difficult  in coming months .  The impact of  Hurricanes Harvey , Irma , and Mari a will \nsignificantly c loud the interpretation of the economic data .  The challenge will be in trying to \ndifferentiate the temporary  — the pause and rebound in activity resulting from the storms and \nsubsequent rebuilding  — from the ongoing  trend .  Thus,  it may be difficult to be fully “data \ndependent ” in the near -term.  This difficulty is compounded by the fact that the Fed eral \nReserve ’s dual mandate  indicators – employment and inflation – are sending somewhat \nconflicting signals  of late: labor markets have continued to improve, yet inflation has slipped \ndown a notch this year .  \n For much of the period of recovery  from the financial crisis and last recession , inflation \nwas well below the Fed eral Reserve ’s 2 percent target , and the  unemployment rate was well \nabove the estimate d long-run sustainabl e rate .  Today, w hile inflation  is still undersh ooting the \nFed’s 2 percent target , the unemployment rate has  declined so much that it is  actually  below  \nwhat most FOMC participants see as the sustainable level of the unemployment rate  (and, as I \nwill note in a moment, it is likely to fall further) .   \nWhen the central bank’s dual mandate is “dueling, ” how should policymakers r esolve the \nconflicting signals?   Monetary policy must  be forward looking, so a key consideration  involve s \nthe likelihood that the mandate “misses ” will persist.   Peering into the future is always fraught  \nwith uncertainty ; but even so, it may be instructive to consider  where most  private sector \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 7:00 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Wednesday, September 27, 2017 OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n3 \n economists and policymakers believe that inflation and unemployment are headed  over the \nmedium -term.   Do they see recent inflation weakness as temporary, or a sign of things to come?  \n As I will discuss today, the forecasts of both Federal Reserve policymak ers (in the \nSummary of Economic Projections or SEP1) and private forecast ers agree that by the en d of next \nyear, inflation is expected to  be close to  target  while  the unemployment rate will continue to fall \n– and as a result, will  move  further  below most estimates of a sustainable  unemployment rate.   \nI share this forecast , and the assessment that  unemployment will be materially  below \nmost policymakers’  estimate s of the rate consistent with full employment . The likelihood of this \noutcome  poses  risks – specifically that an overheated economy will lead to price or asset -price \ninflation, risking the sustainability of the  recovery.  The last time we had un employment rates \ntrending toward  4 percent  (in the late 1990s) , the personal consumption expen ditures (PCE) \nmeasure of total inflation and asset pri ces had begun to rise, followed shortly thereafter by an \neconomic downturn and a significant r evaluation in many asset prices .  Thus , in my view,  \nappropriate risk mitigation would argue for continued gr adual removal of monetary \naccommodation, even though we are currently below the inflation target.  \n \nAre Recent Low Inflation  Rates Likely to be Transitory?  \nFigure 1  provides  the total and core PCE  inflation measures  over the past three years.  \nWhile the total PCE inflation rate briefly  exceed ed the Fed’s  2 percent inflation target earl y this \nyear, it has since fallen, and the total PCE inflation rate – the percent change in the index from a \nyear ago – is currently 1. 4 percent.   \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 7:00 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Wednesday, September 27, 2017 OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n4 \n In part, the decline is due to  some idiosyncratic  individual  price decreases.  Reductions in \nwireless phone plan  price s and lower prescription drug prices both resulted in declines in  the \nPCE inflation rate this spring .  And – as a matter of arithmetic  – these drops  will continue to \ndepress 12-month  inflation rates until next spring.  However , the effects of the hurricanes will \nlikely cause temporary  increase s in reported inflation over the next several months.  The \nhurricanes have disrupted refinery and distribution  facilities, temporarily elevating  gasoline \nprices , for example.   Of course, as this capacity comes back on line, gasoline prices will likely \nfall back to their pre -hurricane levels, imposing another downward imprint on inflation.   The \npoint is that additi onal “noise” in the data will make it a bit more difficult in the near term to \ndetermine the underlying trend in inflation, at a time when policymakers are eager to distinguish \nthe trend from the noise given the recent low readings.  \n Figure  2 provides the median forecast for PCE inflation at yearend 2018 from the past \nfive SEP report s.  The central tendency is defined as the range of forecasts excluding the three \nhighest and three lowest forecasts.  The median forecast , which had been quite constant at 2 \npercent , has edged down in the most recent SEP.  T he fact that the median  has dipped  below 2 \npercent and the  bottom of the shaded area  now extends a bit lower  suggest s that some FOMC \nparticipants believe we will still remain below  the target at the end of 2018.  Nonetheless, I \nwould point out that even the lower boundary of the central tendency , at 1.8 percent,  is still \nrelatively close to the 2 percent target.  \n Figure  3 provides the median forecast and the central tendency for core PCE inflation.  \nThe overall forecast for core PCE inflation is generally consistent with that of total inflation.    \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 7:00 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Wednesday, September 27, 2017 OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n5 \n  Figure  4 turns from Fed policymakers to those private forecasters taking part in the Blue \nChip consensus forecast .  It provides the consensus ( average)  forecast and the average of the 10 \nhighest and 10 lowest forecasts for PCE inflation for Blue Chip participants .2  The private \nforecasts are generally consistent with the SEP, but the chart shows that , unlike the FOMC \nparticipants,  at least some private forecast ers believe inflation will be above the Federal \nReserve’s  2 percent inflation target by the end of next year.  \n Overall, there is a broad consistency between FOMC participants ’ forecasts and private -\nsector forecasts.  The curr ent low inflation readings are viewed as transitory by both.  While such \nforecasts are still of course subject to errors  – possibly even significant ones – I believe \npolicy makers  should not overreact to low current inflation readings that are widely expect ed to \nbe temporary.  \n \nIs the Decline in the Unemploy ment  Rate Expected to be Transitory?  \n  Figure  5 provides the recent unemployment rate and a horizontal line at 4.7 percent \nunemployment, marking  my estimate of the long-run sustainable unemployment rate  or the rate \nconsistent with full employment .  The unemployment rate fell below  my 4.7 percent  estimate  \nearlier this spring,  and is currently 4. 4 percent.  A small and temporary movement below the \nsustainable unemployment rate is unlikely to have much impact on wages and prices  – so again, \nwe need  to explore whether low and falling unemployment should be viewed as a temporary or \npersistent phenomenon.  \nFigure  6 address es this question by showing the median unemployment rate forecast for \nthe end of 2018 by FOMC participants , along with the central tendency.  The chart shows that \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 7:00 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Wednesday, September 27, 2017 OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n6 \n both the median and the central tendency of forecasts for the unemployment rate at the end of \n2018 have been declining .  While the bottom of the central tendency has settled at  4 percent  in \nthe two most recent  forecast s, the bottom of the full range (including  the three lowest \nsubmissions) has declined to 3.9 percent , indicating some FOMC participants now expect the \nunemployment rate to decline below 4 percent , even with the modest rise in interest rates .   \nFigure  7 shows that the Blue Chip forecast of private forecasters is quite similar.  The \nBlue Chip consensus forecast  now has the unemployment rate falling to 4.1 percent , with the \naverage of the lowest 10 forecasts now at 3.8 percent .  The number of forecasters who believe \nunemployment will stabilize at 4.4 percent or rise from there is quite small.  Thus, forecasters \ngenerally see the recent low readings for unemployment as persistent , and they envision \nadditional declines on average.   This is just the opposite of their views on inflation.  \n \nThe Potential Impact of Falling Significantly Below  the Full Employment  Level  \n Figure 8  shows the actual unemployment rate , relative to FOMC participants ’ median \nestimate  of the unemployment rate that is likely to be sustainable in the long  run.  As you can \nsee, i t is only recently that the quarterly unemployment rate has fallen belo w the estimates of the \nsustainable unemployment rate.  With the unemployment rate currently at 4. 4 percent  and the \nmedian estimate of full employment at 4.6, we are currently 0. 2 percent age points  below the \nmedian of what FOMC  participants  believe to be sustainable  – and as I have mentioned, that gap \nis expected to grow as unemployment falls further .  Notably, this has occurred despite a gradual  \ndecline in the level that  FOMC participants consider  sustainable.  \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 7:00 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Wednesday, September 27, 2017 OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n7 \n  Figure 9  shows the SEP foreca st of the unemployment rate made in  September 2014 ,3 \nalong with  the actual path of unemployment.  The forecast assumed that the unemployment rate \nwould fall more slowly than it actually did.  While undershooting the unemployment forecast is \npositive  when trying to reach  full employment, such misses are less desirable if they push the \neconomy  well beyond full employment . \n Figure 10  shows two measures of wage pressures  – average hourly earnings , and the \nwages and salaries component of the employment co st index  excluding incentive paid \noccupations .  While we have  only recently fallen below  the SEP median estimate  of sustainable \nunemployment, we can see that wages and salaries have been trending up over the past several \nyears.  Both measures were below 2 percent in 2012 and have gradually risen to approximately \n2.5 percent more recently.  An open question is how much employers and employees will alter \nwage and  salary expectations in increasingly tight labor markets.  \n Figure 11  display s the Blue Chip forecast , as of this month , for growth in average hourly \nearnings .  As mentioned earlier, the Blue Chip consensus forecast has the unemployment rate \ncontinuing to trend down.  The consensus forecast anticipate s that average hourly earnings \ngrowth will continu e to increase , and reach 3. 0 percent by the end of 2018 .  It is worth noting \nthat average hour ly earnings  growt h is currently 2. 5 percent, and the average of the bottom ten \nforecasters is 2. 7 percent for the end of 2018 .  This indicat es that almost all the Blue Chip \nforecasters are expecting acceleration from current levels.  \n One way that wage pressu res can build is if workers are  willing to leave their current job \nfor a higher -paying one.  As Figure 12  shows, very few workers were willing to leave their jobs \nin the wake of the Great Recession.  However, as labor markets have tightened, workers are \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 7:00 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Wednesday, September 27, 2017 OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n8 \n showing a greater willingness to leave their jobs in pursuit of  better opportunities.  With the so-\ncalled “quits rate” now close to the peak prior to the Great Recession, workers appear to be quite  \nwilling to leave their current jobs in search of higher wages.  \n \nConc luding Observations  \n The weakness in inflation readings appear s to be transitory, but some  one-time declines \nin individual prices will not fall out of annual averages until next spring .  In contrast, t he recent \nhurricanes will likely place some upward pressure on measured inflation over the next several \nmonths, a transitory shock in the other direction.  However , the declines in the unemployment \nrate below the level most  see as sustainable seem  likely t o be more long -lasting, which is one \nreason for my expectation  that tight  – and tightening further – labor markets will result in higher \nwages and prices over time.   \nTemporary fluctuations in prices may obscure the underlying trend  for a little while .  But \nmonetary policy tends to act with long lags, so it is essential that central bankers do their best to \nlook through the temporary toward the underlying trends.  Those trends, as best I can see  them at \npresent, suggest to me an economy that risks pushin g pas t what is sustainable , raising the \nprobability  of higher asset prices , or inflation  well above the Federal Reserve’s 2 percent target .  \nSteps l owering the probability of such an outcome  seem  advisable – in other words , seem like \ninsurance  worth taking out at this time.  As a result, it is my view that regular and gradual \nremoval of monetary accommodation seems appropriate.  \n  Thank you.  \n \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 7:00 P.M.

It is a pleasure to be with you  in Montreal .  I’d like to thank the \nInternational Atlantic Economic Society  for inviting me to share my views on the economy \ntoday.  At the outset, let me note as I always do that the views I express  are my own, not \nnecessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal Res erve Board or the Federal Open Market \nCommittee (FOMC).  \nEvery economic recovery  has its own unique puzzles.  Certainly , one puzzle  in the most \nrecent  recovery  is why it has been so difficult for central banks in many developed economies to \nachieve their inflation objectives , even as employment has rebounded .  Both Japan and the \n\n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 11:45 A.M.  Eastern Time on Wednesday, Octo ber 7, 2017 OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n2 \n United States are at or beyond many estimates of full employment, and the Euro  Area  has made \nsignificant progress toward full employment  – and yet, inflation in all three areas remain s below \ntargets set by their respective central banks.  One would expect robust employment conditions to \nnudge up wages and in turn prices, leading the inflatio n rate towards its target.  \nOne possible explanation for this puzzle could be  that what economists call the “natural \nrate” of unemployment – the unemployment rate  that is  consistent with a n inflation rate  at its \ntarget value  – may have fallen.  A lower natural  rate of unemployment in the economy  might \nexplain why lower actual  levels of unemployment are not driving up wages  and prices as quickly \nas some have expected .  In fact, Federal Reserve policymakers – the participants  in the FOMC – \nhave lowered their estimates of the unemployment  rate that they expect in the long  run. \nWhile it is certainly possible that the natural rate of unemployment for the  U.S. economy \nis now lower, I believe some caution is in order in making this assessment .  Short -run e stimates \nof the natural rate have tended to follow  the actual unemployment rate fairly closely; hence, \npolicymakers’ estimates of full employment1 tend to be  lower  when the economy is doing well \nand higher  when the economy is doing less well.  But with the benefit of hindsight , estimates of \nthe natural rate are  less variable  than initial ly thought , tracking actual unemployment less \nclosely .2   \nModest and gradual movements in the natural rate are consistent with the sense that long-\nterm economic trends , such as improvement in human capital and demographic chang es, are the \nmain source of variation in the natural rate.   Such chang es are unlikely to occur quickly  or in \nunexpected ways over relatively short time periods , such as over a business cycle .   \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 11:45 A.M.  Eastern Time on Wednesday, Octo ber 7, 2017 OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n3 \n So, since I do not believe a significant decline in the natural rate of unemployment \nexplains the subdued -inflation puzzle, it remains just that  – a puzzle.   \nA second surprise in this recovery has been the relatively slow rate of economic growth  \nwe have experienced in the U.S. , despite unusually low interest rates.  While short -term real \ninterest rates have actually been negative throughout  the recovery  – clearly , very accommodative \nmonetary conditions – the economy has still grown at a rather te pid rate of about  2 percent.  A \ncommon explanation for this  dynamic  has been  that the equilibrium interest rate  – the interest \nrate that in the long run is consistent with stable inflation and full employment  – has fallen.   \nIn this case, the movement does seem more understandable.  What policymakers call \n“potential GDP growth ” has declined.  Indeed, FOMC participants are surveyed on their views of \nwhat the long-run sustainable interest rate , and GDP growth rate , will be in th e long er term – and \nboth estimates have fallen quite substantially.   \nHowever, like the natural rate  of unemployment , the equilibrium interest rate  can only be  \ninferred , rather than known.  The rapid decline in estimates of the equilibrium interest rate \nshould also be viewed cautiously, given the imprecision in estimation – and given how much \nestimates have varied over a relatively short time period .  \nThe relatively rap id changes in these estimates of variables  like the natural rate of \nunemployment and the equilibrium interest rate may of course reflect actual changes in \neconomic relationships .  However, they also may attempt to explain developments in “high \nfrequency” information with changes in relatively “low frequency concepts ,” and stretch too far \nin attempt ing to explain developments  in economic measures.  W hile attempting to infer possible \nlong-run changes or implications from recent high  frequency data may be  reasonable , history \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 11:45 A.M.  Eastern Time on Wednesday, Octo ber 7, 2017 OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n4 \n shows that policymakers  tend to place too much weight on short -term fluctuations in their real-\ntime estimates of long -run concepts.   \nThis tendency is of more than academic interest.  One can make significant policy \nmistakes if one assumes  incorrectly that significant changes in long -run variables have occurred , \nwhen in fact no change has occurred.3  Central bankers  should hesitate to change their policy \nstance based on estimated changes in long -run variables that in statistical terms are n ot large , \nrelative to the standard errors with which these quantities are estimated.    \nIn my own view, maintaining negative real short -term rates once we have achieved full \nemployment risks the potential of an eventual overheating of the economy, which could be \nreflected in higher wages and prices , or higher asset prices.  Already -tight labor markets are \nlikely to tighten further as the economy continues to grow faster than its potential.  In these \ncircumstances, p rudent risk management would argue for the continued gradual removal of \nmonetary policy accommodation  in order to minimize the risk of outcomes that might \nprematurely shorten the current economic recovery.   \n \nRecovery Puzzles  \nIt is not particularly surprisi ng that the economic recovery , in the wake of a financial \ncrisis , has been  quite slow.  Studies of earlier episodes  find that recoveries following financial \ncrises  are usually  slow  – as firms and households are understandably more risk averse, and the \ncollateral values that are essential for obtaining financing are slow to  rebound.   However, what \nhas been more surprising is how slowly wages and prices are growing a decade after the onset of \nthe Great Recession.4 \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 11:45 A.M.  Eastern Time on Wednesday, Octo ber 7, 2017 OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n5 \n  Figure 1  shows the unemployment rate in the U nited States, the Euro Area , and Japan.  \nBy this measure , there has been significant improvement in all three economies.  In both the U .S. \nand Japan, unemployment rates are now below levels reported  immediately prior to the Great \nRecession.  In the case of the Euro Area, the unemployment rate  is still elevated , but is on a path \nreflecting  relatively  consistent improvement.   \n In contrast, Figure 2  shows that the progress on achieving stated inflation  targets has \nbeen somewhat disappointing.   In all three regions, inflation rates are currently below  their 2 \npercent  targets .  While there have been periods during the recovery whe n measures of  total \ninflation have temporarily exceeded 2 percent, the inflation rate has remained below target for \nmuch of the recovery.  For example , the total PCE inflation  rate in the U .S. over the last year has \nmost recently averaged  only 1.4 percent.  In Japan, the inflation rate has been particularly low, \npossibly reflecting a fall in the expected inflation rate due to the very long period when actual \ninflation has been below the 2 percent target . \n \nOne Puzzle: Implications of Low Inflation  \n During periods of subs tantial slack in the economy, it  is not surprising that wage and \nprice inflation are modest.  However, as we reach or exceed many economists ’ estimate s of full \nemployment, one might expect that wage and price pressures would gradually increase.  One \nway that economists try to capture thi s relationship is through the Phillips Curve, which \ndescribes inflation as being generated by expectations of future inflation and the amount of  \nlabor -market  slack in the economy.  One challenge of this simple formulation involves  how best \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 11:45 A.M.  Eastern Time on Wednesday, Octo ber 7, 2017 OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n6 \n to capture the a mount of slack in the economy.   The measurement of slack depends on obtaining \nan estimate of the natural rate of unemployment.5   \n Figure 3  provides estimates  of the natural rate  of unemployment  and forecast s of the \nunemployment rate in the long er run.  The dark blue line  is the median  of FOMC policymaker \nestimates of the unemployment rate in the long er run, from the Federal Reserve’s Summary of \nEconomic Projections (SEP) .  Since this is a survey, the estimates reflect what participants knew \nas of the time of the survey.  Participants are asked the unemployment rate they expect in the \nlonger  run, assuming an absence of shocks and assuming appropriate monetary policy.  A second \nmeasure – the green line – is the  current  Congressional Budget Office (C BO) estimate of the \nnatural rate  over the same time period .  Since the financial crisis, the median estimate of FOMC \nparticipants has moved from a high of 5. 45 percent , to the current low of 4.6 percent.  The \nshaded region provides the SEP “central tendency, ” the range of estimates provided by FOMC \nparticipants after excluding the three highest and three lowest responses.  At times , even though \nthe range is quite large , the bottom of the range lies above the CBO estimate of full employment , \nas it does  from mid-2011  through 2015.  \n How reasonable are the estimates of the natural rate?  The range of estimates highlights \nthe uncertainty entailed  in measuring this key variable.  While the natural rate will change over \ntime, most of  those changes reflect gradual but significant changes in  demographic \ncharacteristics of  the labor force.  For example, when (typically) younger workers  first enter the \nworkforce , they are more likely to be unemployed , as they may not as yet have develop ed \nmarketable ski lls, and are thus more likely to shift jobs .  In addition, they are  more likely to leave \nthe workforce  to gain additional skills through  higher education or training.  The opposite is true \nof more experienced and older workers, who have developed job -specific capital and are \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 11:45 A.M.  Eastern Time on Wednesday, Octo ber 7, 2017 OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n7 \n therefore  more attached to their work and less likely to become unemployed or leave the labor \nforce.  So historicall y, when demographics have result ed in a higher share of younger workers  in \nthe labor force, the natural rate appears to have risen  – relative to times when  young workers  are \na small er share  of the labor force.   \n Figure 4  shows the share  of the labor force  between the ages of 16 and 24 and the CBO’s \nestimate of the natural rate of long -term unemployment .  The chart shows that with the aging of \nthe baby boom generation, younger workers have become  a relatively small er share  of the labor \nforce.   And, at the same time, the CBO’s estimate of the natural rate has declined.  \n Figure 5  provides the share  of the labor force – age 25 years and older – with at least a \ncollege degree, which has trended up  over time.  Better educated workers tend to have lower \nunemploym ent rates when compared with those with less educational attainment.  As a result, \none might expect this trend to be reflected in a lower natural rate of unemployment . \n While these figures  provide possible explanations for why the natural rate may change, it \nis important to realize that broad demographic trends are generally slow moving, well-known  in \nadvance , and thus straightforward to predict .  While these trends can make a difference and do \nseem consistent with the moves seen in the CBO estimate of the natural rate , it is hard to match \nthese broader demographic changes with relatively rapid and recent  changes in the estimates of \nthe natural rate  seen in the SEP  forecasts . \n An alternative  explanation of the degree of movement in the presumed natural rate may \nbe that forecasters are overly sensitive to current economic conditions when estimating the \ncurrent natural rate.  When the unemployment rate is quite high, we may associate too much of \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 11:45 A.M.  Eastern Time on Wednesday, Octo ber 7, 2017 OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n8 \n the higher unemployment rate to difficulties in matchin g workers to jobs.  Similarly, when l abor \nmarkets are very t ight, as is the case presently , estimates of the natural rate may fall too much.  \n Figure 6  shows the actual unemployment rate with  the median SEP estimate of the \nnatural rate , and the CBO estimate of the natural rate since mid-2014 .  The actual unemployment \nrate is now below both estimate s of the natural rate  – and estimates of the natural rate  are now \nlower than they were just three years ago.   The SEP estimates, reflecting real -time estimates of \nthe natural rate, move more closely with actual unemployment than the CBO estimate, which has \nthe benefit of hindsight. This suggests exercising cauti on in making our natural rate estimate too \nresponsive to incoming data .6 \n  \nA Second Puzzle: The Low Equilibrium Rate of Interest  \n A second foundational concept that is difficult to estimate is the “normal” level for the \nfederal funds rate  – or what policymakers call the equilibrium nominal interest rate .  As with the \nnatural unemployment rate, the equilibrium interest rate is a concept that cannot be directly \nobserved, but must be estimated.   Also similar to the natural rate, a good proxy fo r estimates by \nFOMC members of the equilibrium funds rate is their SEP estimates for the nominal federal \nfunds rate “in the longer  run.”   \n Figure 7  provides the SEP forecast s since 201 2.  While th e funds rate in the long er run \nwas estimated at  4.25 percent  early in the recovery , the estimate in the most recent SEP had \nfallen to 2.75 percent.  Like the natural rate, there is significant variation in these estimates over \ntime, as well as significant disagreement among SEP partic ipants at any poin t in time .  As the \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 11:45 A.M.  Eastern Time on Wednesday, Octo ber 7, 2017 OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n9 \n shaded region shows, the lowe r bound ary of the central tendency of the estimates of the \nequilibrium interest rate early in the sample are well above most estimates just a few years later.  \n As with  the natural rate, there are good reasons to  expect the equilibrium interest rate to \nchange over time .  In fact , in this case the level may actually  be more responsive to current \neconomic data .  If we think of the interest rate as determined by the balance  between savings and \ninvestment, then c hanges in the equilibrium interest rate will occur w hen the key factors \ndetermining aggregate saving and investment decisions  change.   These include demographic \nchanges, which can affect  global saving behavior  (genera lly younger workers save less, older \nworkers save more) , and changes in productivity , which affect the demand for investment goods \n(higher productivity generally spurs investment, as it implies higher returns per dollar spent on \ninvested goods) .  Increases  in the propensity to save will place downward pressure on \nequilibrium interest rates , as the higher demand for saving implies a lower required interest rate .   \n In this case, one might expect to see more significant changes as, for example, variables \nthat impact aggregate savings and investment can change.  In fact, SEP participants’ estimates of \nthe equilibrium interest rate have fallen significantly over a relatively short period of time.  \nWhile there may be more responsiveness to incoming economic data,  and changes like much \nlower current estimates of productivity should impact this calculation, one should be cautious \ngiven the inherent difficulty in inferring where the equilibrium interest rate will be in the long  \nrun. \n \n \n \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 11:45 A.M.  Eastern Time on Wednesday, Octo ber 7, 2017 OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n10 \n Concluding Observations  \n While it is important that monetary policy be “data dependent,” it is equally important \nthat it not be too sensitive to incoming data  – especially when estimating important underlying \neconomic concepts like the natural rate of unemployment and the equilibrium in terest rate .  \nWhile underlying economic relationships can and do change, one should not be too quick to \nassume that relationships are unhinged as a result of expectation errors for “high frequency ” \ndata.  It is certainly important to adjust estimates of underlying relationshi ps when there are large \npersiste nt variations from estimated values , but too much sensitivity to incoming data can cause \nmonetary policy to be too easy in expansions and too slow to respond to recessions.  \n In the current environment, the low inflation readings have provided monetary \npolicy makers  the opportunity to take a  more patient approach to removing accommodation  than \nin recent recoveries , allowing a prolonged period of recovery in labor markets .  A gradual \napproach has many benef its, including the possibility of a long sustained recovery without \nrisking a significant over -reaction by monetary policy makers .   \nHowever, estimates of the natural rate of unemployment and the equilibrium interest rate \ncan be too low as well as too high.   In my own view, f ailing to respond to very tight labor \nmarkets with rates remaining  negative in real terms could potentially risk  unnecessarily \nshortening  the economic recovery , as rising inflation  or an episode of financial instability  \neventually cause s monetary policy makers  to have to act more forcefully.    \n Thank you.  \n \n1 That is, of the level of unemployment associated with full employment in the economy.                                                             \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 11:45 A.M.  Eastern Time on Wednesday, Octo ber 7, 2017 OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n11 \n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n \n2 See Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago study, Changing Labor Force Composition and the Natural Rate of \nUnemployment , by Daniel Aaronson, Luojia Hu, Arian Seifoddini, and Daniel G. Sullivan.  \n \n3 For example, if central bankers had assumed in 2010 that the natural rate of unemployment had risen toward 9  \npercent , they would have been incorrect, as the data since then has shown.  \n \n4 For additional perspective on the economic recovery in the wake of the financial crisis, see October 2016 remarks \nby Eric S. Rosengren, After the Great Recession, a Not -So-Great Recovery . \n \n5 A common concept of slack employed in this context is the amount of labor ma rket slack, usually taken as the \ndifference between the actual unemployment rate and the rate that is consistent with full employment, called the \nnatural rate. When unemployment is at the natural rate, the labor market does not exert pressure to move the \ninflation rate away from the central bank’s goal for inflation (2 percent in the U.S.). Thus, this definition of slack \ndepends on obtaining an estimate of the natural rate of unemployment, a well -defined but difficult -to-measure \nquantity.  \n \n6 Such movements in the estimates of an important underlying variable for measuring tightness in the labor market \nhighlight that estimates can be too sensitive to recent underlying data.  The CBO estimate of the natural rate tends to \nmove only gradually, consistent with sl ow moving demographic variables, while  the SEP estimates move much \nmore.  This suggests some caution in being too sensitive to incoming data relative to economic relationships that \ngenerally are believed to move only slowly.",

I am very much looking forward to the presentations and discussions over the \ncoming days.   Before I begin , let me note as I always do that the views I express  are my own, \nnot necessarily those of my colleagues at the Board of Governors or on the Federal O pen Market \nCommittee (FOMC).  \nLet me also provide a bit of context for the conference.  This year, our conference focuses \non a topic currently debated in Congress but longstanding  among economists – whether \n\n\n EMBARGOED UNTIL 8:3 5 AM U.S. Eastern Time on Friday, October 13, 2017 OR UPON DELIVERY  \n2 \n monetary policy should follow a rules -based approach, or focus on outcome s (like maximum \nsustainable employment and stable prices) and allow  policy makers discretion in determining \nhow best to achieve them . \nThis forum continues the Boston Fed’s tradition of  examining economic issues and policy \nquestions in a nonpartisan, data -focused way – with an emphasis on actionable issues that can \nimpact the economic well -being of all citizens.  Certainly, m onetary policy impacts all \nAmericans . \nThe extraordinary measures taken to combat the financial crisis and Great Recession have \nrekindled a longstanding debate: In pursuing the objectives mandated by Congress, is it in the \npublic’s best interest to allow  policymakers discretion in setting interest rates , or – as recent  \nlegislation would suggest – is macroeconomic performance enhanced if policymakers  adhere to a \npredetermined rule, for example, a “Taylor rule, ” named after one of our distinguished \nconference presenters,  John Taylor.  \nThe resolution of the rules vs. discretion debate will have significant consequences.  A nd \na hallmark of the Boston Fed’s economic conference is an engaged consideration of impactful \npolicy topics – monetary or otherwise – encouraging frank discussion and debate.  In that spirit, \nover the next day and a half we will grapple with a range of questions central to the rules vs. \ndiscretion debate  – and the way forward .  My colleagues and I hope this  conference provides a \nconstructive forum for the vigorous and balanced consideration of these i mportant issues. \n \n \n \n\n EMBARGOED UNTIL 8:3 5 AM U.S. Eastern Time on Friday, October 13, 2017 OR UPON DELIVERY  \n3 \n An Overview of Policy Rules  \nPolicy rules have long been central to discussions of monetary policy.  I will cover some \nof the positive aspects, as well as some of the drawbacks.  \nOn the positive side, r ules can capture the res ponse of monetary policy to various \nconditions over a historical period, thus providing  an important benchmark and allow ing \npolicymakers to compare potential  policies to historical norms.  What’s more, i f the rules capture \nthe central bank’s actual behavior, they c an make inherently complex policies more \nunderstandable and transparent to the public.  T his transparency can also aid in communicating  \nthe current and prospective stance of monetary policy  – a task that has become  more impo rtant as \ncommunication s operate in real time, around the clock and around the globe, with information \nconstantly processed by financial markets.   Finally, such rules can provide more consistency  \nthrough time , even as the membership of the central bank’s policymaking committee changes .   \n However, in my view, policy rules can also have drawbacks.  Let me provide one \nexample.  Th irty-five years ago, when Frank Morris was president  of the Federal Reserve Bank \nof Boston, there was a raging debate underway about  monetary policy rules  – but the y were \ndifferent policy rules  than are currently used .  At that time, many economists were arguing for \nrules tied to simple money aggregates.  Frank was one of the leading voices at that time in \narguing that financial innovation had degraded the information content of money aggregates, and \nas a consequence, simple money -based  rules w ould be  poor guides for monetary policy.   \nWith the benefit of hindsight, I think it is clear that Frank Morris was right : simple \nmoney aggregate rules did not stand the test of time.  A review of the recent transcripts of FOMC \n\n EMBARGOED UNTIL 8:3 5 AM U.S. Eastern Time on Friday, October 13, 2017 OR UPON DELIVERY  \n4 \n meetings (released with a five -year lag) – and more recent minutes, public speeches, and \ntestimony – suggest s very little time spent discussing moneta ry aggregates at the FOMC . \n No simple policy rule has been widely adopted to direct policy at central banks around \nthe world.  One reason may be that picking the wrong rule can entail significant costs : an \nineffective or inappropriate rule could produce di stinctly sub -optimal results for the economy.  It \ncould also be  quite costly  to a central bank’s reputation and communication efforts if the rule has \nto be  abandoned as a consequence.  \n More modern policy rules , as first described by John Taylor in his 1993 and 1999 papers , \nhave significant advantages over simple money aggregate rules, as they are firmly tied to the \nultimate goals that Congress has set for the Federal Reserve (t he so -called dual mandate of \nmaximu m sustainable employment and price stability ) and to which it holds  the central bank \naccountable.  While the U.S. central bank has independence i n how best to achieve th ese goals , \nthe mandate i tself is provided by a democratically -elected government.  Thus , a policy rule that \nguide s actions  (interest rate decisions ) to reduce misses in the mandate  (deviations of inflation \nand employment from their targe ts) makes intuitive sense.   \n In my remarks today, I will highlight why I view policy rules tied to the central bank’s  \nmandate as extremely useful benchmarks.  I will show , using figures from FOMC briefings five \nyears ago that are now publicly available, that FOMC participants do indeed regularly refer to \npolicy rules .  However, the key point is that such briefings  refer to a variety of policy rules  – not \none rule alone – as different policy rules can give very different policy prescriptions .  Small \ndeviations in the rule can lead to dramatically different policy outcomes.  Of course, the same \nrecord will s how that FOMC participants  refer to a number of other non- rule benchmarks as \n\n EMBARGOED UNTIL 8:3 5 AM U.S. Eastern Time on Friday, October 13, 2017 OR UPON DELIVERY  \n5 \n well.1  My view is that it’s not just rule diversity that’s important, but  diversity in the overall \npolicy approach that builds in robustness. \nIn sum , I will attempt to document w hy benchmarking with policy rules  is essential  – as \nwell as  why legislating the use of simple  policy rules would, in fact , be quite counterproductive.  \n \nPolicy R ules as H elpful Guides  \n  Figure 1  shows the path of inflation over nearly 50 years.   The inflation rate certainly \nappears to behave quite  different ly prior to 1990 than after, with the earlier period reflecting  \nhigher average inflation rates and  larger  cyclical moves , and  the latter period showing less \nvolatility  and rates  centered around 2 to 3 percent.   \nCertainly , this change  in inflation dynamic s in part reflects central bank s’ efforts to fulfil l \ntheir key role of  ensuring price stability, which has been interpreted by many central banks as \nhaving an inflation target ar ound 2 percent.  As  central banks have consistently  worked to attain \na 2 percent inflation target, inflation expectations ha ve become “well -anchored” a round that 2 \npercent goal.   In fact, one of the major advantages of simple policy rules is that they can \nreinforce the expectation s of firms and households that inflation is likely  to re turn to 2 percent in \nthe future . \nFigure 2  shows the unemployment rate over nearly 50 years.  Unlike the inflation chart, \nthe broad dynamics  of the unemployment rate movements are more consistent over time .  One \nregularity of note is that unemployment always falls below its natural rate as the recovery \nmatures, and shortly thereafter rises noticeably above it.  While the Federal Reserve’s dual \n\n EMBARGOED UNTIL 8:3 5 AM U.S. Eastern Time on Friday, October 13, 2017 OR UPON DELIVERY  \n6 \n mandate involves  achiev ing a low but  sustainable unemployment rate, the chart suggests that \nmaintaining a low but sustainable unemployment rate has been quite difficult.   \n Because policy rules that encourage monetary policy makers  to move interest rates to \nachieve low sustainable unemployment and price stability are well-aligned with the Federal \nReserve’s  dual mandate, i t is, in fact , quite common for members of the FOMC to use such  \npolicy rules as benchmarks.  Figure  3 shows the set of policy rules provided during FOMC \nbriefings from 2011, the most recent  period for which  memos and transcripts are now publicly \navailable.2  Note that  there are several policy rules shown, including John Taylor’s rules from his \n1993 and 1999 paper s, as well as other variants commonly used in the literature.  T he variants of \nthe rules all have the dual mandate e mbedded in the ir specification s – that is , deviations from \npotential output (roughly equivalent to full employment ) and the inflation target generate a \nprescribed federal funds rate.  \n While the rules shar e many common attributes, the ir modest differences can g enerate \nvery different interest  rate “ solutions ,” as is shown in the table presented in Figure  4.  Note that \nthe interest rate recommended by this set of rules for the second quarter of 2012 ranged from \nnegative 2.15 to positive 0.59.  This wide dispersion in policy prescriptions highlights how \nsensitive these models can be to relatively modest  modeling differences.   A second important \nfeature to note is that all but one rule result ed in a prescription for negative interest rates, with \nthe rule based on John Taylor ’s 1999 paper implying an interest rate of - 2.15 percent  – a rate that  \nmight not be feasible in practice, given the  powerful  incentive it would create for holding cash.  \n \n \n\n EMBARGOED UNTIL 8:3 5 AM U.S. Eastern Time on Friday, October 13, 2017 OR UPON DELIVERY  \n7 \n Why a L egislated R ule Would B e Problematic  \nSince the Federal Reserve regularly refers  to monetary policy rules  in its monetary policy \ndeliberations , why not require the Fed to  follow a prescribed rule or a rule that it selects ?  While \nusing rules  to capture how the Fed has historically reacted to misses in the mandate is  quite \nuseful , as a benchmark, I would argue that rigid adherence to a rule would result in  a host of \nproblems. \n First, simple interest rate  rules do not capture the full range of policy instr uments \navailable to the central bank.  While some might view this as a positive feature of rules rather \nthan a design flaw, I do not.  Since the financial crisis, the Federal Reserve has – necessarily, and \nwith positive results – expanded its balance sheet, changed the composition of the balance sheet, \nand changed the duration of the balance sheet .  \n Figure 5  shows the size of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet over the past 25 years.  \nWhile the balance sheet was not used as a pol icy tool until  the Great Recession  and its aftermath , \nin my view, the Fed is  very likely  to need it again  in the future ,3 a consequence of living in a \nlow-inflation and low nominal interest rate environment.   Policy rules can , and – as seen in \nFigure  4 – actually did, imply negative short -term interest rates.  While modestly  negative policy \nrates have been used by some central banks, the existence of zero -return cash still makes the use \nof significantly  negative policy rates problematic  under current insti tutional arrangements.  As a \nresult, rather than adopt negative rates , the Federal Reserve, like many other central banks , \nexpanded its  balance sheet  when additional accommodation was needed .  And – a s Figure 6  \nshows  – the Fed also changed the composition of its  balance sheet , increasing the fraction of \nlonger -maturity Treasury securities, and adding government -guaranteed mortgage -backed \nsecurities .   \n\n EMBARGOED UNTIL 8:3 5 AM U.S. Eastern Time on Friday, October 13, 2017 OR UPON DELIVERY  \n8 \n Once short -term interest rates had reached the effective lower bound, t hese actions were \nundertaken to low er longer -term interest rates so as to provide additional macroeconomic \nstimulus, consistent with the negative -rate signals being sent by many simple policy rules.  These \nactions seem to have flattened  the Treasury yield curve  and reduced interest rates  relative to the \nTreasury yield curve.  \n Unfortunately, as I have noted in the past , low productivity, low population growth, and \nlow inflation targets imply low equilibrium nominal interest rates.  As a result, it is quite likely in \nmy view that short -term interest rates may again  hit the effective lower bound in future \nrecessions  – again necessitating policy tools not currently captured in most simple policy rules.  \n A second problem I see is that parameter s often specifi ed as constants  in simple policy \nrules have proven to be quite variable .  For example, i n many formulations of simple policy \nrules , the equilibrium real interest rate is set  as a constant.  However, Figure 7  shows that the \nFOMC members ha ve been reduc ing their  estimate s of the equilibrium real federal funds rate \nquite significantly.  ( This reflects changes in policymakers’  views of the rate that would be \nconsistent with no change in inflation and unemployment.)   Instead of being  constant, their  \nestimate s have moved – and moved enough to significant ly alter the expected number of quarter -\npoint increases required to reach the “normal” or equilibrium rate.  \n Another parameter that is often viewed as a constant in simple policy rules is the estimate \nof full employment or potential output .  Figure  8 shows that FOMC participants have moved \ntheir estimates of full employment quite significantly.  While I have argued elsewhere that these \nestimates may move too much, even more modest  changes would imply significant deviations \nfrom a policy rule that assumed  the natural unemployment rate  was a constant.   \n\n EMBARGOED UNTIL 8:3 5 AM U.S. Eastern Time on Friday, October 13, 2017 OR UPON DELIVERY  \n9 \n  Proposed legislation covering  monetary policy rule s requires explanations , which  can be \naudited , for any deviations in the proposed rule – or deviations from the prescriptions of the rule.  \nHowever, Figure  7 and Figure 8 illustrate why such explanations might be needed at many  \nFOMC meetings, given the changing view s of economic relationships as we get more \ninformation about how the economy is actually responding.  And because such explanations \nwould involve estimates of inherently unobservable concepts that are subject to significant \nuncertainty, one can imagine that  discussion around these explanations could become quite \ncomplicated.  \n Figure  9 shows how the actual interest rate prescription emanating from a particular rule \nwould change given variation in key values – specifically, if one used values for full employme nt \n(the non- accelerating inflation rate of unemployment , or NAIRU) and the equilibrium real rate of  \ninterest that reflect the variation over the past five years in FOMC  participants’ median estimates \nin the Fed’s Summary of Economic Projections , or SEP .  The first line examines the past five  \nyears using John Taylor ’s 1993 rule with an estimate of a real interest rate  of 2.25 percent and a  \nNAIRU of 5 .45 percent , similar to the assumptions in the January 2012 SEP.  The second line \nuses a 1993 Taylor rule with a  0.75 percent estimate of the equilibrium real rate of interest and a \nNAIRU of 4.6 percent , similar to the estimates from the September  2017 SEP.4  The two lines  \nare quite different , using the same rule but different estimates of the real equilibrium  interest rate \nand NAIRU – reflecting the actual estimates of  FOMC participants over the past five  years.   \nNote that the differences in the two lines are material, in the context of monetary policy \ndecisions. \n \n \n\n EMBARGOED UNTIL 8:3 5 AM U.S. Eastern Time on Friday, October 13, 2017 OR UPON DELIVERY  \n10 \n Do S imple Policy R ules Capture Actual Policy Reaction ? \nFigure  10 shows  errors in estimating the 1993 Taylor rule, with recession shading and \nlines tied to various periods of financial instability.  The  chart shows that the simple 1993 Taylor \nrule does not do a particularly good job of tracking how the FOMC actually moved the federal \nfunds rate, particularly during periods of financial instability.  In a paper I wrote with Joe Peek  \nand Geoff  Tootell ,5 we analyzed how policy reacts not only to inflation and unemployment, but \nto financial stability concerns , as reflected in mentions of financial stability in the FOMC \ntranscripts.6  The paper more rigorously shows that concerns about financial stability , which are \nnot modeled in the Taylor rule, are reflected in FOMC actions.  \nThis reflects differences in how FOMC participants think about variables that the rules, \nand rules legislation , treat as constants  or are not included at all .  It also  possibly  reflects the use \nof different weights on inflation and unemployment rate misses, and the use of forecasts rather \nthan outcomes .  But it  also reflects the fact that , in practice, the  Federal Reserve reacts to \nfinancial stability shocks.  \n The leading example for  this point  is the last financial crisis.  In 2007, t he actual federal \nfunds rate decreased much sooner than would have been implied by the 1993 Taylor rule.  In the \ncase of 2007, a much slower reaction to the impending fi nancial problems would have \nexacer bated what was already a very serious economic downturn.   \nThe failure to incorporate financial stability, or anything that reflects “ tail risks ” rather \nthan expected outcomes, will not fully capture how policymakers react in real time.  During \nrecessions and financial crises, this can be a significant omission.  \n \n\n EMBARGOED UNTIL 8:3 5 AM U.S. Eastern Time on Friday, October 13, 2017 OR UPON DELIVERY  \n11 \n Conclu ding Observat ions \nSimple policy rules are useful for many reasons , not least  of which is in capturing how \nmonetary polic y has reacted historically.  This makes these rules very useful benchmarks, \nproviding  useful guidance on how current policymakers are acting relative to how earlier FOMC \nparticipants reacted to misses o n inflation and full employment.   \nHowever,  a legisla ted policy rule that is rigid c ould lead to large policy mistakes , as key \ninputs to policy rules  that can change over time are estimated with substantial error.  From  my \nperspective, policy effectiveness will be better served, instead, by a  more robust  formulation of \nmonetary policy  that draws on a diverse set of guidelines and benchmarks  – which is the exercise \nFed policymakers conduct every six weeks for actual FOMC meetings.  \nThank you, and again I extend a warm welcome to all of you participating in the \nconference.  \n \n                                                           \n1 Such as : a variety of optimal policy simulations, equilibrium real rate comparisons, and alternative scenarios.  \n \n2 For more information on the historical use of monetary policy rules, see: \nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/20170707_mprfullreport.pdf  .  \n \n3 For additional perspective on use of the Federal Reserve balance sheet as a mo netary policy tool, see April 2017 \nremarks by Eric S.

I would like to thank the Department of Economics at Northeastern \nUniversity for having me here today to share my views on the economy  and monetary \npolicymaking .  At the outset, let me note as I always do that the views I express today are my \nown, not necessarily those of my colleagues at the Federal Rese rve’s Board of Governors or on \nthe Federal Open Market Committee (the FOMC).  \nEach year at the January meeting of the FOMC, the Committee  adopts what is called the \nStatement on Longer -Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy .1  This document  represents the \nframework that th e FOMC will use to achieve the dual mandate that  Congress  has set for the \nFed: maximum employment and  stable prices.   \n\n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, November  15, 2017, at 4:10 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time, or UPON DELIVERY*  \n \n3 \n Let’s consider those two elements of the  mandate for a moment.  For much of the \nrecovery from the Great R ecession , the unemployment rate has been too high, and the inflation \nrate too low  – consistent with an economy facing serious  difficulties.   Those outcomes clearly \njustified the highly accommodative monetary policy that the Federal Reserve deployed .  \nHowever, more recently , as economic conditions have improved, inflation has remained \nstubbornly  below the Fed’s  2 percent inflation target ,2 while the unemployment rate has declined \nso much that it is now well below the level viewed by most FOMC participants as a sustai nable \nunemployment  rate.3   \nLow inflation would, of course, justify more s timulative monetary policy, other things \nbeing equal, while quite low unemployment might suggest tighter monetary policy.  How should \nthe FOMC balance the dilemma implicit in the current  readings on the se two element s of the \nFed’s mandate?  \nFortunately, the current S tatement on Longer -Run Goals provides  some guidance.  \nSpecifically, i t states: “U nder circum stances in which the Committee judges that the objective s \nare not complementary, it fol lows a balanced approach in promoting them, taking into ac count \nthe magnitude of the devi ations and the potentially different time horizons over which \nemployment and inflation are projected to return to levels judged consistent with it s mandate. ”   \n In this, the Statement provides some useful  guidance for navigating  the current \ncircumstances .  First, Committee participant s must determine the magnitude of the deviations  of \nthe dual mandate variables from their desired levels .  Simply put , how far is inflation from the  2 \npercent goal , and how far  are we from maximum sustainable employment?   Calculating the \ninflation  deviation is straightforward ; the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) measure of \ntotal inflation in the U.S. is currently  1.6 percent , and the Fed’s  inflation goal is 2 percent , so the \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, November  15, 2017, at 4:10 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time, or UPON DELIVERY*  \n \n4 \n deviation is 0.4 percentage points .  The unemployment deviation, however,  is more difficult to \nassess, as maximum sustainable  employment and the related concept of the natural rate of \nunemployment are only estimates .  Central bankers must infer the  level indirectly, using \ninformation in wages, prices, expectations, and labor market conditions.  What’s more, e stimates \nof the natural rate of unemployment in the economy vary over time , due t o demographic and \nother changes in the workforce , or changes in the efficiency with which workers find jobs.   \nAs a result, there is unavoidable uncertainty  in gauging whether the economy  is at \nmaximum sustainable employment, and how large the gap is  – unl ike the situation with the \ninflation gap.  Still, today I will show  a few indicators that suggest  to me that even with  some \ninherent uncertainty in estimating maximum sustainable employment, the economy seem s to \nhave moved beyond that point in recent quart ers, and will likely continue to move further away – \nsince most forecasters expect real GDP growth to exceed potential for the next several quarters . \nReturning to the guidance  offered in the FOMC’s Statement on Longer -Run Goals , the \nCommittee must also e stimate  how long employment and inflation will deviate from the Fed’s  \ngoals.  This is a bit more difficult.  M onetary policy works with lags, typically long and variable, \nand there are many factors – other than monetary policy  – that impact inflation and \nunemployment .  In part for these reasons, forecasts of unemployment and inflation are subject to  \nsubstantial error.  Nonetheless , forecasts are the only means policymakers have for assessing \nhow long we are likely to deviate from the Fed’s dual mandate, so we must rely on them .   \nAt the same time, policymakers must also  be alert to  systematic errors in forecast s that \nmay reflect chang es in underlying relationships.  In this regard it will be important to consider \nwhy inflation has recently been coming in  lower than projected.  \n \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, November  15, 2017, at 4:10 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time, or UPON DELIVERY*  \n \n5 \n Deviations from the Federal Reserve’s  Mandate  Goals  \n Figu re 1 provides total and core PCE  inflation since 2012.  Total PCE inflation is \ncurrently 1.6 percent, which – as mentioned earlier  – is 0.4 percent age points  below  the Federal  \nReserve’s  2 percent target.   \nWhile it is not surprising that inflation was below the Fed’s target early in th e recovery  \nperiod, when there was significant labor market slack, policymakers had expect ed inflation to \ngradually return to 2 percent  as the economy reached or surpassed full employment – as long as \ninflation expectations remained  well -anchored  around the central bank’s inflation goal .  Recall \nthat while the Fed’s  inflation objective is expressed in terms of  total  PCE inflation, reading s on \ncore PCE inflation, which exclude volatile food and energy prices, are  important because they \ngenerally provide a more reliable indicator of the underlying trends in inflation.  Earlier this year , \ntotal inflation exceeded the Fed eral Reserve ’s 2 percent inflation target .  But core inflation has \nremained below that  target for the past five years.   \nFigure 2  shows the  widely reported U -3 unemployment rate , along with an estimate of \nthe natural rate of unemployment from the Summary of Economic Projections (SEP) .  As the \nfigure indicates, t he unemployment rate has fallen steadily over the past five years, and is now \nbelow FOMC participants’ most recent 4.6 percent median estimate of the natural rate of \nunemployment.  It should be noted that this current  estimate of the natural rate is about 0.2 \npercentage points below the estimate that was published at the time of the December 2016 \nFOMC meeting.  At 4.1 percent , we are currently 0.5 percent age points  below the FOMC ’s \nmedian estimate of the natural  unemployment rate.  My own estimate of the natural rate of \nunemployment, 4.7 percent , has not fallen over the past year , and implies an  unemployment rate \n0.6 percent age points  below what I view as the sustainable  rate.  \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, November  15, 2017, at 4:10 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time, or UPON DELIVERY*  \n \n6 \n Hence it appears that the weak inflation number is in opposition to (rather than consistent \nwith)  the strong employment number.  However, as mentioned earlier , the natural rate of \nunemployment  is not measured , but rather is estimated; as a result it is  of course  possible t hat \nthere may be more labor market slack th an is implied by Fed policymakers’ estimates of the \nnatural rate based on the U -3 unemployment rate.  I will turn to that question now. \n \nHow M uch L abor M arket S lack Do We C urrently  Have ? \nOne way to assess  whether the unemployment rate (the widely reported U -3 rate) is \nactually below its  sustainable rate is to see if other labor market indicators also indicat e a lack of \nslack in the labor market.   To preview the punch line, the data I will walk you through seem \nconsistent with labor markets being quite tight.   \nFor example, initial claims for u nemployment insurance  (which are derived from \nindividuals filing for unemployment compensation in their state , rather than from  the household \nsurvey that serves as the basis for the unemployment rate) , provide a n indicat ion from an \nalternative  data source.  Figure 3  shows the four -week moving average of initial claims for \nunemployment insurance.4  Despite the  spikes in the weeks around hurricanes, initial claims are \ncurrently at lows last seen over 40 years ago.  T hese lows could reflect firms ’ reluctan ce to fire \nworkers given the difficulty to hire replacements, or workers ability to quickly find jobs so that \nthey never actually file for unemployment .  Either explanation is consistent with unusually tight \nlabor markets.  \nFigure 4  shows similar information from a nother source . The Bureau of Labor Statistics \n(BLS) designates all working -age persons as either employed, unemployed (not working and \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, November  15, 2017, at 4:10 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time, or UPON DELIVERY*  \n \n7 \n searching for employment), or outside of the labor force (not working and not looking for \nemployment) .  The BLS provides data on gross flows  among these conditions  beginning  in 1990 \n– and the figure shows that the gross flow from employment to unemployment, scaled by the size of the labor force, is at its lowest point in decades.  This fact is consistent with the message from the initial claims data: separations from employme nt to unemployment are now rare.  \nFigure 5  shows the flow  of people moving from not in the labor force to unemployed, \nscaled by the size of the labor force .  This flow  results from new entrants to the labor force and \nfrom individuals who had previously stopped working , or stopped looking for work, but who \nhave begun to search for employment  again.  The current value is  the lowest point since the start \nof the Great Recession  and close to the overall low over the more than 25 years .  Such a low \nreading may  reflect firms actively seeking and employing workers who are not currently \nsearching , or who just began their search – or individuals who search and quickly find work.   \nFigure 5 shows that the flow of workers who are outside of the labor force moving to \nunemployment  is low,  but Figure 6   shows that the flow of sidelined workers moving to \nemployment  is high  (Figure 6  shows  the flow  of people from not in the labor force moving to \nemployed, scaled by the size of the labor force ).  These patterns are good news for individuals \nwho might have left the labor market when it was weaker, or who were discouraged from looking for jobs at that time.  But the patterns also suggest that the labor market is getting quite tight.  \nFigure 7  shows average hourly earnings and the employment cost index , excluding  \nincentive -paid occupations.  Both series have c learly been trending up over the past five years.  \nThey are now at levels roughly consistent with a long -run full -employment benchmark, t he sum \nof the  inflation rate plus productivity  growth .  However, because most forecasters expect that the \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, November  15, 2017, at 4:10 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time, or UPON DELIVERY*  \n \n8 \n unemployment rate will continue to fall – and remain well below the natural rate for some time  – \none can reasonably expect further increases in wages and salaries.  \nOverall, the data seem quite consistent with labor markets being quite tight.  All of the \ndata we  have just surveyed – U -3 unemployment below its sustainable rate, historic lows in \ninitial claims , labor flows that avoid spells of unemployment, and gradually rising wages and \nsalaries – are consistent with tight labor markets.   \n \nHow L ong Will D eviations from the D ual M andate P ersist ? \n Turning to t he expected longevity of d eviations from the dual mandate goals , I would \nfirst acknowledge that these, like all forecasts, are  subject to uncertainty .  As suggested above, it \nis well- known that forecasts of economic variables  have been subject to sizeable errors.  Still, \nFOMC participants’ forecasts from the most rece nt SEP can provide an idea of the expected \nduration of deviations, as well as the uncertainty surrounding these forecasts.  \n Figure 8  provides the unemployment forecast from the September SEP .  The chart shows \nthat the median forecast for the unemployment rate remains below the C ommittee’s estimate of \nthe long er-run unemployment rate of 4.6, and continue s to do so through 2020.  In addition, the \nupper end of the shaded area, which represents the range (or central tendency)  of forecasts , \nexcluding  the top and bottom three forecasts , also remains below 4.6 through 2020.  Clearly , \nFOMC participants expect the unemployment rate gap to be fairly persistent.  \n Figure 9  shows similar information for total PCE  inflation .  The inflation rate closes in \non 2 percent next year, and the median forecast hits 2 percent in 2019.  In addition, some \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, November  15, 2017, at 4:10 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time, or UPON DELIVERY*  \n \n9 \n members of the Committee  expect to reach 2 percent in 2018 and to  overshoot the target  in 2020.  \nFigure 10 shows similar information for core PCE  inflation,  which follows  a similar pattern.  \n In summary, the forecasts of FOMC participants imply that the current and expected  \ndeviations from the inflation target are likely to be relatively short -lived .  However, the \ndeviations of unemployment f rom its  sustainable rate are likely to be persistent .  If one assumes \nthese forecasts are reasonable, then the  “balanced approach ” outlined in the Committee’s \nframework document likely implies a continued gradual removal of accommodation to reach a \nlevel of the federal funds rate that is closer to its longer -run value .  Indeed, the se forecasts of \ninflation and unemployment deviations generally assume some further increase in interest rates , \nwhich strengthens the case for additional tightening going forward.   \n \nAre FOMC Participants  Wrong A bout t he Inflation F orecast ? \n While the forecasts of most participants imply a return to 2 percent, it is possible that \nthese forecasts are based on faulty assumptions about inflation dynamics.  If one believes  that \ninflation dynamics have changed, one might prefer to wait to learn more about how – and \nperhaps why – inflation will actually evolve .   \n One explanation for persistently low inflation is the role of more globalized markets.  \nIncreased competition from  abroad might make it difficult for domestic firms to rais e prices.  \nWhile  a significant proportion of the U nited S tates economy consists of goods and services that \nare non -tradeable, and thus less subject to such pressures, a significant increase in competition \nfrom abroad could compress margin s for those sectors most impacted by foreign competition.   \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, November  15, 2017, at 4:10 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time, or UPON DELIVERY*  \n \n10 \n Figure 11  shows the annual imports to the U .S., measured relative to GDP.  While there \nwas a large decline in imports relative to GDP as a result of the financial crisis, imports picked \nup in the immediate aftermath of the crisis.  However, over the past four years , imports have \nbeen playing a less significant r ole relative to GDP.  The falling share of imports seem s to argue \nagainst foreign goods  significantly replaci ng U.S. demand  recently . \n Another reason sometimes cited for changed inflation dynamics is the notion that the \nenhanced competition created by emer ging technologies has left firms  with  no pricing power.  \nFigure 12  provides a measure of after-tax corporate profits, after capital consumption and \ninventory valuation adjustments , over the past 50 years .  What is striking is how profitable firms \nare now relative to the past, which seems inconsistent with increased competition and a resulting inability to raise prices to maintain profit margins.  \n An alternative view is that there have been idiosyncratic p rice changes that have had the \neffect of artificially lower ing measured inflation in a manner  which should abate over time.  \nFigure 13  shows four  Consumer Price Index ( CPI) categories  – communication, food away from  \nhome , rent of primary residence, and own ers’ equivalent rent.  The communication component of \nthe CPI dropped significantly last spring as a result of change s in wireless pricing  that are likely \nto be a one -time event  – and thus will not have a persistent effect on inflation.     \nThe other three  categories  in the figure – food away from home, owner’s equivalent rent, \nand rent of primary residence – are areas that have been growing  faster than  2 percent.  H owever, \na recent Federal Reserve Bank of Boston policy brief by Luengo -Prado , Rao and She remirov \n(2017) indicates that these three  sectors have normally grow n even faster durin g periods  of tight \nlabor markets .  Their work finds evidence of a structural break in the inflation- unemployment \nrelationship described by the Phillips curve.  Figure 14  shows their results of running a statistical \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, November  15, 2017, at 4:10 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time, or UPON DELIVERY*  \n \n11 \n model (more precisely an augmented sectoral Phillips Curve)  through the third quarter of 2010 \nand then forecasting what would happen to prices if the historical relationship between \nunemployment and sectoral pr ices was unchanged in the subsequent seven years .5   \nAs shown in Figure 14, on average, inflation readings for the three categories are \nundershooting their historical relationship by about 0.5 percent age points, due to their smaller \nresponse to tight labor  markets .  It is worth noting that these are not sectors that are likely to be \nparticularly impacted by global pricing pressures or new technologies.  \nThus, my own conclusion is that temporarily lower price s in the communication  sector  –  \nalong with the more restrained , but still noticeable,  response to low unemployment in these three \nsectors  – help explain the recent misses in the Federal Reserve’s  inflation target.  These findings \nsuggest that while inflation has been low , due to temporary factors, the pattern of observed \ninflation is still consistent with SEP forecasts of a gradual rise toward the 2 percent target in \ncoming quarters.   \n \nConcluding Observations  \n Inflation remains below the Federal Reserve’s  target , which might suggest added patience \nin removing accommodation, given that the economy is below the equilibrium rate of interest .  \nAt the same time, the unemployment rate is currently below the level  most FOMC participants \nthink will be sustainable , which would suggest the  additional removal of accommodation.  How \nshould the FOMC balance these somewhat conflicting factors?  The Statement on Longer -Run \nGoals and Monetary Policy Strategy provides guidance  for following a balanced approach.   \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, November  15, 2017, at 4:10 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time, or UPON DELIVERY*  \n \n12 \n While the se so-called  “misses”  in the mandate are  of rela tively similar magnitudes \ncurrently, most forecasts expect th e inflation “ miss” to be temporary , but the unemployment \n“miss” to be  more persistent.  While low inflation allows  monetary policy makers  to remove \naccommodation gradually, it remains the case – in my view  – that a gradual increase in interest \nrates is the balanced approach to reachin g both of the Federal Reserve’s  mandates in the next \nseveral years.  \n While it is possible that there is still slack in the economy, most labor market indicators \nseem  quite consistent with tight labor markets.  While it is also possible that inflation dynamics \nare changing, globalization and technology changes do not seem as compelling  an explanation \nfor recent inflation misses  as temporary idiosyncratic factors , coupl ed with a somewhat flatter \nPhillips Curve.  This inference is consistent with FOMC participants expecting to see a return to \nthe 2 percent  inflation target within  the next two years .  However , the unemployment rate is \nlikely to remain below its sustainable rate for a good deal longer .   \nMy own view is that it is quite likely that unemployment will fall below 4 percent, which \nis likely to increase pressures on inflation and asset prices.  In my view, that suggests  the need to \ncontinue to gradual ly remove monetary policy accommodation, which is quite consistent with \nmarket expectations of another increase in December . \n Thank you.  \n                                                           \n1 See https://www.federalreserve.gov/faqs/statement -on-longer -run-goals -monetary -policy -strategy -fomc.htm .  \n  \n2 The Federal Reserve associates a 2 percent level of inflation with price stability and a well-functioning economy.  \n \n3 For additional discussion of what the Federal Reserve considers to be full employment, see  January 2017 remarks \nby Chair Janet L.

Thank you for the invitation to speak with you today. As we begin 2016, \nwe should acknowledge the significant improvement we saw in the U.S. economy  over the past  \nyear, which enabled policymakers to raise short -term rates in December .  That good news \ncontinued with last Friday’s  release of the latest  employment report ; the economy produced \n292,000 jobs in December , and we saw an average of  284,000 jobs added per  month over the \npast quarter .  Since  the unemployment rate remain ed at 5 percent, it suggests  that people \npreviously not in the labor force are entering the labor force and finding jobs.  In addition, tighter \n\n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL January  13, 201 6 at 8:20 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *  \n \n \n \n2 \n labor markets have  helped reduce unemployment in  some  segments  of the labor market that still \nhave elevated unemployment rates.1 \nWhile the last employment report was quite strong, other news around  the start of the \nNew Year has been less positive.  Stock markets in much of the world began the year on a \ndecidedly  weak note , with declines in the Chinese stock market generating particular attention.  \nThese declines have been accompanied by weak oil and commodity prices, furthering the \nconcern  that global growth has slowed significantly .  In addition, estimates of growth for f ourth \nquarter real GDP in the United States have been falling, raising the possibility  that domestic \ngrowth could be slowing.  While monetary policy should not overreact to short -term, temporary \nfluctuations in financial markets, policy makers should  take seriously the potential downside \nrisks to their economic forecasts and manage those risks as we think about the appropriate path \nfor monetary policy.   \n Also, since I will be covering a lot of ground and some key charts, data, and nuances of \nthe financial system, I would like to preview  my “punch line ,” so to speak:  \n The economy has reached an important milestone:  the central bank  raised short -term \nrates last month, reflecting the significant progress the U.S. economy has made  over \nthe course of the last year.   \n In terms of the monetary policy actions taken  by the Federal Reserve  in mid-\nDecember , the initial monetary policy tightening  was rather uneventful.  The effective \nfederal funds rate has  largely traded within the  new target range.  Other short -term \nrates in the marketplace have moved up as expected, and long -term rates  were little \nchanged .   \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL January  13, 201 6 at 8:20 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *  \n \n \n \n3 \n  The future path of the federal funds rate will depend on incoming economic data , \nmost importantly on how that incoming data affects policymakers’ outlook for the  \neconomy for the next year or two .  I hope the economy continues to improve, so that \nfurther normalization is appropriate .  It is important , however,  to carefully manage \nrisks to the economy, including those emanating from abroad .   \n Further increases in rates are in my view likely to be gradual.  \n \nLet me note that the views I will express are my own, not necessarily those of my \ncolleagues at the Federal Reserve’s Board of Governors or on the Federal Open Market \nCommittee (FOMC).  \n \nThe Beginning of Policy N ormalization  \nThe national unemployment rate started 2015  at 5.7 percent , and, over the course of the \nyear, fell to 5.0 percent .  Much of this decline result ed from  new job creation, with 2.65 million \njobs created from January 2015 through December.    This is clearly good news for the economy , \nand it provided the conditions  necessary  for the Federal Reserve to finally begin remov ing some \nof the extraordinary monetary policy accommodation  that was the ne cessary , appropriate, and \neffective response to t he financial crisis, recession , and painfully slow recovery . \n With continued improvements in the economy, it is now appropriate for the U.S. central \nbank to gradually return to a more normalized monetary policy.  The first step in that gradual \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL January  13, 201 6 at 8:20 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *  \n \n \n \n4 \n process was December’s  increase in the federal funds rate  target  – the first rate increase  since the \nGreat Recession.   \nMy own assessment is that th e first increase went quite smoothly .  At the December \nmeeting, t he FOMC  set a target  range  for the federal funds rate o f 0.25 to 0.50 percent, up a \nquarter of a percent (25 basis points) from the prior range of zero to 0.25 percent .  Since then , the \nfederal funds rate has tended to trade in the market around 0.36 percent , about the middle  of the \nnew target range .  In addition, financial markets  did not suffer any extreme swings around the \nrate increase, as some  observers  had predict ed.  Short -term rates moved  roughly in line with the \nfederal funds rate, and long-term rates such as the 10 -year Treasury rate remained nea r their \nlevels as of the middle of December , presumably because the Fed’s action was so widely \nanticipated .  All in all , the response  to the increase  was quite uneventful and not much different \nthan expected.    \nDespite th is solid  start, the extraordinarily high level of reserves in the banking system \nimpact s the monetary policy  normalization process , and will likely cause this tightening cycle to \nbe somewhat different than previous tightening cycles.  These reserves, I would point out, are the \nconsequence of the accommodative monetary policy that was  necessary after our policy rate \ndropped to essentially zero (or hit the zero lower bound) .  \nToday I plan to discuss some of the key features  of the current  gradual normalization \nprocess , and highlight how th ese differ from previous practice.  I think it is important to take \nsome time to describe them today  – since some of the elements are new and different ; and since \nthe mechanics of monetary policy are not especially well understood, but are deployed in the \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL January  13, 201 6 at 8:20 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *  \n \n \n \n5 \n public interest and to achieve  the Fed’s dual mandate from Congress  (maximum employment \nand stable prices ).  \nI will also discuss the outlook for the economy, particularly the lack of significant \ninflationary pressures  in the United States  and the weakness in many other parts of the world.  \nUsually the tightening cycle is , at least in part, a reflection that inflationary pressures have \nalready begun to build.  In contrast, today , core inflation has  yet to show a clear movement \ntowards the Federal Reserve’s 2 percent  target , and real GDP is projected to grow only \nsomewhat faster than potential.  All this should result in a monetary policy that moves more \ngradually than in past tightening cycles.  \n \nChang es in Monetary Policy Implementation  \n Monetary policy affects everyone, and for about eight years now monetary policymaking \nhas been in quite an extraordinary period of change and innovation  – of necessity , given  \nconditions in the U.S. economy  and aro und the world .  Today I would like  to walk you through \nsome of the recent and ongoing changes in monetary policy implementation  in the U.S., where , I \nwould suggest , aggressive action led to  results  that have actually been more favorable than in \nmany other industrialized countries.  \nFigure 1  reflect s the dramatic increase in the Federal Reserve ’s balance sheet that was a \nconsequence of the central bank  purchasing Treasury and mortgage -backed  securities, with the \naim of lowering long -term interest rates and offsetting some of the weakness brought on by  the \nfinancial crisis  and Great Recession .  In the mechanics of central banking,  we paid for these \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL January  13, 201 6 at 8:20 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *  \n \n \n \n6 \n asset s by crediting banks with newly created reserves, which is how all those reserves got into \nthe banking system.    \nPrior to the financial crisis, monetary policy operated by setting the target for the federal \nfunds rate, a short -term interest rate on overnight loans between banks .  It did so by ad justing the \namount of money in the banking system  – by adding or removing  reserves  through open market \noperations  – and thus lowering or raising the rate at which banks were willing to lend and borrow \nin this overnight market.2   For example, t he Federal Reserve could increase the supply of \nreserves by buying private ly held Treasury  securities , paying for the securities with reserves  and \nthus injecting more reserves into the banking system .  Because the amount of reserves in the \nsystem was relat ively modest , small purchases and sales were sufficient to alter the target (and \nactual) federal funds rate.  \n In response to the financial crisis, the Federal Reserve repeatedly  lowered the federal \nfunds rate , eventually reducing it s target  to effectively zero by  the end of 2008 .  But t he economy \nremained weak . To further stimulate the economy  with the federal funds rate at the zero lower \nbound , it was necessary to employ  different  monetary policy tool s.3, 4   \nWith the intent to  lower long -term interest rates , the Federal Reserve purchased Treasury \nsecurities and mortgage -backed securities .  As shown in Figure 2 , the purchase of these assets \ndramatically changed the Fed’s balance sheet  composition – from holding  primarily  short -term \nTreasury bills to holding a  large quantity of mortgage -backed securities and long -term Treasury \nsecurities.  As desired, t his had the effect  of lowering long -term rates  in the marketplace – with \nthe most direct  impact  on Treasury and mortgage -backed securities.  \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL January  13, 201 6 at 8:20 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *  \n \n \n \n7 \n  As shown in Figure 3, prior to the financial crisis there were relatively  few excess \nreserves  in the financial system , and the federal funds rate could be adjusted with very small \nchanges in the Federal Reserve ’s balance sheet  – the buying (or selling ) of securities mentioned  \nearlier .  After the financial crisis, the desire to influence  interest rates required  purchasing large \nquantities of securities .  And b ecause  the Federal Reserve paid for  these assets  with bank \nreserves, there was now a large quantity  of excess reserves  in the financial system .5  This large \nsupply  of excess reserves constitutes a tremendous surplus , which  would tend to keep the federal \nfunds rate at  or very near zero.    \nAs the economy improves, however, a federal funds rate close to zero is no longer \nappropriate.  But as I’ve described, the usual  way of raising the federal funds rate is not available  \nto policymakers .  Simply put , no modest sale of securities will remove  enough excess reserves \nfrom  the system to tighten borrowing conditions in the overnight federal funds market , because \nof the extremely large volume of excess reserves .  \nSo, to increase the federal funds rate this time, the Federal Reserve  needs to use new  \ntools.  These new tools are essentially borrowing facilities for which we control the interest rate, \nrather than relying on changing the balance of reserves in the banking system to influence \ninterest rates.  \nThese administered rates help us create  the top and bottom of the new target range for t he \nfederal funds rate.  Bear with me for a moment while I describe the mechanics.  \n Congress gave  the Federal Reserve the authorization  to pay interest on reserve s, effective \nOctober of 2008 .6  Paying interest  on reserves is an important tool as the Fed works to raise rates \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL January  13, 201 6 at 8:20 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *  \n \n \n \n8 \n – because banks can receive interest on reserves held overnight with the Federal Reserve, banks \nwill not want to lend at a rate below what they can get from holding funds with the Fed.   \nThere is a caveat, however , worth a short digressi on.  Non-banks do not hold funds at the \nFederal Reserve , and as  a result, some non -banks are willing to lend overnight funds slightly \nbelow the interest rate banks get on reserves.  This means that  the fede ral funds rate has trade d a \nbit below the interest rate on excess reserves ( the IOER ).7  Arbitrage plays a role, however, in \npulling rates in the market towards the IOER: Since banks can earn the IOER , if overnight rates \nfall too far below the IOER , banks can make money by buying overnight funds below the IOER \nand holding those funds at the Federal Reserve  where they  receive the IOER .8 \nTo insure that overnight rates will remain close to IOER  and maintain the bottom of the \nnew target range for the fed eral funds rate , the Federal Reserve has created another facility that \npurchases funds from non -banks at a rate slightly below IOER, currently at a rate of 0.25 \npercent , in a reverse repurchase agreement transaction .  Since the reverse repurchase  agreement \ntransaction is collateralized and transacted with the central bank, and thus essentially riskless, \nthese investors should be unwilling to lend at a rate less than the reverse repurchase rate to any \nother borrower.   \nBecause this option  is availab le not only to banks, but also to money market funds and \nother financial institutions, this more widely available  facility  insures that , normally , overnight \nrates will trade between the rate the Fed pays on the reverse repurchase facility and the interest \nrate the Fed pays on excess reserves .9  Again, th e rate on the reverse repurchase agreements  \nestablish es the bottom of the Fed’s target range for the federal funds rate.  \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL January  13, 201 6 at 8:20 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *  \n \n \n \n9 \n Figure 4  provides the interest rate paid on reserves, the overnight reverse repurchase  rate, \nand the effective federal funds rate  in the marketplace .  Prior to the December FOMC meeting , \nthe interest on reserves was set at 0.25 percent .  After the December FOMC meeting , the interest \non reserves was set at 0.50 percent  (the upper end of the target range) and the reverse rep urchase  \nrate was set at 0.25 percent  (the lower end) .  The effective federal funds rate has traded in \nbetween those two rates  – with the exception of December 3 1 – with the effective federal funds \nrate since  the December FOMC meeting  generally trading in the market at 0.36 percent .   \nThe f igure shows that the effective federal funds rate has adjusted just as desired, almost \nexactly in the middle of the target ranged established by the Federal Reserve , with the only \nexception  being  that rates fell below the floor on the last day of 2015.  This largely reflects firms \nlooking to shrink their balance sheet or make their positions look less risky for end -of-year \nreporting.  That situation aside, the policy -relevant interest rate moved as anticipated.  \nFigure 5  shows the volume of Federal Reserve overnight reverse repurchase agreements.   \nWith the federal funds rate trading well above the floor  on most days , the volume of reverse \nrepurchases has been generally in line with the experience prior to raising rates.  Granted , there \nwas elevated volume for one trading day at the end of the year,  as firms adjust ed balance sheets  \nwith end -of-year reporting in mind .  But t he end of year activity was only somewhat higher than \nthe volume experienced at recent quarter -ends.10\n \n \n \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL January  13, 201 6 at 8:20 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *  \n \n \n \n10 \n The Broader Impact of the  First Tightening  on Interest Rates  \n While the short -term interest rate targeted by the Federal Reserve did act as expected  \nsince the first increase , the goal of policymakers is of course to influence the broader economy . \nThat goal  requires that our short -term interest rate changes are transmitted to a much broader \narray of interest rates and asset prices.   It is impor tant that other short -term rates  that are \navailable to a broader set of investors also begin the process of normalization.  Figure 6  provides \nseveral one-month rates  – a commercial paper rate, the  London Interbank Offered Rate  (LIBOR ), \nand the Eurodollar deposit rate .  These rates increased during the month of December , likely \nbecause markets widely anticipated the Fed’s action .  This indicates that rates which  normally \nrespond to short -term expected changes in the federal funds rate have responded to the first \ntightening, beginning the normalization process for a broader set of short -term rates  in the \nmarketplace . \n Long -term rates are less directly impacted by the overnight federal funds rate.  While \ntighter monetary policy generally increases long rates  over time , other factors can significantly \ninfluence longer -term rates – things like prospects for inflation , the exchange rate , and the \ndemand for long -term Treasury securities .  Furthermore, the expectation of some tightening may \nalready have been built i nto longer -term rates, which are likely to be affected by the likely  path \nof rates as well as the current overnight rate.  As Figure 7  shows, longer -term rates did not \nrespond significantly to the first tightening, likely reflecting the fact that the FOMC statement \nindicated strongly that the path of tightening was expected  to be “only  gradual. ” \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL January  13, 201 6 at 8:20 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *  \n \n \n \n11 \n  Figure 8  shows that the Treasury curve remains well below that of 10 years ago , before \nthe financial crisis.   Thus while December’s  first increase was the beginning of normalization, \nrates remain well below their pre -crisis level s. \n \nThe Recent Policy Statement  \n While long -term Treasury rates reflect a variety of influences, the Federal Reserve ’s \nearlier decision  to purchase significant quantities of long -term Treasury securities is, in my view , \none reason for the low long -term rates  we now see .  It is important to point out that in  the \nstatement announcing the first rate increase, the FOMC said that it would continue  to reinvest \nprincipal payments until normalization of the federal funds rate was well underway.   \nThe logic  is to try to move short -term interest rates first, because  we have greater \nconfidence in the likely effects of such a move on the  economy, and also, because we  will then \nhave the flexibility to respond if necessary to a large unexpected negative shock  by reducing \nshort -term rates.11\n  Reduc ing the size of our balance sheet  would also be  a form of tightening, with more \nimpact on longer -term rates .  If we were to tighten in that way , we would presumably not need to \nraise short -term rates as much.  I am fully supportive of the strategy of focusing on short -term \nrates first , before allowing the balance sheet to shrink.  \n The F OMC  statement also s aid that “ The Committee expects that economic conditions \nwill evolve in a manner that will warrant only gradual increases in the federal funds rate.”  \n This gradual notion reflects our best understanding of the current economic landscape: \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL January  13, 201 6 at 8:20 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *  \n \n \n \n12 \n that the economy is growing relatively slowly for a tightening cycle, that the unemployment rate \nis expected to gradually hit full employment , and that inflation remains well below our 2 percent \ntarget  – and will gradually approach it as labor markets improve f urther and other factors that are \ntemporarily depressing inflation recede . \n \nUnemployment, Inflation, and Rates: Policymakers’ Forecasts  \n Figure 9  provides the unemployment rate projections through 2018 from Federal Reserve \npolicymakers.  These projections are provided in the Federal Reserve’s Summary of Economic \nProjections (SEP) on a quarterly basis.   The median forecast of Fed policymakers is fo r the \nunemployment rate to gradually drop to 4.7 percent and then remain there through 2018.  The 4.7 \npercent unemployment rate is consistent with my own estimate of full employment.  \nThe unemployment rate forecast carries some risks.   Figure 10 shows the p ath of the \nunemployment rate relative to the Congressional Budget Office’s (CBO) estimate of full \nemployment  (the “natural rate” of long -term unemployment) .  You can see that i t is relatively \nunusual to have long periods of unchanged unemployment.  Rather,  the unemployment rate tends \nto fall well below the CBO estimate of full employment during most recoveries.  Similarly, once \nthe unemployment rate begins to rise, it tends to increase well above the estimate of full \nemployment.    \n An unemployment rate fall ing more rapidly than in the forecast could potentially call for \na faster increase in the policy rate. However, such a risk should be managed within a context in \nwhich inflation has been typically lower than expected.12  Indeed, one reason for moving quite \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL January  13, 201 6 at 8:20 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *  \n \n \n \n13 \n gradually on rate increases is that low rates may be necessary to achieve our inflation target over \nthe next several years.  \nFigure 11  compares the core PCE rate of inflation with the Federal Reserve’s  2 percent \ninflation target.  The core PCE inflation rate is currently 1.3 percent , and has remained below the \n2 percent inflation target for most of the recovery.   \n The projections in Figure 12  suggest that Fed policymakers  expect to reach our inflation \ntarget  by 2018.  However, this path reflec ts only a gradual move ment  to the target, likely \ninformed by the “misses ” we have experienced (see Figure 11 ). \n Figure 13  shows the federal funds rate projections provided by Fed policymakers in the \nSEP.  The median interest rate observation for each year is designated by a black  diamond .  \nFigure 13  suggests  that the median forecast is for increases in the federal funds rate that sum to \nroughly 1 percent age point  (100 basis point s) in each of the next two years.  However, there are a \nnumber of participants that expect the rate to be below or above the median projection.   I should \nnote that if rates did rise at the rate of the median projection, they would rise much more \ngradually t han during the previous recovery.   \nWhile the median forecast provides a reasonable estimate of the likely path of the federal \nfunds rate, my own view is that such a forecast does have downside risks.  These downside risks \nreflect continued headwinds from weakness within countries that represent many of our major \ntrading partners , and only limited data to support the projected path of inflation to target seen in \nthe SEP, at least to date .  Further tightening will require data continuing to be strong enough that \ngrowth will be at or above potential , so that Federal Reserve policymakers  can be confident that \ninflation will reach our 2 percent target.  \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL January  13, 201 6 at 8:20 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *  \n \n \n \n14 \n Conclu ding Observations  \n In summary and  conclusion, t he economy has reached an important milestone.  The \nFederal Reserve raised short -term rates last month , reflecting the significant progress made by  \nthe U.S. economy .  Labor markets have tightened , and there is an expectation that we will begin \nto see the inflation rate move towards the Federal Reserve’s  2 percent target over the course of \n2016.  \nThe initial  increase in short -term rates was rather uneventful.  The Federal Reserve’s  \ntarget rate moved as expected , and the effective federal funds rate has largely traded within our \nband with the exception of a single day at year -end.  Other short -term rates have moved as \nexpected, and there was little change in long -term rates.  \nThe future path of the fede ral funds rate  will be highly dependent on our evolving \noutlook, which will, of course, respond to the incoming economic data.  My hope is that the \neconomy continues to improve, so that further normalization is appropriate.  Further increases in \nrates are  in my view  likely to be gradual .  Importantly, I will remain highly attentive to foreign \neconomic conditions , any weakening of the domestic economic situation , and the path of  U.S. \ninflation.  \nThank you , and best wishes for a successful 2016 . \n    \n                                                           \n \n1 For example, those having less than a high school diploma.  \n \n2 Banks are required to hold bank reserves on transactions accounts, and banks with excess reserves would sell \nreserves to banks that were falling short of the reserves needed to meet their reser ve requirement.   \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL January  13, 201 6 at 8:20 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *  \n \n \n \n15 \n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n \n3 At first, in response to the events in the fall of 2008, the Federal Reserve created liquidity programs that facilitated \ntransactions in markets where there were no buyers, in order to unfreeze financial markets that had become \nessentially paralyzed.   \n \n4 And although the federal funds rate target was essentially zero, other l onger -term rates remained notic eably above \nzero.  \n \n5 The Federal Reserve determines the total volume  of reserves.  Thus when the Federal Reserve expands its balance \nsheet , the banking system must hold these reserves.   \n \n6 The Financial Services Regulatory Relief Act of 2006 originally authorized the Federal Reserve to begin paying \ninterest on balances held by or on behalf of depository institutions beginning October 1, 2011. The recently \nEmergency Economic Stabilization Ac t of 2008 accelerated the effective date to October 1, 2008.  See \nhttp://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/20081006a.htm  and \nhttp://www.frbsf.org/education/publications/doctor -econ/2013/march/federal -reserve -interest -balances -reserves . \n \n7 This can be explained, in part, because a number of key entities wit h excess funds to lend cannot by law receive \ninterest on reserves. But there is likely a limit to how far below the IOER the federal funds rate can fall, as the \nincentive to park money in reserves rather than lend at the funds rate becomes large as the IOE R rises significantly \nabove the funds rate.  \n \n8 Banks will not want to hold assets that don’t pay at least the interest rate on reserves, but other institutions that do \nnot hold reserves at the Federal Reserve (for example , money market funds ) or do not rec eive interest on their \nreserves  (for example, Fannie Mae) may lend funds at a rate somewhat below the Fed’s rate of interest on reserves. \nThus , the federal funds rate has traded below the rate of interest paid on reserves, because these non -bank firms are \nlending overnight funds at a rate slightly below the interest on reserves available to banks. If their rates fall too low, \nbanks could always arbitrage the market by providing funds to those market participants and holding the funds as \nexcess reserves, whi ch would earn them the Fed’s rate of interest on reserves.  However, because of regulatory \nrequirements, including capital requirements, banks will only do this arbitrage at a rate somewhat below the rate of \ninterest on reserves.  In the absence of regulat ion, with costless arbitrage, everyone would receive the interest on \nreserves as the floor at which they were willing to lend.  \n \n9 The reverse repurchase agreement is, in effect, a loan to the Federal Reserve collateralized by Treasury securities, \nin which the Federal Reserve sells Treasury securities and agrees to buy them back the next day at a slightly higher \nprice.  The difference between the sale price and repurchase price of the securities is essentially the interest earned \non the reverse repurchase ag reement.  It, in effect, provides a risk -free rate at which counterparties, including non -\nbanks, can invest their funds.   \n \n10 The jump at year -end looks less unusual relative to the previous quarter -end (September 30, 2015) when term \nreverse repurchase agreements (RRPs) are also included.  Aggregate overnight and term RRP s outstanding at the end \nof September totaled  approximately $450 billion, only somewhat less than at year -end. Because overnight RRPs had \nno limits on usage, t here was no demand for term reverse repurchase agreements at year -end.   \n \n11 Moving short -term rates represents the tool we have had the most experience with , and as a result there can be \nmore confidence in how it influences the ec onomy.  \n \n12 The tendency for core inflation to be lower tha n forecast  could reflect the fact that the equilibrium unemployment \nrate is lower than my current estimate.",

I would like to thank Josef Tosovsky and the Financial Stability Institute  \nof the Bank for International Settlements  for the invitation  to discuss progress  in the United \nStates  on eliminating the “too big to fail” phenomenon .1   This is an important topic,  and one that \nhas received extensive attention by bank regulators  and supervisors  in the United States.    \nOf course, the views I will express today are my own, not necessarily those of my \ncolleagues at the Federal Reserve’s Board of Governors or on the Fed eral Open Market \nCommittee (FOMC).  \n\n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL February 4 , 2016 at 2:15 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time  and 9:15 A.M. in Cape Town, South Africa  OR UPON DELIVERY *  \n \n \n \n2 \n In the wake of the financial crisis , the primary legislative response in the U.S. was \nenactment of the Dodd -Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act.  The Act begins \nwith the following  phrases : \n“To promote the  financial stability of the United States by improving \naccountability  and transparency in the financial system, to end ‘too big to fail ,’ to \nprotect  the American taxpayer by ending bailouts, to protect consumers from \nabusive  financial services practices, a nd for other purposes …” \n \nThis language suggests little ambiguity about the intent of Congress , stressing that the \nlegislative response to the crisis was intended to end “too big to fail ” (which I’ll refer to today as \nTBTF)  and end financial -sector  bailouts.  The regulations necessary to carry out this intent are \nquite extensive , and despite the legislation being enacted in 2010, some of the regulations are \nstill being finalized by the regulatory agencies or are being phased in over a number of years . \nBoth the Dodd -Frank legislation and the regulations implementing it involve  a wide \nvariety of topics  relevant to , and designed to address,  TBTF .  Today , I will focus my remarks on \ntwo areas where there has been substantial progress :   \n The f irst area involves increased capital buffers  aimed at reducing the  probability  \nof failures .  The largest financial institutions – which  had been thinly capitalized \ngoing into the financial crisis – have significantly increased their capital , as a \nresult of a variety of supervisory and regulatory ini tiatives designed to reduce the \nprobability of failure.  Today I will highlight two tools in particular  – \nComprehensive Capital Analysis and Review ( CCAR ) stress testing , and the U.S. \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL February 4 , 2016 at 2:15 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time  and 9:15 A.M. in Cape Town, South Africa  OR UPON DELIVERY *  \n \n \n \n3 \n Global Systemically Important Bank Holding Compan y (GSIB) capital surcharge  \n– which  have contributed to higher capital ratios.   \n \n The s econd  area involves  steps to reduce spill -over from one troubled institution \nto others  – essentially, reducing the cost of failures .  A variety of actions , most of \nwhich  are in the process of being implemented , would reduce the likelihood that a \nlarge financial institution ’s failure would end up being a systemic ally \ndestabilizing  event.  These actions include  requiring banks to issue enou gh debt \nso that taxpayer funds w ould not be necessary in the event of a resolution , and  \nrequiring  firms to provide resolution plans  to regulators  with the goal  that a  \nfailure would not have a broad impact on the overall economy .   \n \nBefore launching into th ese two topic s, let me just briefly mention some other areas that \nare important an d relevant to TBTF , but which our time constraints will not allow me  to address \nin any depth today.   \nThe first such issue is the shift in  the clearing of some derivat ives to  central \ncounterparties ( discussed last November by Bill Dudley of the New York Fed , and Governor \nJerome  Powell of the Fed eral Reserve ’s Board of Governors ).2  During the  financial crisis that \nbegan in the fall of 2008 , the vast number of firm -to-firm derivatives transactions made it \ndifficult to assess the extent of counterparty risk , as there was no central conduit through which \nthese transactions flowed and were recorded.  Now, because many more derivative contracts are \nbeing centrally clear ed, transparency about derivative exposures has been improved .  In addition, \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL February 4 , 2016 at 2:15 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time  and 9:15 A.M. in Cape Town, South Africa  OR UPON DELIVERY *  \n \n \n \n4 \n recent regulations will increase  margin requirements on those derivative contracts  that are  not \ncentrally cleared .   \nA second important issue we will not have as much time to cover today is the  application \nof regulations to non-bank , systemically important financial institutions.  During the crisis, a \nlarge insuran ce company, AIG, had extensive  derivatives exposure that generated s ignificant  risk \nto counterpart ies.  In addition, some non-bank  financial institutions were poorly supervised at the  \nholding company level; others were significantly impaired by their dependence on short -term \nwholesale funding  when such funding virtually di sappeared in the fall of 2008  (as discussed by \nFed Governor Dan Tarullo  in speeches last fall ).3  To address these problems, the Financial \nStability Oversight Counsel (FSOC) – the federal agency charged with, among other things, \nidentifying and addressing threats to U.S. financial stability – can designate  non-bank  financial \ninstitutions as systemically important , thus  subject ing them to supervision by the Federal \nReserve  and enhanced prudential standards .4 \nA third  matter involve s the extensive use of Federal Reserve liquidity facilities during the \nfinancial crisis by U.S. operations of foreign banking organizations.  Specifically, m any of these \norganizations turned to Fed faci lities because they were highly dependent on short -term \nwholesale funding , which  dried up  during the financial crisis .  As a consequence, l arge foreign \nbanking organizations are now required to form intermediate holding companies covering most \nof their activities in the United Stat es.  This is an effort to  increase the resiliency of their \noperations  by, among other things, subjecting them to the same capital standards as their U.S. \ncounterparts, and stress testing requirements .5   \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL February 4 , 2016 at 2:15 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time  and 9:15 A.M. in Cape Town, South Africa  OR UPON DELIVERY *  \n \n \n \n5 \n A fourth area is a set of major change s establishing  new liquidity requirements.   Events in \nthe financial crisis exposed the fact that many financial institutions had become reliant on funds \nthat could quickly “run” should the firm experience financial str ess (or be perceived as \nexperiencing such stress) .  The regulatory tools  – known as the Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) , \nthe Net Stable Funding Ratio (NS FR), and the Comprehensive Liquidity Analysis and  Review  \n(CLAR)  – are all intended to make financial firms more resilient to liquid ity shocks .6  \nThis is far from a comprehensive list of the major changes that have either been made or \nare underway to address  the issue of TBTF  institutions .  But my goal is to highlight the reality \nthat truly addressing TBTF  involves much more than prudential regulation of individual large \nbanks .  Given the complexity involved and the limited time  we have today, I  will focus on \nGSIBs  and the two issues I mentioned at the outset – increase d capital and steps to reduce the \nspillover of problems from one institution to others and the financial system .   \n \nBackground on U .S. GSIB s \n Figure 1  shows  the total assets of the eight U .S. GSIB s for the third quarter of 2010 and \nthe third quarter of 2015.  The four largest GSIB s all have assets well over $1 trillion and include \nBank of America, JP Morgan Chase, Citigroup , and Wells Fargo.  The next two largest GSIB s, \nGoldman Sachs and Morgan Stan ley, have assets well over $500 billion  and notably  have  very \nlarge broker -dealer businesses.  The two smallest GSIB s, Bank of New York Mellon and State \nStreet , have assets well below $500 billion but are processing banks that are responsible for \nsignificant ba ck-office activities for financial market  participant s, and as such have external \nassets under management and under custody .7   \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL February 4 , 2016 at 2:15 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time  and 9:15 A.M. in Cape Town, South Africa  OR UPON DELIVERY *  \n \n \n \n6 \n  While two of the  largest banks have reduced their size over the past five years ,8 they still \nhave assets that exceed $1.5 trillion  and both had some of the most significant , well -documented  \nproblems during the financial crisis .  In sum, d espite the regulations designed to reduce TBTF, a \nnumber of the largest U.S. GSIBs have grown significantly over the past five y ears. \n Figure 2  shows U.S. GSIB banking assets and their share of U.S. bank ing industry  \nassets.  U.S. GSIB banking assets have grown for most of the past five years and now exceed \n$7.5 trillion, although there has been some decline more recently.  As a group, t otal GSIB assets \nare a little greater than 40 percent of U.S. GDP.  Moreover, G SIB assets represent a sizeable 50 \npercent  of bank ing industry  assets , down slightly from the post-crisis level.   \n Given that GSIBs are still a significant presence, how can it be argued that the problem of \nTBTF is seeing  significant progress?  It is important to remember that many of the new \nregulations that are designed to provide incentives for banks to shrink are fairly recent, and many \nhave full implementation dates several years in the future.  So it may be premature to judge what \nsize GSIBs are likely to be once the full set of TBTF regulations is implemented.  But I do \nbelieve  the most important progress on  TBTF  to date  involves  reducing the probability that these \ninstitutions will fail  – and should they fail, reducing the  risks they would pose to the entire \neconomy.  I will now share some perspectives on progress made and underway in that regard.  \n \nReducing the Probability of U.S. GSIB failure  \n There have been a variety of changes made to the supervision of GSIBs as a result of the \nfinancial crisis.  Perhaps the most crucial change has been the introduction of the CCAR ,9 which \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL February 4 , 2016 at 2:15 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time  and 9:15 A.M. in Cape Town, South Africa  OR UPON DELIVERY *  \n \n \n \n7 \n examines the ability  of large bank holding companies to withstand  stressful economic and \nfinancial conditions  (as discussed by Governor Dan Tarullo ).10  Should the Federal Reserve find \na bank’s capital inadequate under the stresse s modeled  in the CCAR exercise, the Fed  can object \nto capital distributions , such as the payment of dividends or stock repurchases.  In addition to the \nCCAR’s quantitative stress analysis, bank holding companies are assessed qualitatively on their \ncapital planning process, which can also result  in limitations on capital distributions.  \n Figure 3  provides the U.S. GSIBs ’ actual Tier 1 leverage ratio in the third quarter of \n2014 and the minimum Tier 1 leverage ratio that was estimated to arise in the CCAR’s severely \nadverse scenario  conducted at th at time .11  The scenarios model  significant adverse shocks to the \nbanks  – most of the GSIBs under the severely adverse scenario experience declines in the ir Tier \n1 leverage ratio of more than 2 percent age points , but all remain above 4 percent .  The size of  the \ndecline can vary significantly across GSIBs , which is unsurprising  given their very different \nbusiness models which can be more or less impacted by a particular set of stress assumption s. \n The CCAR is a flexible supervisory tool, in that supervisors c an alter the stress scenario \nto reflect those financial and economic s ituations  that they deem to pose, currently,  the biggest \nconcerns.  Since the scenarios change from year to year, the GSIBs need to maintain a capital \ncushion sufficient to exceed minimu m capital standards under a variety of potential stress \nsituations.    \nIn sum, t he utilization of stress tests has been a major change in the supervisory process , \nand has caused GSIBs to reduce risks in areas that might lose significant capital under stressful \nconditions  – or alternatively  has caused GSIBs  to plan on holding significantly more capital \nagainst  those risks.     \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL February 4 , 2016 at 2:15 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time  and 9:15 A.M. in Cape Town, South Africa  OR UPON DELIVERY *  \n \n \n \n8 \n  In addition to the stress testing required by the Dodd -Frank Act, a  number of regulatory \nchange s have  also significantly altered the capital regulation of GSIBs.  While I will address  \ntoday  the surcharge most directly focused on the GSIBs, it is important to remember that there \nhave been o ther substantial changes to capital regulation  since the financial crisis .12  The GSIB \ncapital surcharge I am highlighting is a surcharge imposed on GSIBs to reflect the systemic risk \nposed by these organizations because of the size  and complexity of their operations.   \n As Fed Chair Janet Yellen has noted, “A key purpose of the capital surcharge is to \nrequire the firms themselves to bear the costs that their failure would impose on others.  In \npractice, this final rule will confront these firms with a choice: they must either hold substantially \nmore capital, reducing the likelihood that they will fail, or else they must shrink their systemic \nfootprint, reducing the harm that their failure would do to our financial system.  Either outc ome \nwould enhance financial stability. ”13 \nThe GSIB surcharge is imposed in addition to the minimum 4.5 percent common equity \nTier 1 risk -based capital ratio and the 2.5 percent capital conservation buffer.  Based on data \navailable at the time of adoption, estimates suggest the surcharge would range from 1.0 to 4.5 \npercent and would be phased in over time, with the full effect of the regulation occurring in \nJanuary 2019 .14 \n The GSIB surcharge is calibrated to reduce the GSIBs ’ probability of default, with an eye \nto the impact of a failure on the broader financial system.15  The surcharge is calculated in two \nways, and the higher of the two surcharge s is used .  The first method considers the size, \ninterconnectedness, cross -jurisdictional activity, substitutability, and complexity of the \norganization  – similar to international standards.  The second method considers similar inputs  but \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL February 4 , 2016 at 2:15 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time  and 9:15 A.M. in Cape Town, South Africa  OR UPON DELIVERY *  \n \n \n \n9 \n replaces substitutability wi th a measure of reliance on short -term wholesale funding.16  The size \nof the surcharge will depend on how banks respond by adjusting their inputs to minimize their \ncapital charge.   \n The effect  of both the CCAR stress test and the GSIB surcharge is to signi ficantly reduce \nthe probability that a GSIB fails.  The combination of these and other capital regulations (as \nphased in) should  result in a significant improvement in capital ratios for GSIBs.  Figure 4  \nshows the  increases in the common equity Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio for this group over the \npast five years , even as new capital rules have, on net, increased risk -weightings .17  The common \nequity Tier 1 capital ratio for GSIBs now surpasses th e ratio  for non -GSIB institutions over $50 \nbillion , as well as for non -GSIB institutions under $50 billion.  \n Figure 5  shows that the Tier 1 leverage ratio for GSIB institutions has also steadily \nincreased.  While the GSIB leverage ratio  is still below that of non -GSIB insti tutions, this partly  \nreflects a higher  proportion of low -risk-weighted assets at GSIB s that get favorable capital \ntreatment under the risk -based capital ratio but not under the leverage ratio.  \n I should n ote that all the capital regulations are not fully phased in, and the counter -\ncyclical cap ital buffer is currently zero, and the actual GSIB surcharge is dependent on actions \nthe banks may take to reduce the surcharge.   In addition, it has not yet been decided by the Board \nof Governors of the Federal Reserve whether GSIB institutions will be required to include all or \npart of the surcharge in the capital required by the  CCAR .  If they were  required to , or if the \npost-stress CCAR minimums were increased by other means , the stress tests would be even more \nbinding on GSIB institutions.  I would b e in favor of such changes.  My own personal view is \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL February 4 , 2016 at 2:15 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time  and 9:15 A.M. in Cape Town, South Africa  OR UPON DELIVERY *  \n \n \n \n10 \n that GSIB institutions should be required to  increase post -stress minimums , through one means \nor another . \n \nReducing the Cost of U.S. GSIB failures  \n If, despite the stress tests and enhanced  capital regulations , a GSIB were still to fail, \nactions have been taken to try to reduce the impact of that failure.  Quite recently the Board of \nGovernors  of the Federal Reserve  proposed a rule for total loss -absorbing capacity or “TLAC. ”  \nThe purpose of  TLAC is to i nsure that if a GSIB were to fail, sufficient debt  financing would \nhave been employed so that taxpayer resources would not be needed  in order  to resolve the \ninstitution.   \n The proposal requires U .S. GSIBs to issue enough long -term debt so that if a GSIB fails \nand need s to be resolved, the debt c ould be converted to equity and negate the need for support \nfrom taxpayers .   Figure 6  provides a depiction of the TLAC rule, assuming the fully phased -in \ncapital requirement.18 \n In addition to TLAC , the GSIBs are required to develop resolution plans or so -called \n“living wills ,” covering how they could be resolved.   Both the FDIC and the Federal Reserve \nmust agree to the resolution plan.  Evaluation of the resolution plans is continuing, but when \naccepted by the FDIC and the Federal Reserve these plans should provide additional protection \nfor taxpayer resources should a GSIB fail.  \n The combination of the TLAC proposal and resolution plans ha s caused ratings agency \nStandard & Poor’s  to downgrade ratings on the non -operating holding companies of all the \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL February 4 , 2016 at 2:15 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time  and 9:15 A.M. in Cape Town, South Africa  OR UPON DELIVERY *  \n \n \n \n11 \n domestic GSIBs, reflecting the enhanced possibility that there will not be government support \nshould the largest banks experience financial difficulty.  It is noteworthy that Standard & Poor’s \ndid not downgrade the operating subsidiaries  of these holding companies , since the creditors of \nthe holding company would be a source of funds for the operating subsidiaries.   It is encouraging \nto see that rating agencies are viewing the actions t aken as significantly reducing the TBTF  \nproblem . \n \nConclu ding Observat ions \n Significant progress has been made in eliminating TBTF and the possibility that \ntaxpayers in the United States would need to bail out the domestic GSIBs  to preserve the \nfinancial system’s functioning .  But i t is important to remember that significant work still \nremain s.  Some of the proposals need to be finalized, some of the regulations are only in the \nprocess of being phased in, and more work needs to b e done on resolution plans to insure that \nGSIBs can be resolved in an orderly fashion.  \n Nonetheless, capital ratios at the GSIBs have been steadily increasing, with the goal of \nreducing the chances that a GSIB will fail.  In the event that o ne does  fail, t he new TLAC \nproposal and resolution plans  inten d to reduce the  potential  costs to taxpayers of such a failure \nand make it less likely that  there would be a need for  any financial support  from taxpayers to \npreserve financial system functioning .   \nThank you.  \n   \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL February 4 , 2016 at 2:15 A.M.

These transactions largely occurred in 2008.  \n \n9 In addition to CCAR, large bank holding companies (BHCs) are also subject to the Dodd -Frank Stress Testing Act \n(DFAST).  DFAST, like CCAR, is an annual exercise which assess es large BHCs’ capital adequacy under a stressed \nmacroeconomic environment.

It is a pleasure to be in Maine , and to be speaking here at my alma mater.   \nAt the outset , let me note as I always do that the views I will express are my own, n ot \nnecessarily those of my colleagues at the Federal Reserve’s Board of Governors or on the \nFederal Open Market Committee ( the FOMC).  \nBefore commenting on the national economy, allow me to say that I have been very \nimpressed by the actions of Colby  College  and President Green in contributing to economic \nresurgence here in Waterville , Maine.  So-called “anchor ” institutions are critically important to \n\n\n \n* EMBARGOED UNTIL February 16 , 201 6 at 7:40 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time  OR UPON DELIVERY *  \n \n \n \n2 \n the development of small cities, and an economically vibrant Waterville can pay large dividends \nfor all of c entral Maine.   \nThe recent announcement1 that Collaborative Consulting will open operations in \nWaterville is an important initial step in returning jobs to an area of the state  heavily impacted by \nretrenchment in lumber and manufacturing industries  over th e past 50 years .  The collaborative \nwork of state and local government, local business leaders, and anchor institutions (like a Colby  \nCollege ) represent s one of the key ingredient s that Boston Fed research  by Kodrzycki and \nMuñoz has indicated can lead to rejuvenated  cities .2  And progress in small and mid -sized “post \nmanufacturing” cities is  vital to the economic success  of so many Americans , given the large \nshare of the population that lives in and around them .  \nTurning to the national economy, i n December the FOMC raised short -term rates for the \nfirst time since the financial crisis , by a quarter of a point .  That decision reflected  further \nimprovement in a  range of re cent labor market indicators , confirming  that underutilization of \nlabor resourc es has diminished  – and the Committee’s expectation  that inflation w ill return to 2 \npercent, the inflation target set by the Federal Reserve , over the medium term .3   \nWhile labor markets have continued to improve gradually, headwinds generated from \nabroad have created more volatile financial markets and concerns that U .S. domestic growth may \nbe impeded by these headwinds and inflation may not move as quickly to the inflation target.    \nThe FOMC has made clear in the statement s released after its meetings  that future \nincreases in interest rates will depend, in part, on “actual and expected progress toward” our \n\n \n* EMBARGOED UNTIL February 16 , 201 6 at 7:40 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time  OR UPON DELIVERY *  \n \n \n \n3 \n inflation goal.   My focus t oday will be the recent inflation data  and the prospects of a return to \nthe 2 percent target level  for inflation .   \nWhile most observers expect that the appreciation of the dollar and the fall in oil prices \nwill eventually stabilize , recent global events may make it less likely that  the 2 percent inflation \ntarget will be achieve d as quickly as had been projected in recent for ecasts by private economists \nor by Federal Reserve policymakers.  In my own view, if inflation is slower to return to target, \nmonetary policy normalization should be unhurried.   A more gradual approach is an appropriate \nresponse to headwinds from abroad th at slow exports , and financial volatility that raises the cost \nof funds to many firms.4  Of course, my view could change if we were to experience a more \nrapid abatement of headwinds, or mu ch stronger domestic economic growth than I am currently \nanticipating.  \nRather than expecting some sort of precise forward guidance, it is better for observers to \nrecognize  that monetary policy will be responsive to incoming economic data.  Monetary policy \nwill adjust w hen the accumulated data alter  policymakers’  combined outlook.  For example, data \ncoming in much stronger than forecast would result in interest rate s going up more quickly  than \nprojections and, i n contrast, data much weaker than forecast would result in interest rates go ing \nup more slowly than proj ections .  It is important to view  the interest rate projections of Fed \npolicymakers found in the Summary of Economic Projections (or SEP) not as a promise, but \nrather  as a projection of the path of rates if the economy evolves as expected.  As incoming data \nalter those expectations, those projections can, and should, change.  \n \n\n \n* EMBARGOED UNTIL February 16 , 201 6 at 7:40 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time  OR UPON DELIVERY *  \n \n \n \n4 \n Recent Data  \n Figure 1  shows  the movement of stock prices since the beginning of this year.  Clearly, \nstock markets around the globe have  had a very disappointing start to the new year.  Stock \nmarket prices in major developed countr ies have fallen, with European and Japanese stock \nmarkets declining by more than 10 percent.  Particularly notable is the decline in Japan, despite \nthe fact that monetary policy there has become more accommodative .  Moreover, the country is  \nan oil importer and , as such , should  enjoy a net  benefi t from  significantly lower energy prices.  \n With energy prices having declined quite significantly of late , measures of total inflation \nin most developed economies are quite low, with many hovering around zero.  However, even \nwithout food and energy prices, core inflation rates remain well below 2 perce nt in many \nindust rial economies , as Figure 2  shows .  While core PCE i nflation in the United States is 1.4 \npercent , well below the inflation target of 2 percent, it is nonetheless higher than in Japan, \nEurope, or the U .K. \n Figure 3  shows how far oil prices have fallen .  The current price of oil is near the lows \nthat occurred during the Great Recession.  While the core inflation  measure  removes the direct \nimpact of lower food and energy prices, there are still indirect effects  because  energy prices are \nan important input to many final goods.  The decline s to date  in energy costs  are likely to bring \nabout continued temporary downward pressure on core inflation , at least through the spring of \nthis year .   \n My assessment is that the  energy price decline likely reflects a combination of supply and \ndemand factors.  The introduction of improved technology in oil extraction has greatly increased \n\n \n* EMBARGOED UNTIL February 16 , 201 6 at 7:40 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time  OR UPON DELIVERY *  \n \n \n \n5 \n supply.  In addition, the slowdown in global demand has likely contributed additional downwar d \npressure on energy prices.  However, other commodity prices have also experienced significant \ndeclines.  Figure 4  provides a broad non -energy commodity index and Figure 5  provides an \nagricultural commodity index.5  The decline in many commodities outside  of energy is one \nreason that some analysts have been concerned with a possible broader decline in the global \neconomy.6 \n Figure 6  illustrates another temporary restraint on U .S. inflation.  The  dollar has \nappreciated sharply over the past 18 months, as ref lected in the  trade -weighted currency \nexchange index .7  Of course, the  appreciation of the U .S. dollar  poses a challenge to export -\ndependent businesses .  The appreciation of the dollar makes U .S. exports more expens ive to our \ntrading partners and their exported goods cheaper for us.  But the dollar appreciation also  arises \nbecause global trading partners are experiencing weak er economic growth , requiring further \nmonetary accommodation , at the same time that the United States has experienced relatively \nstrong growth and has just begun to raise short -term rates.  The higher -valued  dollar makes \nimported goods cheaper, reducing U.S. inflation , as it  raises the cost of U .S.-produced  goods to \nforeign buyers.  Exchange rate movements, much like energy price shocks, are likely to only \ntemporarily depress c ore inflation ; but still, these temporary factors make it  unlikely that we will \nexperience significant  increase s in total or core inflation in the near term.  \n Furthermore, t here is one way t hat these temporary downward pressures on reported \ninflation could pose more permanent impediments to reaching the 2 percent  inflation  goal – if \ninflation expectations  were to change a s households and firms viewed the prospects for  future \ninflation  differently .  Figure 7  provides a relatively new measure from the Federal Reserve Bank  \n\n \n* EMBARGOED UNTIL February 16 , 201 6 at 7:40 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time  OR UPON DELIVERY *  \n \n \n \n6 \n of New York  of consumers ’ expected inflation  rate one and three years ahead.   The survey does \nshow a gradual but clear downward trend in inflation expectations over th e past several years.  \nThis suggests  we cannot take for granted that regular, persistent , but seemingly temporary shocks \nto inflation  will not have  a larger  and more lasting  impact .   \n \nInflation Forecasts  \n Figure 8  provides the SEP forecast s for core inflation each December for the past four \nyears.  The  forecasts all follow a similar pattern.  At the time the forecast  is made,  core inflation \nis well below the 2 percent target.  Over the course of the three -year forecast, inflation is \nprojected  to gradually increase and to generally fall just a bit short of the 2 percent target.  \nHowever, Figure 9  shows that the forecasts for a persistent drift up in core inflation have  not \nbeen realized in actual inflation outcomes.  \n One interpretation of this pattern is that  FOMC participants have been persistently \nsurprised by transitory shocks  to oil prices and the dollar , both of which  have tended to depress \ninflation in recent years.  However, a more troubling  alternative would be  that consistent ly \nmissing on the inflation target reflects a change in  the inflation process  – for example , if inflation \nexpectations were becoming less well  anchored.  Declines in surveys and market measures of \ninflation expectations would then imply a m ore serious impediment to achieving the 2 percent \ninflation target.  \n Figure 10 shows that inflation across spending components  has varied quite a bit .  For \nexample, the housing  component of the PCE index  has risen  more than 2 percent over the past \n\n \n* EMBARGOED UNTIL February 16 , 201 6 at 7:40 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time  OR UPON DELIVERY *  \n \n \n \n7 \n year, while durable  and non -durable  goods prices have fallen .  While this reflects relative supply \nand demand factors  – as well as sensitivity to exchange rates  – one might expect that a \nstabi lization of the  exchange rate would relieve some downward pressures in industries facing \nsignificant price competition from import s. \n Another factor that would raise confidence that inflation will pick up as transitory factors \nabate , would be  the continuing tightening of  labor markets.  The unemployment rate is currently \nat 4.9 percent.  If U.S. econom ic growth induce d additional tightening of labor markets, one \nmight expect to see wages and salaries picking up in industries where demand is particularly \nstrong.  Figure 11 shows that average hourly earnings and wages and salaries for private workers \nhave been slowly increasing.8  While the increases are more modest than those  seen in previous \nrecoveries , the gradual upward trend, were it to continue, would make me more  confiden t of \nreaching the  2 percent  inflation target . \n Figure 12 provides wages and salaries by occupational grouping.  No occupational group \nyet shows evidence of sufficient tightness in labor markets to require significantly higher wages \nand salaries.  In sum , there is not much evidence of significant bottlenecks by occupational \ngrouping , but overall there is some drifting up of wages and salaries more generally.  \n \nConclu ding Observations  \n At the  December meeting of the FOMC when rates were raised by a quarter of a \npercentage point, the  Committee released its projections, which generally expected that the \neconomy wo uld grow a little faster than 2 percent , as shown in Figure 13.  However, actual \n\n \n* EMBARGOED UNTIL February 16 , 201 6 at 7:40 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time  OR UPON DELIVERY *  \n \n \n \n8 \n growth  in 2015 (measured from the fourth quarter of 2014 to the fourth quarter of 2015) was  1.8 \npercent and  fell just below the SEP forecast range shown in Figure 13 , as fourth quarter growth \nwas only 0.7 percent .  The slowdown among some global trading partners, the decline in global \nstock prices, and the strong U .S. dollar could result in slower growth going forward than was \nexpected at the time of that December meeting.   While it is likely that much of the fourth -\nquarter weakness is due to temporary factors – for example, a modest inventory adjustment  – if \nmore pronounced global weakness were to materialize  and be transmitted to the U.S., I \npersonally believe there would be little need to raise rates until the economy was growing closer \nto its potential rate . \n However, even with growth at or above potential , the outlook for actual and expected \ninflation remains uncertain.  Figure 14 shows the  most recent  SEP median forecast for the \nfederal funds rate.  The median forecast was for the federal funds rate to increase by a percentage \npoint over the course of 2016 .  However, the SEP forecasts are made based on information \navailable at that time.   If the economy comes in  significantly weaker  (or stronger ) than was \nexpected  at the time of the SEP forecast , or if we see noticeably  less (or more)  progress on \ninflation than  was expected, that precise  interest rate path would no  longer be appropriate , in my \nview .   \nSince the December  publication of the Summary of Economic Projections,  we have seen \noil prices decline  and global stock indices become m ore volatile  – and more generally  a lack of \ninflationary pressures and the  presence of  global headwinds that make future economic growth \nsomewhat more uncertain.   Should these conditions persist, and slow progress on attaining the \n\n \n* EMBARGOED UNTIL February 16 , 201 6 at 7:40 P.M.

But the path of interest rates \ncould be steeper or more gradual, depending on the incoming data.   \n \n5 As a broad index, the S&P GSCI Non -Energy Commodity Price Index does include agricultural commodities, so \nthere is some overlap between the  indices.  \n \n6 While Figure 4  shows a decline in the Non -Energy Commodities Price Index on a monthly basis through January, \ndaily figures show a rise in the index beginning on January 12th.   Alt hough the increase has leveled off in early \nFebruary, on a daily basis the index is now above its monthly average for December.  The Agricultural Commodities \nPrice Index pictured in Figure 5  drifted up slightly in mid -January on a daily basis, but has sinc e continued its \ndownward trend and in early February is below the monthly average for January.  \n \n7 While Figure 6  shows the dollar’s sharp appreciation, daily figures for the index show that the dollar has \ndepreciated slightly since January 21st but remains  above the monthly average for December shown in Figure 6 . \n \n8 The sharp uptick in the first quarter of 2015 (2.8 percent) may at least in part be attributable to incentive pay. \nWhen incentive paid occupations are excluded the increase is a smaller 2.1 perc ent.  (This attribution should be \nviewed with caution, however, as the BLS notes that the indices excluding incentive paid occupations are not strictly \ncomparable with the other series.)",

It is a pleasure to  have  been invited to participate in this panel discussion \non defining the objectives and goals of supervision.  I want to compliment the New York \nReserve Bank for convening this important conference on supervising large, complex financial \ninstitutions.  \n\n\n \n* EMBARGOED UNTIL March  18, 201 6 at 11 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *  \n \n \n \n2 \n At the outset, let me note as I always do that the views I will express are my own, not \nnecessarily those of my colleagues at the Federal Reserve’s Board of Governors or on the \nFederal Open Market Committee (the FOMC).   \nThe discussion today of lar ge-bank supervision is particularly germane , as we continue to \nanalyze and learn from the last financial crisis, where problems at large financial institutions  had \nan important impact on the severity and duration of the recession  that followed .   \nIt is als o important that we have an international perspective  on prudential regulation on \nthis panel , provided by Andrew Bailey  of the Bank of England .  Large -bank problems  were  \nmajor  contributors to the crisis  globally .  Actions taken during and in response to periods of bank \nstress in banking crises have varied across the world .  This reflects , in part , differ ing attitudes \nabout what represents the greatest risk posed by large banks and their potential problems . \n \nPerspective on the  Goals of Bank Supervision  \n In the United States, the most significant  change to bank supervision in the past decade \nwas the adoption of the Dodd -Frank Act.  The preamble of the Act  makes it quite clear that a \ncentral  focus of the legislation  was prevent ing the need for any future taxpayer bailouts  of \ninstitutions  whose demise could worsen a crisis .1  The legislation, a s well as the set of \nregulations that implement it, strong ly emphasi ze avoiding taxpayer bailouts by increas ing loss-\nabsorbing capital , and liquidity , through regulation – all to reduce the probability of a large bank \nfailure . 2  The legislation also emphasize s reducing the loss es that would be borne by taxpayers  in \nthe event of an ins titution’s default .3,4 \n\n \n* EMBARGOED UNTIL March  18, 201 6 at 11 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *  \n \n \n \n3 \n  However, bailout risk to the taxpayers  – while critical  – is not the only risk that motivates \ncareful regulation and supervision of financial intermediaries.  The broader goal  for supervision \nand regulation reflects  the highest intention of all economic policy making: simply to maximize \nthe well-being of t he public.  Bank failures – and financial instability in general  – reduce the \npublic welfare , because w ell-functioning financial intermediaries are essentially the lubricant for \nthe real  economy.  A car engine without oil will seize  up; similarly, countries  with faile d \nfinancial intermediaries can  find their economies seiz ing up.  It is no coincidence that the two \nworst economic cycles in the U.S. over the past one hundred years have coincided with the \nwidespread failure of financial insti tutions.   \nThe Great Depression and the Great Recession, of course, brought large  losses to many  \nfinancial intermediaries .  But the largest  costs were associat ed with lost employment, production , \nand wealth .  Both the Dodd -Frank legislation and recent supervisory letters emphasize making \nfinancial institutions resilient, maintaining financial stability, and  preventing problems at \nfinancial intermediaries from damaging  the real economy .5  So a central  focus of regulation and \nsupervision should be to help improve public  welfare by  maintain ing the efficient and effective \nconduct of intermediary services  despite  economic cycle s.   \nFinancial intermediaries play a critical  role in efficient ly channeling funds from savers to \nborrowers , whose investment in a business idea or household propels the real economy . \nFinancial intermediaries  are also the major conduit through which  monetary policy  affects the \nreal economy , making them key to  transmitting policies that foster  economic recoveries .6,7   \n\n \n* EMBARGOED UNTIL March  18, 201 6 at 11 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *  \n \n \n \n4 \n Supervision aims to ensure  that financial institutions are resilient to even severe shocks .  \nWith sufficiently high capital regulation and effective use of stress tests, supervision should  help \nprevent systemic failures.  Stress testing – a proactive supervisory approach introduced after the \ncrisis – should, if properly implemented, make systematic failures quite unlikely. In fact, stress \ntests should lead to restrictions on  dividends or share buybacks unless the supervisor  is confident \nthat systemic institutions are resilient to even severe stress.  Financial institutions should be able \nto effectively intermediate throughout the cycle, including under severely stressed economic \nconditions , if supervisors successfully utilize stress tests.   \nBut we must also be focusing on what will happen if  a severe economic shock  does \nfundamentally impair intermediaries .  In that case , mitigating more severe economic dislocations \nin the broader economy should be a primary  concern,  not a secondary  one.8 \n \nTrade -offs in Supervisory and Regulatory Policymaking  \n Supervisory policymaking  involve s a balancing o f macroeconomic trade -offs.   When \naddressing the financial condition of an institution , policymakers must be attuned to the broader \nimpacts that can occur with the disruption of the vital intermediation services that lubricate \neconomic activity.  \nCapital regulation  provides a relatively simple but very important example of the trade -\noffs inherent in supervisory and regulatory policymaking .  Maintaining standards for loss -\nabsorbing capital has long been central to bank regulation.  However , the specifics of how that \nregulation is implemented can have very different implications for the broader economy.   \n\n \n* EMBARGOED UNTIL March  18, 201 6 at 11 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *  \n \n \n \n5 \n For example, a  bank that falls below its  regulatory capital -to-assets ratio can take one of \ntwo paths – raise new capital (by raising new equity or retaini ng earnings),  or shrink assets (by \nselling assets or reducing lending , because loans are assets for financial institutions ).  These \nalternatives can differ in important ways, of course – for example, in the speed with which each \noption accomplishes  recapitalization .  But they also differ crucially  in the  impact they may have \non the availability  of credit to individuals and companies – essentially, in the institutions’ ability \nto continue to effectively and efficiently provide credit , and function as a financial intermediary .   \nChoosing to increase capital  by suspending dividends or not repurchasing  share s has the \nadvantage of having  less of an  impact on borrowers  seeking credit , but it is likely to increase \ncapital only very gradual ly – particularly if the operating environment is one in which net \nincome is low.9   \nAlternatively, issuing new equity to bolster loss -absorbing capital can be done relatively \nquickly .  While it dilutes existing shareholders, if done proactively it can stave off severe \nfinancial stres s on the institution .10 \nTurning to the assets in the capital -to-assets ratio – the denominator  – we should note that \nthe approach involving reducing  lending can take time , since  it works primarily through  new \nloans , not existing  ones.  Moreover, a bank is limited in its ability to immediately curtail lending, \ngiven that it has previously committed to lines of credit (including the unused portions) and has \nmade loan commitments to its customers .  However,  the reduction in lending is likel y to result in \na dearth of needed credit for individuals and companies, and thus a weaker economy .11   \n\n \n* EMBARGOED UNTIL March  18, 201 6 at 11 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *  \n \n \n \n6 \n Moreover , tighter loan terms change the calculations inherent in business plans, and  may \nlead firms and entrepreneurs to reduce their borrowing.  The reduction  in credit extension by \nintermediaries may also partially offset the stimulative effects of accommodative monetary \npolicy that the central bank is  usually implement ing in economic downturns.   \nIn contrast, selling off assets can be accomplished  relatively quickly .  But depending on \nthe asset and the prevailing economic conditions, the sales may have to occur  at deeply \ndiscounted or  even  “fire sale” prices .  However, an important nuance to recognize is that asset \nsales at much -reduced prices can affect  the institution’s capital too ,12 with the losses on the asset \nsales feeding through to reduced net worth (capital) .13   \n The speed of the recapitalization is important for several reasons.  Certainly, q uickly \nrecapitalizing makes the financial system more resilient to  continuing or  future adverse shocks , \nand thus m ay help insulate the economy from  future disruptions in the intermediation process.  \nHowever, a more rapid  recapitalization , if accomplished through shrinking assets , can also harm \nthe broader economy  if it entails a significant tightening of lending standards , and thus credit \navailability .14  Again, a s is often the case with economic policy making, the supervisory process \nis a balancing  of macroeconomic trade -offs.  \n Certainly , history shows a number of examples of supervisors taking  different  approaches \nto these  trade -offs.  In the United States, the reces sion in the early 1990s was exa cerbated by \nbinding capital requirements .  Many  banks addressed their binding capital ratios by reducing \nlending and  tightening credit  standards , and bank supervisors did not emphasize the need to \nrecapitalize in ways that were less disruptive to the broader economy .  This supervisory response  \n\n \n* EMBARGOED UNTIL March  18, 201 6 at 11 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *  \n \n \n \n7 \n spawned an academic  literature on credit crunches , highlighting how supervisory p ractice  could \nadversely impact the real economy .  Ultimately , the credit crunch  was cited as a headwind to the \nrecovery , at a time requiring more stimulative monetary policy .15   \nAs Figure 1  shows, after the 1990 recession , the level of real lending  to businesses \ndeclined significantly , and in a way that had not occurred in the previous or subsequent \nrecession .16  Arguably, in the early 1990s , not enough consideration  was given to avoiding a \nsituation where supervisory capital rat ios were  primarily achieved by tightening lending  \n(shrinking assets) .  Less collateral damage to borrowers may have occurred if supervision had \ntaken  the tack of m ore forcefully  requiring retention of earnings or the raising of new equity \ncapital.  \nA very different supervisory approach occurred in 2009.  The first supervisory “stress \ntest” exercise  – which followed the Troubled Asset Relief Program’s (TARP)  funding  that \nboosted institutions’ capital with  investment of  public funds  – required that rec apitalization not \nbe accomplished  by shrinking assets.  Given th at demand for loans declined during the recession , \nthere was still a significant drop in business lending, but it would likely have been much more \nsevere if bank supervisors  had not  discourag ed banks from meeting capital requirements \nprimarily by reducing lending.17  In part, the supervisory approach looked to recapitalize banks \nquickly, but to do it in a way that would have less severe “collateral  damage”  to the economy.    \nImportantly, we can examine the experience in other countries.  Countries experien cing \nsevere shocks have tended to see extremely slow progress in recapitalizing their banking system . \n\n \n* EMBARGOED UNTIL March  18, 201 6 at 11 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *  \n \n \n \n8 \n And some countries  where the government did recapitalize the banks , such  as Japan,  did so only \nafter a long delay.  \nIndeed , following the Japanese banking problems of the 1990s , the authorities  counted on \nbank earnings to recapitalize  the banking sector  – but this was handicapped by continued \ndeclines in stock and real estate prices in Japan ’s economy.   Studies have observed  that the long \ndelays in recapitalizing the banks  and reducing problem loans  generated a misallocation of loans , \nwhich  had a broader adverse impact on the country’s  economy .18   \nIt is my strongly held view that supervisors can effectively help prevent systemic events \nif sufficiently high capital standards are required and rigorous stress tests are regularly \nconducted.  Ideally, bank regulation and supervision will help make financial intermediaries \nsufficiently resilient so that even severe economic shocks would not badly impair financial \nintermediaries over the entire business cycle.  This is the logic behind using stress tests to ensure \nthat b anks are resilient before they are approved to pay out earnings, which of course depletes \ncapital.   Before the introduction of the post -crisis stress tests, banks were allowed to continue to \npay dividends in 2007 and 2008, which resulted in a much greater  need to recapitalize.  \nThankfully, the stress tests now provide a much more proactive way to address the potential of \nsevere shocks before they occur.  \nHowever,  if a shock or event  occurs , and banks prove  to be  not sufficiently resilient, it is \ncritically important to proactively recapitali ze the banking sector as quickly as possible while  at \nthe same time avoiding  collateral damage from tighter credit standards .  Put another way , with \nrespect to the capita l-to-assets ratio , it is vital to increase the capital  (the numerator of the ratio ) \n\n \n* EMBARGOED UNTIL March  18, 201 6 at 11 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *  \n \n \n \n9 \n rather than allowing the adjustment to occur primarily through a reduction in assets, i.e. loans \n(the denominator ).  \nCurrent ly, there continue to be varying responses to the question .  The Basel III accord \nmade clear the existence of  a broad international consensus to better capitalize banks.19  \nHowever, countries have taken different approaches to interpreting how low the acceptable \nminimum level of capital can be – and different approaches to reachi ng the higher capital \nstandards .  Countries that only slowly build  up their banking sector’s resilience  do risk, in my \nview,  more severe repercussions  should their economies encounter additional significant  adverse \nshocks.  \n \nThe Largest Institutions  \nFigure 2  provides the minimum Basel III leverage ratio s applied to the largest  and most \nsystemic ally important  institutions in several developed countries  – the so -called Global \nSystemically Important Banking organizations, or GSIBs.  You see that c ountries have c hosen \ndifferent minimum leverage ratios to apply to the largest institutions.  In the United States, the \nGSIB s are required , by 201 8, to have 5 percent leverage ratios for the holding company.20  \nSwitzerland has set similarly high leverage ratios.  In contrast, the Eurozone and Japan have yet \nto require a higher minimum leverage ratio for the largest institutions – above the  3 percent \nleverage ratio  – although additional requirements for GSIBs are under discussion by the Basel \nCommittee’s Group of Central Bank Governors and Heads of Supervision (GHOS) .21   \n\n \n* EMBARGOED UNTIL March  18, 201 6 at 11 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *  \n \n \n \n10 \n These variations  reflect different trade -offs made across jurisdictions  – trade -offs \nconcerning  the size of GSIB s relative to the GDP of the country, the willingness of governments \nto risk large  bank failures, and concern over how higher capital standards will impact the largest \nbanks in the coun try as well as the broader economy.   \n Figure 3  shows,  for different coun tries or regions , the recent leverage ratio s for GSIBs \nand the fully -phased -in Basel III leverage ratio requirement .  While the transition rules do not \nrequire fully meeting the regulatory requirements until 201 8, the average GSIB  Basel III \nleverage ratio in the U .S. already exceed s the fully -phased -in requirement .22  How quickly \nfinancial institutions have boost ed capital ratios, and the size of the loss-absorbing buffer, \npresumably reflects different market pressures – but also different supervisory  pressure to raise \ncapital ratios.   \nIn the U .S., an important supervisory tool has been the use of stress tests.  Here t he \nrigorous application of stress tests, and the desire of institutions to have comfortable buffers \nagainst future stress tests, ha ve encouraged GSIBs to quick ly improve their capital ratios.  \n The different supervisory and regulatory goals across jurisdictions reflect different trade -\noffs, but also make the country or region’s financial sector more or less susceptible  to additional \nadve rse shocks.  Figure 4  shows global stock indices since December 1, 2015.  The global \nfinancial market turmoil that occurred at the beginning of 2016 has resulted in declines in stock \nmarket indices around the world .  This chart shows , however, that  there a re differences across \ncountries and regions.  For example, the United States and the United Kingdom are currently \n\n \n* EMBARGOED UNTIL March  18, 201 6 at 11 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *  \n \n \n \n11 \n only modestly below December 1 levels , reflecting the relatively strong U.S. and U.K. \neconomies , while Japan and the Eurozone show a more nega tive impact.  \n Figure 5  shows differences in credit default swap (CDS) spreads  of GSIB institutions \nacross countries, scaled relative to December 1.  GSIB CDS have been sensitive to global \nturmoil , and rose quite significantly  in February.  More recently , although volatility has \ncontinued, there has been substantial improvement  among countries that saw the most dramatic \nincreases in CDS spreads .  While these differences likely reflect macroeconomic risks by \ncountry, they also likely reflect investors ’ views  of potential  financial concerns related to  GSIBs \nin that country.    \nFigure 6  shows the differences in stock prices of GSIBs by countr y.  Again the U .S. \nGSIBs have fared  better, experiencing a lesser decline than counterparts in the Eurozone, \nSwitzerland, and Japan, likely reflecting a better macroeconomic outlook  – as well as a relatively \nstronger financial position even as global markets have become more volatile.   A more proact ive \nsupervisory push  to make U .S. GSIB s more resilient has been  appropriate and , as this figure \nsuggests,  beneficial  – as evidenced by market react ion to recent global  volatility.    \n \nConclu ding Observat ions \n In summary and conclusion , I would observe that t he extensive regulation and \nsupervision of financial institutions reflect s the important role that they, as financial \nintermediaries , play in the economy.  In particular, higher capital and rigorous stress tests should \nmake GSIBs mor e resilient over time .  But, as I have discussed today, there are trade -offs to \n\n \n* EMBARGOED UNTIL March  18, 201 6 at 11 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *  \n \n \n \n12 \n carefully consider.  Policymakers need to balance the resilience that higher capital ratios bring \nagainst the possibility of pullback in  the provision of credit , and downstream  impacts on  the \nability of firms  and households  to borrow and invest . \nWhile the distribution of losses when  financial institutions fail is very important, the \nprimary goal of supervision should be to create effective intermediaries that can support the \nbroader economy  throughout the business cycle  including  periods of stress .  I am in favor of \nusing bank supervision to more quickly insulate the largest financial institution s from adverse \neconomic shocks  that may emerge .  But i deally , this would be done i n ways that also encourage \nfinancial intermediaries to continue lending .  I am happy to observe that in the United States , \nbanks have been able to significantly improve capital ratios while  still expanding their lending.   \n Thank you.  \n  \n                                                           \n1 The Dodd -Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act begins with: “To promote the financial stability \nof the United States by improving accountability and transparency in the financial system, to end ‘too big to fail,’ to \nprotect the American taxpayer by ending bailouts, to protect consumers from abusive financial services practices, \nand for other purposes…”  \n \n2 See the speech by Federal Reserve Governor Jerome H. Powell, “ Ending ‘Too Big to Fail ,’” March 4, 2013. This \nspeech highlights the too big to fail phenomenon.  \n \n3 For more discussion of how the probability of failure and cost of failure ha ve been reduced in the United S tates, \nsee “Progress on Addressing 'Too Big To Fail' ,” Eric S. Rosengren , BCBS-FSI High -level Meeting for Africa  \nfocused on Strengthening Financial Sector Supervision and Current Regulatory Priorities , held in Cape Town, South \nAfrica , Feb. 4, 2016 .  \n \n4 In particular, the Total Loss Absorbing Capacity proposal, or TLAC, would force large banks’ bondholders to \ndirectly suffer losses in the event of failure.  \n \n5 Supervision  and Regulation Letters , such as SR 12 -17, provide detailed discussions of the consolidated supervision \nframework for large financial institutions.  Two primary objectives for bank supervision are provided :  see \n“Enhancing resiliency of a firm to lower the probability of its failure or inability to serve as a financial \n\n \n* EMBARGOED UNTIL March  18, 201 6 at 11 A.M.

Stein, June, 1997. American Economic Revie w, 90, 407 –28. \n \n7 In the event of an institution’s dissolution, the arrangements for how its losses are allocated among equity holders, \nbondholders, and taxpayers, are – of course – highly important after the fact.  But how the rules for this allocation \nare set before the f act are also extremely important – they can affect financial incentives in critical ways, and thus \nthe behavior of both the financial intermediaries and those who fund them.   \n \n8 Stress tests are ideally suited to ensure that banks are resilient during dif ficult economic circumstances.  \n \n9 This leaves the institution vulnerable during the slow recapitalization process to any additional adverse economic \nshocks, which would require an even greater accumulation of capital.    \n \n10 In addition, proactively issuing new equity to bolster loss -absorbing capital can also allow future capital actions  to \nrecalibrate once markets stabilize . \n \n11 Of course, how much a reduction in bank lending affects the nonfinancial economy depends, in part, on whether \nborrowers have access  to alternative credit suppliers, and on what terms.  During the financial crisis, larger firms \nsubstituted bond finance for bank finance, but that option was not available to all firms.   \n \n12 Can affect the numerator as well as the denominator of the capita l-to-assets ratio.  \n \n13 Such sales may also affect the health of other financial institutions by reducing the market value of their assets, \nand thus their capital.  \n \n14 I would underline the trade -offs between addressing the financial condition of the institution expeditiously, and \nthe broader impacts that can occur with the disruption of vital intermediation services that lubricate economic \nactivity.  \n \n15 For a discussion of this period , see “ The Capital Crunch: Neither a Borrower Nor a Lender Be ,” Joe Peek and Eric \nRosengren, 1991. Also see, “Bank Regulation and the Credit Crunch ,” Joe Peek and Eric Rosengren, 1993.  \n  \n16 The chart shows the decline in commercial and industrial and commercial real estate loans  outstanding .   \n \n17 The emphasis on capital adjustment rather than shrinking assets stemmed further deterioration, and probably \nmitigated problems of credit access – although credit was certainly impaired, regardless, given the severity of the \ncrisis.    \n \n18 See \" Zombie Lending and Depressed Restructuring in Japan ,\" Ricardo J. Caballe ro, Takeo Hoshi, and Anil K. \nKashyap, 2008 . See also  \"Unnatural Selection: Perverse Incentives and the Misallocation of Credit in Japan ,” Joe \nPeek and Eric S.

Rosengren \nPresident & Chief Executive Officer \nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston \n \n \nRemarks at the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston’s  \n2016 Cybersecurity Conference  \n \n \nBoston, Massachusetts  \nApril 4, 2016 \n \n \n \n \n  Good morning.  It is a pleasure to be able  to welcome so many representatives of \nfinancial institutions to the Federal Reserve t oday, for what is an important program.  An \nimportant role for leaders of financial institutions  and their boards, of course, is monitoring and \nmitigating potential risks to their institution.  Toda y I would like to briefly discuss, and offer my \nown views on, two areas of risk that I often hear about when I talk with bankers.   \nAt the outset, let me note as I always do th at the views I express today are my own, not \nnecessarily those of my  colleagues at the Federal Reserv e’s Board of Governors or on the \nFederal Open Market Committee (the FOMC). \n\n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL April 4, 2016 at 10:15 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY * \n \n \n \n2 \n The first area of risk that I will commen t on involves the economy.  Early this year, \nconcerns reemerged about the economic health of  China and Europe, which led to significant \nvolatility in both foreign and domestic financial mark ets.  In reaction to th at volatility, federal \nfunds rate futures fell significantly, reflecti ng market expectations for only a very gradual \nincrease in short-term interest rates.   \nTo preview my main point, my own sense is that financial markets may have reacted too \nstrongly.  My assessment is that the U.S. economy is continuing to improve despite the \nheadwinds from abroad.  If my forecast is righ t, it may imply more increases in short-term \ninterest rates than are currently priced into futures markets – but, let me emphasize that my \noutlook still calls for a gradual  pace of increases and, as always, the path should depend on \nincoming economic data.  \n The second risk that I am going to touch on to day is cyber risk, the primary focus of this \ngathering.1  It is a risk that institutions of all si zes are well aware of, and have been taking \nsignificant steps to mitigate.  However, the eve r-changing nature of the risk is why continued \nattention is so important.  This is the topic th at the speakers today are going to cover in some \ndetail, I am pleased to say.   \nFor context, the risk of bank r obbery or fraud had, in the pa st, been primarily a localized \nproblem, with relatively few individuals able to pose a significant threat.  With appropriate \ncontrols, the risks of large losse s were quite low.  However, w ith banking increasingly done via \nthe internet and mobile devices, an attack can be conducted from anywhere in the world.  Cyber \ncriminals are looking for the targ ets of opportunity without rega rd to geographic location, and \nthe existence of a global populat ion of potential attackers look ing for softer targets means \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL April 4, 2016 at 10:15 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY * \n \n \n \n3 \n increased risks.  Without appr opriate controls and defenses, the banking system could be at \ngreater risk of a large loss – but fortunately, institutions of all sizes have been expending \nsignificant resources very st rategically in this area,2 and bank supervisory examiners have been \nverifying that controls are in place.    \nNonetheless, as with the threat of terrorism – which has been so r ecently and tragically \nhighlighted – cyber defense is an area where continued vigilance and continuous improvement \nare required.  This has been a focus at the Boston Federal Reserve Bank, and the discussions \ntoday will touch on programs we ar e pursuing to support financial inst itutions as they continue to \nmitigate this risk. \n \nEconomic risks    \n Turning back to the economy, I would note that  at the beginning of the year, problems in \nthe domestic economies of many of the United St ates’ major trading partners began receiving \nsignificant attention.  Several foreign central banks eased th eir monetary policy, and some \nfinancial markets became volatile.  These global developments had an impact on U.S. financial \nmarkets, and many market partic ipants began anticipating that U.S. monetary policy would be \nless likely to continue normalizing.   \nIndeed, as of the end of last week, as shown in Figure 1 , the federal funds futures market \nimplied the belief that there would be roughly one more quarter-point increase by the end of \n2016, and an additional quarter-point  increase by the end of 2017.  This extremely gradual path \nfor reducing monetary policy accommodation w ould imply either a weak outlook for the \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL April 4, 2016 at 10:15 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY * \n \n \n \n4 \n economy or significant concerns that even if the expected outlook was benign, there were \nsignificant “tail” risks.  My own view is that the outlook is not as  weak, and the tail risks not as \nelevated, as would be implie d by this very gradual path.3,4 \n Figure 2  shows that futures markets atta ch a 41 percent probability to just one increase by \nthe end of the year, and a 38 percent probability to no change at all this year. In other words, the \nfutures markets assign a very high probability of one  or zero increases in rates by the end of this \nyear.  \n It is important to remember that these mark et probabilities can change significantly, and \nrapidly.  When weaker economic data are release d, the probability of tightening built into futures \nmarkets falls; conversely, when stronger data are rel eased, the probability of tightening is seen as \nincreasing.  Figure 3 shows that over the past two months , the probabilities have shifted \nsignificantly.  The probability assi gned to seeing no change in the federal funds rate this year \nwas less than 30 percent two months ago, rose  to over 50 percent one month ago, and most \nrecently has returned to 38 percent. \n One reason for these changing probabili ties has been the weak economic data, \nparticularly from abroad.  Figure 4  shows that European and Japanese stock markets weakened \nsignificantly in the middle of Febr uary, and still remained well below their levels in the middle \nof December.  Figure 5  shows that the declines in U.S. stock markets were more modest, and \nhave now rebounded to levels prevailing in mid-December of last year. \n Not only have the levels of stock indices im proved, but so has volatility – as shown in \nFigure 6 .  The VIX – a measure of stock market volat ility – rose significantly in February and \nthen fell thereafter.  Currently the VIX is so mewhat below the level of mid-December.   \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL April 4, 2016 at 10:15 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY * \n \n \n \n5 \n  The exchange rate has also been volatile, as seen in Figure 7 .  The dollar was stronger on \na trade-weighted basis earlier in the year.  Howe ver, currently the trade-weighted data are below \nthe level of mid-December.  This is si milar to the pattern of bond spreads in Figure 8 .  While the \nspread was elevated in February, it is now belo w the levels seen in the middle of December. \n With financial market volatility subsiding since earlier this year, it is to me surprising that \nthe expected path of monetary policy embedded in futures markets is so low.  A weak forecast \ndoesn’t seem to explain the path expected for the funds rate (see Figures , 9, 10, and 11 for \ncontext).5  As I see it, the risks seem to be abatin g that problems from abroad would be severe \nenough to disrupt the U.S. recovery.  Financial- market volatility has fallen, and most economic \nforecasts do not reflect expected  large spillovers from continued headwinds from abroad.   \nSo, while problems could still arise, I woul d expect that the ve ry slow removal of \naccommodation reflected in futures market pricing could prove too pessimistic.  While it has been appropriate to pause while waiting for inform ation that clarified the response of the U.S. \neconomy to foreign turmoil, it increasingly appear s that the U.S. has weathered foreign shocks \nquite well.  As a consequence, if the incoming data  continue to show a m oderate recovery – as I \nexpect they will – I beli eve it will likely be appropriate to resume the path of gradual tightening \nsooner than is implied by financial-market futures.  \n \nCyber risk \n Turning to the second risk I will address today, I would say that while economic risks \nhave arguably abated somewhat, the same cannot be  said for cyber risk.  News stories on cyber \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL April 4, 2016 at 10:15 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY * \n \n \n \n6 \n attacks and cyber fraud have become more prev alent.  No CEO, in any industry, can feel \ncomfortable with the ba rrage of stories relate d to cyber intrusions. \n The ability to conduct financial transactions  over the Internet and through mobile devices \nhas resulted in major innovations in financial serv ices.  Banks and other financial institutions \nhave invested heavily in technology, and in keeping that technology safe.    \nOf course, it is notable that banks’ business lines are also increasingly challenged by new \norganizations that are primarily electronic.  To  the extent that so-called “fintech” entities \ncompete directly with banks with similar pr oducts, they are not burdened by large brick and \nmortar operations or the regulator y oversight that comes with bei ng a bank.  It is important to \nexamine whether these new innovators have fully  captured the risks of economic downturns and \nthe implications for their lending model.  Whethe r or not customers fully appreciate that deposit-\nlike accounts do not carry deposit in surance, remains to be seen. \nCustomers are looking for convenience; so no t surprisingly, new app lications and devices \ncontinue to evolve in new and une xpected ways.  However, this ra pid evolution generates risks.  \nA proliferation of apps increasingly focused on customer c onvenience may not always focus as \nintensely on security.  In addition, the consumer, ra ther than the financial institution, can often be \nthe entry point that cyber criminals seek to exploit. \nI mention fintech because clearly banks must co ntinue to evolve with  and invest in these \nfinancial services innovations, and therefore should be attuned to the cyber risks that come with \nonline and mobile delivery.6  The cyber criminal can be anywhere there are computer links.  \nThey may very well be hard to find, submerged in the large volume of transactions and data \nhandled by financial institutions.  But they also have the potential to la unch massive attacks, \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL April 4, 2016 at 10:15 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY * \n \n \n \n7 \n quickly ballooning from complete anonymity to a large-scale threat.  These challenges make it \nimportant that CEOs, management, and boards of directors understand the risks that are posed. \nIdeally, cyber thefts can be significantly m itigated.  Maintaining good cyber security and \nkeeping personnel and software up to  date is critical.  However, it is important to be able to \nquickly understand what is happening to other or ganizations and even across industries.  As you \nwill hear later today, the Boston Fed tries to be quite active in this regard, to make sure that news of threats gleaned by the central bank or other financial institutions quickly becomes known, and \nthat appropriate act ions are taken.   \nI would also highlight the importance of ha ving protocols ready, should a breach occur.  \nResiliency is important, as is recovering critical operations in a timely fashion.  Finally, having a \ncommunication plan to address concerns of cust omers, vendors, and regulators – with a clear \nunderstanding of where decision rights are held – can mitigate problems in the event of a breach. \n Of course, bank regulators and supervisors from  the Fed and other agencies are attuned to \ncyber risks, and work with financial institutions  on an ongoing basis to ensure defenses are \nrobust and opportunities for the spread of pr oblems are constrained.  Cyber risks make it \nimperative that we all work together to ensu re that resiliency, m onitoring, detection, and \nrecovery capabilities are opera tional in the financial system. \n \nConcluding Observations \n In summary and conclusion, I would observe that some of the economic concerns from \nearlier this year seem to be receding.  As the economic risks abate, financ ial market expectations \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL April 4, 2016 at 10:15 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY * \n \n \n \n8 \n of a very slow removal of monetary policy accommodation could, it seems to me, prove unduly \npessimistic.  I personally expect that a stronger economy, at essent ially full employment and with \ngradually rising inflation, will lead to more tight ening than is currently priced into the futures \nmarket expectations for the next two years. \n The risks in the cyber realm are, unfortuna tely, not abating.  Banki ng organizations need \nto continue to evolve as these risks mor ph, and as new innovations and expectations of \nconvenience introduce new challenges to security.  I hope the discussion over the course of today \nwill help prepare you for those challenges.   \nThank you. \n \n                                                            \n \n1 For additional perspective on cybersecurity as a financ ial stability issue, see January 2015 remarks by Eric S. \nRosengren at: http://www.bostonfed.org/news/speeches/ rosengren/2015/013015/013015text.pdf  \n \n2 Of course, cyber risk also encompasses third-party service providers to financial institutions, so there is a need for \nvigilance in managing these relationships and entry points. \n \n3 Note that the Federal Reserve Board of Governor’s Advance release of table 1 of the Summary of Economic \nProjections has a steeper path particularly in 2017.  However, this reflects modal forecasts and may not capture the \ntail risks that may be priced into the futures market.  See the table at: http://www.federalreserve.gov/moneta rypolicy/fomcprojtabl20160316.htm  \n \n4 The higher SEP forecasts were revise d down about one-half percentage poi nt from the December forecasts, as \nCommittee members responded to international developments and the implications for the U.S. economy.  However, \neven after this adjustment, the path is steeper th an captured in the federal funds futures rates.  \n \n5 As previously suggested, one possible explanation could be a very weak private sect or forecast for the economy.  \nHowever, the policymaker forecasts in the March SEP expect a declining unempl oyment rate, a rising core inflation \nrate, and a real GDP forecast quite similar to the curren t economic forecasts from most of the private sector \nforecasters – and not much different than we have experi enced over this economic recovery.  So, a weak forecast \ndoesn’t seem to explain the low path expected for the funds rate. The path could suggest that the market is weighing \nthe risks from abroad more heavily than I am.  \n6 Obviously, the traditional model of knowing customers at the branch provides little protection when business takes \nplace over network connected devices.    ",

Rosengren \nPresident & Chief Executive Officer \nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston \n \n \nAmerican Savings Foundation Distinguished Lecture at \nCentral Connecticut State University  \n \n \nNew Britain, Connecticut  \nApril 18, 2016 \n \n \n \n \n  Good evening. It is a pleasur e to be joining you for the  American Savings Foundation \nDistinguished Lecture at Centra l Connecticut State University. \nAt the outset, let me note as I always do th at the views I express today are my own, not \nnecessarily those of my  colleagues at the Federal Reserv e’s Board of Governors or on the \nFederal Open Market Committee (the FOMC).  \nIncoming economic data for the first quarter suggest that growth in the quarter was \ndisappointing, with real GDP likely to have adva nced at a pace well belo w most estimates of \n\n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL April 18, 2016 at 7:15 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY * \n \n \n \n2 \n potential growth, about 2 percent.  However, I will point out that weakness in the first quarter has \nbeen a consistent pattern in recent years, and to  date, that weakness has generally been offset in \nsubsequent quarters, as the ec onomy has continued to improve slowly.  Certainly the March \nunemployment report showing 215,000 jobs created, along with an increase in the labor force \nparticipation rate to 63 percent,  is supportive of a more  optimistic reading of the GDP numbers.  \nAdditionally, the core PCE inflation rate is now  at 1.7 percent, much closer to the Federal \nReserve’s 2 percent target than we re the core PCE readings in 2015.  \nDespite this gradual improvement in the U. S. economy, global financial markets have \nbeen quite turbulent.  Concerns that low infla tion and weak growth abroad might spill over into \nthe U.S. have had an impact, it appears, and pric es in financial futures markets now suggest that \nmarket participants expect considerably fewer interest rate increases in the United States than historically occur when the Federal Reserve begins to raise rates.  Federal funds futures currently \nreflect the expectation of approxima tely one-quarter of a percentage  point increase in each of the \nnext three years.   \n While I believe that gradual federal funds ra te increases are absolu tely appropriate, I do \nnot see that the risks are so elevated, nor the outlook so pessimistic, as to justify the \nexceptionally shallow interest rate path currentl y reflected in financial futures markets. The \nforecast for economic variables contained in th e most recent Fed policymakers’ Summary of \nEconomic Projections is consistent with my own estimate – GDP growth slightly above potential \nand a continued slow decline in the unemployment rate.   \nFurthermore, I would point out that the extr emely shallow rate path reflected in the \nmarket for federal funds futures seems at odds w ith forecasts by private sector economists and by \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL April 18, 2016 at 7:15 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY * \n \n \n \n3 \n financial firms that serve as count erparties to the Federa l Reserve (the so-called primary dealers), \nas well as my own forecast for the U.S. economy.   Most of these for ecasts envision a much \nhealthier U.S. economy than is implied by that unusually shallow path of the funds rate, and \nmany of the major private forecasters expect shor t-term rates to rise more rapidly than implied \nby financial futures.  \nThe unemployment rate is currently 5 percent, and I expect it to continue to drift down.  \nAs I have noted publicly in the past, it is qui te appropriate to probe how low unemployment can \ngo, given that the inflation rate is below the Federal Reserve’s 2 percent target and wages are \nonly increasing modestly.  \nProbing just how low the unemployment rate can fall before risking overheating in the \neconomy can be beneficial for labor markets.  It  should encourage those w ho have left the labor \nmarket to re-enter, a welcome trend we have seen  recently.  Such probing is particularly helpful \nto those who became discouraged by the very weak labor market during and following the Great Recession, and thus stopped looking for work – as well as those who continue to be part-time \nworkers who would prefer full-time work.  In the parlance of labor economist s, I suspect that the \namount of so called labor market “slack” is grea ter than what is captured by the traditional and \nwidely reported U-3 measure of the unemployme nt rate, and we should welcome any remaining \nslack being absorbed by a healthy labor market. \n However, the unemployment rate is now at 5 percent – relatively close to my estimate of \nfull employment, 4.7 percent – and net payroll employment growth is averaging over 200,000 \njobs per month over the past quarter .  My concern is that given th ese conditions, an interest rate \npath at the pace embedded in the futures markets could risk an unemployment rate that falls well \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL April 18, 2016 at 7:15 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY * \n \n \n \n4 \n below the natural rate of unemployment.  We ar e currently at an unemployment rate where such \na large, rapid decline in une mployment could be risky, as  an overheating economy would \neventually produce inflation rising above our 2 percent goal, eventually necessitating a rapid \nremoval of monetary po licy accommodation.  I would prefer th at the Federal Reserve not risk \nmaking the mistake of significantly overshooting the full employment level, resulting in the need \nto rapidly raise interest rates – with potentiall y disruptive effects and an  increased risk of a \nrecession.   \nIn sum, in my view the very shallow path of rate increases imp lied by financial futures \nmarket pricing would likely result in an overheating that necessita tes the Fed eventually raising \ninterest rates more quickly than is desirabl e, which could endanger the ongoing recovery and \ncontinued growth. \n \nFinancial Futures and the Expected Path for Interest Rates \n \n Figure 1  provides the path of the federal funds  rate in the rate-tightening cycles \nfollowing the last two recessions.  The Federal Re serve raised interest rates by a quarter of a \npercentage point at each FOMC meeting in th e two years following the first increase in 2004.  \nThe pace of increases was even quicker when the FOMC began to raise rates in 1994.  In \ncontrast, as noted in my introduction, the federa l funds futures market is currently reflecting the \nexpectation of a much more grad ual pace of tightening this time around.  The market is currently \nassuming only a roughly one-quart er percentage point increase per year  rather than per FOMC \nmeeting as in the 2004 episode, over the next three y ears – an exceptionally sh allow rate path.    \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL April 18, 2016 at 7:15 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY * \n \n \n \n5 \n  The federal funds futures are not the only anom aly that I see in financial markets.  In \nFigure 2 , we see that the rate on 10 year Treasury secu rities is currently below 2 percent.  If one \nbelieves that the Federal Reserve will be successful in averaging 2 percent inflation over the next \n10 years, then investors in these benchmark secur ities are accepting a negativ e real rate of return \nover the 10 year period.   \n The pricing on both short- and long-term secur ities seems most consistent with either a \nfairly pessimistic best guess for the economy’s pr ospects in the near future, or with concern \nabout an unusually large “tail” risk (that is, a significant chance that the economy could be much \nweaker than expected).  Both s cenarios would affect th e path of federal funds rate futures prices. \nWith that in mind, I will turn now to private- sector forecasts for the economy, to see if \neconomists or financial forecasters are predicti ng either an unusually weak economy or very \nsignificant tail risk over th e next several years. \n \nPrivate-Sector Forecasts of the Economy \n Focusing first on the likely economic outlook, I would note that private-sector forecasts \ndo not seem particularly pessimistic.  Figure 3  shows the most recent Blue Chip forecast for real \nGDP, which aggregates the results of roughly 50 private sector economic forecasts.  Most of \nthese private sector forecasters are expecting a weak first quarter, but are not expecting that \nweakness to persist. \n Consistent with GDP growth that is e xpected to be somewhat above 2 percent, Figure 4  \nshows that the Blue Chip forecasters expect a gradual decrease in the unemployment rate.  The \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL April 18, 2016 at 7:15 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY * \n \n \n \n6 \n consensus is that the unemploymen t rate will level off at 4.5 percen t, a little below my estimate \nof full employment. \n The Blue Chip forecast extends only through 2017.  An alternative survey is conducted \nwith the primary dealers, the financial firms that  serve as counterparties to the Federal Reserve \nwhen we buy or sell government securities as part  of our monetary policy responsibilities.  The \nFederal Reserve Bank of New York surveys the pr imary dealers on a regular basis regarding the \neconomic outlook and their forecasts.  Figure 5  shows the primary dealers’ forecast for the \nunemployment rate through 2018.  Like the Blue Chip forecast, the primary dealers see the \nunemployment rate drifting down to 4.5 percen t by 2017, but then have it returning to 4.7 \npercent by the fourth quarter of 2018.  One interpreta tion of this path would be that it predicts the \nunemployment rate modestly overshooting fu ll employment but then stabilizing at full \nemployment as the Federal Reserve takes step s to gradually normalize interest rates. \n So the evidence suggests that economic forecasters and primary dealers do not seem to \nexpect a particularly weak economy.  But, it is possible that while they view the most likely \noutcome as benign, they fear an elevated risk of  a much more worrisome outcome.  If true, such \na pricing-in of tail risk probabi lity could potentially justify a low federal funds rate and 10-year \nTreasury rate, even with a favor able expected economic outlook.1  \n One way of ascertaining the per ceived potential for a heightened possibility of a tail risk \nevent is to look at surveys that try to captu re forecasters’ assessmen ts of risks around the \nforecast.  The Survey of Professional Forecasters (SPF) incorporates the ou tlook of private sector \neconomists and provides the distri bution of outcomes around their fore casts, as well as the most \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL April 18, 2016 at 7:15 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY * \n \n \n \n7 \n likely outcome in their forecast.  A significant tail  risk event would likely be reflected in a higher \nprobability of an elevated unemployment rate, whic h would be more consiste nt with a recession.   \nTo that end, Figure 6  examines the average probabil ity among SPF forecasters that the \nannual average unemployment rate will be 6 per cent or higher in either 2016 or 2017.  A 6 \npercent unemployment rate is a fu ll percentage point above the cu rrent unemployment rate of 5 \npercent, and would be consistent with a relativ ely mild recession.   But rather than being \nelevated, the probability of such an outcome ha s fallen quite significantly over time – in the \nsurveys taken in 2014, 2015, and 2016.  While some of this multi-year trend reflects the drifting \ndown of the realized unemploymen t rate, the probability has c ontinued to fall over the past \nseveral quarters, while the unemployment rate has been relatively stable near the current rate. \n Figure 7  provides the entire distribution of the pr edictions for the unemployment rate in \n2016 according to the two most recen t forecasts by the SPF.  While the average probability or \nassessed likelihood of the unemployment rate bei ng at recession levels is relatively low, the \nsurveys show an increased probability of the une mployment rate falling below 4 percent, a rate \nmost forecasters would judge to be we ll below estimates of full employment.  Figure 8  shows \nthat for 2017, the probability that the unemploym ent rate will fall below 4 percent actually rises \nto just over 10 percent.   \n Figure 9  highlights one reason why it might be ri sky if the unemployment rate were to \nfall well below the estimates of the natural rate of unemployment.  The green line provides the Congressional Budget Office’s estimate of the na tural rate of unemploym ent.  As the figure \nshows, prior to the last three recessions, the unemp loyment rate fell well below the green line.  \nAt times like that, the economy has exceeded it s sustainable level of activity, and monetary \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL April 18, 2016 at 7:15 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY * \n \n \n \n8 \n policy often needs to react to try to m odestly slow the economy.  Unfortunately, modestly  \nslowing down the economy is difficult, and as the chart shows, during these previous episodes \nthe unemployment rate subsequently rose significantly above the natu ral rate of unemployment.    \n Recently, the unemployment rate has been fluc tuating around 5 percent.  In part, this \nreflects positive news on labor fo rce participation.  Unemployment has remained stable in the \nface of strong growth because many of the new j obs have gone to workers re-entering the labor \nforce.  As Figure 10  shows, for the preceding five year s, the unemployment rate has been \ndrifting down along with the labor force participation rate.   \nOne reason for the decline in labor force participation involves changes in the \ndemographics of the labor market.   As the pe rcentage of the population (notably baby boomers) \nreaching retirement age rose, labor force particip ation was expected to decline.  However, at \nleast some of the decline in labor force partic ipation has reflected th e poor job prospects of \nworkers who have become discouraged or have not  looked for work over the past year given the \njobs that are available to them.  As the labor market has become tighter, some individuals have \nreturned to the labor force, as we had long expected.2   \nOne reason for probing how low the unemploymen t rate can go is that it will encourage \nmore people to return to the labor force.  Part icularly for those workers who may need additional \ntraining, there are benefits to th e individuals and to the economy  of having a higher percentage \nof the population working.  However, these advantag es need to be weighed against the risk that \nsignificantly more people might not actually be drawn into the labor force, and in that case with \ncontinued employment growth, the unemployment rate would fall well below the natural rate. \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL April 18, 2016 at 7:15 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY * \n \n \n \n9 \n At the Boston Federal Reserve Bank we have been expecting only a slow decline in the \nunemployment rate, a forecast in part predicated  on people being drawn into the labor force.  \nHowever, given the difficulty in accurately estim ating labor force participation, our model has \nassumed that real GDP growth somewhat over 2 percent will be consistent with some gradual \nfurther decline in the unemployment rate.  In pa rt it is gradual because of increased labor force \nparticipation, but also in part as a result of a gradua l normalization of interest rates, which we \nalso assume. \nFigure 11  shows that in addition to the financia l market prices, the Survey of Primary \nDealers reports a rising probability of seeing no federal funds rate increase  this year.  As of the \nMarch 21 update, the survey indicated somewhat more than a 20 percent probability of no change this year.  Even more st riking is that the federal funds futures market does not price a 25 \nbasis point increase in the federal funds rate wi th near-certainty until 2017.  In my view, such \ndour interest rate projections do not seem consis tent with the outlook for the economy that I and \nmany others share. \n \nConcluding Observations \n High frequency real economic data are indi cating that the real economy likely grew less \nthan its estimated potential growth rate in the first quarter of this year.  N onetheless, most private \nforecasters – and my own forecast – expect the economy to continue to improve over the next \nseveral quarters.  In addition, while there have  been significant headwinds from abroad, and \nmarket turbulence relate d to those headwinds, I view the U.S. economy as fundamentally sound \nand likely to perform better than the domestic  economies of most trading partners.   \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL April 18, 2016 at 7:15 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY * \n \n \n \n10 \n In my view, this represents an outlook st rong enough to engender fu rther decline in the \nunemployment rate, even with some gradual normali zation of interest rates.   As I see it, the \npricing in the federal funds futures market, which implies roughly three-quar ters of a percentage \npoint in increases by the end of  2018, is inconsistent with the assessment – mine and that of \nmany forecasters – of continued moderate growth in the U.S. economy.  \n Thank you again for inviting me to be with you today  at Central Connecticut State \nUniversity. \n \n                                                            \n \n1 Another explanation is that the level of r* – the equilibrium  real interest rate – is deemed to be extremely low by \nparticipants in the federal funds future markets.  Histor ically, r* has been around 2.5%, which is consistent with \ninflation of 2% and a nominal interest rate of 4.5%.  Even with an r* of 0, the current fed funds rate implies a \nsignificant amount of policy accommodati on at this stage in the business cycl e.  As economic headwinds fade over \ntime, r* should increase gradually and be around 1.25% to 1.5% in 2018.  The 75 basis points through 2018 in the \nfutures markets would require a value for r* well into negative territory over th e forecast horizon.  Most estimates, \ninstead, already place the curr ent value of r*at or s lightly above zero.    \n \n2 Since September of 2015, we have seen an increase in labo r force participation – with a significant flow of people \nfrom outside of the labor force becoming employed.  While it is difficult to predict with  certainty how many people \nare likely to return to the labor force as the ec onomy improves, this is certainly a positive sign.  ",

Thank you very much for invi ting me to Concord, New Hampshire to \ntalk about the economy.  At the outset, let me not e as I always do that the views I express today \nare my own, not necessarily those of my colleag ues at the Federal Reserve’s Board of Governors \nor on the Federal Open Market Committee (the FOMC). \nIn addition to this discussion, I am also l ooking forward to a meeting this afternoon about \nthe Boston Federal Reserve Bank’s work on post-industrial cities1 and how that work might be \nbeneficially applied in New Hampshire.   \n\n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Thursday, May 12, 2016 at 12:20 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY * \n \n \n \n2 \n I would also like to offer very special th anks to Richard Uchida for extending the \ninvitation to be here today.  I have gotten to know Richar d through our work on the Colby \nCollege Board of Trustees, and I know how dedi cated he is to so many legal, civic, and \ncharitable endeavors.  His public service is something I greatly admire.  \n Last Friday’s employment report for April wa s one of the first major indicators of how \nthe economy is unfolding in the second quarter.  Employers added 160,000 new jobs in April.  \nWhile this was a bit below mark et expectations, and below th e 203,000 average monthly gain for \nthe first quarter, it still reflects what I would consider to be re latively strong payroll employment \ngrowth.  Given broad demographi c trends, like the slowing of population growth and increased \nbaby boomer retirements, normal or “trend” pa yroll employment growth is now between 80,000 \nand 100,000 jobs a month.2   \nAs a result, if April’s payroll employment growth continues, it should be strong enough \nto bring some further tightening of  labor markets.  With the U.S.  unemployment rate at 5 percent \nin April, we remain only somewhat above my  estimate of “full” employment, which is 4.7 \npercent unemployment.   \nI would add that other elements of the jobs re port were positive.  Average hourly earnings \nincreased by 2.5 percent over the past year, a nd there was an increas e in the workweek.  \nSomewhat higher wages and hours worked will add to household income, and so should be \npositive drivers of future consumption.  \n First-quarter GDP growth, at only 0.5 pe rcent, was weaker than most economists \nexpected. But most private forecasters do not ex pect such weakness to persist.  And after \nconcerns about foreign growth at  the turn of the year impacted  U.S. and foreign stock markets \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Thursday, May 12, 2016 at 12:20 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY * \n \n \n \n3 \n through mid-February of this year, markets ha ve since rebounded, both he re and abroad.  In \naddition, the dollar has recently depreciated on a trade-weighted basis, and the economic \nindicators for many of our trading partners have come in stronger  than expected.  For example, \ngrowth in the Euro area in the first quarter was actually faster than in the United States.  These \ndevelopments bode well for expor t-dependent U.S. industries.  Furthermore, domestic demand is \nstarting to rebound as auto sales, which had dippe d a bit in March, have returned to their mid-\n2015 levels.    \nAll this suggests that, with diminished h eadwinds from abroad and consumers responding \nto growing household income and wealth, consum er spending should improve over the course of \nthe second quarter.  Of course at th is point, this is still a forecast, as we currently have very little \nby way of actual spending data for this quarter. \n However, the limited second-quarter data to da te are consistent with my expectation that \ngrowth in real GDP in the second quarter will be somewhat above my estimate of the so-called \n“potential” growth rate for the economy – about 1.75 percent in my analysis.  The early data are \nalso consistent with some con tinued gradual improvement in labor markets and with inflation \nmoving gradually closer to the Federal Re serve’s 2 percent targ et for inflation.  \nIf the economic data that come in over the c ourse of this quarter confirm these trends, it \nwill be appropriate to continue the gradual normaliz ation of monetary policy that began with the \ninitial increase in short-term interest rates last  December.  In my view, the market remains too \npessimistic about the fundamental strength of the U.S. economy, and the likelihood of removing \nmonetary accommodation is higher than is curr ently priced into financial markets based on \ncurrent data.  \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Thursday, May 12, 2016 at 12:20 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY * \n \n \n \n4 \n Exploring Recent Economic Data \n Allow me to walk you through some of th e analysis that underpins my views and \nexpectations. \nFigure 1 provides the quarterly patter n of real GDP over the past two years.  The first-\nquarter data are shown in red.  As  I mentioned a moment ago, first- quarter real GDP for this year \nwas a disappointing 0.5 percent.  Since 2014, firs t-quarter real GDP growth has tended to be \ndisappointing, but over the last tw o years it has provided a poor signal of subsequent quarters, \nwhich experienced stronger growt h.  This pattern may partly refl ect weather anomalies, or it may \nsuggest imperfect adjustments for changing seasona l patterns in the data.  Still, it will be \nimportant to obtain more data on spending to dete rmine whether it is likely that the economy will \ngrow above potential. \n An important area of weakness in firs t-quarter real GDP was consumption, which \naccounts for approximately two-thirds of real  GDP.  Consumption grew 1.9 percent at an \nannualized rate in the quarter.  This moderate pace is somewhat surprising, given the progress in \nthe usual supports for consumer spending during the quarter.  By the end of the quarter, stock \nprices had recovered, and housing pr ices rose, as did personal income, driven in part by gains in \npayroll employment.  Most forecasters expect these relatively strong fundamentals to spur \nconsumption, a key driver for most of their forecasts.  Without strong consumption, most \nforecasts look decidedly weaker.     \nWhile we have relatively scant data  so far on second-quarter activity, Figure 2  provides \nsome reassuring data for auto sales – which are re leased with a very short time lag.  The last two \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Thursday, May 12, 2016 at 12:20 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY * \n \n \n \n5 \n months of data are shown in re d.  Fortunately, the sizab le decline in March did not persist, as \nauto sales rebounded, although they  are still below levels seen earlier this year. \n The most important second-quarter data poi nt we have in hand is last Friday’s \nemployment report, which indicated that Ap ril payroll employment grew by 160,000 jobs, as \nshown in Figure 3 .  While roughly the same as the growth in January, this was below the \naverage monthly increase in the first quarter.  However, these da ta still reflect relatively robust \nemployment growth at a time when the U.S. econo my is close to what most economists consider \nfull employment.   \nIn fact, as we approach full employment, we  expect employment growth to moderate \ntoward its long-run sustainable growth rate – a rate that will neither raise nor lower the \nunemployment rate.  Federal Reserve economists  currently estimate that rate, based on \ndemographic and population data, to be about 80,000 to 100,000 jobs per month.  So, while the \nApril jobs growth was below market expectati ons, it remained strong enough to continue the \ngradual improvement in labor markets.  \n Furthermore, other data in the employment report were even more positive.  While the \nofficial, widely reported  U-3 measure of the unemployment rate  remained the same as in March, \nat 5 percent, the broader U-6 rate (which incl udes the unemployed, as well as people “marginally \nattached” to the labor force, and peop le employed part time for economic reasons3) declined \nsomewhat further to 9.7 percent.   \nAs shown in Figure 4 , the U-6 unemployment rate was ove r 12 percent at the beginning \nof 2014.  The decline that has taken place since then  reflects continued reductions in the number \nof workers employed only part time for economic r easons, and also the tre nd of more so-called \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Thursday, May 12, 2016 at 12:20 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY * \n \n \n \n6 \n discouraged workers finding work over the past two years.  The spread between U-6 and U-3 is \none of the major reasons for tightening monetary policy only  gradually even though we are \nrelatively close to full employment, with more workers being drawn into full-time employment \nas labor markets improve. \n Another positive effect of further gradual tightening of labor markets is that over time, \ntighter labor markets should lead  to higher wages and salaries.  Figure 5  provides some evidence \nthat we are beginning to see a te ntative upward trend in average hourly earnings.  Over the past \nyear, average hourly earnings have risen about 2. 5 percent, which represents a gradual increase \nfrom the 2 percent pace we had seen in earlier years. \n Figure 6  shows there has also been a somewhat positive trend in the rate of inflation, \nwhich had been extremely subdued.  Over the pa st year, inflation – measured by the Core \nPersonal Consumption Expenditures Price Index, or Core PCE – has averaged 1.6 percent.  This \nis somewhat higher than the 1.3 to 1.4 percen t that we were averaging throughout 2015.  While \nstill below the 2 percent target set by the Fe deral Reserve as an op timum level of annual \ninflation, the most recent data hint  at a gradual move toward that  target – a trend that was not \nevident last year. \n So, while it is still early in the quarter, it appears that the economy is continuing to \ngradually improve.  We are adding jobs faster than trend, broader measures of unemployment \nhave continued to tighten, and th ere has been a welcome upward tr end in both wages and prices.  \nAnd while we have limited spending data for the quarter, the data we do have seem consistent \nwith growth a bove potential. \n \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Thursday, May 12, 2016 at 12:20 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY * \n \n \n \n7 \n Risks Associated with Leaving Rates Too Low for Too Long \n I believe that one of the benefits of our current accommodative monetary policy, even as \nwe approach full employment, is that it fosters co ntinued gradual improvement in labor markets.  \nAs I have noted in the past, it is quite appropriate to probe on the natural rate of unemployment \nto see how low it might be, given the benefit to wo rkers.  We have seen workers rejoin the labor \nforce, many of them previously having given up looking for work. \nHowever, there can be potential costs to accommodation if rates st ay too low for too \nlong.  One cost involves the potential of very low interest rates en couraging speculative \nbehavior.  One area where I have some concern in  this regard is the commercial real estate \nmarket.  Let me walk you through some of  the numbers that I find illuminating.   \nFigure 7  shows commercial real estate prices fo r four broad property types.  As labor \nmarkets have improved and vacancy rates have dec lined, it is not surprising that there has been \nsome appreciation in commercial real estate prices .  For apartments, prices have increased – as \nmany potential homebuyers have chosen to rent rather than own, presumably chastened by the \nexperiences of many homeowners during the fi nancial crisis, or constrained by stricter \nrequirements for down-payments and other mort gage qualifications.  However, prices now \nexceed the peaks reached prior to the financial cr isis, and are well above the levels reached in \n2005 as real estate prices were beginning to accelerate before the financial crisis.4 \nWhile Figure 7  reflects national commercial real estate prices, regional indices show that \nprices have been rising particul arly quickly on both coasts.  Certainly in Boston, one of the \nrelatively hot commercial real estate markets, the higher prices for commercial real estate are readily apparent.   \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Thursday, May 12, 2016 at 12:20 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY * \n \n \n \n8 \n Figure 8  shows real multifamily residential mortgage growth from 1976 to 2015. Growth \nin mortgage debt on multifamily properties is up sh arply from lows reached in this cycle in 2010. \nIn the most recent quarter, multifamily mortgage gr owth was just shy of the pre-recession peak.  \nWe care about potentially inflated commercial real  estate prices because they might risk a \nbout of financial instability.  History shows that  most periods of serious financial instability \ninvolve a scenario in which debt  is high relative to a volatile underlying asset, and the value of \nthe asset subsequently declines.  These declines  not only create problems for the owners of the \nasset (in this case, prop erty), but also for the lenders – w ho may end up acquiring the asset in the \nevent of default.  Often these lender s are highly levered institutions.   \nIn fact, this exact scenario played out in New England in the late 1980s and early 1990s, \nresulting in slumping real estate  prices, failing financial institu tions, and broader problems of \ncredit availability for borrowers (both individu als and firms) that were dependent on financial \ninstitutions for loans.  Given that history, it is  important that we take actions early enough to \navoid a repetition of  that experience. \nPotential concerns surrounding commercial re al estate led to a recent Interagency \nStatement on Prudential Risk Management fo r Commercial Real Es tate Lending (SR 15-17)5 \nthat, along with the 2006 Intera gency Guidance on Concentrations of Commercial Real Estate \nLending (SR 07-1),6 emphasized the need for exposure th resholds, increased monitoring, and \nprudent risk-management practices.  While this guidance applies to regulated banks, it is notable \nthat commercial real estate loans are also  being provided by non-bank lenders (and foreign \ninvestors).   \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Thursday, May 12, 2016 at 12:20 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY * \n \n \n \n9 \n In sum, one potential cost to keeping rates too low for too long is that doing so might \nencourage excessive risk-taking in commercial real estate – a sect or likely to be influenced by \nlow borrowing costs. \nA second possible cost of keeping rates too low for too long relates to the limits we see in \nmonetary policy’s ability to “fin e tune” the economy.  Consider Figure 9 .  Once unemployment \nhas reached its low point in the economic cycle, it is unusual for it to proceed smoothly back to \nthe natural rate.  The red highlighting indicates the first time that the unemployment rate rises by \n0.4 percentage points after hitting a cyclical low.  There are no  episodes in which unemployment \nrose a bit and remained stable at its natural employment rate.  Instead, relatively soon after the \nperiods shown here with red highlighting, une mployment rises significantly – that is, we \nexperience a recession, as indica ted by the gray shading.   \nThe chart strongly suggests that it has prove n difficult to calibrate policy so as to \ngradually increase the unemployment rate, gen tly nudging it back toward full employment.  The \nlesson is that policymakers shoul d avoid significantly overshooti ng their best estimates of the \nnatural rate of unemployment.   \nToday, the unemployment rate is still somewh at above my estimate of the natural rate, \n4.7 percent.  But waiting too long to have more  normalized rates risks possibly overshooting on \nthe unemployment rate, and needing to tighten  more quickly than would be desirable. \n \n \n \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Thursday, May 12, 2016 at 12:20 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY * \n \n \n \n10 \n Concluding Observations \nIn summary and conclusion, I would note th at the economy has continued to improve \ngradually.  While it has been a slow, methodical  recovery from the Great Recession, it is \nimportant to recognize that we are approachi ng full employment, and getting closer to the \nFederal Reserve’s 2 percent target for inflation.   The real (inflation-adju sted) federal funds rate \nremains quite stimulative, which is unusual for an economy that is near both of the Federal \nReserve’s dual mandate goals (stable prices, which we target as 2 percent inflation, and \nmaximum sustainable employment).   \nIf the incoming economic data continue to be  consistent with gradual improvement in \nlabor markets and inflation getting closer to target, the Fed should be  ready to gradually \nnormalize interest rates, perhaps at a pace not cu rrently anticipated by the federal funds futures \nmarket, as I have noted in other talks.7   \nOf course, there is always the potential for di sruptions from abroad or  at home that could \nimpact the U.S. economy.  However, such concerns  are only pertinent if th ey materially change \nthe outlook for the U.S. economy.    \nAll in all, should incoming economic data conf irm that we continue  to make progress on \nboth inflation and labor markets, I believe the Fe deral Reserve should con tinue with the gradual \nremoval of monetary policy accommodation. \n Thank you. \n \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Thursday, May 12, 2016 at 12:20 P.M.

I would like to thank our hosts, the Bank of Finland and the Global \nInterdependence Center, for inviting me to  speak as part of this forum.   \nIn addition to discussing the main topic of th e panel, the experience in the United States \nand Europe with quantitative easing, I will provide a few comments on the current outlook for \nthe U.S. economy.  The U.S. experience is an impor tant part of the discus sion, as we are in the \nprocess of gradually normalizing in terest rates, and a key consid eration with quantitative easing \n\n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Monday, June 6, 2016 at 2:15 A.M.U.S. Eastern Time and 9:15 A.M.in Helsinki, Finland, OR UPON DELIVERY * \n \n \n \n2 \n and nontraditional monetary policy tools more gene rally is the strategy fo r exiting when that \nbecomes appropriate. \nAt the outset, let me note as I always do th at the views I express today are my own, not \nnecessarily those of my  colleagues at the Federal Reserv e’s Board of Governors or on the \nFederal Open Market Committee (the FOMC). \nIn the United States, the central bank has taken the first step toward more normalized \nmonetary conditions with the 25 basis point increase  in the target range fo r the federal funds rate \nin December.  It is my expectation that econom ic conditions will continue to gradually improve, \nwhich in turn would justify further actions to normalize policy, continuing a gradual return to a \nmore normal interest rate environment.   \nLately the economic data have been choppy.  In  the first quarter, em ployment growth was \nstrong but spending data showed weakness.  To  date in the second quarter, we have had a \nreversal of that pattern, with economic data consistent with a pick-up in growth, but weaker \nemployment growth.  However, I still expect sufficient economic growth  to justify a gradual \nremoval of accommodation.    \nI would note that the move toward policy norm alization has been much slower than in \nprevious U.S. recoveries, because of economic c onditions characterized by a very gradual return \nto full employment and to the Federal Reserve’ s 2 percent inflation target.  I expect the \nnormalization process will continue to be gradua l, compared with previous episodes of U.S. \ninterest rate tightening.   \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Monday, June 6, 2016 at 2:15 A.M.U.S. Eastern Time and 9:15 A.M.in Helsinki, Finland, OR UPON DELIVERY * \n \n \n \n3 \n The most comprehensive and complete evalua tion of monetary policy tools can take \nplace only after a return to more normal economi c conditions and monetary policy.  Still, with \nthat caveat, my overall assessment of quantitative eas ing is that it was quite  successfully utilized \nin the United States.  One reason the U.S. is now  relatively close to achie ving both aspects of the \nFederal Reserve’s dual mandate from Congress – full employment and price stability (which the \nFederal Reserve targets at 2 percent inflation) – is the early and forceful use of quantitative easing in the aftermath of the financial crisis.  Real rates that are rele vant to households and \nfirms have been quite low, in part as a result  of the accommodative monetary policy.  This has \nstimulated the U.S. economy despite forceful he adwinds stemming from the financial crisis and \nfrom economic struggles confron ting our trading partners.   \n With regard to the use of negative interest rates, I would say the e xperience in Japan and \nparts of Europe seems mixed.  It will take some time before one can fully assess the overall impact on the Japanese and European economies.  But my assessment so far of the effectiveness \nof the transmission mechanism of negative-rate policy, and of behavioral responses to negative \ninterest rates, make this a t ool to use only after other nontradi tional monetary policy tools – the \n“more-conventional unconventional” tools – have been exhausted. \n \nA Few Comments on the U.S. Economic Outlook \n The minutes of the April FOMC meeting in dicated the conditions that would make it \nappropriate to further raise inte rest rates include a rebound in spe nding (that is, growth from the \nfirst quarter level), continued st rengthening of labor markets, and additional progress toward \nreaching the Federal Reserve’s 2 percent inflation target.\n1   \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Monday, June 6, 2016 at 2:15 A.M.U.S. Eastern Time and 9:15 A.M.in Helsinki, Finland, OR UPON DELIVERY * \n \n \n \n4 \n Figure 1  provides the forecasts for second quarter  real GDP from two groups of private \nsector forecasters, as well as the Federa l Reserve Bank of Atlanta’s GDPNow “Nowcast.”2  All \nthree indicate an expectation that real GDP growth will pick up in the second quarter of this year.  \nThe Federal Reserve Bank of Boston’s forecast sim ilarly expects growth in the second quarter to \nbe somewhat above 2 percent. \n One reason for the widespread optimism that  the second quarter will include something \nof a “snap back” from the weak growth of the fi rst quarter is the strong retail sales report for \nApril, as shown in Figure 2.   The April increase was large, relative to sales over the past year \nand was fairly widely distributed across retail cat egories.  Because consumption is approximately \ntwo-thirds of U.S. GDP, strong consumption provides a signifi cant boost to the overall economy. \n In terms of labor markets, the employment  situation report for May was disappointing.  \nNonfarm payroll employment grew by only 38,000 j obs; however, we should note that this \nnumber was held down by about 35,000 jobs as a re sult of a significant strike which has since \nended.3  In addition, the previous two months of  payroll employment were revised down by \n59,000 jobs.  The unemployment rate fell to 4.7 percen t, in part due to a 0.2 percentage point \ndecline in the civilian labor fo rce participation rate.     \nGiven that the labor market contrasts with th e pattern in the first quarter, and the pick-up \nin spending observed so far from other data, it wi ll be important to see whether the weakness in \nthis report is an anomaly or reflects a broader slowing in labor markets.   \nDespite the weakness in the recent employment  report, at 4.7 per cent unemployment we \nare now at my estimate of full employment.  On Figure 3 , the shaded band shows the central \ntendency4 of the forecasts of the longer-run unemploym ent rate that Federal Reserve presidents \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Monday, June 6, 2016 at 2:15 A.M.U.S. Eastern Time and 9:15 A.M.in Helsinki, Finland, OR UPON DELIVERY * \n \n \n \n5 \n and governors submitted in the March Summary of Economic Projections (the SEP).  Note that \n4.7 percent is at the bottom of the cen tral tendency and is also the median  unemployment \nprojection for year-end 2016 by Fede ral Reserve’s policymakers. \nIn terms of inflation, the rise in energy prices  and the depreciation of the dollar relative to \nJanuary highs reverses some of th e factors that had been contributi ng to low inflation readings in \nthe U.S.  The core inflation rate, shown in Figure 4 , has been 1.6 percent over the past year, \nsomewhat higher than in 2015.  So, while it is  only gradual progress, we are seeing some \nevidence of inflation moving toward  the 2 percent inflation target. \n The normalization process has been very gr adual – appropriately so, given the very \ngradual return to full employment and to the Fede ral Reserve’s 2 percent inflation target – but \nthis also means that a truly comprehensive eval uation of quantitative easi ng in the United States \nwill not be possible for some time.  Still, evidence to date allows me to share my current assessment of the quantitative easing experience in the United States. \n \nQuantitative Easing in the United States \n I was a strong supporter of pursuing quantit ative easing in the Un ited States during the \naftermath of the financial crisis and in light of the very slow recovery.  My reasoning was quite \nstraightforward.  With short-term interest ra tes at the zero lower bound, an unemployment rate \nwell above the level associated with full employment, and infl ation too low – well below the \nFederal Reserve’s target of 2 percent – I was co nvinced the U.S. economy needed more stimulus.  \nIdeally, perhaps, more of that stimulus would have been generated by fiscal policy, but when \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Monday, June 6, 2016 at 2:15 A.M.U.S. Eastern Time and 9:15 A.M.in Helsinki, Finland, OR UPON DELIVERY * \n \n \n \n6 \n fiscal stimulus was not forthcoming, monetary po licymakers needed to act strongly to ensure \nattainment of our dual mandate goals. \n I would note that the U.S. central bank used  other tools in additi on to quantitative easing \n– most notably, forward guidance that highlight ed our plan to remain accommodative for some \ntime; and earlier on, liquidity fac ilities designed to address some of the stresses experienced in \nfinancial markets during and af ter the financial crisis.   \nHowever, I view quantitative easing as one of  our most important monetary policy tools \nin this cycle.  In the wake of the financial cr isis, the recovery to norma l levels of activity was \npainfully slow.  Lower long-term rates and highe r asset prices generally  would help to spur \nactivity, but with the federal f unds rate at its effective lo wer bound, monetary policy makers \nneeded another tool to affect long rates and other asset prices.  Purchasing  longer-term securities \npushes down the interest rates paid by households and firms,5 increasing aggregate demand in \nthe economy.  I would note that in the United Stat es, the central bank is limited to purchasing \nTreasury or agency mortgage-backed securities, while many other central banks have far more \nlatitude to purchase assets th at may more directly influence the borrowing costs of households \nand firms.   \nNumerous studies have examined announcem ent effects and found that quantitative \neasing significantly affected rates, although the studies find different impacts depending on the \nnature and circumstances of the quantitative easing.6  Today, I will not try to replicate those \nstudies by focusing on event dates, but rather wi ll simply examine whether financial conditions \nfor households and firms were generally easier after the onset of quantitative easing, with less \nspecific focus on the various programs.7  Note that interest rates were impacted not only by the \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Monday, June 6, 2016 at 2:15 A.M.U.S. Eastern Time and 9:15 A.M.in Helsinki, Finland, OR UPON DELIVERY * \n \n \n \n7 \n quantitative easing in the United States, but also the quantitativ e easing implemented in Japan \nand Europe, as well as other factors such as relatively weak global economic conditions. \n Figure 5  shows the real rates on auto  loans in the U.S.  Prior to quantitative easing, real \nauto loan rates had generally been above 4 per cent, while over the past several years (after \nquantitative easing) real auto loan  rates in the United States have  been below 2 percent.  More \nrecently, with the increased expectation of rising s hort-term interest rates in the United States, \nthere has been a very modest upw ard trend in real auto loan ra tes.  Consumers seem to have \nresponded to the lower real interest rates and more  robust economy, as auto sales have been quite \nstrong over the past several years,  returning to pre-recession highs. \n Figure 6  shows the real rate on 30 -year fixed-rate mortgages.  Prior to quantitative \neasing, real mortgage rates had generally been above 4 percent, and afterward real mortgage \nrates in the United States have ge nerally been fluctuating between 2 and 3 percent.  Over the past \nseveral years, residential real  estate investment has been trending up, though many borrowers \nstill find it difficult to meet the post-cris is credit standards for home mortgages. \n Figure 7  shows the real rates on co rporate bonds.  Prior to quantitative easing, real 10-\nyear rates for AAA and AA corporate borrowers ge nerally fluctuated betw een 3 and 4 percent, \nwhile over the past several year s, real rates for AAA and AA bo rrowers have generally varied \nbetween 1 and 2 percent.   \n In sum, households and firms have seen lower real rates since the fi rst quantitative easing \nwas implemented in the United States.  In part be cause of this monetary stimulus, enacted after \nthe traditional policy rate h it the zero lower bound, the U.S. economy is approaching both \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Monday, June 6, 2016 at 2:15 A.M.U.S. Eastern Time and 9:15 A.M.in Helsinki, Finland, OR UPON DELIVERY * \n \n \n \n8 \n elements of the Federal Reserve’s dual mandate .  This stimulus led, in part, to conditions \nappropriate for the initial increase in  short-term rates in December 2015. \nWhile the full evaluation of quantitative easi ng in the United States will need to wait until \nmonetary policy has fully normalized, I expect the results will suggest that the tool was useful \nduring the crisis and therefore w ill be appropriate in the future , should we once again experience \na recession where short-term inte rest rates hit the zero lower bound. \n \nA Few Observations on Negative Interest Rates \n Turning to the issue of negative rates, let me first say that fortunately  I do not expect that \nthe United States will need to us e negative interest  rates given that we are slowly recovering, and \non the path to more normalized monetary policy.  Also, I will say that for several reasons which I will discuss today, I would only turn to the tool of  negative rates as a last resort.  While a number \nof central banks have implemented negative intere st rates, I think the Ja panese experience is \nespecially informative because th e announcement of negative interest  rates came as a surprise to \nmany, and the results to date seem so decidedly mixed. \n Unlike quantitative eas ing, which reduces long-term rates and credit spreads, negative \nshort-term policy rates have their most direct effects on short-term market rates.  As is the case \nwith low but positive policy rates, negative policy rates generally make holding short-term securities less attractive and, a ll things equal, are expected to depreciate the currency.  \nInterestingly, after the an nouncement of negative interest rates in Japan (see Figure 8 ), the \nexchange rate appreciated .  This decreased the costs of im ports, lowering their contribution to \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Monday, June 6, 2016 at 2:15 A.M.U.S. Eastern Time and 9:15 A.M.in Helsinki, Finland, OR UPON DELIVERY * \n \n \n \n9 \n overall inflation, and made hitting the inflation target more difficult.   The real cost of mortgages \nis modestly lower following the announcement (shown in Figure 9 ) while the real cost of \ncorporate borrowing (in Figure 10 ) actually ends up rising.  So the positive effects expected \nfrom the announcement are not clearly reflected in the data.   \n Furthermore, the announcement of negative rates in Japan does seem to have had some \nadverse consequences.  The monetary policy tr ansmission mechanism is more effective when \nbanks are healthy and able to pass on lower interest costs on to borrowers.  However, as Figure \n11 shows, Japanese bank stocks declined after the announcement of negative interest rates, \nperhaps reflecting concern, in part, that negative rates will prove challenging for the profit model \nof Japanese banks.8 \n An additional concern is that the presence of  negative rates could disrupt some short-term \ncredit markets.  As an example, the volume of trades in Japan’s call market decreased, and concerns have been raised over a lack of ma rket liquidity for short-term maturities (see Figure \n12). \n At this early stage, the beha vior of Japanese consumers and firms in response to negative \ninterest rates is as yet un clear.  If households view negative inte rest rates as a tool of last resort, \nthe behavioral response of hous eholds and firms may be dominated by risk-averse behavior, \nresulting in less consumption and investment.  Much more time, experience, and empirical \nobservation across countries will be needed to fully assess the impact of negative interest rates as \na monetary policy tool.  However, in my view the results to date do not seem particularly \npromising.  I believe that for the United States , negative rates would be a tool to be employed \nonly after most other tools had proved insufficient to stimulate the economy. \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Monday, June 6, 2016 at 2:15 A.M.U.S. Eastern Time and 9:15 A.M.in Helsinki, Finland, OR UPON DELIVERY * \n \n \n \n10 \n Concluding Observations \n Central banks around the world have tried a va riety of new tools to address the severe \neconomic problems experienced since the financial cr isis.  My view is that the positive response \nof the U.S. economy to quantitative easing is one of the reasons we are now approaching both \nelements of the Federal Reserve’s dual mandate. \nIn contrast, I would observe th at negative interest rates seem  to have much more mixed \nresults.  At least that is the early conclusi on I would draw, based on in itial reactions to the \nannouncement of negative inte rest rates in Japan. \n Fortunately, in the United States I do not e xpect additional quantitative easing or negative \ninterest rates to be utilized gi ven that we are slowly recove ring, and on the path to more \nnormalized monetary policy.  I expect that th e U.S. central bank will gradually normalize \nmonetary policy as the three conditions set out  in the April FOMC minutes are met.   \nThank you. \n  \n \n                                                            \n1 More precisely the minutes said, “ Most participants judged that if incoming data were consistent with economic \ngrowth picking up in the second quarter, labor market conditions continuing to strengthen, and inflation making \nprogress toward the Committee's 2 percent objective , then it likely would be appropriate for the Committee to \nincrease the target range for the federal funds rate in June. ” \n \n2 See https://www.frbatlanta.org/cqer /research/gdpnow.aspx?panel=1.  \n \n3 The Labor Department counts striking workers as unemployed. \n \n4 The central tendency excludes the three highest and three lowest projections for each variable in each year.

I would like to thank our hos ts, the Shanghai Adva nced Institute of \nFinance, for inviting me to participate in th is exchange of ideas and perspectives.   \nLet me note as I always do that the views I express today are my  own, not necessarily \nthose of my colleagues at the Federal Reserve’ s Board of Governors or on the Federal Open \nMarket Committee (the FOMC). \n\n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, August 31, 2016 at 3:15 A.M.U.S. Eastern Time and 3:15 P.M.in Beijing, Chi na, OR UPON DELIVERY * \n \n \n \n2 \n It is a pleasure to be here in Beijing to share some observations.  Let me begin with the \nobvious: growth in the global economy has conti nued to underwhelm.  In response to these \ndisappointing economic results, cen tral banks in many developed c ountries have reduced short- \nand long-term rates to historic lows.  Indeed, a number of countries now have negative rates on a \nsignificant proportion of their sovereign debt.  In the financial sector, the low rate environment \nhas continued to challenge the business models of many financia l intermediaries, and troubles \nwithin some banking organizations continue to  present downside risks in many parts of the \nworld, particularly in Europe.  And it is not only developed economi es that are facing challenges; \nmany emerging economies are still suffering from th e decline in global commodity prices which \nhas resulted, in part, from the slow growth across much of the world.   \n Weak global growth has hindered the United States expansion sin ce the end of the so-\ncalled Great Recession.  The most recent two quart ers have been no exception, with GDP growth \nbelow 2 percent in both the fi rst and second quarters of 2016.   \nYet despite the weak growth in the U.S. economy, by historical standards U.S. labor \nmarkets are now at, or close t o, the rate of unemployment that  most economists consider full \nemployment.  And, while “core” inflation (usi ng the Personal Consumption Expenditures price \nindex or PCE1) remains below the Federal Reserve’s 2 pe rcent target, there have been gradual \nincreases in our core measure of PCE inflation – from readings of 1.3 to 1.4 percent last year to \n1.6 percent currently.   \nWith the U.S. economy closing in on full empl oyment, and edging closer to the 2 percent \ninflation target, the Federal Reserve’s dual manda te – stable prices a nd maximum sustainable \nemployment – is likely to be achieved relativ ely soon.  But, considering the aforementioned \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, August 31, 2016 at 3:15 A.M.U.S. Eastern Time and 3:15 P.M.in Beijing, Chi na, OR UPON DELIVERY * \n \n \n \n3 \n challenges in the global economy, important questi ons confront monetary policymakers in the \nUnited States.  When and how quickly should the Fe d normalize interest rate s?  And what is the \n“normal” rate? \n Given the persistently weak economic growth  in the United States during the recovery \nfrom the Great Recession, it has been appropriate to be patient about normalizing rates.  The \nFOMC raised short-term rates by one-quarter of a percentage point last December and has yet to \nraise rates again this year.  I have often spoken about the appropriateness, and clear benefits, of a \npatient and gradual approach to increasing rates.  One benefit is that gradual tightening allows \nfurther progress in labor markets,  helping those who are still une mployed or temporarily out of \nthe labor force.  In turn, tighter  labor markets should help the infl ation rate return to the Federal \nReserve’s 2 percent inflation target, which is especially important as many countries around the \nworld are contending with low inflation rates, wh ich tends to depress our own inflation rate to \nsome extent.    \nBy slowly normalizing rates, we would hope to continue to support growth.  However, \nkeeping interest rates low for a long time is not without risks.  Today I will focus my remarks on \none of those risks.  \n Prolonged periods of very low rates pose chal lenges for some financial intermediaries \nand for households who derive significant income fr om savings.  Because of their crucial role in \nfacilitating economic activity, we must be attuned to the health of financial intermediaries.  \nMany financial intermediaries derive income from  spread lending – borrowing at low short-term \nrates and lending or investing at a higher return  over longer periods of time.  However, in an \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, August 31, 2016 at 3:15 A.M.U.S. Eastern Time and 3:15 P.M.in Beijing, Chi na, OR UPON DELIVERY * \n \n \n \n4 \n environment where both short and long rates are quite low, the profit margins of financial \nintermediaries can shrink.2   \nMeanwhile, households can also be challenged by low rates prevailing over long periods.  \nSaving sufficient funds for retirement, for example, is much more challenging if low-risk investments generate ve ry little return.   \nFirms and households faced with long peri ods of low returns may react by “reaching for \nyield” – that is, buying riskier assets than one would otherwise, in orde r to achieve a desired \nprofit or savings goal.  The challenge is that in  a pervasive low-rate environment, the returns on \nrisky assets are also reduced.  A key risk to an environment charac terized by reaching for yield is \nthat, should a large negative shock occur, fi rms and households would be exposed to greater \nlosses through their holdings of ri skier assets than they would be  if they were not reaching for \nyield.  To the extent that reaching for yield is more likely in a low interest rate environment, \npolicymakers may need to weigh this particular ri sk related to low rates against the benefits of \nsupporting the economy.\n3  \n Today in my remarks I would like to explore the potential risks of the rapid increase in \ncommercial real estate prices in the United Stat es.  As interest rates have remained low, \ncommercial real estate prices have risen; capitaliz ation or “cap” rates on real estate (representing \nthe ratio of net operating income pr oduced by a property to the price paid4) have fallen to historic \nlows; and foreign investment in U. S. commercial real estate has in creased.  This raises a possible \nconcern that investors may be engaged in ex cessive risk-tak ing.  Should the U.S. economy \nexperience a large negative shock, this could pos e a problem for the stability of the U.S. \neconomy.  Current cap rates the Un ited States indicate that a long period of very low interest \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, August 31, 2016 at 3:15 A.M.U.S. Eastern Time and 3:15 P.M.in Beijing, Chi na, OR UPON DELIVERY * \n \n \n \n5 \n rates can add to potential downside risks, and in my view this suggests that financial stability \nconcerns could be a considera tion in how long policymakers wa it before resuming the gradual \nremoval of monetary accommodation. \n \nCommercial Real Estate and Financial Stability \nLooking at the data, Figure 1  shows the percentage change in  real commercial real estate \nprices and real GDP in the U.S. over the past 30 years.  Over that pe riod, we have had three \nrecessions in the United States (shaded on the figure).  The most severe one – the Great \nRecession – was clearly exacerbated by declines in  real estate prices, both residential and \ncommercial.  Because these real estate assets were important collateral for loans, and because \nthere were also significant holding s of derivative financial instru ments tied to real estate, many \nfinancial institutions experienced large losses.  These real estate related losses within financial intermediaries led to credit av ailability problems for households and businesses th at contributed \nto the severity of the Great Recession. Weakened  banks may constrain lending to maintain their \ncapital ratios, significantly reducing access to  credit for all but the most credit-worthy \nborrowers.\n5 \nThe U.S. recession in the early 1990s also ha d a significant real es tate component.  Many \nof the initial problems in that recession be gan in the New England region, where large \ncommercial real estate exposures created problems for financial in stitutions.  As commercial real \nestate prices fell, we saw “fire sales” of commerci al real estate properties as financial institutions \nunwound their positions.  Eventually , the problems in commercial real estate extended to both \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, August 31, 2016 at 3:15 A.M.U.S. Eastern Time and 3:15 P.M.in Beijing, Chi na, OR UPON DELIVERY * \n \n \n \n6 \n coasts and the Southwest region of the U.S., and resulted in what then Federal Reserve Board \nChairman Alan Greenspan referred to as “headwinds” in monetary policy.6 \nIn contrast, the recession in 2001 did not ha ve a large impact on financial institutions, \nlargely because the financial upheaval centered on  equities, an asset against which financial \ninstitutions were not highly leveraged.  As a re sult, the financial sector  was not suffering large \nlosses and pulling back on lending, so credit availa bility was not particul arly constrained.  The \nrecession was relatively mild by historical sta ndards, and the recovery  proceeded relatively \nquickly.   \nThese differing experiences in U.S. economic downturns, as well as in other countries, \nshow us that it is critically impor tant to closely monitor and unde rstand the assets held in highly \nleveraged financial institutions. \n Figure 2  utilizes the Financial Acco unts of the United States to  show the di stribution of \nexposures to commercial real es tate among lenders.  Out of the $3.6 trillion in total commercial \nmortgages and multifamily residential mortgage s, about $1.9 trillion are held by the banking \nsystem.  Among asset classes held by leveraged in stitutions, commercial real estate is large – \nalthough it is not particularly concentr ated in larger institutions.   \nSuch exposures, by themselves, are unlikely to trigger financial stability problems.  But if \nthe economy weakens, a large decline in commercial real estate collateral values could lead to \npayment defaults, and la rge losses to banks.7  This would have downs tream effects on credit \navailability to firms and households, as menti oned a moment ago.  The precipitating conditions \nwould conform well to the classic determinants of  financial stability problems: collateral values \nfall, and payment stream s are interrupted.   \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, August 31, 2016 at 3:15 A.M.U.S. Eastern Time and 3:15 P.M.in Beijing, Chi na, OR UPON DELIVERY * \n \n \n \n7 \n In sum, commercial real estate problems can  increase the amplitude of distress during an \neconomic downturn.  And I would like to discuss toda y some data that highlight recent trends in \ncommercial real estate. \n  \nRecent Trends in Commercial Real Estate \n Several factors other than low interest ra tes have made commercial real estate an \nattractive asset class at this time.  Figure 3  shows the occupancy rate for apartments in the \nUnited States.  The dark green shading, which re flects at least 96 percen t occupancy, shows that \nmany regions of the country are now close to full occupancy.  This is particularly true on the two \ncoasts, around some of the larger c ities.  It is also quite striking that some of the areas severely \nimpacted by the decline in real estate prices during the Great Recession, such as Florida, now \nhave relatively high occupancy rate s – reflecting in part the movement  into rental units of former \nfinancially distressed homeowners. \n Given the high occupancy rates in many regions of the U.S., it is not surprising that rents \nhave been increasing, as shown in Figure 4 .  The dark green shading represents an annual \nincrease in rents of at least 6 percent.  Again, the two coasts  are among the areas experiencing \nhigh occupancy rates, and tend to ha ve rents increasing more rapidly. \n With high occupancy rates, rising rents, and very low interest rates on alternative assets, \nit is not surprising that commercial real estate prices have been on the rise.  Figure 5  shows that \nU.S. commercial real estate prices across the four property types have each experienced rapid \nappreciation in real terms, although only the apartment price index is above the 2007 peak.  \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, August 31, 2016 at 3:15 A.M.U.S. Eastern Time and 3:15 P.M.in Beijing, Chi na, OR UPON DELIVERY * \n \n \n \n8 \n Interestingly, retail commercial real estate prices  have continued to rise, despite some of the \nlong-run changes affecting that pr operty type such as the rise of online shopping.  Particularly \nstriking is how much multifamily property prices have risen.   \nIt is also worth noting that commercial real  estate properties exhi bited very significant \nprice declines duri ng the Great Recession.  Certainly much a ttention has been focused on the role \nplayed by residential real estate price declines, which were important fact ors contributing to the \nseverity of the recession.  But commercial prop erty price declines al so were significant. \n Figure 6  shows real commercial real  estate prices by region.  Among the five regions \nshown, the U.S. Northeast/Mid-Atlantic, Southwest, and West have seen the most rapid price increases in recent years – and incr eases that are considerably more  rapid than in other parts of \nthe country. \n Figure 7  shows that real multifamily property prices have been particularly robust in six \nmajor metro markets.\n8,9  In Greater Boston, where I live and work, there have been rapid \nincreases in multifamily prices; I am reminded of this when I pass by numerous construction \nsites each day to and from my office.  On top of  low interest rates and rapidly increasing rents, \nBoston in particular has a large number of universities and robust high tech industries that have \nbeen attractive to millennials and have helped boost the demand for apartments. \n Figure 8  shows the capitalization or cap rates10 for the various propert y types.  Given that \nincreases in the market prices of commercial pr operties have outpaced rent increases (and thus \nnet operating income), cap rates have been declin ing and are quite low by historical standards. \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, August 31, 2016 at 3:15 A.M.U.S. Eastern Time and 3:15 P.M.in Beijing, Chi na, OR UPON DELIVERY * \n \n \n \n9 \n  Figure 9  shows the cap rate for apartments and th e 10-year Treasury rate.  As the 10-year \nTreasury rate has fallen, along with  rates on sovereign debt in mu ch of the world, households and \nfirms have been turning to the rela tively high returns possible in real  estate.   This should not be \nsurprising; one of the ways that monetary policy works in a low-interest-rate environment is to \nencourage investors to move into  somewhat riskier asset class ca tegories, to stimulate economic \nactivity.  Of course, should macroeconomic condi tions change, there is a potential for large \nlosses to those who moved into riskie r assets, as previously discussed. \n Figure 10  shows the increase in foreign investment in U.S. commercial real estate.  The \nUnited States is not alone in bei ng in a low-interest-rate environmen t.  Japan and parts of Europe \nhave negative interest rates, and in some countri es the negative rates extend well out on the yield \ncurve.  With the relatively strong U.S. economy, fo reign investors have been  attracted to an asset \nclass that still provides a relativ ely high rate of return.  As the chart shows, there have been \nsignificant inflows of funds from both Europe and Asia. \n \nPotential Implications \n Having explored some of the relevant data , it is useful to thin k through the potential \nimplications.  In my view, comm ercial real estate is, by itself, unlikely to trigger financial \nstability problems.  But should prevailing econo mic conditions change in response to a large \nnegative economic shock, commercial real estate prices could dec line relatively quickly, leading \nto large losses at leveraged firms.  Because co mmercial real estate debt is widely held by \ndepository institutions, this could cause a contra ction of credit – similar to the credit crunch \nexperience in the United States  in the early 1990s.  While Figure 2  showed that the holding of \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, August 31, 2016 at 3:15 A.M.U.S. Eastern Time and 3:15 P.M.in Beijing, Chi na, OR UPON DELIVERY * \n \n \n \n10 \n commercial real estate loans is relatively disp ersed, it is an important asset class for most \nleveraged institutions. \n Figure 11  shows the percentage of commercial real estate loans outstanding held by \nbanks with commercial real estate loans in excess  of 350 percent of their risk-based capital, for \nbanks under $1 billion in assets, in  each U.S. state.  This incl udes owner-occupied as well as \nnon-owner-occupied property.   Owner-occupied comme rcial real estate is not used for purposes \nof the commercial real estate guidance in bank supervision, but can be an issue for the economy \nif falling real estate prices occur and make it difficult to roll over or expand credit.  In some of \nthe coastal states, a high percenta ge of commercial real estate loans made by banks with under \n$1 billion in assets are held in institutions that ha ve a commercial real estate to risk-based capital \nratio above 350 percent.   \nSo the concern I put forward today is the scenario where widespread declines in \ncommercial real estate prices co uld ripple through the financial se ctor and lead to a significant \ntightening of credit for many borrowers.  And give n that, I would pose the natural next question: \nif one agrees that there is building pressure in commercial re al estate, should it have any bearing \non the setting of monetary policy?  \n U.S. monetary policymakers should focus on achieving maximum employment consistent \nwith stable prices currently , of course, but also over time .  Very low interest rates may move the \neconomy closer to the central bank’s dual mandate goals more quickly than  would higher interest \nrates, but it is important to evaluate “at what cost.”   \nWhen the economy is far away from achievi ng the dual mandate goals , asset prices tend \nto be weak – providing an added rationale for accommodative policy.  However, when the \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, August 31, 2016 at 3:15 A.M.U.S. Eastern Time and 3:15 P.M.in Beijing, Chi na, OR UPON DELIVERY * \n \n \n \n11 \n economy is close to achieving the dual mandate – as the U.S. economy is now – very low rates \nmay cause the economy to attain and exceed sustai nable employment, risking greater imbalances \nthat could negatively impact the economy in the future.  And this may be an unfavorable trade-\noff. \n Figure 12  shows the U.S. unemployment rate for the past 10 years, along with the \nCongressional Budget Office estimate of full em ployment.  After the Great Recession, the \nunemployment rate was very high, a nd the potential negative effects of low interest rates on asset \nprices were quite low given the depressed mark et for most assets.  However, over time the \nunemployment rate has fallen, and is now within many estimates of full employment – and some \nasset prices, such as for commercial real estate, have risen quite dramatically.   \nShould the macroeconomic environment cha nge, one could envision a scenario where \ncommercial real estate prices could decline signif icantly if underlying rent s, occupancy rates, and \nmarket interest rates become less favorable.  The probability of such a reassessment is, of course, each market participant’s to judge, and I am not ma king a prediction of this outcome, to be sure.  \nBut I have emphasized that such a revaluation, in conjunction with an  economic downturn, could \nmake a recession worse than it would have been had policymakers normalized interest rates more \nrapidly.   \nIn other words, a somewhat faster move to  rate normalization may defer somewhat how \nquickly we achieve the dual mandate goals of full employment and pric e stability, but could \nreduce the risk of a larger diverg ence from the dual mandate in the next downturn.  This is one of \nthe challenges of monetary policymaking that requ ires empirical analysis, historical perspective, \nand judgment. \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, August 31, 2016 at 3:15 A.M.U.S. Eastern Time and 3:15 P.M.in Beijing, Chi na, OR UPON DELIVERY * \n \n \n \n12 \n Concluding Observations \n Low or even negative interest rates have  been the policy response of central banks \ngrappling with difficulties in reaching legislat ed mandates in many countries.  However, it is \nimportant that central banks thi nk about attainment of their manda tes not only at the current time, \nbut also through time.  Policymakers must weigh the benefi ts of low interest rates now against \nthe potential costs in the future of  possibly spurring financial instab ility that will ultimately have \ndownstream adverse effects on firms and households. \n In the United States, a potential collateral im pact of very low intere st rates has been rapid \nprice appreciation in the commercia l real estate sector.  While there are certainly fundamental \nfeatures that make commercial real estate an attractive asset class, I think it is fair to say that part \nof the attraction has been the low interest rate en vironment.  The financial stability concerns that \ncould arise from a low interest rate policy co ntinuing for an extended period of time should be \nconsidered in conjunction with how best to achieve the dual mandate goals, now and over time. \n Thank you. \n \n                                                            \n \n1 “The core PCE price index is defined as personal consumption expenditures (PCE) prices excluding food and \nenergy prices.

I would like to thank Peter Fo rman and the members of the South Shore \nChamber of Commerce for having me here today.  At the outset, let me note as I always do that \nthe views I express today are my own, not neces sarily those of my colleagues at the Federal \nReserve’s Board of Governors or on the Fe deral Open Market Committee (the FOMC). \nOver the past year the United States economy has remained fairly resilient despite the \neconomic “drag” emanating from overseas.  Gl obal concerns – including a more significant \nslowdown in China – caused some market volatility at the beginni ng of this year, and the United \nKingdom’s vote to leave the European Union ha s refocused attention on continued lethargic \n\n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, September 9, 2016 at 8:15 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY * \n \n3 \n growth in Europe.  In fact, the Internationa l Monetary Fund recently downgraded its growth \nforecast for the world economy.  The expansion in many developed countries has remained so \nweak that their central banks have put in place even more stimulative monetary policies.    \nDespite these headwinds from abroad, labor ma rkets in the U.S. continue to gradually \ntighten, and inflation is slowly re turning to the Federal Reserve’s 2 percent inflation target.  In \nfact, it is quite possible that we  will reach or even exceed full em ployment over the course of the \nnext year.   \nGiven how near the U.S. economy is to re aching the Federal Reserve’s dual mandate \nfrom Congress (stable prices and maximum sust ainable employment), it is reasonable to ask \nwhether the current degree of m onetary policy accommodation – hist orically low interest rates – \nremains necessary.  My personal view, based on data  that we have received  to date, is that a \nreasonable case can be made for continuing to pursue a gradual  normalization of monetary \npolicy. \n As usual, there are some conflicting signals  in the economic data that came out this \nsummer.  For example, payroll employment has been quite strong, averaging 232,000 net new \njobs per month over the past three months, a nd just over 200,000 per month over the past year.1  \nWhat’s more, that rate remains significantly higher  than long-run labor for ce growth.  Consistent \nwith the tightening in labor markets, measures of  wage and salary growth  have been increasing \nsomewhat, albeit from still relatively low levels.   \nIn contrast, real GDP growth for the first two quarters has been disappointing, averaging \naround only 1 percent, well below the pace the Fe deral Reserve’s policymakers were expecting \nwhen we first raised rates last December.2  However, I would observe that at least part of this \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, September 9, 2016 at 8:15 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY * \n \n4 \n weakness reflects temporary inventory adjustments th at are likely to be reversed in the second \nhalf of this year.  While final sales (real GDP net of inventorie s) expanded 1.8 percent a quarter \nso far this year, real GDP was much weaker, wh ich reflected a run-down of inventories.  The \ncombination of the relatively strong domestic demand and the re stocking of inventories should \nprovide a basis for growth to exceed 2 percent over  the next two quarters.  This will increase the \nrisk that the unemployment rate wi ll be pushed over time to a poi nt below most estimates of full \nemployment – an outcome that is like ly to prove unsustainable over time.  \n  \nOverview of Recent Data \n Figure 1  shows the real GDP growth that economi c forecasters participating in the Blue \nChip forecast were predicting for the first two quarters of 2016, as of the middle of December \n2015, and the actual results.  Clearly,  the first two quarters did not live up to the forecasts.  The \nBlue Chip forecasters were expecting growth in the first two quarters to be comfortably above 2 \npercent, but as I noted a mome nt ago, actual growth fell short of that.  The forecasts over-\npredicted the strength of growth in each of the first two quarters by more than 1 percentage point. \n Figure 2  shows real GDP and real final sales growth  in the first two quart ers of this year.  \nReal final sales give a better reading on the demand for goods and services in the U.S. because \nthey exclude inventory fluctuations, which can a ffect GDP in the short term.  The figure shows \nthat inventories were a drag on GDP in the first half of the y ear as a sizable portion of demand \nwas met by reducing inventories.  Second-quarter  real final sales growth was 2.4 percent, \nindicating that these inventory adjustments – rather than a weak underlying economy – explain \nmuch of the economy’s apparent softness. \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, September 9, 2016 at 8:15 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY * \n \n5 \n  Figure 3  provides real final sales to domestic purchasers, which removes the impact of \nboth net exports and inventories from the growth  in real GDP.  This represents the demand \ncoming from U.S. firms, government, and consumers. Over the past two years, real final sales to \ndomestic purchasers grew at a healthy 2.6 percent.  So the data  show that the domestic economy \nhas been performing quite well despite the effect s of a strong dollar and weak growth among our \ntrading partners.  I expect some continuing dr ag from foreign activit y, but underlying domestic \nstrength is likely to be sufficien t to engender continued improvement.  \n Figure 4  shows several forecasts for the third quar ter.  Clearly forecas ters are expecting \nthird quarter growth to notch an increase.  Bo th the August Blue Chip Forecast and the August \nSurvey of Professional Forecasters predict gr owth well above 2 percent – and the “nowcast” \nstatistical forecast by the Atlanta Federal Reserve Bank (GDPNow3) expects an even stronger \nthird quarter. \n \nOverview of Labor Market Data \n Payroll employment growth of late can be described as somewhat choppy, as depicted in \nFigure 5 .  We saw a very weak payroll employme nt report in May, followed by two fairly \nsignificant increases in payroll employment in th e June and July reports.  With last Friday’s \nreport for August payroll employment showing an increase of 151,000 jobs, average monthly \npayroll growth is 232,000 jobs over the past th ree months and 204,000 jobs over the past twelve \nmonths.  Either figure is well above the 80,000 to 100,000 jobs a month that monetary \npolicymakers estimate are needed just to keep the unemployment rate constant over time.   \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, September 9, 2016 at 8:15 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY * \n \n6 \n In sum, the data we have seen over the summ er continue to reflect a tightening of the \nU.S. labor market.  The national unemployment rate shown in Figure 6  is now 4.9 percent.  As \nthe chart shows, the unemployment rate has de clined steadily over the past four years.  \nPolicymakers’ views of the unemployment rate that will prevail in the long  run – indicated by the \ncentral tendency of FOMC part icipants shown in the chart shading – were 4.7 percent to 5 \npercent at the June FOMC  meeting.  So we are currently at or close to the estimates of full \nemployment held by FOMC participants.   \nLooking forward, most forecasters expect that labor markets will continue to tighten and \nthe unemployment rate will continue to fall.  The Blue Chip consensus forecast for the \nunemployment rate in the fourth quarter of this year is 4.7 percent (see Figure 7 ), which is the \nsame as my own forecast for the end of this  year, and is equal to  my estimate of full \nemployment.  The Blue Chip consensus forecast fo r the unemployment rate in the fourth quarter \nof 2017 is 4.5 percent, somewhat below the FOMC participants’ consensus view of the long-run \nunemployment rate.  The figure shows that by th e fourth quarter of 2017, the average of the 10 \nhighest unemployment rate forecasts among the roughl y 50 forecasters in the Blue Chip survey is \nstill below 5 percent. \nAs the labor market has tightened, we have seen modest evidence of  the upward pressure \non wages and salaries that would support inflatio n reaching the Federal Reserve’s 2 percent goal.  \nFigure 8  provides wages and salaries from the em ployment cost survey and average hourly \nearnings from the payroll employment survey.4  The series have been  gradually rising over the \npast two years, although they still remain at levels that are low by historical standards.  However, \nmodest increases in wages and salaries seem to  me consistent with tightness in labor markets \nbeginning to appear more st rongly in the wage data. \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, September 9, 2016 at 8:15 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY * \n \n7 \n Risks to the Outlook \nOne potential concern is that while our best  guess for the economy is consistent with \ncontinued improvement, the economy faces particul arly risky global conditions.  And this adds \nan element of risk to actions that would furt her normalize monetary policy.  Some observers \nargue that the fragile global econom ic situation could just ify an even more patient U.S. monetary \npolicy, simply on risk management grounds.   \nIn this debate I would offer the observation th at, while it is importa nt to acknowledge the \npresence of global risks, market indicator s have so far provided little evidence of outsized  risks.  \nFor example, Figure 9  shows the VIX market volatility index.5  While the index was elevated at \nthe beginning of the year in re sponse to concerns related to Ch ina and more recently in June \nreflecting concerns about the poten tial impact from the Brexit vote,  the current value of the index \nis near its low for the year.  Given the number of global events over the past nine months, the \nVIX highlights the resilience of the U.S. economy in the face of potential shocks from abroad. \nIf an elevated risk of a severe financial shoc k existed, one might expect it to be reflected \nin stock prices, particularly prices in those markets that might be most sensitive to global shocks.  However, Figure 10  shows that the S&P has more than reco vered from its sharp declines earlier \nin the year.  Similarly, emerging market stock pr ices have made very substantial improvements \nover the same period.  The same cannot be said of the Euro STOXX index, which has not recouped its losses of earlier in the year. This likely reflects the ongoing weakness in the Euro \narea.  The figure suggests that, with the exception  of Europe, the potential concern with fragile \nglobal economies does not seem to be strongly pr iced into financial assets, at least to date. \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, September 9, 2016 at 8:15 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY * \n \n8 \n However, not all the risk is on the downside.  It is important to note that an overheated \neconomy – one that significantly exceeds sustainable output and employment – would pose risks \nto maintaining full employment over tim e.  Here history is instructive – Figure 11  shows the \nunemployment rate and the effective federal funds rate for the past 50 years, along with recession \nshading.  The chart suggests that  monetary policy has not been a precise tool, capab le of gently \nguiding the economy back to full employment in periods when we have exceeded sustainable, full employment.  As shown, the federal funds rate  frequently peaks prior to a recession as the \neconomy threatens to overheat, with unemplo yment potentially dipping below its long-run \nsustainable rate.  The figure s uggests that the calibration of monetary policy during such a \ntightening cycle is difficult: The U.S. econom y often slows down more than is optimal, \nfrequently resulting in a recession.   \nThis historical pattern illust rates the difficulty of slowi ng the economy to a sustainable \nrate without going too far and causi ng a recession.  This problem could be compounded if delays \nin tightening earlier in the cycle lead to conditions that require mo re rapid increases in interest \nrates later in the cycle,  risking a more pronounced slowing in growth and rise in unemployment. \nA second risk of waiting too long to tighten is that some asset markets become too \nebullient.  Figure 12  shows that real commercial real estate  prices have risen quite rapidly over \nthe past five years, particularly for multifamily properties.  Because commercial real estate is \nwidely held in the portfolios of leveraged institutions, commercial real estate cycles can amplify the impact of economic downturns as financial institutions need to write down the value of loans and cut back on lending to main tain their capital ratios. \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, September 9, 2016 at 8:15 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY * \n \n9 \n In sum, the risks to the forecast are beco ming increasingly two-sided, in my view.  \nWeakness emanating from abroad poses short-te rm downside risks to the domestic U.S. \neconomy.  However, the U.S. economy has been rela tively resistant to shoc ks from abroad of \nlate, as evidenced recently by the aftermath of th e Brexit vote.  Yet as I have described today, \nthere are also longer-term ri sks from significantly overshooti ng the U.S. economy’s growth – \ngiven the bluntness of monetary po licy tools, and the possibility of  growing imbalances in some \nasset classes. \n \nConcluding Observations \nFor some time now, we at the Federal Reserv e have taken a very patient approach to \nmonetary policy normalization, re flecting the low-inflation envir onment and more recently the \nglobal shocks experienced over the past year.  However, with the current degree of monetary \npolicy accommodation, the U.S. economy continue s to grow fast enough to yield continued \nimprovement in labor markets.  That degree of  accommodation increases the chances of driving \nthe core inflation rate closer to the Federal Re serve’s 2 percent target, but it also increases the \nchances of overheating the economy.   \nSo if we want to ensure that we remain at full employment, gradual tightening is likely to \nbe appropriate.  A failure to continue on the path of gradual remova l of accommodation could \nshorten, rather than lengthen, th e duration of this recovery. \nThank you. \n \n \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, September 9, 2016 at 8:15 A.M.

U.S. Eastern Time, OR UPON DELIVERY *  \n \n \n \n \n2 \n We are looking forward to hear ing from our keynote speaker, Federal Reserve Chair  \nJanet Yellen , a little later today .  I would also like to welcome some of my fellow Fed \npolicymake rs who are joining us .  It is wonderful to have them here, as well as all of our \npresenters and discussants , and all of you who are attending.  \nAt a high  level , what are the  facts that make this recovery unusual?   First, d uring this \nrecovery, growth in real  GDP h as been quite subdued – with growth rates that are percentage \npoints slower than the historical average .  Second, despite the tepid  growth, t he unemployment \nrate has fallen quite a bit faster than many expected .  And finally, inflation has lingered \nstubbornly below the Federal Reserve’s inflation target of 2 percent.   \nUnderstanding why this recovery has been different is important  for monetary \npolicymakers .  Understanding the source s of the difference will shape expect ations  going \nforward,  views on how to calibrate policy, and perspective s on the extent to which  monetary and \nother macro policies can support a retur n to more normal levels of long -run growth.   \nQuestions abound.  Is a slow recovery the unavoidable consequence of a severe \nrecession ?  Or of a financial crisis?   What role is played by the changing demographics in the \nUnited States? Will what may  seem like  temporary a nomalies become the “new normal ” for the \neconomy or economic cycles ?  Answers to questions like these will help us understand whether \nfirms and households have changed behavior  in ways t hat are likely to be more permanent than \ntransitory , whether slow growth in productivity is transitory  or permanent , and whether recent \ntrends in personal  saving behavior a re likely to persist well into the future.  In view of recent \nglobal inflation trends, the answers to these questions also have bear ing on whether the global \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, October 14, 2016 at 8:30 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time, OR UPON DELIVERY *  \n \n \n \n \n3 \n economy will continue to face bouts of undesirably low – rather than high – inflation , \nchalleng ing policymakers  in novel ways .  \nAgain, t he answers to these questions not only impact our understanding of the economy \nduring this recovery , but may also have important consequences for setting policy well in to the \nfuture.  For example, w ill a persistent change to long -run growth and long -run real interest rates \nrequire that nontraditional monetary policy actions become part of the traditional “ tool kit ” of \ncentral banks ?  Has this recovery changed views around using monetary policy rather tha n fiscal \npolicy to address slow recoveries?  And does the experience of a persistently  slow re bound alter \nviews on how quickly to  address any emerging risks to the current recovery? \nThis morning , I am going to briefly touch on some of the “ puzzles ” that we have asked \nthe presenters to address at this conference – leaving the difficult job of answering the questions \nto our paper givers and discussants .  I will then briefly examine how some of these puzzles have \nimpacted financial markets and how we m ight interpret  financial market reactions to this \n“nonconformist ” recovery.  \nBefore I begin, l et me note that the views I will express are my own, not necessarily those \nof my colleagues at the Federal Reserve’s Board of Governors or on the Federal Open Market \nCommittee (FOMC).  \n \n \n \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, October 14, 2016 at 8:30 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time, OR UPON DELIVERY *  \n \n \n \n \n4 \n Economic Anomalies and the Current Recovery  \nFigure 1  displays the pace of the recover ies from the last three recessions.   This recovery \nhas been  notably weaker than the previous two.  G rowth has averaged just a little over 2 percent \nduring  the current  recovery .  The slope of the line is quite a bit flat ter, but relatively constant  – \nthat is, there has been no substantial surge in growth, as sometimes occurs at the beginning of \nrecoveries, but rather a decidedly  gradual recover y of GDP f rom a very deep recession.   \nDespite the only  gradual increase in real GDP, the unemployment rate has fallen faster \nthan in the previous two recoveries.  Given the slower growth, this  is somewhat surprising.  \nGiven the  unusually high unemployment rate coming out of the Great Recession, this more rapid \ndecline in unemployment was certainly  welcome –  but t he pairing of slower, sustained real GDP \ngrowth with a rapid decline in the unemployment rate is one of the clear puzzles of  the recov ery.  \nThe falling unemployment rate has also been accompanied by falling labor force participation , as \ndemographic aging of the U.S. workforce causes people to leave the labor force.  However , as \nFigure 2  shows, even within age cohorts there have been decl ines in participation rates during \nthe recovery, with declines in the labor force participation of both prime working age men and \nwomen.  These trends may have implications for how we might expect the economy to evolve , \ngoing forward.  \nAt least one of the r easons for relatively slow growth  has been the pattern of the saving \nrate.  As Figure 3 shows, t he earlier recoveries (the periods following the recession shading on \nthe chart) were accompanied by period s of secular decline in the personal  saving rate.  This \nallowed for somewhat stronger consumer spending , which serv ed as one of the foundations of \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, October 14, 2016 at 8:30 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time, OR UPON DELIVERY *  \n \n \n \n \n5 \n earlier recoveries.  At least to date, the decline in  the saving rate prior to the Great Recession has \nbeen followed by a higher saving rate, whi ch may suggest  different saving s behavior stemming \nfrom the experience of  the Great Recession.  Should this pattern persist, it has implications going \nforward  for consumption patterns and the economy more broadly.  \nCore inflation has also remained subdued during the recovery from the Great Recession , \nas shown in Figure 4.  However, core inflation was also below 2 percent after the 2001 \nrecession, but returned to a bit  above 2 percent once labor markets tightened.  In contrast, while \nunemployment is now quit e close to most economists’ estimates of the natural rate, the core PCE \ninflation rate has remained consistently below the Federal Reserve’s 2 percent target over most \nof the recovery period, and currently stands at 1.7 percent.  \nThe real federal funds rate in the current recovery also differs markedly from previous \nrecoveries, as shown in Figure 5.  Reflecting the depth of the Great Recession, the real federal \nfunds rate has been significantly lower , and consistently negative , in contrast to the two earlier \nrecoveries.  T he need for more monetary policy accommodation is not surprising, given the \nseverity of the recession.   What is surprising, however, is that even near full employment, the \nreal rate is still so much lower  than in the earlier r ecover ies.  By the fourth year of those two \nearlier recoveries, the real federal funds rate had  almost reached  2 percent  (following the 2001 \nrecession ) or had exceeded  2 percent  (following the 1991 recession ).   \nIn contrast, in the current recovery the real federal funds rate has not rebounded, \nremaining quite negative .  And as Figure 6 shows, now seven years into the recovery , the real \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, October 14, 2016 at 8:30 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time, OR UPON DELIVERY *  \n \n \n \n \n6 \n federal funds rate remains below the nadir of the earlier two recoveries , even  though the \neconomy has returned to near full employment . \n \nEconomic Anomalies and Asset P rices  \nThe very short -term real federal funds rate is not the only segment  of the yield curve that \nis unusually low , as shown in Figure 7.  The 10- year Treasury rate minus 10-year inflation \nexpectations ( from  the S urvey of P rofessional F orecasters ) remains unusually low, even late in \nthe recovery.  There are a number of possible reasons for this , including the Federal Reserve ’s \nholding s of a significant quantity of longer -duration Treasury bonds ; depressed long rates \nglobally , stemming from weak national economies inducing asset purchases by  their central \nbanks ; and concerns that central banks in many parts of the world may have difficulty achieving \ntheir inflation targets.   \nHowever, looking at Figure 8, it is noteworthy that in the seventh year of the  recovery, \nthe 10- year real U.S. Treasury yield  remains negative  – in other words, purchasers of 10- year \nTreasuries are willing to accept a return that does not even compensate them for the inflation \nexpected over the holding period.  Th is suggests a  lack of confidence in U.S. and global growth \nprospects, and in the abili ty of policy authorities to offset weak growth.  \nWith both the real federal funds rate and the longer -term Treasury rate unusually low, \none might also expect other asset prices to behave differently than in earlier recoveries.  Figure 9 \nshows the price to operating earnings ratio for the S&P 500 in the period covering the past three \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, October 14, 2016 at 8:30 A.M.

While the price to earnings ratio for stocks is elevated, it still remains well below \nlevels reached prior to 2001.   \n Figure 10 shows an index of price to rent for residential housing.

The recovery  from the 1991 recession saw declines in real commercial real estate \nprices at the beginning of the recovery ; even seven  years later , prices had not returned to their \nlevel  in the trough, in real terms.  Of course, c ommercial real estate had been a major c ause of \nthat recession, spurring significant bank failure s.  Unlike the 2001 recession, in which \ncommercial real estate suffered only collateral damage, it was many years before commercial \nreal estate prices stabilized after the 1991 recession.  Interestingly, the past two recoveries have \ncontained  relatively rapid appreciation in commercial real estate prices.  \nFigure 12  shows the overall capitalization rate for commercial real estate over the past \ntwo recessions and recoveries.  Cap rates now stand at historic lows. \nOverall, anomalies in this recovery are leaving an imprint on only some financial asset \nclasses.  Price to earnings ratios for stocks and price to rent for residential real estate are only somewhat elevated and are well below previous peaks in these series.  In contrast, 10- year \nTreasury rates and commercial real estate capitalization rates are unusually low  relative to the \npast.  Figure 1 3 shows that the duration of the Federal Reserve  System Open Market Account \n(SOMA)  holding s rose  as asset -purchase programs increased the holdings of longer -term \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, October 14, 2016 at 8:30 A.M.

More recently , there has been some decline in \nthe duration of the Federal Reserve’s portfolio as the previously  purchased , longer -term \nsecurities holdings  continue d to age.  However, if one were concerned about the historically low \n10-year Treasury and commercial real estate capitalization rates , perhaps because of potential \nfinancial stability concerns, the balance sheet compos ition could be adjusted to steepen the yield \ncurve.   \n \nConclu ding Observat ions \n This recovery has been full of surprises, most of which have not been good.  Hopefully , \nthe discussions that we have over the next two days will help us better understand these \nanomalies, and whether they are likely to have a more permanent impact on the economy.  They may also have implications for the pricing of financial assets as the policy normalization process  \nproceeds .   \nWhile one must always be cautio us about assum ing that current trends reflect something \ndifferent from historical experience, it is important to consider whether this time has  indeed  been  \ndifferent.  If it has , then the lessons from this recovery  – perhaps an understanding of a “new \nnormal” environment  – may very well impact how we should be thinking about monetary policy \ngoing forward.  \nThank you.",

Rosengren  \nPresident & Chief Executive Officer  \nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston  \n \n \nPortland Regional Chamber of Commerce  \n \n \nPortland, Maine  \nNovember 15, 2016  \n \n \n \n \nGood morning. I would like to thank the staff and members of the Portland Regional \nChamber of Commerce for having me here today  to share my views on the economy .  At the \noutset, let me note as I always do that the views I express today are my own, not necessarily \nthose of my colleagues at the Federal Reserve’s Board of Governors or on the Federal Open \nMarket Committee (the FOMC).  \n The U .S. economy has continue d to gradually improve.  Payroll employment growth of \n161,000 jobs  in October  and the unemployment rate at 4.9 percent are two indications that we are \nat or close to most economists ’ estimate s of “full employment ” in the econo my.  My own \nestimate of the level of unemployment associated with full employment is 4.7 percent  – only two \n\n\n*EMBARGOED UNTIL Tuesday, November 15, 2016, at  8:00 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time, or UPON DELIVERY*  \n2 \n tenths less than the current unemployment rate.  I t has been  my expect ation that if trends \ncontinue, the remaining gap w ould close next year.   \n I would add that there has also been continued improvement in the outlook for inflation , \nwhich ha s been below the Federal Reserve’s  2 percent target for much of the recovery .  While \nour 2 percent target involves total inflation, it is useful to also examine the “core” inflation \nmeasure that excludes volatile food and energy  for a gauge on underlying inflation trends .  Core \ninflation ( measured using the Personal Consumption Expenditures or PCE price index1) \nfluctuat ed between just 1.3 and 1.4 percent last year , but now stands at 1.7 percent.  Should \nrecent  exchange rate stabiliz ation  and higher oil prices  continue , I would  expect both total and \ncore PCE inflation to be at or near the Federal Reserve’s  2 percent target in 2017 .  \n With the economy close to full employment and inflation nearing the Fed’s target, it was \nnot surprising that the futures market ’s probability of a tightening in December  has been high – \nin the vicinity of 75 percent  – with some volatility around the election.   Absent significant \nnegative economic news over the next month, the market’s assessment of the likelihood of \ntightening in December seems plausible . \n In my view , the goal should be  to have a continued , sustained economic re covery .  To \nachieve that , we must consider  the risks  inherent in waiting too long to gradually remov e \nmonetary accommodation.  I would much prefer that tightening be gradual, and that \npolicymakers try to avoid  circumstances in which we need  to tighten more  quickly .  My concern \nis that more rapid tightening , were it necessary,  could  risk disrupting the recovery that is now \nattaining  both elements of the Federal Reserve’s  dual mandate  – full employment and an \ninflation  target consistent with price stability .     \n\n*EMBARGOED UNTIL Tuesday, November 15, 2016, at  8:00 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time, or UPON DELIVERY*  \n3 \n The Recent Outlook for Labor Markets  \n Now I would like to explore with you some of the subtleties and nuances I am seeing in \nlabor markets.  \nFigure 1  shows the recent movement of the unemployment rate.  The horizontal lines \ndefine  the central tendency2 of U.S. monetary policymakers’ expectations for the unemployment \nrate in the long run . Note that over the last year the unemployment rate has remained in the \nnarrow band defined by that range.  My own 4.7 percent estimate of full employment places me \nat the lower end of that range .  If we dip below 4.7 percent unemployment, we would be running \nthe economy somewhat hot , and probing for how low the unemployment rate c ould go consistent \nwith our inflation target.   \nLooking ahead to the end of 2017 , the blue dot represents the unemployment rate that I \nexpect at the end of next year  – 4.6 percent .  It is also the median unemployment rate expected \nby members of the FOMC , and is the Blue Chip Consensus  forecast .  The implication is that \nmany forecasters have been expect ing us to slightly overshoot the lower bound of the central \ntendency of full employment estimates by the end of next year.  \n Of course, the outlook for unemployment is in part tied to the outlook for r eal GDP \ngrowth next year.  The Survey of Professional F orecasters expects next year ’s growth to be \nhigher than this year and somewhat above 2 percent , as shown in Figure 2 .  My own estimate of \nthe sustainable  growth rate for the economy is a bout 1.75 percent, so th e growth  forecast above \nthat level implies  that we are likely to see some further tightening in labor markets.  \n Figure 3 shows the percent change from a year earlier for the labor force.  The labor \nforce is defined as the sum of those who are currently employed and those who are searching for \n\n*EMBARGOED UNTIL Tuesday, November 15, 2016, at  8:00 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time, or UPON DELIVERY*  \n4 \n employment ( that is, are unemployed ).  When employment grows faster than the labor force , the \nunemployment rate goes down  – which has been the pattern for most of this  economic  recovery.  \nHowever, over the past year the unemployment rate has remained stable, despite relatively robust \npayroll employment  growth .  This is in part explained by relatively strong growth in the labor \nforce over the past year.  \n Many of us  focus on the n et increase in employment  in the monthly report , which  of late \nhas average d 100,000 to 200,000 jobs per month.  But that net change is the product of a much \nlarger flow of workers into and out of employment and unemployment.   \nFor example , the labor force  will grow if people not in t he labor force – such as  students, \nretire es, or discouraged workers – decide to enter the labor force, actively seeking work .  Figure \n4 displays the number of people flowing from out of the labor force into employment, as a share \nof the labor force.  Over the recovery period, there has been a dramatic increase in this share  as \nthe figure shows, accounting for much of the growth in the lab or force over that period.  But \nmore recently there has been a leveling off of these flows, albeit at relatively high levels.   \n However, this dynamic does not account for the levelling off of the unemployment rate \nover the past year.  Figure 5 focuses on labor market transitions over the past two years, and \nshows that , more recently , the number of people flowing into employment after being out of the \nlabor force has leveled off.  Rather, the levelling off of the unemployment rate in the last year \nseems to reflect the recent decline in the number of people flowing in the opposite direction – \nthat is, fewer people are leaving employment to step out of the labor force.   \n A reason to expect that the growth in the labor force may not be as robust going forward \nis the continuing impact of the aging of the workforce.  Figure 6  shows the share of the labor \n\n*EMBARGOED UNTIL Tuesday, November 15, 2016, at  8:00 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time, or UPON DELIVERY*  \n5 \n force between the ages of 25 and 54, which  has been declining , while the share of th e labor force \nbetween ages 55 and 65 has been rising.  As more baby boomers reach retirement age, we should \nsee a continued increase in the number of workers shifting  from employed to retired and  thus out \nof the labor force.    \n Reflecting that ongoing demographic transition, Figure 7  shows that the labor force \nparticipation rate has been declining  for more than 15 years .  While the labor force participation \nrate leveled off recently, these demographic changes will almost surely c ontinue, and make it \nunlikely that the labor force will grow as quickly as recently experienced .  \n It is certainly good news that the labor force has grown more rapidly of late , and that \nworkers have been drawn from out of the labor force into employment .  But this trend is likely to \nbe limited going forward by the demographic changes  in the workforce.  As a result,  if the \neconomy  grow s even somewhat faster than potential, as  most forecasters are expecting, the \ncorresponding increase s in employment are likely to be accompanied by further declines in the \nunemployment rate.  Since the unemployment rate is already close to its full employment  level , \nfurther declines would increase the risk o f overshoot ing what is likely to be a  sustainable  \nunemployment rate  in the longer run .  That outcome cou ld lead at some point to the need for a \nmore rapid removal of monetary policy accommodation.  \n \nWages and Prices  \n As labor markets have tightened  recently , we have seen signs in many indicators that \nwages and prices are rising in  respon se.  Figure 8  shows that core PCE prices have been rising  – \n1.7 percent in the most recent  year-over-year reading, which is  just three tenths shy of  our 2 \n\n*EMBARGOED UNTIL Tuesday, November 15, 2016, at  8:00 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time, or UPON DELIVERY*  \n6 \n percent target  for total inflation .  The Boston Fed  forecast has us reaching 2 percent core PCE \ninflation next year, slightly above the estimates of the median Summary of Economic Projections  \n(SEP) forecast for core PCE . \n Figure 9  shows the average probabilities that  Surv ey of Professional Forecasters \nparticipant s assign to core PCE falling into each of 10 ranges in 2017 , as of the fourth quarter of \n2016.  The chart shows that on average, forecasters assign a significant probability ( 70 percent) \nto inflation falling in a range near 2 percent – between 1.5 percent and 2.4 percent.  \n Figure 10 shows the forecast for total PCE inflation.  Total PCE inflation is still being \nheld down by the impact of earlier declines in oil prices and the rising value of the dollar.  As \nthese effects have subsided, total PCE has been rising.  The Boston forecast is currently at 2 \npercent for the end of 2017 while the median SEP is slightly lower .  While total PCE could still \nbe impacted by shocks, Figure 1 1 shows that  since the beginning of 2016, the exchange rate has \nbeen roughly stable, while oil prices have ris en on balance. Thus the combined effects of these \ntwo factors should act to increase inflation relative to previous years.  \n There is also evidence that wage pressures are beginning to show up more convincingly \nin the data.  Figure 1 2 shows that average ho urly earnings have been gradually rising as labor \nmarkets have tightened.  Over the past year average hourly earnings have risen 2. 8 percent, \nbelow what we saw prior to the Great Recession but above the 2 percent growth we experienc ed \nearlier in the recove ry. \n In sum , inflation  appears at last to be trending toward the Federal Reserve’s  2 percent \ntarget  for total inflation .  The Boston Fed forecast expects both the total and core PCE inflation \nmeasures to hit 2  percent  over the next year.  Progress to date and the expectation of further \n\n*EMBARGOED UNTIL Tuesday, November 15, 2016, at  8:00 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time, or UPON DELIVERY*  \n7 \n progress likely explain , in part, why markets ha ve priced in a high probability of a rate hike in \nDecember . \n \nConclu ding Observations  \n At the September  FOMC meeting,  I voted to  increase interest rates , arguing that if we \nwaited too long to raise rates we could place at risk the sustainability of the recovery .  I was \nconcerned that waiting could risk the need to raise rates  faster and  more than desire d at some \npoint , and I felt that this was a risk that c ould be reduced by remov ing a bit of accommodation \nearlier.  At the FOMC meeting earlier this month, however, I felt that the changes in the FOMC \nstatement were well aligned with the notion (and the market perception ) of a high likelihood of \ntightening in December .  As a result, I did not dissent .   \nGoing forward, I will be attuned to assessing whether my forecast – continued progress \ntoward  achieving our inflation target and employment goals  – is on track.   \n Thank you.  \n \n                                                           \n \n1 The core PCE price index is defined as personal consumption expenditures (PCE) prices excluding food and \nenergy prices.

Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *  \n 1 \n \n \n \n \nRemarks at a Panel Discussion on \n“Monetary Policy Normalization: Graceful \nExit or Bumpy Ride?”  \n \n \nEric S.

At the AEA’s annual meetings since 2008, my sense is \nthat monetary policy discussions have not had the word “normal” in the title.  It is a \npleasure to be seeing the types of economic conditions where su ch a discussion is not just \ntheoretical – where the economy has improve d enough for the discussion to move from \nwhether  normalization will occur to when  normalization will occur. \n\n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL January 3, 2015 at 2:30 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *  \n 2As I begin, I would note as I always do that  the views I will express today are my \nown, not necessarily those of my colleagues at  the Federal Reserve’ s Board of Governors \nor the Federal Open Market Committee (the FOMC).  In the year just past, the monetary po licy environment has been quite stable – \nperhaps surprisingly st able, given the number of significan t monetary policy events that \ntranspired.  Over the past year, we have s een new leadership at the Fed, in both a new \nChair and Vice Chair.  The Committee wound down and ended its bond purchase program, and provided a revise d exit strategy.  The FOMC ha s also shifted the FOMC \nstatement from providing forward gui dance tied to labor market outcomes\n1 to a “patient” \npolicy that is not time dependent.2 \nThis  all occurred in the context of a falling unemployment rate, a below-target \ninflation rate, a rising stock market, and falling long-term interest rates.  As the second \npart of the title to this session suggests – “Graceful Exit or Bumpy Ride” – such good \nfortune cannot, of course, be automatically assumed for the coming year. \n Any change in policy, monetary or othe rwise, has the potential for unanticipated \neffects.  In assessing the poten tial consequences of a patie nt monetary policy response, \nfor example, some observers worry that such a policy entails significant risks of \novershooting full employment, overheating financial markets, or even causing \nundesirably high inflation.  I would note, howev er, that the last time the FOMC raised \nrates after a recession in June of 2004, the une mployment rate was at 5.6 percent, below \nour current 5.8 percent, and Personal Consumption Expenditure (PCE) inflation was at \n2.8 percent, well above its current reading of 1.2 percent.  Some worry that patience will \nmean deferring the first rate increase until well past the arrival of economic conditions \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL January 3, 2015 at 2:30 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *  \n 3that historically result in tightening, but I would point out that we have some way to go \nbefore reaching those conditions, and so ha ve not been unusually patient as yet.  \n While many market participants are understandably concerned about the exact \ntiming of a rate liftoff, it is important to recall that economic forecasts are imperfect and \npredictions of turning points are particularly  imprecise. While we w ould all like to know \nwhen the liftoff will occur, it is not possible to predict the relevant economic conditions \nwith enough precision to pinpoint the point in time at which a data-driven liftoff will be \nappropriate. Furthermore, while market par ticipants worry about whether liftoff will \noccur in April, June, or August, in fact most models imply that the macroeconomic \nimplications of such differences are quite sm all.  Indeed, such circumstances remind us \nthat monetary policy can be as much art as science.   \nAs such, there are a few key questions to  consider at this juncture:  Is the \neconomy clearly on a sustainable path to fu ll employment and the 2 percent inflation \ntarget?  Will that path be sustained as policy accommodation is removed?  Can we be \nquite confident that the risks to the forecast will not materialize a nd perhaps result in a \nneed to reverse policy, particularly consider ing the policy challeng es when short-term \nrates are bounded by zero?     \nAs I consider these questions for this cycl e, I believe the continued very low core \ninflation and wage growth nu mbers provide ample justificat ion for patience.  A patient \napproach to policy is prudent until we can mo re confidently expect that inflation will \nreturn to the Fed’s 2 percent target over th e next several years.  Such patience also \nprovides support to labor ma rkets, boosting the prospect s of the many Americans who \nwere adversely impacted by the financial cr isis, severe recessi on, and slow recovery. \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL January 3, 2015 at 2:30 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *  \n 4 Today I would like to discuss how I thi nk about a so-called “exit strategy” in the \ncontext of a patient monetary policy.  I w ill first compare current economic conditions to \nthe conditions prevalent at the time of the last two rate lif toffs following recessions.  I \nwill then discuss some of the differences that may make an exit from accommodative monetary policy more complicat ed this time compared with  the previous two economic \nrecoveries.  I will then disc uss the impact of previous liftoffs on economic and financial \nvariables and what that history may portend as  normalization becomes appropriate in the \nUnited States this time.   \nConsidering U.S. Economic Conditions at Tightening \nThe timing of the initial tightening of s hort-term interest ra tes after a recession \ndepends on several factors, including the posi tion of the economy relative to the Fed’s \nmandated goals of stable prices and maxi mum sustainable employment, the speed at \nwhich the economy is likely to reach these mandated goals, and the likelihood that the \nrecovery is sufficiently vigorous that removing accommodation will not undermine that progress.  Because of the complicated inter actions of these and other factors, and the \ndifficulty associated with economic forecasti ng, I would argue that previous liftoffs can \nprovide only an imperfect guide  to likely future actions – bu t do provide some indication \nof factors that shoul d be considered.   \n  Figure 1  shows the unemployment rate with vertical lines indicating February \n1994 and June 2004, the months when the first ra te increase occurred after the recessions \nof 1990-91 and 2001 respectively (shaded in gr ay).  The first rate increase in 2004 \noccurred when the unemployment rate was at 5.6 percent, a lower ra te than in 1994 and a \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL January 3, 2015 at 2:30 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *  \n 5little lower than the curren t 5.8 percent unemployment rate.  In both 1994 and 2004, the \nfirst interest rate increase occurred sometime after the unemployment rate had begun to \ndecline, and in both instances , the unemployment rate continued to decline after that \ninitial tightening, with the ons et of tightening having no perc eptible effect on the steady \nimprovement in labor markets. \nFigure 2  uses another indicator of  the strength of labor markets: the growth in \npayroll employment.  In 1994, the first tighten ing did not occur until payroll employment \ngrowth was reasonably sustainable, and the economy continued to create jobs as the \ntightening cycle began.  In 2004, payroll empl oyment growth was less entrenched and \nsubsequent employment growth also was le ss solid than in the 1994 tightening episode. \nFigure 3  shows the other element of the Fede ral Reserve’s dual mandate – stable \nprices – using the inflation rate as meas ured by the PCE price indices. While this \ncomparison across episodes is a bit more complicated, given the possibility that the \nFOMC implicitly used a somewhat higher infl ation target in previous years, the PCE \ninflation rate was above 2 percent at the time of  the previous two initia l rate increases.   \nOne compelling reason for patience is th e uncertainty surrounding how quickly \ninflation will return to the Fed’s 2 percent inflation target .  Developed economies around \nthe world have been experiencing inflation ra tes well below the targets set by their central \nbanks.  With current core PCE at 1.4 percent and total PCE at 1.2 percent, current \ninflation remains quite low – and recent data do not yet indicate a cl ear trend back to 2 \npercent.  Such low inflation, and the risk th at inflation expectations may decline, are \nreasons to allow labor markets to tighten fu rther, which should spur wage growth and \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL January 3, 2015 at 2:30 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *  \n 6increase the likelihood that infl ation will return to the 2 perc ent target within the next \nseveral years. \nFigure 4  highlights that the first tighteni ng in the previous two recoveries \ncoincided with relatively strong real GDP growth.  With third- quarter real GDP growth of \n5 percent (2.7 percent on a year-over-year basis) and the likeli hood of above-potential \nGDP growth in the fourth quarter, the economy appears to be growing at a pace that is \nlikely to foster continued impr ovement in labor markets.   \nFigure 5  contains a measure of compensation growth: the employment cost index.  \nGiven the improving economy, this index has be en growing more slowly than one might \nexpect, and also well below the experience at  the time of the two previous tightenings.  \nGiven modest increases in productivity a nd a 2 percent inflation target, we would \nnormally expect more rapid growth in compensation in a steadily improving labor market.  \nFigure 6  shows another important distinc tion between current conditions and \nconditions around the start of the two previous  interest rate increases.  The Federal \nReserve has substantially increa sed its balance sheet to help stimulate stronger growth in \nthe economy over the past six years.  My own assessment is that this is one reason why \nour economy is stronger and our in flation rate closer to target  than is the case for many \nother developed countries.  Nonetheless, the level of short-te rm interest rates understates  \nthe degree of accommodation the Fed has provided, given the much larger balance sheet.  As the normalization process progresses, the Federal Reserve will need to carefully balance how quickly to normalize short-term  rates versus how quickly to normalize its \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL January 3, 2015 at 2:30 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *  \n 7balance sheet – a problem not faced during th e two previous periods of monetary policy \ntightening. \nIn sum, three areas stand out as complica ting current discussions  of raising short-\nterm interest rates.  First, it is unusual that  inflation is still well below the Fed’s target, \nwith favorable supply shocks (for example, dramatic decl ines in oil prices) making \noverall inflation likely to be particularly depressed in the sh ort run.  Second, it is unusual \nfor compensation to be so subdued at a tim e when raising rates is under discussion.  \nFinally, it is unusual to have conducted nontraditional monetary policy that enlarged the \nFed’s balance sheet which will need to be normalized in conjunction with normalizing \nshort term rates. \n \nGlobal Complications \nThe global economy provides a potentia l challenge to policy normalization.  \nDuring most monetary policy normalizations, one sees a reasonably high correlation of \neconomic and financial variables across countri es.  However, in the coming year, it is \nfairly likely that there will be an unusual divergence, with some countries beginning the \nnormalization process while other industriali zed countries continue  easing domestic \npolicy.  \nOne of the key differences across countri es has been the divergence in the \ninflation experience, as shown in Figure 7.   While Japan has tended to experience a \nmuch lower inflation rate than most other developed economies, Europe and the United \nStates have had relatively similar moderate -inflation experiences, until recently.  While \nmost developed economies have been modes tly undershooting their inflation targets, \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL January 3, 2015 at 2:30 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *  \n 8Europe’s inflation rate has continued to decl ine, and has recently diverged significantly \nfrom its target, registering inflation below 0.5 percent.  At the same time, U.S. core \ninflation has been reasonably stable at 1.4 to 1.5 percent, and the small effects of an \nappreciating exchange rate and falling oil prices should keep overall inflation quite \nmodest over the near term.  In part, this provides the opportunity fo r a patient monetary \npolicy, at least until wage and price pressu res are sufficient to ensure reaching our \ninflation target.   \nWhile many developed economies are in a similar position with respect to \ninflation, the likely trajectorie s for inflation may result in  quite different monetary \npolicies, at least initially.  Countries worried that disinflati on could lead to deflation are \nlikely to continue stimulating their economies,  while countries more  confident that low \ninflation is temporary (and will soon return to  their inflation target) will likely follow less \naccommodative policy.  This may result in a more divergent period of global monetary \npolicy than we usually experience du ring monetary policy normalization. \n As Figure 8  shows, short-term rates most in fluenced by monetary policy have \ngenerally tended to move together among devel oped countries.  With short-term interest \nrates moving together, there is less incentive fo r short-term funds to surge across national \nborders seeking higher returns.  However, with some countries tightening while other \ncountries are continuing to ease, exchange  rate and asset price dynamics may become \nmore complicated, creating yield differenti als that might spur cross-border asset \nreallocation. \n  \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL January 3, 2015 at 2:30 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *  \n 9Potential Impact of First Tightening \nFigure 9  illustrates that the reaction of the 10- year U.S. Treasury rate to the first \ntightening depends on the context of the economy, and the expectations  surrounding the \nfirst tightening.  The first tightening in 1994 was not fully anticipated at the time and \nresulted in a fairly sharp in crease in long-term rates to a level noticeably above where \nthey ended up later in the normalization proce ss.  In contrast, the first tightening in 2004 \nappears to have been anticipated and thus di d not cause much reaction relative to the rates \nimmediately prior to the tightening or relative  to rates later in the normalization process. \nA complication with the pres ent cycle is the presence of unusually low long-term \nrates.  With inflation low, global rates low,  and large central bank balance sheets, we see \nlong-term rates are below their historical  average in many developed countries.  \nAssuming inflation does return to 2 percent in  the United States, a 10-year Treasury rate \nfluctuating around 2.25 percent is lower than on e should expect – unle ss investors expect \na negative real after-tax return  on average over the next 10 year s.  This implies that there \nwill need to be some upward adjustment in long-term rates during the normalization \nprocess.   \nWhile conventional wisdom is  that a cycle of tightening monetary policy is bad \nfor the stock market, Figure 10 shows  that has not been true during the past two \ntightening cycles.  In part, this is becaus e in those cases the tightening was initiated \nbecause the Fed assessed that there was suffi cient strength in the underlying economy to \njustify tightening. As it turned out, their assessment was about right, so the tighter \nmonetary policy did not derail the economy.  However, curren tly it is worth noting that \nthere already has been a significant improvement  in stock prices, and interest rates have \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL January 3, 2015 at 2:30 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *  \n 10been unusually low as a result of the de pressed economic conditions following the \nfinancial crisis – so the pattern  of the previous tw o tightenings might not be repeated this \ntime. \nFigure 11 shows that stock market volatility di d not increase significantly in the \npast two periods of normalization.   As  measured by the Chicago Board Options \nExchange Market Volatility Index (VIX), both periods of moneta ry policy normalization \nhave been periods of relatively low volatilit y.  High volatility of st ock markets tends to \noccur during periods preceding or during re cessions rather than when the economy is \nstrengthening and monetary  policy rates are rising. \n \nConcluding Observations \nClearly, an unusual set of conditions prev ails as the Federal Reserve considers \nbeginning a move toward more normal rates.  Both short-term and long-term rates are \nunusually low, and remain below their historical  average in most count ries.  Large central \nbank balance sheets – here and in many devel oped countries –  and very low inflation \nrates in developed countries are important cont ributors to current low rates.  Also, unlike \nin some previous periods, some countries will be easing while ot hers will likely be \ntightening, causing more complicated exchange-r ate dynamics.  These are all factors that \ncomplicate the period of normalization.   \nThe low inflation rates experienced globa lly may also allow for a more gradual \nnormalization process than typically occurs. W ith so little wage and price pressure, and \nrelatively slow productivity growth, it is po ssible that rates may not normalize at the \nsame level they were prior to the financial crisis.  \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL January 3, 2015 at 2:30 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *  \n 11In sum, the complexity of monetary policy normalization is more pronounced \nthan in 1994 and 2004.  However, as I noted at  the outset of my rema rks, the fact that \ndiscussion of policy normalization is now appropriate is a welcome change from \ndiscussions of monetary polic y over the past six years.  \nThank you.  \n                                                 \n \n1 Note that the January 2014 FOMC statement still had the phrase, “that it likely will be appropriate to \nmaintain the current target range for the federal fund s rate well past the time that the unemployment rate \ndeclines below 6-1/2 percent” \n \n2 The statement, available at http://www.federalreserve.gov/newsev ents/press/monetary/20141217a.htm  \nnotes that “Based on its current assessment, the Comm ittee judges that it can be patient in beginning to \nnormalize the stance of monetary policy.”",

Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *  \n 1 \n \n \n \n \nRemarks at a Panel Discussion on \n“Monetary Policy Normalization: Graceful \nExit or Bumpy Ride?”  \n \n \nEric S. Rosengren \nPresident & Chief Executive Officer \nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston \n \n \nNational Association for Business Economics / \nAmerican Economic As sociation Meetings  \n \nBoston, Massachusetts  \nJanuary 3, 2015 \n \n \n \n \n \nI am happy to be participating on today’s panel, especially since the topic is \nmonetary policy normalization .  At the AEA’s annual meetings since 2008, my sense is \nthat monetary policy discussions have not had the word “normal” in the title.  It is a \npleasure to be seeing the types of economic conditions where su ch a discussion is not just \ntheoretical – where the economy has improve d enough for the discussion to move from \nwhether  normalization will occur to when  normalization will occur. \n\n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL January 3, 2015 at 2:30 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *  \n 2As I begin, I would note as I always do that  the views I will express today are my \nown, not necessarily those of my colleagues at  the Federal Reserve’ s Board of Governors \nor the Federal Open Market Committee (the FOMC).  In the year just past, the monetary po licy environment has been quite stable – \nperhaps surprisingly st able, given the number of significan t monetary policy events that \ntranspired.  Over the past year, we have s een new leadership at the Fed, in both a new \nChair and Vice Chair.  The Committee wound down and ended its bond purchase program, and provided a revise d exit strategy.  The FOMC ha s also shifted the FOMC \nstatement from providing forward gui dance tied to labor market outcomes\n1 to a “patient” \npolicy that is not time dependent.2 \nThis  all occurred in the context of a falling unemployment rate, a below-target \ninflation rate, a rising stock market, and falling long-term interest rates.  As the second \npart of the title to this session suggests – “Graceful Exit or Bumpy Ride” – such good \nfortune cannot, of course, be automatically assumed for the coming year. \n Any change in policy, monetary or othe rwise, has the potential for unanticipated \neffects.  In assessing the poten tial consequences of a patie nt monetary policy response, \nfor example, some observers worry that such a policy entails significant risks of \novershooting full employment, overheating financial markets, or even causing \nundesirably high inflation.  I would note, howev er, that the last time the FOMC raised \nrates after a recession in June of 2004, the une mployment rate was at 5.6 percent, below \nour current 5.8 percent, and Personal Consumption Expenditure (PCE) inflation was at \n2.8 percent, well above its current reading of 1.2 percent.  Some worry that patience will \nmean deferring the first rate increase until well past the arrival of economic conditions \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL January 3, 2015 at 2:30 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *  \n 3that historically result in tightening, but I would point out that we have some way to go \nbefore reaching those conditions, and so ha ve not been unusually patient as yet.  \n While many market participants are understandably concerned about the exact \ntiming of a rate liftoff, it is important to recall that economic forecasts are imperfect and \npredictions of turning points are particularly  imprecise. While we w ould all like to know \nwhen the liftoff will occur, it is not possible to predict the relevant economic conditions \nwith enough precision to pinpoint the point in time at which a data-driven liftoff will be \nappropriate. Furthermore, while market par ticipants worry about whether liftoff will \noccur in April, June, or August, in fact most models imply that the macroeconomic \nimplications of such differences are quite sm all.  Indeed, such circumstances remind us \nthat monetary policy can be as much art as science.   \nAs such, there are a few key questions to  consider at this juncture:  Is the \neconomy clearly on a sustainable path to fu ll employment and the 2 percent inflation \ntarget?  Will that path be sustained as policy accommodation is removed?  Can we be \nquite confident that the risks to the forecast will not materialize a nd perhaps result in a \nneed to reverse policy, particularly consider ing the policy challeng es when short-term \nrates are bounded by zero?     \nAs I consider these questions for this cycl e, I believe the continued very low core \ninflation and wage growth nu mbers provide ample justificat ion for patience.  A patient \napproach to policy is prudent until we can mo re confidently expect that inflation will \nreturn to the Fed’s 2 percent target over th e next several years.  Such patience also \nprovides support to labor ma rkets, boosting the prospect s of the many Americans who \nwere adversely impacted by the financial cr isis, severe recessi on, and slow recovery. \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL January 3, 2015 at 2:30 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *  \n 4 Today I would like to discuss how I thi nk about a so-called “exit strategy” in the \ncontext of a patient monetary policy.  I w ill first compare current economic conditions to \nthe conditions prevalent at the time of the last two rate lif toffs following recessions.  I \nwill then discuss some of the differences that may make an exit from accommodative monetary policy more complicat ed this time compared with  the previous two economic \nrecoveries.  I will then disc uss the impact of previous liftoffs on economic and financial \nvariables and what that history may portend as  normalization becomes appropriate in the \nUnited States this time.   \nConsidering U.S. Economic Conditions at Tightening \nThe timing of the initial tightening of s hort-term interest ra tes after a recession \ndepends on several factors, including the posi tion of the economy relative to the Fed’s \nmandated goals of stable prices and maxi mum sustainable employment, the speed at \nwhich the economy is likely to reach these mandated goals, and the likelihood that the \nrecovery is sufficiently vigorous that removing accommodation will not undermine that progress.  Because of the complicated inter actions of these and other factors, and the \ndifficulty associated with economic forecasti ng, I would argue that previous liftoffs can \nprovide only an imperfect guide  to likely future actions – bu t do provide some indication \nof factors that shoul d be considered.   \n  Figure 1  shows the unemployment rate with vertical lines indicating February \n1994 and June 2004, the months when the first ra te increase occurred after the recessions \nof 1990-91 and 2001 respectively (shaded in gr ay).  The first rate increase in 2004 \noccurred when the unemployment rate was at 5.6 percent, a lower ra te than in 1994 and a \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL January 3, 2015 at 2:30 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *  \n 5little lower than the curren t 5.8 percent unemployment rate.  In both 1994 and 2004, the \nfirst interest rate increase occurred sometime after the unemployment rate had begun to \ndecline, and in both instances , the unemployment rate continued to decline after that \ninitial tightening, with the ons et of tightening having no perc eptible effect on the steady \nimprovement in labor markets. \nFigure 2  uses another indicator of  the strength of labor markets: the growth in \npayroll employment.  In 1994, the first tighten ing did not occur until payroll employment \ngrowth was reasonably sustainable, and the economy continued to create jobs as the \ntightening cycle began.  In 2004, payroll empl oyment growth was less entrenched and \nsubsequent employment growth also was le ss solid than in the 1994 tightening episode. \nFigure 3  shows the other element of the Fede ral Reserve’s dual mandate – stable \nprices – using the inflation rate as meas ured by the PCE price indices. While this \ncomparison across episodes is a bit more complicated, given the possibility that the \nFOMC implicitly used a somewhat higher infl ation target in previous years, the PCE \ninflation rate was above 2 percent at the time of  the previous two initia l rate increases.   \nOne compelling reason for patience is th e uncertainty surrounding how quickly \ninflation will return to the Fed’s 2 percent inflation target .  Developed economies around \nthe world have been experiencing inflation ra tes well below the targets set by their central \nbanks.  With current core PCE at 1.4 percent and total PCE at 1.2 percent, current \ninflation remains quite low – and recent data do not yet indicate a cl ear trend back to 2 \npercent.  Such low inflation, and the risk th at inflation expectations may decline, are \nreasons to allow labor markets to tighten fu rther, which should spur wage growth and \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL January 3, 2015 at 2:30 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *  \n 6increase the likelihood that infl ation will return to the 2 perc ent target within the next \nseveral years. \nFigure 4  highlights that the first tighteni ng in the previous two recoveries \ncoincided with relatively strong real GDP growth.  With third- quarter real GDP growth of \n5 percent (2.7 percent on a year-over-year basis) and the likeli hood of above-potential \nGDP growth in the fourth quarter, the economy appears to be growing at a pace that is \nlikely to foster continued impr ovement in labor markets.   \nFigure 5  contains a measure of compensation growth: the employment cost index.  \nGiven the improving economy, this index has be en growing more slowly than one might \nexpect, and also well below the experience at  the time of the two previous tightenings.  \nGiven modest increases in productivity a nd a 2 percent inflation target, we would \nnormally expect more rapid growth in compensation in a steadily improving labor market.  \nFigure 6  shows another important distinc tion between current conditions and \nconditions around the start of the two previous  interest rate increases.  The Federal \nReserve has substantially increa sed its balance sheet to help stimulate stronger growth in \nthe economy over the past six years.  My own assessment is that this is one reason why \nour economy is stronger and our in flation rate closer to target  than is the case for many \nother developed countries.  Nonetheless, the level of short-te rm interest rates understates  \nthe degree of accommodation the Fed has provided, given the much larger balance sheet.  As the normalization process progresses, the Federal Reserve will need to carefully balance how quickly to normalize short-term  rates versus how quickly to normalize its \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL January 3, 2015 at 2:30 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *  \n 7balance sheet – a problem not faced during th e two previous periods of monetary policy \ntightening. \nIn sum, three areas stand out as complica ting current discussions  of raising short-\nterm interest rates.  First, it is unusual that  inflation is still well below the Fed’s target, \nwith favorable supply shocks (for example, dramatic decl ines in oil prices) making \noverall inflation likely to be particularly depressed in the sh ort run.  Second, it is unusual \nfor compensation to be so subdued at a tim e when raising rates is under discussion.  \nFinally, it is unusual to have conducted nontraditional monetary policy that enlarged the \nFed’s balance sheet which will need to be normalized in conjunction with normalizing \nshort term rates. \n \nGlobal Complications \nThe global economy provides a potentia l challenge to policy normalization.  \nDuring most monetary policy normalizations, one sees a reasonably high correlation of \neconomic and financial variables across countri es.  However, in the coming year, it is \nfairly likely that there will be an unusual divergence, with some countries beginning the \nnormalization process while other industriali zed countries continue  easing domestic \npolicy.  \nOne of the key differences across countri es has been the divergence in the \ninflation experience, as shown in Figure 7.   While Japan has tended to experience a \nmuch lower inflation rate than most other developed economies, Europe and the United \nStates have had relatively similar moderate -inflation experiences, until recently.  While \nmost developed economies have been modes tly undershooting their inflation targets, \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL January 3, 2015 at 2:30 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *  \n 8Europe’s inflation rate has continued to decl ine, and has recently diverged significantly \nfrom its target, registering inflation below 0.5 percent.  At the same time, U.S. core \ninflation has been reasonably stable at 1.4 to 1.5 percent, and the small effects of an \nappreciating exchange rate and falling oil prices should keep overall inflation quite \nmodest over the near term.  In part, this provides the opportunity fo r a patient monetary \npolicy, at least until wage and price pressu res are sufficient to ensure reaching our \ninflation target.   \nWhile many developed economies are in a similar position with respect to \ninflation, the likely trajectorie s for inflation may result in  quite different monetary \npolicies, at least initially.  Countries worried that disinflati on could lead to deflation are \nlikely to continue stimulating their economies,  while countries more  confident that low \ninflation is temporary (and will soon return to  their inflation target) will likely follow less \naccommodative policy.  This may result in a more divergent period of global monetary \npolicy than we usually experience du ring monetary policy normalization. \n As Figure 8  shows, short-term rates most in fluenced by monetary policy have \ngenerally tended to move together among devel oped countries.  With short-term interest \nrates moving together, there is less incentive fo r short-term funds to surge across national \nborders seeking higher returns.  However, with some countries tightening while other \ncountries are continuing to ease, exchange  rate and asset price dynamics may become \nmore complicated, creating yield differenti als that might spur cross-border asset \nreallocation. \n  \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL January 3, 2015 at 2:30 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *  \n 9Potential Impact of First Tightening \nFigure 9  illustrates that the reaction of the 10- year U.S. Treasury rate to the first \ntightening depends on the context of the economy, and the expectations  surrounding the \nfirst tightening.  The first tightening in 1994 was not fully anticipated at the time and \nresulted in a fairly sharp in crease in long-term rates to a level noticeably above where \nthey ended up later in the normalization proce ss.  In contrast, the first tightening in 2004 \nappears to have been anticipated and thus di d not cause much reaction relative to the rates \nimmediately prior to the tightening or relative  to rates later in the normalization process. \nA complication with the pres ent cycle is the presence of unusually low long-term \nrates.  With inflation low, global rates low,  and large central bank balance sheets, we see \nlong-term rates are below their historical  average in many developed countries.  \nAssuming inflation does return to 2 percent in  the United States, a 10-year Treasury rate \nfluctuating around 2.25 percent is lower than on e should expect – unle ss investors expect \na negative real after-tax return  on average over the next 10 year s.  This implies that there \nwill need to be some upward adjustment in long-term rates during the normalization \nprocess.   \nWhile conventional wisdom is  that a cycle of tightening monetary policy is bad \nfor the stock market, Figure 10 shows  that has not been true during the past two \ntightening cycles.  In part, this is becaus e in those cases the tightening was initiated \nbecause the Fed assessed that there was suffi cient strength in the underlying economy to \njustify tightening. As it turned out, their assessment was about right, so the tighter \nmonetary policy did not derail the economy.  However, curren tly it is worth noting that \nthere already has been a significant improvement  in stock prices, and interest rates have \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL January 3, 2015 at 2:30 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *  \n 10been unusually low as a result of the de pressed economic conditions following the \nfinancial crisis – so the pattern  of the previous tw o tightenings might not be repeated this \ntime. \nFigure 11 shows that stock market volatility di d not increase significantly in the \npast two periods of normalization.   As  measured by the Chicago Board Options \nExchange Market Volatility Index (VIX), both periods of moneta ry policy normalization \nhave been periods of relatively low volatilit y.  High volatility of st ock markets tends to \noccur during periods preceding or during re cessions rather than when the economy is \nstrengthening and monetary  policy rates are rising. \n \nConcluding Observations \nClearly, an unusual set of conditions prev ails as the Federal Reserve considers \nbeginning a move toward more normal rates.  Both short-term and long-term rates are \nunusually low, and remain below their historical  average in most count ries.  Large central \nbank balance sheets – here and in many devel oped countries –  and very low inflation \nrates in developed countries are important cont ributors to current low rates.  Also, unlike \nin some previous periods, some countries will be easing while ot hers will likely be \ntightening, causing more complicated exchange-r ate dynamics.  These are all factors that \ncomplicate the period of normalization.   \nThe low inflation rates experienced globa lly may also allow for a more gradual \nnormalization process than typically occurs. W ith so little wage and price pressure, and \nrelatively slow productivity growth, it is po ssible that rates may not normalize at the \nsame level they were prior to the financial crisis.  \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL January 3, 2015 at 2:30 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *  \n 11In sum, the complexity of monetary policy normalization is more pronounced \nthan in 1994 and 2004.  However, as I noted at  the outset of my rema rks, the fact that \ndiscussion of policy normalization is now appropriate is a welcome change from \ndiscussions of monetary polic y over the past six years.  \nThank you.  \n                                                 \n \n1 Note that the January 2014 FOMC statement still had the phrase, “that it likely will be appropriate to \nmaintain the current target range for the federal fund s rate well past the time that the unemployment rate \ndeclines below 6-1/2 percent” \n \n2 The statement, available at http://www.federalreserve.gov/newsev ents/press/monetary/20141217a.htm  \nnotes that “Based on its current assessment, the Comm ittee judges that it can be patient in beginning to \nnormalize the stance of monetary policy.”",

I would like to thank Jo sef Tosovsky, chairman of the Financial \nStability Institute of the Bank for Internationa l Settlements, for inviting me to speak at \nthis forum.  The Institute serves an importa nt role by increasing aw areness of financial \nstability issues and highlighti ng actions that can be taken to  address vulnerabilities.   \n\n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, January 30, 2015 at 2:45 A.M. U.S. Easter n Time and 9:45 A.M. in Cape Town, South Africa OR UPON DELIVE RY \n \n  \n 2Today I am pleased to speak with you about a very important topic – cyber \nsecurity for banks, payments systems, and central banks – and its implications for financial stability.  As I begin, I would note as I always do that the views I will express \ntoday are my own, not necessari ly those of my colleagues on  the Federal Reserve’s Board \nof Governors or the Federal Open Market Committee (the FOMC). \nAs we all know, innovations in computi ng and communications technologies are \nrapidly altering the landscape of payments.  And overseeing the safety, security, and \nefficiency of payment systems is a major re sponsibility of many central banks.  Indeed, I \nwould argue that for central banks, the transmission of mone tary policy, the provision of \nservices to financial intermediaries, and the supervision of the banking system are integrally linked.   \nHowever, payment systems are becoming less bank-centric and are changing \nmuch more quickly than their regulatory fr amework.  As payment systems quickly evolve \nwith new technologies, a potenti ally serious financial stabili ty concern is inherent in \ncyber security.  So, today I am going to descri be why I view cyber se curity as one of the \nmost serious financial stability concerns facing central banks, and why we need to \nbecome more directly involved.\n1 \n By way of example, consider the many payment choices available to a consumer \nwhen simply purchasing a shirt.  The consum er can go to the store and use cash, a debit \ncard, a credit card, a prepaid card, or even a mobile phone.  Alternatively, the shirt can be \npurchased on the Internet, the consumer paying with a credit card or signature debit card, \nPayPal, direct debit from a bank account, or alternatively using a mobile app such as \nApple Pay or Google Wallet.   \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, January 30, 2015 at 2:45 A.M. U.S. Easter n Time and 9:45 A.M. in Cape Town, South Africa OR UPON DELIVE RY \n \n  \n 3Each of these transaction options woul d involve combinations of different \npayment systems, intermediaries, and technologies.  Because these options ultimately ride on traditional banking and payment “rails,” consumers see little need to consider \nwhether the behind-the-scenes technol ogy, accounting, and bookkeeping functions are \ntruly available, safe, and secure.   Despite the advantages to consumers and businesses from rapid innovation in \npayments systems, cyber-security issues are beginning to intrude.  Cyber crime has \ndirectly affected millions of consumers.\n2  The value of stolen data has grown \nexponentially with the evolution of a very  sophisticated black market for personal \ninformation.3  All this highlights one of the ec onomic risks of moving to electronic \npayments – a wide (and growing) variety of en try points for those look ing to steal, divert, \nor disrupt payments.   \nWhen financial gain is the primary mo tivation behind the fraud, there are three \noptions for containment.  First, prevent th e intruder from enteri ng the system.  Second, \nand often more importantly, prev ent the intruder’s ability to leave  the system with \nconfidential data.  Or third, de value the data so it is meani ngless to an intruder who gains \naccess to it.   \nNews media have reported thefts involv ing consumers’ credit card information.  \nTo date, these incidents have not resulted in  systemic shocks to the economy or to \npayments networks.  Still, should breaches co ntinue, a lack of conf idence in traditional \npayments may lead people to less efficient options.  Likewise, while these events do not \nreally introduce systemic risk from a tota l-dollar-value perspectiv e, they nonetheless \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, January 30, 2015 at 2:45 A.M. U.S. Easter n Time and 9:45 A.M. in Cape Town, South Africa OR UPON DELIVE RY \n \n  \n 4contribute to the erosion of confidence in payment mechanisms and ultimately increase \noverall transaction costs. \nA more serious case would be an attack  on payment systems aimed at disrupting \ntransactions, for example by a rogue state or en tity.   Prevention is difficult because the \nattacker does not need to “enter”  the system to be disruptive,  and there is no need to exit \nwith confidential data – all th e attacker needs to do is fl ood the public-facing “front door” \nof a payments processor with enough traffic to make the system unavailable.\n4  However, \nthe bad actors are moving on to much more nefarious ways of penetrating processing \nassets.   \nPreventing disruption puts an emphasis on ensuring that resiliency, monitoring, \ndetection, and recovery capabilities are de signed into, and operational in, any payment \nsystem.  An attack on payment systems that  renders consumers and businesses unable to \ntransact business could be extremely disrupt ive and could possibly cripple an economy.  \nTo that end, the adoption of a national defe nse grade security level, rather than a \ncommercial grade security leve l, would mean a much more resilient – albeit expensive – \npayment system. \n Today I will briefly discuss how complex our payment system has become, and \nconsider susceptibility to cyber-related inte rruptions.  I will then discuss the financial \nstability concerns inherent in current arrang ements.  As an example, I will discuss the \npayment disruptions that occurred after the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001.  I will \nmention some steps that need to be take n, some specific actions being taken by the \nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston, and a recent report issued by the Federal Reserve. \n \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, January 30, 2015 at 2:45 A.M. U.S. Easter n Time and 9:45 A.M. in Cape Town, South Africa OR UPON DELIVE RY \n \n  \n 5I. Payments Systems \nThere are a variety of payment systems in the U.S., and the volume and dollar-\nvalue of the transactions th at flow through them is striking.  The 12 regional Federal \nReserve Banks collectively proces s over $4 trillion in payments every day .\n5  However, \nthe U.S. payments landscape encompasses much  more than those processed by the central \nbank.  In the realm of so-called “retail” paym ents, there are a variety of payment systems \nor networks that directly support credit and debit card payments as well as Automated \nClearinghouse (ACH) payments, and that indi rectly support intermediaries such as \nPayPal, Google Wallet, or Apple Pay.  Ther e are also payment systems devoted to \n“wholesale” funds transfers, including Fe dwire Funds transfers, Fedwire Securities \ntransactions, and the Clearing House In terbank Payments System or CHIPS.6,7  Other \nsystems focus on securities transfers and paym ents related to stocks, bonds, options, and \nderivatives.   \nIt is perhaps easiest to consider cyber crime in the context of a generic retail \npayment, as shown in Figure 1.   The consumer can choose from a variety of payment \nmethods and platforms8 to initiate a transaction.  The transaction information and \npayment method then enter the merchant’s computer system.  For a credit or debit \naccount payment, the merchant (or third-part y processor or “acquirer”) transmits the \naccount information to the issuing entity for au thorization.  The issuing entity approves \n(or rejects) the authorizati on back through the processor to  the merchant.  The payment \ninvolves the issuing entity or  its bank sending funds to the merchant’s bank, with \nsettlement on the books of the Fed.   \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, January 30, 2015 at 2:45 A.M. U.S. Easter n Time and 9:45 A.M. in Cape Town, South Africa OR UPON DELIVE RY \n \n  \n 6At each stage of the transaction, a differe nt party may have customer information \n– which, if stolen or destroyed, could impact ot her parties to the transaction.  At the point \nof initiation, the consumer could be tricke d into providing account information, or during \nprocessing any of the institutions could expos e the customer’s information to a third \nparty.\n9   \nFraudsters have typically targeted consumer payments, making them a critical \narea for focus – and one where large-scale h acking incidents have been well-publicized.  \nShould fraud become so widespread that cu stomers lose confidence in the safety of \npayment transactions, the entire payment landscape (both retail point-of-sale and e-\ncommerce) could be severely impacted and en tire transaction models could be imperiled. \nUnfortunately, the retail space is only  one area where cyber-security breaches \ncould impinge on payment systems.  Figure 2  shows the U.S. regulatory arrangements \ncovering payment, clearing and settlement systems.  As the figure illustrates, payment systems extend well beyond reta il payments to other areas also susceptible to cyber-\nsecurity problems.   \nArguably, the complicated payment structure\n10 is actually something of an \nadvantage in that the payment system is decen tralized.  Without a single point of failure, \nproblems in one area may not directly impinge on other areas – at least not immediately.\n11  But, with diffuse roles and respons ibilities in the payments landscape, \ninvolving both the private and public sectors – and with attackers looking for the weakest \nlink – a unified cyber-preven tion approach is difficult to implement.  The complex \nlandscape means a significant investment is re quired to protect the many potential points \nof failure.  Also, complexity makes it difficult  to react in a more coordinated fashion to \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, January 30, 2015 at 2:45 A.M. U.S. Easter n Time and 9:45 A.M. in Cape Town, South Africa OR UPON DELIVE RY \n \n  \n 7concerns. A particular worry relates to attack s where the purpose is not financial gain, but \nrather disruption of payment sy stems and economic activity.   \n \nII. Disruptions of Payment Systems \nThe attacks on September 11, 2001 had imp acts beyond the tragic loss of life and \nmassive destruction of property – including impacts on payment systems.  Because the \nWorld Trade Center was located near Wa ll Street, numerous payment systems were \naffected.  Insufficient resiliency became clear – for example, the New York Stock \nExchange halted trading for four days.  Th e flow of funds through the banking system \nwas also impacted.\n12  Some banks did not have suffici ent back-up systems and could not \nreceive incoming funds.  This resulted in some banks having a surplus, while others \nfound themselves short of funds or reserves.    \nFigure 3  shows the dramatic increase in th e volume of federal funds (Fed Funds) \nand Discount Window loans that occurred as bank s tried to reallocate funds or reserves \naround the payment system during that period.  Work by McAndrews and Potter13 on the \nliquidity effects of the events of Septembe r 11 documents that both the value and volume \nof Fedwire activity declined by well over 20 percent, as some banks had difficulty \ncommunicating with customers and counterparties,  and some institutions lost the ability \nto track the flow of funds. \nWithin a week, most payment flows had b een restored.  Banks were able to re-\ncreate files and restor e lost infrastructure.  In addi tion, actions taken by the Federal \nReserve facilitated recovery – the Federal Reserve not only helped restore financial \ncommunications, but also waived overdraft f ees, actively encouraged  borrowing from the \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, January 30, 2015 at 2:45 A.M. U.S. Easter n Time and 9:45 A.M. in Cape Town, South Africa OR UPON DELIVE RY \n \n  \n 8Discount Window, and conducted open market ope rations to increase reserves in the \nbanking system.   \nIn reaction to the disruption, significant  longer-run actions were taken.  The \nInteragency White Paper on Sound Practices to  Strengthen the Resilience of the U.S. \nFinancial System\n14 required fundamental changes to pr event a similar shock from having \na large impact in the future.  Payment syst ems and financial institutions made costly \nimprovements that dramatically improved the speed at which payments activities could \nbe restored.   \nWith September 11, the implications of physical damage became fully evident.  \nThe corrective activities focused on geographi c dispersion, and resi liency for a physical \nevent.  In contrast, a cyber-atta ck could have greater scale an d take an extended period of \ntime to play out prior to the full impact being known.  And adve rsaries are well funded, \nand have time to evaluate and plan.  We n eed to consider and protect against many and \nall types of attacks, whil e adversaries need just one vulnerability – and we must assume \nthey are always trying.   \nWhile the payment disruptions that follo wed the September 11 attacks were not \nrelated to cyber security, there are analogies and lessons that can be applied to a more \nproactive and coordinated approach.15  Underlying infrastructure s need to better ensure \nthat payment providers take sufficient prec autions to minimize the likelihood and impact \nof cyber attacks – whether commercially motiv ated or focused on disruption.  This will \nrequire a level of information-sharing a nd expectation-setting by national defense \nagencies, regulators, supervisors, and ope rators exceeding that of today’s very \nfragmented but dynamic payment systems.   \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, January 30, 2015 at 2:45 A.M. U.S. Easter n Time and 9:45 A.M. in Cape Town, South Africa OR UPON DELIVE RY \n \n  \n 9In the U.S., legislation aimed at impr oving the way information is shared among \nthe public and private sector has stalled due to privacy and other liability concerns.  \nHowever, the Obama administration has noted that cyber threats ar e “one of the most \nserious economic and national securi ty challenges we face as a nation”\n16 and is \npromoting legislation to require enhanced  threat information sharing among the two \nsectors. \n \nIII.  Addressing Cyber Security \nIn addition to addressing cyber security  with a more integrated and holistic \napproach among the large payment systems opera tors, there is work that central banks \nshould be considering on the lo cal and smaller-scale levels.  Figure 4  highlights some of \nthe significant cyber-security problems that have been experienced by major business entities as a result of their suppliers or sub-contractors being compromised.  Often, it \nseems, the initially-compromised organizations  tend to be smaller and less sophisticated, \nand may not have sufficient resources to prot ect against a hacker intent on using the \nweakest link to penetrate a computer system that reaches, and could impact, other entities \nand systems. \nIn the United States we have over 6, 000 banks, and many are small institutions \nwith modest information technology teams w ho often have job re sponsibilities beyond \ncyber-security.  These smaller financial inst itutions do not have regular access to national \nsecurity briefings and often rely on outside vendors or third-party processors, many of \nwhom may also be relatively small organizatio ns with limited cyber-security capabilities.  \nDespite their best efforts, such institutions  may provide determined intruders the least \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, January 30, 2015 at 2:45 A.M. U.S. Easter n Time and 9:45 A.M. in Cape Town, South Africa OR UPON DELIVE RY \n \n  \n 10technically advanced defenses and easiest entry points into payment systems.  So \nbolstering the awareness and defe nses of these sorts of smaller organizations should be a \npriority.   \nSharing actionable information about cyber attacks has the potential to \nsignificantly improve a firm’s preparedness.  Some larger institutions have committed to share cyber-threat information in a mo re real-time manner, or through industry \ncollaboration forums such as the Financ ial Services-Information Sharing Analysis \nCenter\n17.  Still, many government agencies and cy ber-security firms are reticent to share \ninformation and discuss problems because of potential legal liabilit ies, or reputational \nrisk concerns. \nIn 2014, the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston began a pilot program focused on \nthe sharing of cyber-threat information by, and among, small- to medium-sized banks.  \nThis pilot, for a specific segment of a single industry, was very successful.  We intend to \nexpand the program in 2015.  Importantly, the program is not part of our supervisory \noversight of banks, but instead is conducte d by Boston Fed cyber-security experts, who \ncan share information about emerging threats and mitigants.  All participants sign a non-\ndisclosure legal agreement that stipulates th at the information provided is shared for the \nsole purpose of allowing members to improve  their own cyber defenses, and cannot be \nused for any other purpose.18  While still in the early stages  of implementation, the initial \nresults are encouraging.  The experience to da te highlights that more peer sharing for \ngroups of smaller institutions has the potential to help thwa rt cyber criminals’ potential \nentry to the payment systems. \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, January 30, 2015 at 2:45 A.M. U.S. Easter n Time and 9:45 A.M. in Cape Town, South Africa OR UPON DELIVE RY \n \n  \n 11Similarly, the Boston Fed is a founding memb er of the Advanced Cyber Security \nCenter (ACSC), a nonprofit organization that brings together indus try, university, and \ngovernment organizations to address the most advanced cyber threats.  A key focus is \nsharing cyber threat information.  The Bost on Fed facilitates mont hly “Cyber Tuesdays” \nto enable discussion among security practitione rs on emerging issues and the state of the \ncyber threat environment. \nAnd earlier this week, the Federal Reserve System issued a paper on Strategies \nfor Improving the U.S. Payment System .\n19    A key strategy highlighted in the paper \ninvolves working “to reduce fraud risk and adva nce the safety, securi ty and resiliency of \nthe payment system.”  The paper notes the Federal Reserve belief that security is the foundation of any payment system, and our intent to work with a wide range of stakeholders to promote an environment wh ere end-to-end payments security preserves \nprivacy and integrity, commands high public confidence, and improves continuously in \nresponse to evolving threats.  The pape r has a somewhat different focus, but \ncomplements, what I’ve talked about today.\n 20    \n \nConcluding Observations \nCyber security is a serious financial stab ility concern.  The potential for loss of \ntrust in payment systems due to incursions or disruption is a key consideration.  Beyond \nintrusions with financial motiv ation, the increased ac tivity of rogue states  or entities in \nwhat is essentially cyber warfar e or cyber terrorism changes a nd elevates the nature of the \nprotections necessary.21   \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, January 30, 2015 at 2:45 A.M. U.S. Easter n Time and 9:45 A.M. in Cape Town, South Africa OR UPON DELIVE RY \n \n  \n 12In general, central banks need to focu s on how best to address this emerging \nconcern and play a proactive role in assuring the cyber resiliency of payment systems.  \nGiven privacy and secrecy concerns, open communication of threats and mitigants is often problematic.  And as I discussed t oday, the rapid technol ogical evolution of \npayment systems has resulted in a highly frag mented and diffuse regulatory framework.  \nThere are serious challenges and obstacles to comprehensive solutions.  Central banks are \nessential to this discussion and to the progr ess that needs to be made.  And given the \nimportance of a safe and available paymen t system to the functioning of a nation’s \neconomy, investment in core aspects of system s to ensure they are as secure and cyber \nresilient as possible must be a national priority.   \nOur efforts cannot focus solely on preventi ng incursions, because almost certainly \nsomeone will ultimately breach many cyber defe nses.  The focus should also be on rapid \ndetection, limiting damage, and rapid remediation of damaged resources. \nBecause the weakest link provides the grea test opportunity for intruders, focusing \nsolely on the largest players is unwise.  Wh ether a financial institution is located in \nNorthern Maine or near the tip of South Africa, cyber threats know no borders – and \nneither geography nor small size insulate inst itutions, and the payment systems that they \nare part of, from risk.  There are opportuni ties for central banks to play a more active \nleadership role in this area.   \nThank you. \n   \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, January 30, 2015 at 2:45 A.M.

For example, The Bank for International Settlements’ Committee \non Payments and Market Infrastruct ure has highlighted the need for more cyber readiness for financial \nmarket infrastructures, and the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (FFIEC) has a working \ngroup focused on raising regulator awareness and improving bank supervision of cyber risk – but \nactionable items are lacking and the Federal Reserve’s Financial Advisory Council has highlighted the need for more sharing of information.  \n \n2 Many consumers with credit or debit cards have experienced the downstream effects of cyber crime.  \nThese include the irritation and hassle of a card transaction being denied, or having cards frequently \nreplaced, or having one’s personal information or paym ent identity stolen, or seeing fraudulent transactions \nthat cause financial or reputational harm.    \n3 The hackers are no longer just using the information themselves, but selling it to criminal computer \nscientists and “quants” that correlate it with other stolen data to make it even more valuable. \n \n4 Many low cost or free automated tools for doing so are, unfortunately, available – even to unsophisticated \nattackers. \n \n5 A number equivalent to almost 25 percent of annual  U.S. GDP \n \n6 See http://www.newyorkfed.org/abou tthefed/fedpoint/fed36.html  \n \n7 An example of a wholesale payments problem was the system disruption of the Bank of England’s \nClearing House Automated Payments System (CHAPS) which went down for technical issues and resulted \nin the disruption of 2,450 home sales.  \n8 Such as a credit card, debit card, mobile phone, or computer. \n \n9 Javelin Strategy and Research estimates fraud lo sses from bank and credit card accounts was $16 billion \nlast year, up 45 percent from the previous year.  However, this probably underestimates the costs of \nforensic work, law enforcement activities, fraud monitoring, and additional system changes taken to avoid repetition of the problem. \n \n10 E.g., the complex operating struct ure, the multi-faceted regulatory en vironment, and diffuse governance. \n \n11 Although, as we witnessed in the financial cr isis with subprime mortgages and products like \ncollateralized debt obligations, systemic issues can deve lop across intermediaries based on indirect factors, \nsuch as a loss of confidence – as happ ened to Lehman Brothers and AIG.   \n \n12 While wholesale funding was most impacted, the in fluence on consumer confidence was important.  In \nsome areas, runs on ATMs occurred.  \n \n13 See http://www.ny.frb.org/re search/epr/02v08n2/0211mcan/0211mcan.html  \n \n14 See http://www.federalreserve.gov/boarddocs /press/bcreg/2003/20030408/default.htm  \n \n15 i.e., not waiting until a significant intrusion has wreaked havoc for one or more payment systems. \n \n16 See http://www.whitehouse.gov /the-press-office/2015/01/13/remarks-president-national-cybersecurity-\ncommunications-integration-cent  \n \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, January 30, 2015 at 2:45 A.M.

By the way,  we have found that in-p erson meetings are most \nproductive in this regard, rather than audio or video calls.  In-person meetings allow a trusted network to \ndevelop over time.  We have found that audio calls do  not work as well, because some participants are not \nentirely comfortable with who else might be listening in.    \n19 https://fedpaymentsimprovement.org/wp-content/upl oads/strategies-improving-us-payment-system.pdf  \n \n20 The paper notes that “protection against, prevention of, or elimination of cyber attacks, in general , is an \nimportant topic, but one that is beyond the scope of this desired outcome” [emphasis added].  The paper \ndoes however address cyber security as it relates to  payment transactions and payment systems.   \n \n21 Indeed, some data indicate a shift of cyber-related events away from financially motivated activity to \nactivity by rogue states, entities, or individuals looking to cause disruption of critical infrastructure, in order \nto advance a specific agenda.",

U.S. Eastern Time and 11:00 A.M. in Frankfurt, Germany OR UPON DELIVERY * \n   \n \n \n 2The expansion of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet ended with the completion \nof the tapering process last Oc tober, but we still are a l ong way from normalizing either \nshort-term interest rates or our balance sheet.   As a result, it may be some time before a \nfull assessment of the effects of our quantitat ive easing policies can be made, since a full \nevaluation will require a successful return to a normalized monetary policy.  Nonetheless, \nI think it is quite possible and appropriate at this point to consider which design features \nof the Federal Reserve’s asset-purchase progr am were effective, and which were less \nsuccessful, in achieving our monetary policy goals.   \nIn addition to considering the design feat ures, I will also consider the equally \nimportant communications st rategy.  Communications, ofte n referred to as forward \nguidance, are an increasingly important com ponent of monetary policy, especially when \nshort-term interest rates are at the zero lower bound. \n An important caveat here is that in stitutional, structural, and governance \ndifferences across the world’s central banks can make comparisons of policy actions (and \ntheir efficacy) quite difficult.  Perhaps the most important difference between the Fed in \nthe United States and most central banks in de veloped countries is th at Congress assigned \nthe Federal Reserve a “dual mandate” – the tw in goals of achieving maximum sustainable \nemployment as well as stable prices – ra ther than a single mandate related only to \ninflation.   \nHowever, another important difference invol ves the restrictions on securities that \nthe Fed can purchase for its open market account.  We are limited to securities that have \nthe full backing of the U.S. government, and thus have purchased government-guaranteed \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Thursday, February 5, 2015 at 5:00 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time and 11:00 A.M. in Frankfurt, Germany OR UPON DELIVERY * \n   \n \n \n 3mortgage-backed securities (MBS) and U.S. Treas ury securities.  Such restrictions vary \nsignificantly across the wo rld’s central banks.  \nReflecting on the financial crisis and its aftermath, I have become convinced that \nthe dual mandate is one reason why the U.S. Federal Reserve moved more aggressively \nthan many other central banks to address th e significant undershooti ng of inflation that \nwe saw in the U.S., and that many other count ries have experienced.  Given the imperfect \nunderstanding of inflation dynamics, even a string of quarters in which inflation \nsignificantly undershoots its target may be reasonably interpre ted as a temporary \nshortfall, since deviations of this magnitude  and persistence still lie well within the \naccuracy of current inflation forecasting mode ls.  However, the substantial increase in \nunemployment  throughout the developed world, in combination with the below-target \ninflation rates, indicates that significant output gaps do exist.   How aggressively a central \nbank reacts to this situation depends on whether that central bank’s mandated goals \ninvolve inflation alone, or as  in the U.S., a dual mandate that includes employment. \nHowever, I would argue that regardless of  mandate, delays by central banks in \nmoving to address the undershootin g on inflation can be costly – especially if such delays \nlead households and firms to expect  very low inflation rates.   \nIn the United States, the decline in infl ation during the recession afforded us more \nlatitude to aggressively focus on the employ ment side of our dual mandate.  Given the \npainful disruptions in labor markets that the U.S. experienced, this emphasis seemed \nappropriate, and does so with hi ndsight, and with all due cons ideration to the possibility \nof structural shifts in labor markets.  I felt it was important that the focus on weak labor \nmarkets, as well as the unde rshooting of inflation, together  provided important support \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Thursday, February 5, 2015 at 5:00 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time and 11:00 A.M. in Frankfurt, Germany OR UPON DELIVERY * \n   \n \n \n 4for U.S. monetary policymakers to decide to move aggressively during the financial \ncrisis, and indeed it s long aftermath.   \nOf course today, after significant labor market improvement, and with the horizon \nover which inflation will return to its target being uncertain, inflati on has taken on a more \nprominent role in our deliberations.  Currently, an obvious caveat in interpreting the low inflation rate in the U.S. is the \nsupporting role played by the recent decline in en ergy prices.  Oil shocks have been \nassociated with major changes in monetary po licy before.  The failure to control inflation \nin the United States during the 1970s, in th e presence of an adverse oil supply shock, \nhighlighted a serious dilemma facing monetary policy at that time.  Importantly in that \ncase, what might have been a temporary  pass-through of oil to non- oil prices turned into \na more lasting problem with overall inflation, as wage and price dynamics at that time \nhelped turn increases in oil pr ices into fairly protracted in creases in overall inflation.   \nFormer Federal Reserve Board Chairman Volc ker is rightfully recognized for taking \nforceful action to address the situation and ultimately tame inflation in the United States. \nCurrently, a concern is that  central banks are facing  the mirror image of the \nproblem in the 1970s.  The problem of significantly under shooting inflation – a dynamic \nwhich could well keep interest rates at the zero lower bound – is likely to be a key \nchallenge to central bankers in the first two decades of the 21\nst century.  And I would say \nthat as with the oil shock in the 1970s, th e current shock has served to accentuate a \npotential monetary policy pitfall – in this case, the failure to quickly and vigorously \naddress a significant undershooting of infla tion targets, potentially leaving economies \nstagnant at the zero lower bound. \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Thursday, February 5, 2015 at 5:00 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time and 11:00 A.M. in Frankfurt, Germany OR UPON DELIVERY * \n   \n \n \n 5 There are three observations I will ma ke today.  First, that a significant \nunder shooting of the inflation target should be treated with the same policy urgency as a \nsignificant overshooting of the inflation target.  Second, that open-ended  quantitative \neasing tied to policy goals is likely to be mu ch more effective than limited quantitative-\neasing programs.  Third, that clarity on m onetary policy communications is difficult to \nachieve, but critically important for the succe ss of the program.  I would add that this \nfinal point is as cr itical to how we normalize  policy as it is to how we initiate  quantitative \neasing policies.  \nThe Design of Large-Scale Asset Purchases in the United States \n While there were three separate large- scale asset purchase programs in the United \nStates, I will only briefly focus on the first one , since it was at least partly designed to \naddress dysfunctional markets during the height  of the financial crisis.  In addition to \naddressing the shortfall in macroeconomic goa ls, this program was focused on purchases \nof mortgage securities, and sought to relieve the weak demand for mortgage-backed \nsecurities when markets became quite illiquid and risked becoming much more so.  This \nprogram has generally been view ed as a successful way to st abilize markets, but isolating \nits effects is complicated because it occurr ed in the midst of the financial crisis. \nFigure 1  provides details of the large-sc ale asset purchase programs commonly \nreferred to as “QE1,” “QE2,” and “QE 3.”  QE1 was announced on November 25, 2008, \nwith purchases beginn ing shortly thereafter.\n1  Initial purchases were of agency debt and \nagency mortgage-backed securities (MBS), “to provide support to  the mortgage and \nhousing markets.”2  Additional agency debt and MBS purchases were announced in \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Thursday, February 5, 2015 at 5:00 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time and 11:00 A.M. in Frankfurt, Germany OR UPON DELIVERY * \n   \n \n \n 6March 2009, along with the purch ase of longer-term Treasury s ecurities, all to “provide \ngreater support to mortgage lending a nd housing markets” and “to help improve \nconditions in private credit markets.” 3  The program concluded in March 2010.  \nPurchases totaled $1.25 trillion in agency MB S, $175 billion in agency debt, and $300 \nbillion in longer-term Treasury securities. 4  \nQE2 began in November 2010, and ended in June 2011.  The program committed \nto purchase $600 billion of longer-term securities by the middle of 2011.5  Unlike QE1, it \nwas focused solely on purchasing long-term Tr easury securities, and did not include the \npurchase of mortgage securities – which had been  the focus of that first large-scale asset \npurchase program.  \nThe purchase program did not fully meet expectations in terms of achieving \nmonetary policy goals.  As a result, in Sept ember of 2011 – only th ree months after the \nend of QE2 – the Federal Reserve announ ced the Maturity Extension Program \n(commonly referred to as “Operation Twist”).   This program was designed to lengthen \nthe average maturity of the Fed’s Treasury securities portfolio, by purchasing long-term \nsecurities and selling an e qual amount of short-term securities.  The program removed \nduration from private holdings of Treasury securities, but did not increase the overall \namount of the securities portfolio held by the Federal Reserve.  The goal was to decrease \nthe longer-term rates that tend to affect the real economy; in  fact the FOMC statement at \nthe time highlighted that the program s hould “put downward pressure on longer-term \ninterest rates.” 6   \nThe initial program was a purchase of $400 billion in long-term Treasury \nsecurities, and clearly had the intended e ffect on long term rates.  The program was \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Thursday, February 5, 2015 at 5:00 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time and 11:00 A.M. in Frankfurt, Germany OR UPON DELIVERY * \n   \n \n \n 7extended in June 2012, at which point the program was limited by the lack of short-term \nsecurities to sell, a nd ended in December 2012.7  At the time this eliminated our holdings \nof T-bills and very short term notes.  The third quantitative easing program began in September 2012.\n8  The program \nbegan as a monthly purchase of $40 billion in  agency mortgage-backed securities, in \naddition to the Treasury securities that we re being purchased (o r swapped) under the \n“Twist” program.  Unlike QE2, QE3 was an open-ended program.  The continuation of \nthe program was tied to substant ial improvement in labor markets, consistent with price \nstability.  In this way the communication empha sized the need to achieve the policy goals \nrather than a given size of the program.  Communications also emphasized that the \nprogram would “put downward pressure on longer-term interest rates” and “support \nmortgage markets.”  When the Maturity Extension Program ended in December 2012 \nbecause of a lack of short-term Treasury securities remaining in the portfolio, the \nprogram was adjusted to the outright purchas e (rather than exchange or swap) of $45 \nbillion per month in longer-term Treasury secu rities, in addition to the purchase of $40 \nbillion per month in mort gage-backed securities.9  \n Figure 2  shows the growth of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet over this \nperiod.  QE2 expanded the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet by $600 b illion, to a little \nbelow $3 trillion.  Operation Twist did not influe nce the overall size of  the balance sheet.  \nQE3 significantly increased the balance shee t to the current size of approximately $4.5 \ntrillion.   \nFigure 3  shows the composition of the Fed’ s balance sheet.  It shows the \nprogression from QE2 – where the expansion pr imarily involved Treasury securities with \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Thursday, February 5, 2015 at 5:00 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time and 11:00 A.M. in Frankfurt, Germany OR UPON DELIVERY * \n   \n \n \n 8a 5 to 10 year maturity – to a balance sheet  with much larger holdings of mortgage-\nbacked securities, and Treasury securities  with more than 10 years to maturity. \n \nImpact of Programs \nA number of good event studies have atte mpted to evaluate the impact of the \npurchase programs in a narrow time window around the program-announcement dates.10  \nIn general, the studies find roughly a 20 to 25 basis point reducti on in long-term rates \nassociated with a purchase of $500 billion in long-term assets, although there is a high \ndegree of imprecision involved.    \nIn particular, with numerous Federal Reserve officials publicly discussing \npossible policy options, the timing of exactly when the market came to expect  a new \nprogram is hard to pinpoint.  It is very di fficult to isolate the extent of the “news” \ncontained in any announcement – news about  either the timing or magnitude of a \nprogram. \nFigure 4  shows 10-year Treasury yields around the time of announcements \nrelated to the three quantitative easin g programs.  QE1 was announced on November 25, \n2008, with the announcement reiterated in the FOMC statement on December 16, 2008.  Additional purchases were announced in th e FOMC statement released on March 18, \n2009.  The 10-year Treasury yield fell 24 ba sis points on the day of the November \nannouncement, and an additional 12 basis points on the following day.  On the day of the March announcement of additional purchases,  the 10-year Treasury rate fell 51 basis \npoints.   \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Thursday, February 5, 2015 at 5:00 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time and 11:00 A.M. in Frankfurt, Germany OR UPON DELIVERY * \n   \n \n \n 9Treasury yields, at much lower levels  by the November 3, 2010 announcement of \nQE2, fell by 14 basis points the day following the announcement, but drifted slightly \nupward over the next couple of weeks.   \nAs QE3 was contemplated, 10- year Treasury yields hovere d at historic lows well \nunder 2 percent.  (Because of the low levels, please note that the scale on the chart for \nQE3 is different than the scale for the QE1 and QE2 charts.)  QE3 was announced in the \nFOMC statement on September 13, 2012.  Howeve r, shortly prior to the announcement, \non August 31, 2102, Chairman Bernanke spoke at the annual Jackson Hole symposium \nhosted by the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City.11   \nOn the day of Bernanke’s speech, the 10- year Treasury yield declined by 6 basis \npoints.  However, on the day after the QE 3 announcement, the 10-year Treasury yield \nrose 13 basis points but then adopted a dow nward trend, falling ove r 20 basis points over \nthe next two weeks, easing th e initial jump.  Through the announcement of QE3, 10-year \nTreasury rates had fallen approximately 200 basis points, which was the immediate goal \nof the program.  While measuring the reduction in rates is  one way to capture the impact of the \nprogram, the real goal is to have a sign ificant impact on economic variables more \ngenerally.  QE1 was meant to stem the tid e of the deepening recession; the economy’s \nmomentum was highly contractionary and QE 1 was meant to moderate the resulting \ndecline in output.  On the other hand, the later two QEs were meant to stimulate the economy.  The FOMC statement announcing QE3 highlig hted the desire to support mortgage \nmarkets.  Figure 5  shows that there was no notable ch ange in housing starts during the \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Thursday, February 5, 2015 at 5:00 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time and 11:00 A.M. in Frankfurt, Germany OR UPON DELIVERY * \n   \n \n \n 10period of QE2.  However, housing starts did improve over the period of Operation Twist \nand QE3.  After averaging 569,000 units during QE2, starts averaged 708,000 units from \nearly on in Operation Twist through August 2012.  During the past 6 months, starts have \nimproved to averaging over 1 million units. \nFigure 6  shows the path of housing prices.  With housing prices declining, it was \nvery hard to see or generate momentum in the housing market.  Housing prices continued \nto decline during QE2, but began to rise some what steadily – albeit modestly – in late \n2011, with Operation Twist underway for several months.  Housing prices continued their \nupward trend during  QE3.    Figure 7  shows that QE2 did not generate much momentum in auto and light-\nweight truck sales, which did pick up during Operation Twist and QE3.  During QE2, \nauto and light truck sales were averagi ng 12.4 million units.  Midway through Operation \nTwist, and as QE3 began, auto sales had rise n to an average of nearly 15 million units, \nand over the past six months auto sales have averaged nearly 17 million units.  One of the transmission mechanisms is to alter asset prices other than interest rates.  Figure 8  illustrates that while there was not much momentum in stock prices from \nQE2, there was a substantial improvement ove r the period of Operation Twist and QE3. \nFigures 9 and 10  illustrate what happened to measures of the two goals \nembedded in the Fed’s dual mandate over th is period.  The unemployment rate fell \nappreciably over the period.  Core PCE inflation reached 2 percent during Operation Twist, but has generally been persistently below the 2 percent ta rget.  In part, the \npresence of full employment in the mandate, a nd the pain being felt in U.S. labor markets \n– coupled with core inflation below 2 percen t – provided plenty of support for aggressive \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Thursday, February 5, 2015 at 5:00 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time and 11:00 A.M. in Frankfurt, Germany OR UPON DELIVERY * \n   \n \n \n 11policy actions.  The FOMC statements noted the need for substantial improvement in \nlabor markets, and the statements relate d to QE3 eventually incorporated an \nunemployment threshold.   \nIn sum, in the absence of the dual mandate, some significant and I would say \nneeded policy actions may not have occurr ed – Operation Twist when core PCE was \nrelatively close to the 2 percen t target, and QE3 when core in flation trended at roughly 50 \nbasis points below 2 percent.  Had these polic y actions not occurred, it would in my view \nhave prevented what was ultimately important pre-emptive action against a persistent undershooting of the inflation target that could have become much worse, as in some other parts of the globe.   QE2 was limited in scope.  It had a fixed purchase amount and was not \ncommunicated in a manner tied to goals.  Mo reover, it was focused on Treasury securities \nrather than on areas with larger spreads, such  as mortgages.  And th ere is little evidence it \nhad the desired impact on rates or real variables.  In contrast, QE3 was limited only by the progress made against the goals.  The \npurchases were open-ended, and the communication was firmly tied to goals.  It included \nareas with larger spreads such as mortgage s.  And both financial variables and real \nvariables showed improvem ent with this program. \n In summary, program design, and communi cation, both matter.  A program that is \nopen-ended and focused on areas where spr eads are large – in conjunction with a \ncommunication strategy tied to goals – seems to  have made a material difference in \noutcomes.  While the transmission channels of  large-scale asset purchases are still not \ncompletely understood, it seems to me that the signaling and comm unication tied to a \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Thursday, February 5, 2015 at 5:00 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time and 11:00 A.M. in Frankfurt, Germany OR UPON DELIVERY * \n   \n \n \n 12large-scale asset purchase are an important chan nel – but one that unfortunately is hard to \naccurately quantify.  \n \nExit Strategies \n At this point no central bank has fully normalized its policy stance.  However, as \nmy discussion has highlighted, communication and actions around exit are likely to be as \nimportant as they were at initiation .  I am pleased that the United States has experienced \nmuch improved labor markets and inflation ra tes that, while below target, are higher – \nless close to dangerously low or negative rate s – than in some, if not many, developed \ncountries.  Nonetheless, policy should not be focu sed on progress from where we have been, \nbut should instead be focused on meeting the ul timate goals in a timely fashion.  At this \ntime, there is insufficient evidence that U.S. inflation is clearly trending toward the 2 \npercent goal.  While labor markets have continued to improve, the employment cost \nindex (ECI) overall, and the occupati onal breakdown of the ECI shown in Figure 11 , \nshow little evidence of trending to pre-crisis levels.   \nWhile disentangling the impact of positive energy shocks on prices will be \ndifficult, we know that the PCE core infl ation rate remains well below the Federal \nReserve’s 2 percent target.  Given how low to tal and core inflation have fallen in most \ndeveloped countries, a policy of patience in the United States continues to be appropriate.  \nThis is particularly true gi ven the inherent asymmetry that  we face at the zero lower \nbound – meaning, while we have all kinds of  room to respond to an unexpectedly \nfavorable shock, we remain quite limited in our ability to respond to negative shocks. \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Thursday, February 5, 2015 at 5:00 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time and 11:00 A.M. in Frankfurt, Germany OR UPON DELIVERY * \n   \n \n \n 13Concluding Observations \n My remarks have focused on the United States experience.  Given the different \nplaces central banks in developed countries are on policy at this time, it is likely \npremature to draw hard and fast conclusi ons for the global context.  Certainly the \nJapanese experience of raising the rate of inflation with a broad open-ended program tied \nto its policy goal is encouraging.  Simila rly, we will all learn from recently announced \nprograms being initiated in Europe.   \nThe relatively recent focus among central banks around the world on addressing \nthe problem of persistently low inflation rates is in my view very encouraging.  Just as \nhigh inflation in the 1970s was a pernici ous problem for central banks, the problems \ngenerated by low inflation and interest ra tes settling at the zero lower bound were \nunderestimated by professional economists and ce ntral bankers alike.  The broad focus on \nmeeting central bank mandates is important, a nd actions being taken to achieve inflation \ntargets should result in a more robust global economy.   \n Thank you.   \n \n                                                 \n \n1 The Federal Reserve’s press release announcing the ac tion on November 25, 2008 stated “This action is \nbeing taken to reduce the cost and increase the availab ility of credit for the purchase of houses, which in \nturn should support housing markets and foster improved conditions in financial markets more generally.” \nhttp://www.federalreserve.gov/newsev ents/press/monetary/20081125b.htm  \n \n2 See the statement from the Dece mber 16, 2008 FOMC meeting: \nhttp://www.federalreserve.gov/newsev ents/press/monetary/20081216b.htm  \n \n3 See the statement from the March 18, 2009 FOMC meeting: \nhttp://www.federalreserve.gov/newsev ents/press/monetary/20090318a.htm  \n \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Thursday, February 5, 2015 at 5:00 A.M.

Rosengren  \nPresident & Chief Executive Officer  \nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston  \n \n \nChatham House  \n \n \nLondon, England  \nApril 16, 2015  \n \n \n \n \n \nIt is a great pleasure to be here at Chatham House to discuss the economic \noutlook.  Because of the strong  economic ties across the Atlantic, it is important to \nmaintain a  good dialogue centering on the common  challenges we all face – and what \nthose challenges  imply for our respective monetary policies.  \nAs I begin, I would note as I always do that the views I will express today are my \nown, not necessarily those of my collea gues at the Federal Reserve’s Board of Governors \nor on the Federal Open Market Committee (the FOMC).  \n\n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL April 16, 2015 at 1:3 5 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time (6:3 5 P.M. Local Time  in London ) OR UPON DELIVERY  \n 2 In March, the FOMC’s  monetary policy statement1 provided two conditions for \nraising  short -term interest  rates in the United States.  First, the statement i ndicated that \nthe Committee needs to see “ further  improvement in the labor market. ”  Second,  the \nCommittee needs to be “reasonably confident that inflation will move back to its 2 \npercent objective over the medium term.”   \nTo the first condition, the recen t U.S. employment report was disappointing.  In \nMarch, the U.S. economy created only 126,000 net new jobs, and the unemployment rate \nwas unchanged at 5.5 percent.  To the second, core PCE inflation in the United States is \n1.4 percent2 with no clear indicat ion of when it will return to the Federal Reserve’s stated \ninflation target of 2 percent.   \nHence, a t this time, I do not think that either condition has been met.   Although \nthere has been noticeable improvement in the labor market over the past few years,  since \nMarch the indicators have been a bit mixed.  Furthermore , inflation remains stubbornly \nbelow our target of 2 percent.   \nWith sufficiently strong economic growth, improvements in labor markets and \nincreases in inflation would likely follow.  But first quarter real GDP growth in the U.S. \nappears to have slowed to well below the relatively disappointing fourth quarter growth \nof only 2.2 percent.  The unusually cold and snowy winter (which I can surely attest to, \nliving in the Boston area, which this year saw over 110 inches of snow) may have been a \ntemporary slowing factor.  Still, it remains difficult to separate the temporary and easy -\nto-explain from the lasting and more concerning – so in my view, incoming data would \nneed to improve to fully s atisfy the Committee’s two conditions for starting to raise rates.    \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL April 16, 2015 at 1:3 5 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time (6:3 5 P.M. Local Time  in London ) OR UPON DELIVERY  \n 3 Along with the two conditions described in the statement, the Committee also \npublished its latest forecasts.  Each q uarter, the FOMC provides information on the \nindividual forecasts of t he Federal Reserve Governors and Reserve Bank Presidents , \nbrought together in a Summary of Economic Projections (SEP) .3  Not surprisingly, many \nobservers tend, it seems,  to focus on the interest rate  projections from  each of the FOMC \nparticipants .  Yet , I would suggest that there is important additional information  in the \nSEP that tends not to receive  the same  emphasis.  \nToday I would like to focus on two aspect s of the recent Summary of Economic \nProjections – two aspects that probably deserved to attract mo re public discussion  than it \nseems they did .  The first matter is the  recent  striking reduction  in the estimates of the \nunemployment rate that FOMC participants expect to see in the long er run.  The second \nis the reduction in the  level of the  federal funds  rate that participants expect to see in the \nlonger run.  Both variables are important , obviously, to FOMC participants as we \ndetermin e both the  timing of the  first tightening of this monetary policy  cycle,  and how \nmuch and how quickly the Committee  should  continue to tighten  after the first increase .   \nI would add that i n addition to being relevant for current monetary policy \ndecision -making,  these measures are also relevant to the discussion of how best to utilize \nsimple monetary policy rules, a topic dis cussed by members of Congress and Chair \nYellen at recent Congressional hearings.  T hese two variables  – longer -run expectations \nfor unemployment and the federal funds rate – are normally assumed  to be  constant in \nsimple rules  such as those proposed by Professor John Taylor .4  But in practice, these key \nvariables , held constant by  simple rules of thumb , can change – and, according to FOMC \nparticipants ’ SEP submissions, have  changed significantly over the past t hree years .5  The \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL April 16, 2015 at 1:3 5 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time (6:3 5 P.M. Local Time  in London ) OR UPON DELIVERY  \n 4 variability of these two k ey estimates highlights just one of the many perils of using  \nsimple rules to constrain  monetary policymaking .6   \n \nThe Fed’s Dual Mandate  \nIn the United States, the central bank has a Congressionally assigned dual \nmandate to achieve maximum sustainable emplo yment and stable prices.  In practice, the \ndual mandate involves maintaining full employment and hitting the inflation target.   \nThese two goals are affirmed each year in the Statement on Longer -Run Goals \nand Monetary Policy Strategy.7  The inflation goal is quite explicit – a 2 percent \nannualized rate of inflation , as measured by the PCE price index.  Full employment, by \ncontrast, has a more ambiguous target.  As the statement on monetary goals says, “T he \nmaximum level of employment is largely determined by non-monetary factors that affect \nthe structure and dynamics of the labor market.  These factors may change over time and \nmay not be directly measurable. ”  \nIn practice, this means that the Committee has to make an assessment about the \nlevel of unemployment that would be consistent with a stable inflation rate in the longer \nrun – the level of unemployment below which competition for labor bids up wage \nincreases, leading to higher price inflation.  Views on the level of unemployment \nconsistent with full employ ment certainly differ among economists and policymakers – \nand with good reason, given the difficulties in estimating an unobservable quantity that \nnonetheless appears to have changed significantly over time.   \nFigure 1  shows how the Committee’s views on un employment in the longer run \nhave changed over the past three years.  The dark blue line provides the midpoint of the \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL April 16, 2015 at 1:3 5 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time (6:3 5 P.M. Local Time  in London ) OR UPON DELIVERY  \n 5 estimates of the participants at the policy meeting.  The shaded area provides the range of \nthe central tendency, which excludes the three  highest and three lowest estimates of the \nlonger -run unemployment rate.  Starting in June of 2012, the midpoint was 5.6 percent, \nwith a quite large range of 5.2 to 6.0 percent.  Had participants with estimates at the top \nof the range not subsequently chan ged their estimates of unemployment in the longer run, \nthe U.S. unemployment rate would currently be one -half percentage point below their \nestimates of full employment.  \nOver the past five quarters, the upper end of the central tendency declined \nsignificant ly.  As of the March FOMC meeting, the top of the range was 5.2 percent – \nand notably, 5.2 percent was the bottom  of the central tendency until recently.  In \naddition, the spread has narrowed significantly, with the central tendency now lying \nbetween 5.0 a nd 5.2 percent.  My own estimate of the longer -run unemployment rate is \n5.0 percent, at the bottom of the central tendency.  I, too, have changed my estimate over \nthe past three years – from 5.25 percent at the beginning of the period to 5.0 percent now.   \nA number of factors may be behind the lower estimates for the unemployment \nrate in both the medium and the longer run.   \nLooking first at the medium run, one possibility is that the standard \nunemployment rate usually quoted – the “U -3” measure – may not f ully capture the \ncurrent slack in the labor market.  As Figure 2  shows, the share of workers whose status \nis “part time for economic reasons” has declined over the recovery but still remains quite \nelevated by historical standards.  These are people who wou ld prefer full -time work, and \nare likely to continue to seek and find full -time employment as the economy improves.  \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL April 16, 2015 at 1:3 5 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time (6:3 5 P.M. Local Time  in London ) OR UPON DELIVERY  \n 6 However, since they are viewed as “employed” in the U -3 measure, they are not counted \nas part of the unemployment rate.  \nTurning to the lon ger run, a reason FOMC participants may have lowered their \nestimates of the longer -run unemployment rate is the absence of significant wage and \nprice pressures, despite the unemployment rate falling to 5.5 percent.  Figure 3  shows the \ncore PCE rate of infl ation.  The core rate of inflation has yet to return to 2 percent, and in \nfact has been below 2 percent for most of the period since the recession.  Figure 4 shows \nthat growth in wages and salaries has remained relatively subdued across occupations \nsince t he recession.  Wages and salaries are also well below the growth rate seen prior to \nthe recession.  The disaggregation by occupational groups also shows that broad \noccupational categories are not yet hitting significant bottlenecks.  The absence of wage \nand price pressure is consistent with some slack still remaining in the labor markets, even \nwith an unemployment rate that has fallen to 5.5 percent.  \nIt is also possible that demographics have been underappreciated and play some \nrole in the decline in the le vel of the unemployment rate consistent with negligible \ninflation pressure.  For example, Figure 5 shows the age distribution of the labor force at \n10-year intervals since 1994, indicating that the age distribution has shifted to somewhat \nolder workers on average.  Older workers generally experience lower unemployment \nrates than workers new to the labor force, so the unemployment rate that is consistent \nwith scant inflation pressure may have declined.  \nAlso, the skills of the labor force, as proxied  by educational attainment ( Figure \n6), have improved in the U nited States.  There are fewer workers who have not \ncompleted high school, and more workers with college or graduate degrees.  Skilled \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL April 16, 2015 at 1:3 5 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time (6:3 5 P.M. Local Time  in London ) OR UPON DELIVERY  \n 7 workers tend to have lower unemployment rates than less -skilled workers.  This might \nalso be a factor that was underappreciated and may help to explain why there are yet to \nbe significant wage or price pressures.  \nIn sum, the unemployment rate that is cons istent with full employment appears to \nhave declined.  Estimates of full employment can and do change, which is one reason the \nFOMC has not provided a numerical estimate for full employment.  And simple rules that \nassume the full employment level of unempl oyment is constant  could provide misleading \nguideposts for setting monetary policy.  \n \nDeterminants of Interest Rates  \nRecent Summaries of Economic Projections have also reflected substantial \nchanges in the level of the federal funds rate that FOMC participan ts expect in the longer \nrun.  Figure 7  shows that both the midpoint of participants’ estimates of the federal funds \nrate in the longer run and the range of the central tendency have moved down over the \npast three years.  Since the FOMC has not changed its inflation target, this would imply \nthat the real federal funds rate is expected to be lower in the longer run.8 \nFigure 8  shows that the reduction in estimates of the federal funds rate in the \nlonger run come at a time when prevailing long -term rates in mos t developed countries \nhave moved to unusually low levels.  I would suggest that seeing longer -term rates (these \n10-year government bond yields) well below the stated inflation target may indicate a \nlack of faith internationally in some central banks’ abili ty to achieve those inflation \ntargets on average over the 10 -year period – coupled with the likelihood of very low real \nrates over the next 10 years.  This could be evidence of a global savings glut, as \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL April 16, 2015 at 1:3 5 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time (6:3 5 P.M. Local Time  in London ) OR UPON DELIVERY  \n 8 suggested at one point by former Fed Chairman Ben Ber nanke;9 or it could reflect \ninadequate investment opportunities, as suggested by former Treasury Secretary , \nProfessor Larry Summers.10 \nAnother reason why real rates may have fallen is that households and firms may \nhave become more risk averse as a result of  the financial crisis, and increased their \nprecautionary savings.  Figure 9  shows that checkable deposits and currency for \nhouseholds are quite high by historical standards, as are holdings by nonfinancial \ncorporate businesses, shown in Figure 10.11   \nDecre ased productivity typically also leads to lower real interest rates , all other \nthings equal .  Figure 11 shows that, indeed, productivity has slowed recently to a pace \nmuch lower than experienced on average over the past two decades.  \nLower longer -run, or eq uilibrium, federal funds rates have several implications :   \n First, if the longer -run federal funds rate has declined, rates do not need to rise \nas much to return to “normalized” interest rates.  This is one reason that rate \nincreases might not need to foll ow as steep a path as in previous recoveries.   \n Second, lower longer -run federal funds rates imply that in the future , \npolicymakers will have less room to lower interest rates in the event of \neconomic weakness, and will thus be more likely to hit the zero lower bound \nfor interest rates.  The zero lower bound constraint on policy interest rates has \nbeen more than an academic concern of late, as most developed countries’ \ncentral banks have experienced difficulty in providing sufficient monetary \nstimulus to sp ur a robust recovery in their economies. This may imply that \ninflation targets have been set too low. After all, a higher inflation target \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL April 16, 2015 at 1:3 5 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time (6:3 5 P.M. Local Time  in London ) OR UPON DELIVERY  \n 9 would mean a higher longer -run policy rate, which brings with it a lower \nchance of hitting the zero lower bound.   \n Third, the longer -run federal funds rate is assumed to be constant in most \nsimple policy rules.  The fact that the real interest rate may change in both the \nintermediate and longer runs provides a further rationale for looking beyond \nsimple monetary rules.  \n \nConcluding Observations  \nFigure 12 compares the FOMC participants’ forecasts for the federal funds rate  \nexpected to prevail at the end of 2015 , from the December and the March SEPs.  The \n“dots” indicate that many participants lowered their expectations for the federal funds \nrate for the end of this year.  While this could be due to a weaker near -term outlook for \neconomic growth, it could also be consistent with participants revising their assessments \nof appropriate policy in light of declining estimates of b oth the full -employment level of \nunemployment and the longer -run federal funds rate.   \nToday I have provided two examples of variables that have changed quite \nnoticeably,  but which normally do not change in simple monetary policy rules.  This is an \nargumen t against the simple rules that several policymakers have proposed.   Simple \nmonetary rules cannot capture the full complexity involved in determining appropriate \nmonetary policy, especially during periods when economic relationships may be \nchanging.   \nAs such, rigidly following such rules would, in my view, be misguided.  Many of \nthese simple rules would have dictated a tighter policy for some time, even as \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL April 16, 2015 at 1:3 5 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time (6:3 5 P.M. Local Time  in London ) OR UPON DELIVERY  \n 10 employment has fallen short of full employment and inflation has run below our 2 \npercent goal, more than seven years since the start of the recession.  For me, there is \nwisdom in utilizing a more flexible and comprehensive set  of variables and models when \nconsidering appropriate monetary policy.  \n I would emphasize that despite their shortcomings, funds rate equations such as \nthose advocated by John Taylor do play a role in monetary policy formulation.  In the \nU.S., they serve as useful benchmarks, because they can often capture rough  contours of  \nthe historical regularities in central bank policy ov er specific periods.  And the fact that \nsome inputs to the model are difficult to estimate does not render them useless.  We face \nsimilar uncertainties in estimating all of the economic relationships that operate in our \ncomplex economies.  But it does high light that rules are likely best used as guidelines, \nalong with a host of other inputs – the most important of which are good judgment and \nhard-won experience.  \nThank you again for inviting me to Chatham House to share these perspectives on \nthe economy and monetary policy.   \n \n \n \n                                                 \n \n1 http://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/monetary/20150318a.htm  \n \n2As measured by the year -over-year percent change in the c ore PCE or Personal Consumption Expenditures \nPrice Index , excluding food and energy . \n \n3 Summary of Economic Projections, March 2015: \nhttp://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/fomcprojtabl20150318.pdf  \n \n4 See John B.

Friedman and Michael Woodford, eds., Handbook of Monetary Economics , vol. 3B (San Diego: \nElsevier), pp. 829 -59. \n \n5 FFt = r* + π t + 0.5(π t -2) – (ut – u*), where FF is the federal funds rate, r* is the estimated value of the \nequilib rium real rate, π is the  inflation rate , u is the unemployment rate and u* is the n atural rate of \nunemployment.  This example of a simple policy rule relates the federal funds rate to current inflation \nrelative to a 2 percent target and the unemployment rate relative to the natural rate of unemployment.  Such \nsimple monetary policy rules rely on significant assumptions, including that r* and u* are  fixed.   \n \n6 This is just one of the perils. For example these simple rules do not include a variable that captures large \nscale asset purchases, one of the major tools used by central banks in developed countries around the world \nin recent years.   Others include the rigidity of assigning fixed emphases (or weights) on inflation versus \nemployment, which may not be optimal in all circumstances. In addition, the notion that assumed or \nestimated historical response coefficients represent the best that monetary  policymakers can do in any \ncircumstances is a very strong assumption. Further, these simple rules do not capture financial stability \nissues, an area that has been receiving increasing attention since the financial crisis. There is also an issue \nwith the n onlinearity of the rules in general (ex. we do not raise rates when the unemployment rate falls \nfrom 10 to 9 percent).

It is a pleasure to be invited to address you today, and to take part \nin this event  honoring individuals and orga nizations that contribute  to the health of the \nregional  workforce . \nAs I begin, I would note as I always do that the views I will express today are my \nown, not necessarily those of my colleagues at the Federal Reserve’s Board of Governors \nor on the Federal Open Market Committee (the FOMC).  \n\n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL  June 1 , 201 5 at 9:00 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY  * \n 2 With the wonderful New England summer weather now upon us, it may seem \nunnecessary – and perhaps a bit cruel – to dredge up memories of the brutal winter we \nexperienced here in the Northeast.  However, economics has been called the dismal \nscience.   \nBut I have a substantive reason for pondering the winter we just endured.  \nBecause economic data emerge  with lags, recent disappointing numbers  have generated a \nspirited debate about whether the weak performance  can be explained by temporary \nfactors, such as the brutal weather  we experienced during the first quarter .  In many parts \nof New England , record snowfall prevented pe ople from getting to work, shoppers from \ngetting to stores, and customers from going out to eat.  So clearly, bad weather did deter \nsome economic activity.  \nHowever, the data w ere not just weak during the worst of winter ; they were  also \nweak before the stor ms and have  been weaker than expected ever since.  So economic \ngrowth for the first half of this year looks to be well below what was expected, even \ncorrecting for some temporary disruptions.  \nOf course, t his weaker growth has implications for monetary poli cy.  In the last \ntwo monetary policy statements issued by the FOMC, the Committee’s criteria for raising \nshort -term rates w ere twofold – first, further improvement in the labor market , and \nsecond, being reasonably confident that inflation will move back to  our 2 percent target .  \nSuch conditions are  likely to be met  in the near term only  if the economy grow s above \nthe rate economists refer to as its “ potential. ” Given the data that we have seen so far, \neconomic growth above potential seems unlikely  for the f irst half of this year . \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL  June 1 , 201 5 at 9:00 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY  * \n 3 Despite a disappointing first half , most forecasters expect a stronger second half \nof the year.  Among the factors supporting t his optimism are growth in personal income, \nthe positive impact of lower gas prices, and household net worth  that continues to grow .  \nHowever, so far  this improvement is only in the forecast , and not in the data.  The d ata \nhave disappointed before, and a n appropriately  data-dependent monetary policy requires \nconfirmation in the numbers , not just in forecast s of better times.       \nToday I w ould like to  provide  an overview of recent data, which  in my view  \ndemonstrate why the conditions for beginning the tightening of monetary policy have not \nyet been met.    \nThis view is heightened, I would argue, by global pol itical, security, and financial \nconditions that suggest the risks of a negative shock from abroad remain elevated, as has \nbeen the case over the last several years.  With short -term interest rates near zero , \nmonetary policy would have limited ability to of fset such a shock.  If we were fortunate \nenough to see the economy grow much more quickly, we would have the ability to raise \nrates more quickly.  But the near -term constraint on offsetting a shock amounts to an \n“asymmetric” situation that, in my view, nee ds to be taken into account in formulating an \nappropriate policy stance.  \n \nRecent Economic Growth  \nFigure 1  shows the private -sector forecasts for real GDP growth as of last \nNovember.  It provides the median forecast of quarterly real GDP growth in the Surve y \nof Professional Forecasters conducted by the Philadelphia Federal Reserve Bank, and the \naverage forecast of quarterly real GDP growth from the Blue Chip survey.  While there is \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL  June 1 , 201 5 at 9:00 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY  * \n 4 some overlap among the participants in the two surveys, both surveys forecast  relatively \nstrong real GDP growth from the fourth quarter of 2014 through 2015.   \nHowever, the figure shows that actual growth has been well below forecasted \ngrowth.  Real GDP in the fourth quarter of 2014 grew at 2.2 percent, and declined 0.7 \npercent in the first quarter of  2015.  My expectation is that second quarter growth is \nlikely to be only 2 percent.  Taken together , this means that over the past three qua rters, \nreal GDP growth has been disappointing. If such a pace of growth persists, it is unlikely \nto be associated with further significant declines in the unemployment rate.   \nFigure 2  shows the probability assessments for different real GDP growth rates \nfor 2015 submitted by forecasters participating in the Survey of Professional Forecasters \nin February and in May.  The distributions show forecasters were more confident about \nthe probability of stronger 2015 real GDP growth in 2015 in February than in May . Thus, \nbased on the weaker incoming economic data, a noticeable leftward shift in the \nprobability distribution occurred between February and May.   \nTogether, Figures 1 and 2 show that forecasts have tended to be too optimistic \nabout growth in 2015, and tha t their assessment of the likelihood of strong growth over \nthe year has declined significantly as the year has progressed.   \nFigure 3 shows that there was indeed unusual weather in many parts of the \ncountry in the first quarter.  In the East, the weather w as unusually cold.  This would \npresumably discourage shopping, housing starts, and other types of economic activity \nwhere adverse weather could deter outdoor activity.  However, the chart also shows that \nwhile the East had record cold, the West had record warmth.  Warmer than normal \nwinters in the West might not be much of a deterrent to economic activity in the short \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL  June 1 , 201 5 at 9:00 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY  * \n 5 term1 unless you were hoping to ski (although New England provided ample \nopportunities for that).   \nEven though most of the unusual weather o ccurred in February, the higher -\nfrequency economic data suggest slowness both before and after February.  While it is \ndifficult to assess the exact effect of weather on first -quarter data, if there was a \ntemporary deferral of economic activity due to bad w eather, one should expect a \nsnapback as the weather improves.  But there has not been much evidence of such a \nsnapback in the numbers.  \nFigure 4  provides the quarterly pattern of real GDP growth over the previous five \nyears.  The dotted lines pinpoint the g rowth rate that occurred in the first quarter of each \nof these years.  Some economists have questioned whether the normal seasonal \nadjustments are appropriately capturing seasonal variations in economic activity, since \nfirst-quarter growth has tended to be  lower than other quarters recently.  If inappropriate \nseasonal adjustment accounts for a significant portion of weak measured growth in the \nfirst quarter, this too would suggest a snapback in the subsequent quarter (and reasonable \ngrowth on average across  the two quarters).  But the data for the second quarter do not \nyet indicate much of a snapback, with many current -quarter forecasts of GDP close to 2 \npercent growth.  \nFigure 5  provides the growth rate of real GDP leading up to the first tightening of \nmonetary policy in previous cycles.  The table shows that in each of the previous \ntightening cycles, real GDP growth in the two years preceding the tightening was above 3 \npercent.  It should not be surprising that the first tightening of policy occurred during \nperiods of relatively strong growth. However, today we are faced with a growth rate of \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL  June 1 , 201 5 at 9:00 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY  * \n 6 2.3 percent over the past two years, and the strong possibility that growth in the first  half \nof this year will average much less than 2 percent.  In my view, such a pace of GDP \ngrowth does not meet some of the economic preconditions we look for when we begin a \ntightening cycle, even if one takes into account that potential GDP growth is now lower \nthan in previous cycles.  \n \nThe Role of Consumption  \nMost forecasters have expected relatively robust growth in consumption.   \nBecause consumption is such a large component of GDP, stronger growth in \nconsumption can offset weaker growth in many of the s maller components of GDP.   \nFigure 6  shows that seasonally adjusted consumption at the end of last year was quite \nstrong, while in the first quarter of this year it was disappointing.  If first -quarter \nweakness was really due to temporary factors, we would  expect a rebound in the second \nquarter as these factors waned. The weak retail sales numbers for April, however, signal \nthat we need to see more data before dismissing the slower first -quarter consumption as \nonly a result of temporary factors.  \n Figure 7  provides an estimate of retail sales based on a survey that breaks out \nresults by geographic region  of the country .  Given the weather map shown in Figure 3, \none might expect sharp variations across regions of the country.  However, the regional \npatterns ar e quite similar, making the weather a less plausible explanation for most of the \nweakness in the first quarter.  \n An alternative explanation – versus temporary factors such as severe weather \nimpacting recent data – could be simply that many consumers remain  reluctant to spend \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL  June 1 , 201 5 at 9:00 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY  * \n 7 despite the time that has passed since the Great Recession.  Figure 8  shows that the \npersonal saving rate has remained well above where it was prior to the Great Recession.2    \nIf consumer behavior is still being impacted by the experie nce of the financial \ncrisis, the Great Recession, and the painfully slow recovery, then it is possible that the \neconomy will not be as robust as many economic models would suggest, because the \nmodels do not take into account this behavioral change.  As Figure 9  illustrates, many of \nthe factors that drive consumption in most economic models have been increasingly \nfavorable.  The strength of these consumption fundamentals likely explains why many \nforecasters continue to expect reasonably strong consumption an d growth in the second \nhalf of this year.  \n \nAchieving the Fed’s Mandate  \n The Federal Reserve has a dual mandate from Congress that is focused on stable \nprices and maximum sustainable employment.  Let me now turn to inflation and \nemployment in more detail.  \nFigure 10 illustrates that neither the “total” nor the “core” measures of PCE \ninflation are yet showing much evidence of returning to the 2 percent inflation target that \nthe Fed considers ideal.  If the economy were growing quickly, there might be greater \nconfidence that the resulting tightening of labor markets would boost wages, and \nultimately prices, such that the 2 percent target level of inflation would be reached over \nthe next two years.  However, if growth remains slow, confidence in the likelihood of  \nachieving the 2 percent inflation target in the next two years would be diminished.  \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL  June 1 , 201 5 at 9:00 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY  * \n 8  Figure 11  shows longer -run forecasts of the unemployment rate from the \nSummary of Economic Projections made by Federal Reserve policymakers over the past \nyear, including the most recent as of the March FOMC meeting.3  At 5.4 percent, \nunemployment is currently below some FOMC participants’ estimate of “full” \nemployment.  However, in the absence of inflationary pressures, estimates of full \nemployment among many FOMC particip ants have been trending down.  At this point, \nthe median estimate of full employment among FOMC participants – as reflected in their \nlonger -run unemployment rate projections – is 5.05 percent.4  Still, a declining \nunemployment rate coupled with weak GDP gr owth could signal that the level of the \nunemployment rate consistent with full employment is drifting even lower.  \n Figure 12  provides the range and median of inflation forecasts for the next three \nyears as of the March FOMC meeting.  Many FOMC participants  forecast that inflation \nwill only gradually reach the 2 percent inflation target.  \nFigure 13 shows that at the March FOMC meeting, many participants viewed the \nmost likely path of the federal funds rate to be a tightening that is gradual by historical \nstandards.5   Obviously, the data coming in since that meeting may result in revisions to \nthat path after the June FOMC meeting.  \nAs the federal funds rate target is raised, it is likely to also be reflected in longer -\nterm rates, such as the 10 -year rate.  But  as Figure 14  shows, the historical relationship \nbetween the 10 -year Treasury rate and the effective federal funds rate has been quite \nvariable.  On average, the spread has been roughly 150 basis points.  But the figure \nhighlights that it is certainly poss ible that the spread between the funds rate and longer -\nterm rates could be much larger than it has been of late.  \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL  June 1 , 201 5 at 9:00 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY  * \n 9  \n \n \nConcluding Observations  \nIn summary and conclusion, the economy has been softer in the first half of this \nyear than many forecasters expected .  It is too soon to know whether this is driven \nprimarily by temporary factors like the severe winter, or is a reflection of broader \nchanges in the economy.   \nFor monetary policy to begin the normalization process, I believe we need to be  \nconfident that we will return to full employment and 2 percent inflation over the next \ncouple of years.   If the economy continues to grow at the same pace as we witnessed on \naverage in the current and the past two quarters, I do not expect to see timely \nimprovements in the unemployment rate and sufficient progress towards the 2 percent \ninflation target.   T his, in my view, makes a compelling argument for continued patience \nin monetary policy.  \n Thank you.     \n \n                                                 \n \n1 Obviously, warmer winters can have longer -run negative  impacts on economic activity , given that they \nmay exacerbate drought conditions.  \n \n2 Prior to the financial crisis , the saving rate may have been unusually low and has now perhaps returned to \na more normal level.  \n \n3 Economic Projections of Federal Reserve Board Members and Federal Reserve Bank Presidents, March \n2015: http://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/fomcprojtabl20150318.pdf  \n \n4 In Figure s 11 and 12 , what is referred to as the median is the midpoint of the median range reported in the \nminutes for the FOMC meeting s.

Thank you for the invitation to speak with you today.  I look \nforward to the exchange of views and analysis that are hallmarks of these gatherings.  \nAs I begin, I would note as I always do that the views I will express today are my \nown, not necessarily those of my colleagues at the Federal Reserve’s Board of Governors \nor on t he Federal Open Market Committee (the FOMC ). \n\n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL July 10, 2015 at 11:35 A.M. Eastern Time (9:35 A.M. Local Time in Victor, Idaho) OR UPON DELIVERY  * \n 2 As the U.S. economy approaches conditions that are consistent with beginning the \nprocess of normalizing monetary policy, it is not surprising that financial market \nparticipants would prefer simple and unqualified statements about the future path of \nmonetar y policy.  However, appropriate policy necessarily depends on our forecast of the \neconomy’s path in coming months, and that path is always somewhat uncertain.  Events \nthat are unfolding  of late  exemplify the difficulties often face d in making economic \nforecasts.  These events and uncertainties also reinforce the prudence of adhering to the \nnotion of “data dependence” in making monetary policy decisions.  \nOne significant area of uncertainty in the current forecast centers on inflation: \nwhy have we not yet see n inflation clearly returning to the 2 percent target?1  The Federal \nReserve policymakers’ forecasts in the June Summary of Economic Projections2 – the \n“SEP” – predict that core inflation will return to 2 percent, but that has been the case for \nearlier SEP forecasts as well and, as yet, the data on core inflation have remained \nsurprisingly weak, even as labor markets have improved.  In addition, recent international \nevents highlight that the future path of energy prices and the dollar remain quite \nuncertain.   \nA second area of uncertainty stems from events – often difficult to predict – \nwhich domestic monetary policy cannot influence.  The unfolding events in Greece \nprovide an obvious current example .  The emergence in recent weeks of questions abou t \nwhether Greece and its creditors can reach a viable a greement complicate s projections \nabout how economic conditions are likely to unfold over the course of the summer and \nbeyond.   \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL July 10, 2015 at 11:35 A.M. Eastern Time (9:35 A.M. Local Time in Victor, Idaho) OR UPON DELIVERY  * \n 3 To be clear, while these negative developments have been intensely painfu l for \nthe Greek people, to date it is not obvious that these events will significantly alter the \nexpected path of the U.S. economy.  But they have surely added to the uncertainty  \naround  that forecast.   I will offer my own perspective on that situation in a  few moments.  \nWere the U.S. economy to unfold as I and other policymakers expect ed in our \nJune SEP forecasts, beginning the policy normalization process later this year might be \nappropriate.  However, the assumption that our current forecasts for labor mar kets and for \ninflation will unfold as expected is still subject to considerable uncertainty, a topic to \nwhich I will now turn.  \n \nDomestic Uncertainty  \nThe evolution of the domestic economy remains somewhat concern ing.  Perhaps \nmost troubling is th e fact th at inflation persists in remain ing well below the Federal \nReserve’s 2 percent target.  Inflation rates that are too low limit monetary policy’s ability \nto offset the disturbances that often  buffet an economy.  Hence, one of the conditions that \nthe FOMC sti pulated for beginning to raise short -term rates is that the Committee should \nbe reasonably confident that inflation will move back to its 2 percent objective over the \nmedium term.3  Notably,  the undershooting  of inflation targets has been a problem in \nmany  developed countries, with Japan and Europe significantly undershooting their \ntargets as well.  \nFigure 1  shows how the forecasts of inflation by FOMC participants have fallen \nover the last three years.  The figure provides prediction s, made at various times , of core \nPCE inflation for the fourth quarter of 2015.  What you see is the so -called central \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL July 10, 2015 at 11:35 A.M. Eastern Time (9:35 A.M. Local Time in Victor, Idaho) OR UPON DELIVERY  * \n 4 tendency of those forecasts, which excludes the three highest and the three lowest \nforecasts.  In late 2012 and early  2013, the forecasts for inflation in 2015 w ere closely \nbunched around our 2 percent inflation target.  However , as time has progressed, the SEP \nforecasts have reflected increasing pessimism that we will reach the 2 percent inflation \ngoal in 2015.  Over the last year, core PCE inflation has been onl y 1.2 percent, and the \nJune SEP forecasts for inflation in the fourth quarter of this year had a central tendency of \njust 1.3 to 1.4 percent.   \nOne reason the inflation rate may be so subdued is that significant slack – that is, \nexcess supply – may remain in the labor market despite the simplest and most widely -\nreported unemployment rate having fallen to 5.3 percent.  An example of potential slack \nin the labor market appears in Figure 2 , which shows a steep drop in the percent of the \npopulation in the U.S. that is employed.  This employment -to-population ratio declined \nsignificantly during the last recession and has only marginally improved during the \nrecovery.  \nHowever, some of this decline is the result of a significant demographic change \noccurring in the w orkforce.  Failure to take this demographic change into account would \nresult in an overestimation of the potential slack in the labor market.  A close \nexamination of Figure 3  shows just how dramatic the age -related demographic shift has \nbeen in the populat ion over the last two decades.  By 2014, the percentage of the \npopulation in the three younger age groups had fallen relative to 1994, while the \npercentage of the population in the three older age groups had risen.  This demographic \nshift is slightly offse t by the fact that more older Americans are participating in the labor \nforce than has historically been t he case .   \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL July 10, 2015 at 11:35 A.M. Eastern Time (9:35 A.M. Local Time in Victor, Idaho) OR UPON DELIVERY  * \n 5 An interesting implication of this demographic shift is that the unemployment rate \nshould perhaps be lower at so -called “full employment.”  Younger workers tend to have \nhigher unemployment rates, since they are only beginning to acquire the skills needed by \nemployers.  Older workers tend to have very low unemployment rates if they remain in \nthe workforce.  As a result, the estimates of the une mployment rate at full employment \nneed to consider whether changes in the demographic composition of the workforce have \nan impact.   \nThis is one reason why I personally have lowered my estimate of the natural rate \nof unemployment to 5 percent, and I believ e it may need to be adjusted even lower if \ninflation continues to undershoot our forecasts.  \nFigure 4  shows the employment -to-population ratio for three of the prime -age \nworking cohorts.4  Since it is looking at narrow fixed -age groupings, its movement will  \nnot be as affected by demographic changes as would the overall employment -to-\npopulation ratio.  All three age cohorts declined significantly during the recession, and \nhave partially recovered over the past several years.  However, they also highlight that  in \neach of the age cohorts, the employment -to-population ratio remains well below levels \nseen in the decade prior to the recession.  Even if we do not fully return to the \nemployment -to-population ratios seen in the decade before the recession, we could st ill \nhave significant labor market slack to address.   \n \nUncertainty Related to Possible International Shocks  \nI would also like to provide some perspectives this morning on international \nshocks.  Given the many pressure points around the world –  Greece’s de bt crisis, China’s \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL July 10, 2015 at 11:35 A.M. Eastern Time (9:35 A.M. Local Time in Victor, Idaho) OR UPON DELIVERY  * \n 6 slowing economy, Japan’s long -running economic challenges , and areas of geopolitical \ninstability and conflict  – we all recognize that a number of international disruptions to the \ndomestic economy are at least possible.  \nLet me say that I am currently making the assumption  that international matters  \nwill be resolved in a way that does not meaningfully alter the course of the U.S. domestic \neconomy.  However, I will also highlight the situation in Greece as an example of how \ndifficult -to-predict international events can make forecasting the future course of the \neconomy challenging .  The situation also calls for some sober reflecting on how best to \npreserve financial stability  in all parties’ interests – and to that end I will provid e a few of \nmy own perspectives in a moment.  \nRecent events in Greece have underlined the fact that the Greek people are \nenduring a very difficult era.  Figure 5  shows that the unemployment rate in Greece has \nrisen dramatically over the past several years, a nd  was over 25 percent  this spring, prior \nto the turmoil of the last few weeks.  And unfortunately  the modest d ecline in  the Greek \nunemployment rate is  not really  a particularly positive  development,  since it partly \nreflect s reductions in labor force part icipation as Greek workers have given up on looking \nfor work in th eir highly depressed labor market.  \nSome analysts and observers suggest that any problems in Greece are unlikely to \nhave a broader impact simply because of Greece’s relatively small size.   To that end,  \nFigure 6  provides some summary statistics.  Greece is indeed a small country.  With a \npopulation of 11 million people, it is small relative to the 334 million people in the Euro \nArea or the 507 million people in the European Union.  Because per capita GDP  in \nGreece is lower than in many European countries, Greek GDP is less than 2 percent of \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL July 10, 2015 at 11:35 A.M. Eastern Time (9:35 A.M.

For an American frame of reference, \nGreece has about the same population as Ohio , and the GDP of Connecticut .   \nAs a general principal I would say that such measures can be a bit misleading \nwhen one is calibrating financial stability risks.5  The absolute size of an exposure may be \nless important than whether that exposure is diffusely held or is concentrated with \nparticular investors.  Generally speaking, disruption can be amplified  when investors are \nhighly leveraged, and when they play a c ritical role in financial market s functioning \nsmoothly . \nAt this point , much of the exposure to Greek assets has already been transferred \nfrom European banks to the  European  public sector.  In 2011, a key risk was that \ncommercial banks that were important f or the stability and functioning of the financial \nsystem  held highly leveraged exposures to Greece.  Factually speaking, t hat particular \nfinancial stability risk is diminished today, as the earlier restructuring of Greek debt \nmeans that many of the losses would be borne diffusely by European taxpayers.  And as \nyou can see in Figure 7 , the spread of peripheral countries’ 10 -year bonds over German \nbonds has been significantly less volatile recently , compared with 2011  – perhaps \nreflecting the diminution of th at risk.  \nFigure 8  shows the movement of stock prices in various countries following the \nannouncement of the Greek referendum after the close of stock markets on Friday, June \n26.  On Monday, June 29 there was a sizable impact (even though the referendum, as  \nannounced, would not decide the matter of Greece’s future participation in the Euro \nArea).  The decline in stock prices of about 2 percent in the United States, and more than \nthat in other countries, suggests the importance that market participants place on events in \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL July 10, 2015 at 11:35 A.M. Eastern Time (9:35 A.M. Local Time in Victor, Idaho) OR UPON DELIVERY  * \n 8 Greece even given its small size .  Of course, we do have the caveat that the declines \nreflect  other “news” events that may have occurred during that same time period .  \nTo date, the impact of the situation in Greece has been modest outside of G reece \nitself.  However, the financial market movements that I have highlighted suggest that, in \na world with integrated financial markets, even modest disruptions  that seem small \nrelative to the global economy  have the potential to be enhanced .  This argue s for \nthoughtful, proactive work to try to prevent  or manage  such disruptions .   \n \nPotential for Unintended Consequences  \nEvents in Europe are obviously  very fluid, but as a longtime observer of financial \nstability issues and their impact on economic participants, I will offer  my perspective.  I \nwould underline the desirability of  Greece and its creditors find ing a reasonable \ncompromise, which would not only help Greece but would avoid  some unintended  \nconsequences  for all p arties  in the Euro Area .  \nThe Euro Area had been assumed to be a permanent currency union with no \nprospect of or procedure for countries leaving to reinstat e their previous national \ncurrencies.  If that assumption eroded and  it were to becom e understood , instead,  that \ncountries could  leave the Euro Area, some of the advantages of the common currency for \nall the members would be  diminished.  Allow me to give some examples.  \n One advantage of a common currency is that it eliminates exchange -rate risk.  As \na result, transactions anywhere in the common currency area can be conducted without \nconcern that the relative currency valuation will change, eliminating the need for firms t o \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL July 10, 2015 at 11:35 A.M. Eastern Time (9:35 A.M. Local Time in Victor, Idaho) OR UPON DELIVERY  * \n 9 hedge their exchange  rate risk.  However, if a country  were to exit the euro, firms w ould \nnot be hedged for counterparties in that country.6   \nIn essence, the common currency makes it difficult to completely hedge the “tail” \nrisk (meaning a small likelih ood, large impact  event ) of a country  leaving the euro, and \nthis applies not just to Greece.  Th e emergence of this new  dynamic  might  encourage  \nfirms and financial institutions to reduce their exposure to counterparties in some  \ncountries, or to match their  assets and liabilities by country.  All this  would  mean that \nsome of the advantages of a common currency would be  lost for all parties in the \ncurrency union . \n A second advantage of a common currency relates to inflation discipline.  Several \nof the countri es in the Euro Area did not have success controlling inflation prior to \njoining  the euro .  However, exit ing the union  would imply a risk of a sharp reduction in \nthe value of currency – essentially a large inflationary effect.  So any country with a risk \nof exit may have the potential tail risk of much higher inflation (upon exit ), and this  \nmight  discourage some firms from locating in  such countries , despite the other \nadvantages . \n A third advantage of a common currency is that capital can flow to the highest  \nreturn projects, regardless of national borders.  However, if exit becomes  perceived as \npossible, the prospect of capital controls in countries with exit potential could discourage \ninvestment.  Similarly, capital flows would be  unlikely to move as freely if there is a tail \nrisk of a large currency devaluation.  \n These are just three examples underlining the fact that exit could  have  some  \nlonger -term implications not only for Greece, but also potentially for other countries in \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL July 10, 2015 at 11:35 A.M.

I raise these issues in the spirit of encouraging a prudent , proactive  \nunderstanding and management of risks , and a s clear  an eye as possible  to potential \nunintended consequen ces.  \n \nConcluding Observations  \nIn summary and conclusion, I will first state the obvious: economic forecasting is \nimportant for setting appropriate monetary policy.  Today, I have emphasized two areas \nof significant uncertainty in such forecasting.   \nDespite persistent improvement, the U.S. economy continues to undershoot the \nFederal Reserve’s 2 percent inflation target.  As the economy continues to improve, I \nexpect that inflation will begin to move closer to that target, making it appropriate to \nconsider starting to normalize monetary policy later this year.  However, as we near our \ndual mandate goals, monetary policymaking needs to be particularly data dependent.  As \nI have emphasized today, data  dependence at this point means , in my view,  that we wa it \nfor data that gives us greater confidence in our forecast, especially our forecast for \ninflation. And it also means w e wait to get a better handle on how the crisis in Greece \ngets resolved, so that we can better gauge its  potential to  impact finan cial markets and the \ndomestic economy.  \nObviously, m y hope is that both of these key risks will resolve in a way that \nsupports the Committee’s normalization criteria.   Fortunately, to date , geopolitical issues \nand concerns around the world have not signifi cantly altered the outlook for an \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL July 10, 2015 at 11:35 A.M. Eastern Time (9:35 A.M.

I \nlook forward to the rest of today’s program.  \n \n                                                 \n \n1 The FOMC’s Statement on Longer -Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy states: “ The inflation rate \nover the longer run is primarily determined by monetary policy, and hence the Committee has the ability to \nspecify a longer -run goal for inflation. The Committee reaffirms its judgment that inflation at the rate of 2 \npercent, as measured  by the annual change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures, is \nmost consistent over the longer run with the Federal Reserve’s statutory mandate. ” \nhttp://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/FOMC_LongerRunGoals.pdf  \n \n2 See the June  SEP at http://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/fomcprojtabl20150617.pdf  \n \n3 See the statement at http://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/monetary/20150617a.htm  \n \n4 While looking at the employment -to-population ratio for narrow age groups significantly reduces the \neffects of demographic changes, another way to remove  the effects of demographics changes on the \nemployment -to-population ratio and to better assess its recovery from the most recent recession is to hold \nthe age mix of the population constant.   This exercise – holding the age mix of the population constant as \nof 2004 – shows that some of the lack of recovery in the employment -to-population ratio can be attributed \nto the aging of the population.  With a constant age mix, the employment -to-population ratio falls by almost \nan equal amount but recovers more rapi dly and would be roughly two percentage points higher as of June, \nbut still well below its previous peak.   \n \n5 For example, many analysts cited the small size of sub -prime mortgages relative to the size of the U .S. \neconomy in making the argument that their  loss in value would have a minimal impact.  This perspective \nwas certainly not borne out by events in the United States in 2007 and 2008 . \n \n6 In the case of Greece,  no financial exchange would be immediately available to completely hedge the \npotential new -drachma exchange -rate risk.",

Thank you for the invitation to speak with you today. It is a great time to \nbe speaking at  the Forecasters Club of N ew York, as the path of monetary policy is importantly \ntied to policymakers’  forecast s for the economy and our confidence in those forecast s.   \nAs I begin, I would note as I always do that the views I will express today are my own, \nnot necessarily those of my colleagues at the Federal Reserve’s Board of Governors or on the \nFederal Open Market Committee (FOMC).  \n\n\n \n* EMBARGOED UNTIL September 1, 2015 at 1: 10 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *  \n \n \n2 \n The July FOMC statementi provided two conditions  related to  when raising  the target \nrange for the federal funds rate will be appropriate.  First, the statement indicated the committee  \nneed ed to see “some further improvement in the labor market. ”  In my own view, this condition \nhas largely been met by the continued growth in payroll employment – averaging in excess of \n200,000 jobs per month , year-to-date through July , and a U -3 unemployment rate – the typical, \nwidely reported measure of unemployment – that is currently at 5.3 percent.  \nThe second condition noted in the statement was that policymakers  must be “reasonab ly \nconfiden t that [PCE] inflation will move back to its 2 percent objective over t he medium term .”  \nFor this condition , the data have not been as clear -cut.  Core PCE inflation for the past year has \nonly been 1. 2 percent, and recently there have been substantial declines in oil prices and other \ncommodity prices.  These  will likely feed into core (and headline) measures of inflation for some \nmonths to come, temporarily lowering inflation  readings.  Adding to this , recent reports on \nwages and salaries still show few signs that the tightening labor market s are translating to \nincreases in  wages and salaries consistent with reaching 2 percent inflation.  \nAs a result, current data have yet to indicate that this second condition will be met in the \ncoming months ; instead , policymakers  will need to rely on forecasts of inflation.  Unfortunately, \nover t he past several years most forecast s have , incorrectly , predicted  that inflation will r eturn to \n2 percent  – you might say the incoming data have not cooperated  with the forecasts .  A \ncombi nation of positive supply shocks, the presence of more labor market slack than is captured \nby U -3 unemployment  readings , and weaker global conditions have no doubt contributed to these \nforecast errors.  Nonetheless, one might still be somewhat confident that we will reach 2 percent \n\n \n* EMBARGOED UNTIL September 1, 2015 at 1: 10 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *  \n \n \n3 \n PCE inflation if one sees  the U .S. economy  as likely to continue  grow ing above its potential , \nwhich would further  improv e labor market conditions .   \nIn effect, then, my view of the forecast for higher inflation rests largely on whether I \nthink the economy will continue to experience growth  above potential , and whether the \nsubsequent declining labor market slack will be  sufficient to raise my confidence  that inflation  \nwill return to 2 percent in a reasonable time frame.   \nSuch a forecast needs to be mindful of recent developments, including data that suggest  \nthe slowing of foreign economies , coupled with volatile  stock prices and falling commodity \nprices  – both of which  are consistent with a weaker global economy.  In my view, t hese \ndevelopments might suggest a downward revision  in the forecast  that is large enough  to raise \nconcerns about whether further tightening of labor markets is likely.  And without an expectation \nof growth above potential and further tightening of labor markets , I would lose my primary \nrationale for a forecast of rising inflation, diminishing my confiden ce that inflation will reach the \n2 percent target within a reasonable time frame.  Indications of a  much weaker global economy \nwould at least increase the uncertainty surrounding  policymakers’  economic growth and  inflation \nforecast s. \nThe focus of my talk today will be less about  the precise timing of an FOMC  move  on \ninterest rates , and more about the likely trajectory of monetary policy.  W hile market attention \nhas focused on the exact timing of potential rate rises , macroeconomic models of the economy \noverwhelmingly suggest  little impact on the broader economic landscape from moving the \ntiming of initial interest rate  hikes forward  or back ward  by a couple of month s.  However, the  \nfuture trajectory  of interest rate  increase s – that is , whether increases to more normaliz ed levels  \n\n \n* EMBARGOED UNTIL September 1, 2015 at 1: 10 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *  \n \n \n4 \n occur quickly or more gradually  – is, by cont rast, likely to have a meaningful impact  on \nemployment and inflation . \nToday I will argue that there are very good reasons to expect a much more gradual \nnormalization process than occurred in the previous two tightening cycles.  Importantly, t his is \nnot just my view ; the Summary of Economic Projections – the “SEP” – released  after the June \nFOMC  meeting , which incorporates the federal funds rate expectations for all the FOMC \nparticipants assuming appropriate monetary policy, indicates that Federal Reserve policymakers  \nexpect a gradual  tightening cycle.ii  My presentation  today  will, I believe,  illustrate  why this \nmore modest tightening path is both necessary and appropriate . \n \nRecent Tightening Cycles  \n Figure 1  shows the effective federal funds rate over time, highlighting the six months \nbefore and after the initial commencement of a tightening cycle .  In the past two cycles of \ntightening , the effective federal funds rate increased rapidly.  Just prior to tightening , in January \n1994 , for example,  the federal funds rate was about  3 percent but one year later was 5.5 percent, \nan increase of almost 250 basis points in that time .  In the most recent tightening cycle that began \nin June 2004, th e FOMC raised the federal funds rate by 25 basis points at each of the next eight \nmeeting s, thus totaling 200 basis points in th e first year following the commencement of the \ntightening cycle.  The figure also shows three dots  to illustrate the expected path as indicated  in \nthe June SEP.    \n This implied path of the SEP, illustrated more closely in Figure 2 , is much slower  than \nthe path taken in 2004 , with the federal funds rate increasing at roughly half the pace of th at \n\n \n* EMBARGOED UNTIL September 1, 2015 at 1: 10 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *  \n \n \n5 \n tightening episode .  This significantly slower pace reflects that linger ing headwinds resonating \nfrom the financial crisis, an d continued low inflation rates  both here and abroad, likely require a \ndifferent path of tightening.   \n  \nThis Time is Different  \n Figure 3  shows the inflation rate as measured by the core PCE index.  At the beginning  \nof the 1994 tightening cycle , core inflation was somewhat above 2 percent.  At the initiation of \nthe 2004 tightening cycle , core PCE inflation was almost at 2 percent ; shortly a fter the \ntightening , it averaged slightly  above 2 percent.  In contrast, we are currently well below the 2 \npercent target, with the core PCE index having risen  only 1.2 percent  over the past year . While \nthe SEP indicates that core PCE inflation is expected to gradually rise to 2 percent, it is only \nslowly converging to this point , and similar forecasts made over the past two year s have not been \nborne out by incoming data .  Such a modest path to  achieving  the 2 percent inflation target in my \nview provides  Fed policymakers  the latitude to more gradually raise rates as we become more \nconfident that the trajectory of  our inflation forecast is likely to be realized.  \n Figure 4  shows the growth in real GDP , with shading around the commencement of \ntightening cycles .  In the first quarter of 1994 , when the tightening cycle was beginning, real \nGDP over the previous year averaged 3.4 percent.  At the start of the 2004 tightening cycle , real \nGDP growth over the p revious year was 4.2 percent .  In contrast, over the p ast four quarters, real \nGDP has averaged only 2.7  percent.  While  it is true that potential growth has slowed recently, \nhow large and enduring this slowdown will prove to be  is still unknown.   Furthermore, real GDP \n\n \n* EMBARGOED UNTIL September 1, 2015 at 1: 10 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *  \n \n \n6 \n growth as forecast in the SEP is likely to remain below 3 percent – slower than what was \nencountered in previous tightening cycles.   \n Figure 5  highlights  the unemployment rate , with shading around  the beginning  of the \ntightening cycl es.  In January 1994  (as well as in the first quarter of 1994 as a whole) , the \nunemployment rate was 6.6 percent.  In the second quarter of  2004 the unemployment rate was \n5.6 percent.  Today, however, at 5.3 percent unemployment in July , we are well below the rate \nthat preceded  the past two tightening cycles, although  the SEP expects only a gradual \nconvergence in unem ployment to  5 percent.   \n So, b y the U -3 measure of unemployment , the commencement of tightening might on the \nsurface seem to be a bit late.  However, as shown in Figure 6 , using  a broader definition of \nunemployment  – known as  the U-6 – which includes workers who are working part time for \neconomic reasons and workers who are marginally attached to the workforce , a somewhat \ndifferent picture emerges.  In the first quarter of 1994, the U -6 rate was 11.5 percent; in the \nsecond quarter of 2004 it was only 9.6 percent.  With the current U -6 unemployment rate of 10.7 \npercent in the second quarter of 2015, and more rec ently 10.4 percent in July, we are between the \ntwo U -6 rates from the last two tightening  episode s.   \nOne interpretation of the data could be that the lack of inflation we are seeing to date may \nreflect that the degree of slack in the labor market is only imperfectly measured by U -3, which \nwould help account for the weak inflation and relatively modest increases we have seen in \nwages.  If one believes the broader measure of unemployment better captures slack in the \neconomy, then labor markets would not be viewed as unusually tight for commencing the \n\n \n* EMBARGOED UNTIL September 1, 2015 at 1: 10 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *  \n \n \n7 \n tightening cycle.  This potential additional slack would also be a reason for policymakers to \nfollow a more modest interest rate path a t the begin ning of a  tightening cycle.  \n \nAnticipation of this Tightening C ycle \n Figure  7 shows the two -year Treasury rate , with the commencement of tightening  \nhighlighted .  Since most of the increase  in the federal funds rate usually  occurs in the first two \nyears  of earlier  tightening cycles , as the figure shows, then movement in the two-year rate should \ncapture the market ’s anticipation of how quickly interest rates are likely to rise.  In both 1994 \nand 2004 , for example,  there was some modest increase in the two-year rate prior to the \ntightening , but substantially higher rates en sued once the first tightening had occurred.  \nToday, w ith the periodic publication of the SEP and a greater emphasis on \ncommunication  by the Federal Reserve , there has been significant marketplace discussion of the \nlikelihood of rates rising by the end of 2015.   Not surprisingly, the two -year rate has increased \ngradually as the prospect of a tightening cycle has become more likely .  A complicating factor is \nthe flight to quality that occurs with disturbances abroad ; problems in Greece and China have \nprobably encouraged some movement into Treasury securities.  However , the modest \nmovements to date seem consistent with investors expecting a gradual pace to the tightening.  \n In my own view, given current and forecast  condition s, not only is the pace likely to be \ngradual, but the federal funds rate in the longer run may be lower than in previous tightening \ncycles.  Figure 8  compares the federal funds rate three years after the first tightening in previous \ncycles to the fed eral funds rate in the long er run, according to the June SEP .iii  The median SEP \nestimate of the federal funds rate in the long er run is 3.75  percent , well below the rates seen three \n\n \n* EMBARGOED UNTIL September 1, 2015 at 1: 10 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *  \n \n \n8 \n years after the commencement of tightening in earlier tightening cycles.  A much lower endpoint \nand a gradual tightening path are , in fact,  consistent with the only modest increase in the two-\nyear rate to date.   \n The results of July’ s Survey of Primary Dealersiv offer a nother indication that many \nmarket participants believe  this will be a more gradual tightening cycle .  Figure 9  shows the  \nmidpoint  estimates of the primary dealer survey for the federal funds range compared  with the \nestimates provided by FOMC participants in the SEP.  The primary dealer response s show that \ntheir forecast for the path of the federal funds rate is not significantly different than what was \nprovided by FOMC participants in the June SEP  – both expect that the tightening path this time \nwill be gradual and is likely to stop at a lower rate than in pre vious cycles.  \n \nConclu ding Observations  \n In summary and conclusion, t his period of tightening is likely to differ from the two \nprevious tightening cycles  in that inflation is low and real GDP growth is slower than in 1994 \nand 2004, respectively.  While U-3 unemployment is lower  now than at the outset of the se earlier  \ntightening cycle s, the broader measure – U-6 unemployment  – is not particularly low compared \nto the start of the prior  two c ycles.   \nThe results of  the primary dealer survey and the most recent SEP provide  further \nevidence that this cycle of tightening is expected  to be more gradual and stop at a lower federal \nfunds rate.   \n\n \n* EMBARGOED UNTIL September 1, 2015 at 1: 10 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *  \n \n \n9 \n The more gradual tightening cycle should enable monetary policy makers  to gauge  how \ntight labor markets can be while maintaining stable prices.  The very low inflation rates here and \nabroad make it a particularly good time to not be too tied to imprecise measures of full \nemployment.    \nOf course, g iven the low wage and price inflation  data seen to date, and increased \nuncertainty about global growth, it will be particularly important for monetary policy makers  to \nclosely monitor and depend on incoming data . \nThank you.  \n                                                           \n \ni See the statement at http://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/monetary/20150729a.htm . \n \nii See the June SEP material at http://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/fomcprojtabl20150617.pdf  \n \niii For historical context, the longer -run federal funds rate could be measured by the average over a long time period, \nsuch as from the first quarter of 1992 to the third quarter of 2008  – 4 percent  – or from the first quarter of 1985 to \nthe third quarter of 2008  – 5 percent .  \n \niv The New York Fed’s Markets Group surveys primary dealers on their  expectations for the economy, monetary \npolicy, and financial market developments prior to Federal Open Market Committee meetings.

Thank you for the invitation to speak with you today.   It is a great \npleasure to be in Newport  County  to talk about the economic outlook.  In September, Rhode \nIsland had an unemployme nt rate of 5.4 percent , only a bit above the national average.  This \nrepresent s a really  remarkable improvement,  given that the  state was among the hardest hit \nduring the Great Recession  – unemployment peaked at 11.3 percent in Rhode Island in mid-\n2009.  According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, among the states, Rhode Island had the \nlargest decline in the unemployment rate from September 2014, at 1.8 percentage points.1\n\n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL Monday, November 9, 2015 at 12:40 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n \n \n2 \n Looking regionally , in September two New England states – New Hampshire and \nVermont – had unemployment rates below 4 percent , and two other New England states – \nMassachusetts and Maine – had unemployment rates below 4.8 percent, which is my current \nestimate for the “ full employment ” level  for the nation  as a wh ole.   \nThe employment report for  October , released last Friday , held very good news.  \nNation ally, the unemployment rate fell to 5 percent.  In addition, payroll employment grew by \n271,000 jobs in October , and over the past three months payroll employment growth has \naveraged 187,000 jobs per month.  Clearly, we are seeing continued improvement in labor \nmarkets and a further reduction in the remaining labor market slack.   \n Given the positive labor -market new s – in Rhode Island, in New England, and nationally  \n– it is reasonable  to ask whether t he degree of monetary stimulus being provided by the Federal \nReserve is still necessary .  The question is especially relevant  as many parts of the country return \nto pre -recession unemployment rates.    \n As I explore that question with you today, I would note as I always do that the views I \nwill express are my own, not necessarily those of my colleagues at the Federal Reserve’s Board \nof Governors or on the Federal Open Mark et Committee (FOMC).  \nAt the September monetary policy meeting of the FOMC, the Committee  chose not to \nraise short -term rates.  In my view, that was a prudent decision , based on manag ing risks and  \nconcerns.  In the second half of August, problems in some emerging -market  countrie s were \nunsett ling global financial markets  – and it was unclear what the duration of those difficulties  \nwould be , and the likely extent of the spillover to more developed economies .   \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL Monday, November 9, 2015 at 12:40 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n \n \n3 \n Fortunately, the worst of those c oncerns have not materialized. Many stock markets have \nimproved from August, and more importantly, domestic spending  in the U.S.  does not seem  to \nhave slowed significantly as a result of those earlier concerns ; and firms are continuing to hire \nadditional w orkers . \n After the October monetary policy meeting, the FOMC statement2 noted  that we are , of \ncourse,  still monitoring global economic and financial developments .  It went on to say that “it \nwill be appropriate to raise the target range for the federal funds rate when [the Committee ] has \nseen some further improvement in the labor market and is reasonably confident that inflation will \nmove back to its 2 percent objective over the medi um term.”  In more  colloquial  terms , I would \nsay if we see  continued gradual improvement in the U .S. economy , it will be appropriate to \ngradually increase short -term rates .  \nOctober’s  statement explicitly mentioned the possibility that the first move could  occur as \nsoon as the next meeting , in December , by saying : “In determining whether it will be appropriate \nto raise the target range at its next meeting, the Committee will assess progress  – both realized \nand expected  – toward its objectives of maximum emp loyment and 2 percent inflation. ”  I would \nhighlight that the data received recently have been positive, reflecting real improvement for the \neconomy.  \nToday , I would like to review some of th e current economic data and in doing so, \ndescribe why I am quite s upportive of the position taken by the FOMC at the last meeting.  \n \n \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL Monday, November 9, 2015 at 12:40 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n \n \n4 \n Recent Economic Data  \n Many headlines have focused on real GDP growing at only 1.5 percent  in the third \nquarter .  However,  I would like to share with you a measure that focuses on domestic demand  – \nreal final sales to domestic purchasers , which is shown in Figure  1.  This statistic is similar to \nGDP , but excludes  fluctuations in  inventories  and net exports .  This leaves consumption, \ninvestment , and government spending  – in sum,  a measure that tries to capture the underlying \nstrength in domestic demand.  In the third quarter  of this year,  real final sales to domestic \npurchasers grew by 2.9 percent , follow ing its second -quarter growth of 3.7 percent . \n In part, this indicator of mo re robust growth reflects the strength of consumer spending , \nshown in Figure 2.   Consumer spending has been boosted by the continued gradual \nimprovement in labor markets, lower gasoline prices , and  the relative strength in housing prices \nand stock prices , which  have improved household net worth.   \nImportantly, the strength in the third quarter in this measure of domestic demand suggests \nthat the U.S. was  little affected by the problems in emerging markets , or by the resulting \nfinancial -market turbulence.   With little collateral damage evident from external sources, I \nexpect domestic demand to continue to support  the economy .  This should  help to offset any \npotential weakness of some  of our trading partners and the strength of the dollar , which  of course  \nmakes it more difficult for U .S. exporters to compete internationally.       \n As long as domestic growth can offset any weak ness in  net exports, the economy should \ncontinue to grow somewhat above the level one would consider its “ potential ,” a growth rate that \nI estimate to be somewhat below 2  percent  today.  Growth above that rate should place downward \npressure on unemployment rates.  Recent evidence confirms this assessment: d espite real GDP \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL Monday, November 9, 2015 at 12:40 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n \n \n5 \n grow th averaging only 2.1 percent since the beginn ing of the recovery, both the widely reported  \nU-3 measure of unemployment and the broader U -6 measure of unemployment have fallen quite \nquickly , as shown in Figure 3  (the U -6 measure of unemployment adds persons marginally \nattached to the labor force, plus those part time for economic reasons) .   \nHow much further  the unemployment rate can fall  without risking a significant rise in \ninflation above  the Federal Reserve’s  2 percent target depends on one’s  estimate of the \nunemployment rate that is consistent with full employment.  Figure 4  shows the Federal Reserve \npolicymakers’ Summary of Economic Projections – the “ SEP” – forecast for the unemployment \nrate through 2018 .3  The median among all policymakers’ projections is shown a s the solid line, \nstarting at 5  percent  and falling to 4.8  percent .  In addition , the chart provides the estimates by \nFOMC participants o f where longer-run unemployment is likely to be  – which is a good proxy \nfor their estimates of the unemployment rate consistent with full employment .   \nThe area between the  dashed  lines contains  the range of estimates, which is fairly wide – \nfrom a low of 4.7 percent to a high of 5.8 percent.  The central tendency  (which excludes the \nhighest and lowest three estimates of longer -run unemployment)  ranges from 4 .9 to 5.2 percent , \nand is shaded .  Given those numbers, the 5.0 percent unemployment rate for the U -3 measure is \nalready squarely within the Fed policymakers’ central tendency for longer-run unemployment.  \nAt the Boston Fed, our estimate of unemployment in the long run is 4.8  percent .  While that is  \njust below the SEP central tendency, it is only 0. 2 percent below the current rate.   \n Once we have reached the 2 percent inflation  target  and the natural rate of \nunemployment , we should have normalized interest rates.  So one way the unemployment rate  \nstops declining and  levels off is if the Federal Reserve begins normaliz ing interest rates during \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL Monday, November 9, 2015 at 12:40 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n \n \n6 \n the recovery , as the current extent of monetary accommodation becomes no longer necessary to \nreach the long-term goals.  \n Figure 5  provides the real federal funds rate, measured  as the federal funds rate minus \nthe inflation rate (with inflation  measured by core PCE ).4  The real rate is important for spending \nand investment decisions.  The past three recessions are shaded.  \nNot surprisingly, the Federal Reserve generally reduces short -term interest rates during a \nrecession and the early stages of a recovery.  While the real federal funds rate did not become \nnegative during the 1990 recession, it did become negative just after the close of the 200 1 \nrecession. What is more unusual is how long the real federal funds rate has remained negative  in \nthe aftermath of t he most recent recession .  After more than six years of recovery, the real federal \nfunds rate still remains negative , to a greater extent  than in either of the previous two recessions . \n Figure 6  plots the real federal funds rate relative to the U -3 unemployment rate.  The red \ndot highlights the October  unemployment rate of 5. 0 percent , and a n October  real federal funds \nrate of negative 1.2 percent.  In addition, the chart separates – by color – observations from \nbefore monetary policy reached the zero lower bound (in December of 2008) , and after.  The \nbulk of negative real interest rate observations occur when the unemployment rate is quite high.   \nMore generally, when the unemployment rate is as low as it is now , you normally see positive \nrather than negative real federal funds rates.   \nFigure 7  shows  the real federal funds rate relative to core PCE inflation .  Again, the chart \nuses color to separate the observations from before and after monetary  policy reached the zero \nlower bound.  As the chart shows, t he cluster of negative real interest rates reflects the period \nwhen monetary policy  hit the zero lower bound.   Since the nominal federal funds effective rate is \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL Monday, November 9, 2015 at 12:40 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n \n \n7 \n near zero, the movement of the real interest rate once the zero lower bound was hit only reflects \nvariation in the core PCE inflation rate.  While there are limited observations of the core PCE \ninflation rate being this low, there are observations of a higher real federal funds rate  when \ninflation is approximately as low as it is currently.  This highlights that monetary policy remains \nquite accommodative  by historical standards , even while the PCE inflation rate remains low , \nrelative to our target.  \n To that end, Figure 8  shows several possible paths for short -term interest rates .  One path \nillustrates  what might occur  if we were to increase the funds rate by  25 basis point s at each \nFOMC meeting (as we did in the recovery from the 200 1 recession ) until the rate reaches the \nSEP longer -run projection .  Another path depicts the Fed policymakers’  September SEP, and a \nthird path represents market expectations, implied by federal funds rate futures .  The latter two \nboth would suggest  that this is likely to be a much more gradual normalization process than th e \none that  followed the 2001 recession .  Given persistently low wage and price pressures , and the \nrelatively slow real GDP growth forecast in the SEP shown in Figure  9, a more gradual path of \nnormalization may be necessary to ensure reaching the 2 percent inflation target.    \nThere are other potential advantages to a gradual removal of accommodation.  First, a \nslower path will provide more time to analyze the effectivene ss of monetary policy tightening \ntools.  Were the Committee  to wait longer  to begin , and then need to potentially move rates more \nrapidly , we might have less flexibility to assess the effectiveness of some of our new tools . \nA second benefit of a gradual removal of accommodation is that it would provide more \ntime to analyze how the tightening is affecting the real economy.  Given that there is significant \nuncertainty about the level of interest rates that would stabilize  inflation or unemployment  – and \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL Monday, November 9, 2015 at 12:40 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n \n \n8 \n also uncertainty about the federal funds rate that would reflect fully normalized policy  – a slower \npace reduces the risk that the Committee  takes more or less aggressive action than needed or \nintended.    \nGiven the uncertainties  surrounding the degree of accommodation that is necessary to \nachieve 2 percent  inflation and full employment, I prefer a path that involves only gradual \nincreases in interest rates and that essentially probes how tight labor markets can be , consistent \nwith our  2 percent  inflation target.  \n \nFinancial Stability Considerations  \nWhen the U.S. economy was  significantly missing on the Federal Reserve’s  employment \nand inflation  goals , monetary policy was appropriately calibrated to provide considerable \nstimulus,  so as to  return the economy to  its desired, normal state.   However, as the economy \nattains a more desirable balance of full employment with 2 percent inflation , financial stability \nissues  that imply  risks to future economic balance should receive increased  weight.   \nOne potential cost of maintaining the federal funds rate at the zero lower bound  for a long \ntime is that it may incent behavior that would be discouraged in a  more normalized interest rate \nenvironment.  Looking forward, a  potential risk  of a low -interest rate environment is that \ninvestors seeking a higher return may take on too much  risk in order to improve returns, perhaps \nnot fully taking into account the higher risk that normally accompanies higher yields.   \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL Monday, November 9, 2015 at 12:40 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n \n \n9 \n Early signs of this “ search for yield ” may be showing up in  the commercial real estate  \nmarket .  Figure 10  shows the path of commercial real estate prices , which  have grown quite \nrapidly, despite the only modest growth in real GDP over the recovery.   \nWhile Figure 10  reflects b road regional trends, in some more localized markets \ncommercial real estate activity has been even more robust.  A qualitative indicator in a major city \nis a simple crane count .  When the number of cranes observed on a short walk in a city  such as \nBoston  reaches double digits, as is the case today, it is worth reflecting on the sustainability of \nsuch growth.   Particularly given the role that commercial real estate played in the economic \ndownturn in New England during the late 1980s, th e trend in commercial real estate prices \nshould be thoughtfully monitored.  \n \nConclu ding Observations  \n In summary and conclusion , I would note that l abor markets have improved over the past \nyear, and we are at  – or fast approaching  – rates of unemployment  that many economists \nestimate to be consistent with full employment.  As long as the economy is growing somewhat \nabove potential, I am reasonably confident we will return to our 2 percent inflation target and to \nmy estimate of full employment.  \nAs the October FOMC statement indicated, all future Committee  meetings  – including \nDecember ’s – could be an appropriate time for raising rates , as long as the economy continues to \nimprove as expected.  However, with inflation still below the target , I believe the path of  \nincreases should be gradual , once we do move off the zero lower bound .   \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL Monday, November 9, 2015 at 12:40 P.M.

While a range of views could, of \ncourse, develop under a more centralized sy stem, it would depend on the willingness of \nFed leadership to foster dissenting opinions .  While that has certainly been the case \nrecently, it arguably has not always b een so during our 100 year history.   \nIn many respects, the Federal Reserve System was designed to encourage the \nexpression of diverse views, given the fede rated structure consisting of independent \nregional reserve banks and a Presidentia lly nominated Board of Governors in \nWashington.  Diversity of views is partic ularly useful during a period of changing \nparadigms, and when substantially new fact s confront the economics profession.  In \nrecent years, we experienced a so-called “Gr eat Moderation” and a “Great Recession,” so \nthere has been no shortage of topics in need of further investigation – and, I would add, a \nneed for a healthy dose of humility about how well the profession’s models fit actual \nexperience.  Today I will take up our moderator’s i nvitation to provide a few examples of \nways the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston (t he Boston Fed) has tried to provide a \ndistinctive perspective on economic issues.  The Boston Fed has had a tradition of active \ninvolvement in a variety of policy areas over the years.  For exampl e, in the past the \nBoston Fed was proactive in looking at such  issues as discrimination in mortgage \nlending\n1 and the role of credit crunches in transmitting financial shocks to the real \neconomy.2  Today, however, I will focus on some more recent work – work done over the \ncourse of the last six years or so. \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Saturday, January 4, 2014 at 10:15 AM Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY  * \n \n \n  \n \n 3 I will first discuss how the Boston Fed focused on problems emerging in the real \nestate sector during the early stages of the fina ncial crisis, which in turn led us to try out a \nnew role for a Reserve Bank – hosting large mortgage foreclosure events designed to \nbring borrowers and lenders together to address mortgage delinquency problems.   \nNext, I will mention some of our work on financial stability, with a particular \nfocus on money market mutual funds.  During the financial crisis, the Boston Fed was the \nonly Reserve Bank outside of New York to host a Federal Reserve System emergency \nliquidity facility – specifically the AMLF (the Asset-Backed Commercial Paper Money \nMarket Mutual Fund Liquidity Facility).  That experience underscored for us the \nimportance of trying to prevent the need fo r such interventions in the future.  Our \ncontinuing research on money market funds ha s resulted in published studies, op-ed \npieces, comment letters, and speeches seeking to encourage the reform of financial \nstructures that continue to  pose systemic issues.   \nFinally, I will discuss monetary policy.  The Boston Fed has been, and remains, \nfocused on both elements of the Fed’s dual mandate from Congress – employment as well as inflation.  We have highlighted the high costs related to being below full \nemployment for a long period of time.  And we have strongly argued that policymakers \nshould be as concerned about inflation being too low as be ing too high, given the toll and \npersistence of deflation were it to emerge.  The analytical work done by the Boston Fed’s \nResearch department on these issues has also informed my choice to dissent twice as an \nFOMC member – first because of concern that  financial shocks were going to have a \nmuch larger impact than many anticipated in December 2007; and again last month, to \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Saturday, January 4, 2014 at 10:15 AM Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY  * \n \n \n  \n \n 4advocate for a patient approach to re moving accommodation since the economy \ncontinues to have unemployment that is t oo high and inflation that is too low. \n \nMortgage Foreclosure Issues \nIn 2007, the Boston Fed’s Regional and Community Outreach staff documented \nhow foreclosures were disproportionately  impacting low- and moderate-income \nneighborhoods around New England.  These concer ns were also surfacing in discussions \nwith community development experts servi ng on our external advisory groups.   \nAlso, staff in our research area began i nvestigating the increase in foreclosure \nactivity.3  Much of that research highlighted that the behavior of home prices was critical \nto understanding the foreclosure crisis.  As Figure 1  highlights, while home prices had \nfallen in some regions of the country in the early 1990s, for all sections of the country to \nexperience falling home prices simultaneous ly was unusual.  Families experiencing a \n“life event” such as an unemployment  spell, a divorce, or health issues in a rising \nhousing market  can sell their house.  However, those same problems occurring during a \nperiod of falling housing prices often resulted  in foreclosure.  Many underestimated or \nignored the potential for housi ng prices to fall nationally – something outside of recent \nhistorical experience.  This proved problematic not only for individuals and families, of course, but also for a variety of financial instruments that were designed to perform well \nwhen housing prices were rising, but could generate large losses  if housing prices fell.   \nI highlighted the research being done at th e Bank on these sorts of residential real \nestate problems in speeches I gave soon after becoming president of the Boston Fed.\n4  We \nalso decided to pursue large-scale mortgage foreclosure prevention workshops.  We held \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Saturday, January 4, 2014 at 10:15 AM Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY  * \n \n \n  \n \n 5the first of these at Gillette Stadium, home of the New Engl and Patriots, and thousands of \nresidential borrowers came to work with lenders  in an attempt to prevent foreclosure (see \nFigure 2 ).  The long lines of borrowers unde rscored for the Boston Fed and other \nReserve Banks that there was an opportunity to  reach more distressed borrowers – and to \nfocus policy discussions on more comprehens ive ways to address these problems.   \n \nFinancial Stability \nAnother area of focus that has been im portant and somewhat distinguishing for \nthe Boston Fed is financial stability.  The Boston Fed had always been attuned to less \ntraditional financial intermediaries, such as money market mutual funds, because of the \nprevalence of such entities in New England.  However, that longstanding interest took on \ngreat urgency when problems at a money ma rket mutual fund, the Reserve Primary Fund, \nin the wake of the Lehman failure led to a run on prime money market mutual funds, \nillustrated in Figure 3 .   \nWith the run picking up steam, we worked closely with colleagues from the Board \nof Governors on ways in which the Federal Reserve might provide an emergency liquidity facility to stabilize the money market mutual fund industry, to prevent further \ncollateral damage – including pot ential collateral damage to a wide range of companies \nthat depended on money market funds purchas ing their short-term debt to fund their \noperations.  The result was that by the end of  the week a new emergency credit facility \nwas established, a call center to operate th e facility was created within the Boston Fed, \nand the facility was up and running by the fo llowing Monday.  The facility administered \nby the Boston Fed – the AMLF – provided loan s on asset-backed commercial paper that \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Saturday, January 4, 2014 at 10:15 AM Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY  * \n \n \n  \n \n 6banks purchased from money market mutual f unds.  Within the firs t 10 days of operation, \nlending under the AMLF grew rapidly – reaching a peak of over $150 billion on October 1, as shown in Figure 4 .  This program, along with the pr ovision of insurance for money \nmarket funds by the federal government, helped  stop runs that were seriously disrupting \nshort-term credit markets.\n5 \nThe crisis experience spurred interest in identifying and putting in place \nregulations that could help avoid a repetition of the probl ems experienced and the need \nfor emergency measures.  Boston Fed analys ts studied publicly av ailable reports and \ndisclosures, and found that fund sponsors prov ided substantial support for money market \nfunds to avoid numerous occasions of funds “breaking the buck.”  This underlines the fact that the funds’ current structure poses significant fi nancial stability concerns.\n6  The \nPresidents of all the Reserve Banks jointly signed two comment letters advocating \nregulatory reform of the m oney market fund industry.7  I also contributed two op-ed \npieces in The Wall Street Journal  advocating for reducing the financial stability risk \nposed by the current structure of money market mutual funds.    \n \nMonetary Policy    \nThe Boston Fed has long been data driven when it comes to monetary policy – \nand willing to proactively advocate policy, base d on the data and our empirical analysis.  \nIn our research and our public speeches, we have argued for a balanced approach to the \ndual mandate and have supported flexible inflat ion targeting.  Research by our staff on \ninflation and employment dynamics has provi ded a strong empirical  foundation for the \nmonetary policy positions of the Boston Fed.8 \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Saturday, January 4, 2014 at 10:15 AM Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY  * \n \n \n  \n \n 7With regard to inflation targeting, our research, speeches and policy actions have \nhighlighted that monetary policymakers shoul d be concerned about inflation being both \ntoo low as well as too high.9  As Figure 5  shows, over the past two years most measures \nof U.S. inflation have been trending down, and all are below the 2 per cent target that the \nFederal Reserve reaffirmed at the beginning of last year.  With the inflation rate below \ntarget and the unemployment rate significantl y above target, we be lieve strongly that \nmonetary policymakers have the opportunity  to be patient in removing accommodation, \nspeeding up the process of achie ving both elements of the Fed’s dual mandate.  This was \none of the motivations for my dissen ting vote at the last FOMC meeting. \nEven if we were not significantly unde rshooting our inflation target, there would \nstill be a significant argument for moneta ry policy remaining hi ghly accommodative.  \nThe theme of our Bank’s April 2013 resear ch conference was “Fulfilling the Full \nEmployment Mandate.”  In sum, the confer ence highlighted how far the U.S. remains \nfrom full employment – and the costs of not retu rning to full employment more quickly.   \nIndeed, as Figure 6  shows, the percent of thos e who are unemployed and have \nbeen so for more than six months has been unusually high during this recession and \nrecovery, and remains well above the peak  of previous recessions.  Long-term \nunemployment has significant negative effects for individuals of course, but also the \neconomy – for example through the atrophy of sk ills.  So the failure  of monetary and \nfiscal policy to generate a more rapi d recovery risks creating a long-term structural  \nunemployment problem out of a severe cyclical downturn.  This concern also underlies \nmy dissent at the last FOMC – because, in my view, the risks from generating a more \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Saturday, January 4, 2014 at 10:15 AM Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY  * \n \n \n  \n \n 8rapid recovery seem small relative to th e risks from generating a more permanent \nincrease in structural unemployment. \n \nConcluding Observations \nI have discussed three examples of ways  the Boston Fed has tried to make unique \npolicy contributions within the Federal Reserv e System.  Moreover, my footnotes contain \ncitations illustrating that we  also make academic contributions by publishing our research \non these topics, as well as many other topics th at I do not have time to  highlight today, in \nthe top economics and finance journals.   \nHowever, as I hope my remarks have illustrated, we have tried to advance not \nonly diversity of thought  in the Federal Reserve System, but also diversity of actions .  \nThe work that I have highlighted today illustra tes our belief that da ta-driven research of \nthe type that can appear in major professiona l journals can also inform and guide policy \nactions – in monetary policy, supervisory policy, financial stability policy, and the \neconomy more broadly.  Ultimately, our hope is  to make a positive difference in these \nimportant areas. \nFinally, I would add that our work at the Boston Fed has benefitted significantly \nfrom our interactions with the rich academ ic community in New England.  Most of the \narticles I have cited in my footnotes have multiple authors.  We value collaboration with \nthe academic community, and there are certainly important topics that would benefit from \nfurther academic work and collaboration.  Let me provide some quick examples from the \nthree areas I have di scussed today:   \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Saturday, January 4, 2014 at 10:15 AM Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY  * \n \n \n  \n \n 9 In the area of residential real estate, there remains much to be learned about \nwhat generates real estate bubbles, a nd why the rapid appreciation of real \nestate in countries around the world has generated collapses in some countries \nwhile other countries have seen little or no pull-back after rapid appreciation.  \n  \n In the area of financial stability, statis tical models can help us identify and \nunderstand unusual occurrences and pa tterns up to a point – but when \ncommon assumptions prove wrong and hi storical relationships break down, \nserious and damaging problems can emer ge.  We should ask ourselves how \nvarious parties could do a better j ob of considering potential outlier \nexperiences, and incorporate their risks in to the ways financial institutions are \nled and managed (and supervised). \n \n And in the area of monetary policy, th e dynamics of inflation both during and \nfollowing the recession have presented puzzl es.  For instance, why is inflation \nboth here and abroad remaining stubbor nly low today, even as the economic \nrecoveries in the U.S. and the Euro ar ea strengthen, in pa rt boosted by  highly \naccommodative monetary policy?  In Boston, we have examined the extent to which a number of factors might explai n recent behavior – time-variation in \nthe slope of the Phillips curve, a reduced impact of relative prices (especially \noil) on inflation, survey measures as  proxies for short-run and long-run \ninflation expectations, an d downward nominal wage ri gidities.  While these \nfactors appear to provide partial expl anations, no effects singly or severally \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Saturday, January 4, 2014 at 10:15 AM Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY  * \n \n \n  \n \n 10provide a complete accounting of recent  inflation behavior.  Given these \nuncertainties about inflation dynamics, we have reason to have less confidence than usual in the inflation forecasts from our suite of models, \nmany of which would suggest a gradual ri se toward the Fed's inflation target \nin coming quarters. This makes the cu rrent low level of inflation more \ntroubling from the perspective of risk ma nagement.  So, in short, we need to \nbetter understand inflation dynamics.      \nWe will continue to benefit from the work of many of you in the audience.  \nHopefully the diversity of thought and actions  that stems from the federated Federal \nReserve System will continue to make our pol icymaking process resilient – especially in \nlight of the uncertainties we continue to face.   \nThank you. \n      \n                                                 \n \nNOTES: \n1  See the following: \n \n “Redlining in Boston: Do Mortgage Lenders Discriminate Against Neighborhoods?” Geoffrey \nM.B.

I would also note that  New College is consistently ranked among the \ntop colleges for the combination of academ ic excellence and affordability – no small \nachievement in this day and age.  \nTurning to my topic today, I would first like to note – as always – that the views I \nshare are my own, not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market \nCommittee (FOMC) or the Federal Reserve’s Board of Governors. \n\n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Thursday, February 6, 2014 at 5:45 PM Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY  * \n \n \n  \n \n 2The New College location in sunny Florid a seems appropriate for my message \ntoday, given that there has been some sunnier  news on the economy recently.  Last week, \nwe learned that the preliminary estimate of real GDP growth in the fourth quarter of 2013 \nwas 3.2 percent, and thus for the second ha lf of 2013 real GDP growth averaged 3.7 \npercent – well above the 2.4 per cent average over the recove ry period.  Some of this \ngrowth reflects factors that  will likely prove temporary, such as a rapid build-up of \ninventories and a surge in net exports.  But excluding inventory fluctuations, final sales \ngrew three-quarters of a per centage point faster in the s econd half of 2013 than in the \npreceding 16 quarters.  Not only has there been good news on economic growth, but the unemployment \nrate has also continued to decline – and I hope we will see another decline in tomorrow’s \nemployment report.  It is certainly good news that the national unemployment rate has \nfallen from a peak of 10 percent in the post-fi nancial crisis recession to 6.7 percent as of \nDecember.  Unfortunately, not all reductions in the unemployment rate are alike.  For \nexample, some are caused by rapid employment  growth, while others are due to people \ngiving up looking for a job. Distinguishing which is occurring is often quite difficult.  \nOne warning sign for economists is that while ov erall this has been a long, slow recovery, \nthe recent decline in the unemployment rate  has occurred more quickly than many \nexpected.   \nThe fact that other labor market indicato rs have not been as favorable as the \nunemployment rate suggests that the rate may be falling for both reasons.  Gauged by \nthese broader measures of labor market ut ilization, we remain far from conditions \nexperienced prior to the so- called “Great Recession.”   \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Thursday, February 6, 2014 at 5:45 PM Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY  * \n \n \n  \n \n 3Currently, over 20 million  Americans are either unemployed, are marginally \nattached to the labor force (including discouraged worker s no longer looking for work \nbecause they believe no jobs are available for them), or are working part time when they \nwould prefer full-time work.  For these Ameri cans, it is all too painfully apparent that \nlabor markets remain far from th eir state prior to the recession. \n The concern that the unemployment rate al one does not fully capture the state of \nlabor market conditions is reflected in the Federal Reserve’s current  stance of monetary \npolicy.  In the January FOMC statement,1 the Committee reaffirmed that it likely will be \nappropriate to maintain the current target ra nge for the federal funds rate well past the \ntime that the unemployment rate declines below 6.5 percent (especi ally if inflation \nremains so subdued). \nGiven that the unemployment rate is now approaching this 6.5 percent threshold, I \nwant to highlight why, in my  view, labor-market conditions remain far from where they \nwould need to be to justify raising short-te rm rates.  Furthermore, I will argue that \neveryone following the economy should be plac ing weight on the broader measures of \nlabor market underutilization.  A key point that  I will expand on in a moment is that these \nmeasures remain far above where they were when the Federal Reserve began raising short-term rates in the previous recovery.   \nAs I have often noted, a patient appro ach to removing accommodation is further \njustified because the inflation rate remains far below the Fed’s 2 percent target.\n2  Very \nsubdued inflation gives policymakers latitude to accommodate a more rapid improvement \nin labor markets, by keeping short-term ra tes lower for longer than is typical for \nrecoveries. \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Thursday, February 6, 2014 at 5:45 PM Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY  * \n \n \n  \n \n 4Measures of Underutilization in Labor Markets \n Since we are gathered today on a college campus, I hope you will indulge me a \nbrief tutorial on labor market statistics .  The topic may sound a bit dry, but the \ndistinctions in the measures have major implications for policies that affect millions of Americans.   \nThe U.S. Bureau of Labor Statisti cs (BLS) publishes a broader set of \nunemployment rates in order to captu re underutilization in labor markets\n3 – indeed, the \ncategories were redefined in 1994, so there is  a consistent series going back that far.4  \nFigure 1  charts these various BLS measures of  underutilization in  labor markets over \ntime.  Let me walk you through the chart, beginning at the bottom. \n \n The dark blue reflects those Americ ans who are unemployed.  This is the \nmeasure most frequently cited from the labor report.  The BLS calls this its \n“U-3” definition of unemployment, which includes people who do not have jobs but have actively searched for work over the previous four weeks.\n5  (In a \nmoment you will be conversant in all th e “U” measures of labor market slack, \nfrom U-3 to U-6.)   \n  \n The light blue area reflects so called  “discouraged workers” who, together \nwith the unemployed, make up the “U-4” measure of labor market utilization.  \nDiscouraged workers are not included in the narrower definition of the \nunemployed because they have not searched for work over the previous four weeks. They have searched for work over the previous year,  but do not think \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Thursday, February 6, 2014 at 5:45 PM Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY  * \n \n \n  \n \n 5that jobs fitting their skills or bac kground are currently av ailable.  As of \nDecember, the BLS measured 917,000 of these discouraged workers in the U.S., compared to only 363,000 at the beginning of the recession in December \nof 2007.\n6 \n \n The green area reflects other persons wh om the BLS classifies as “marginally \nattached to the labor force,” but w ho are not classified as discouraged \nworkers.  The BLS’s “U-5” measure adds  these people to the discouraged and \nunemployed workers.  The other marginally attached workers are available to work and have searched for work in th e previous year, but have not searched \nfor work in the past four weeks and are therefore outside of the labor force.  \nThey do not state that their reason for being out of the labor force is an \nabsence of available jobs.\n7  Issues such as family responsibilities or \ntransportation challenges may be playing a role.  The BLS estimates that there are currently about 1.5 m illion Americans in this category, compared to \n981,000 in December of 2007. \n \n The dark red area on the chart reflects persons who are working part time for \nso-called “economic reasons.”\n8  They are available to work full time, but have \nhad their hours reduced – or could only  secure part-time work.  The BLS’s \n“U-6” measure adds these people working part time for economic reasons to the people in the U-5 measure.  Ther e are currently 7.8 million workers who \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Thursday, February 6, 2014 at 5:45 PM Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY  * \n \n \n  \n \n 6are working only part time for econo mic reasons, up sharply from the 4.6 \nmillion in December of 2007. \n \n In sum, Figure 1 highlights why, for ma ny Americans, the labor market remains \nvery difficult – and why using the narrow, wi dely reported unemploy ment rate alone to \nsummarize labor market conditions could s uggest a misleadingly optimistic state of \naffairs.  While the traditional unemployment rate is an important measure, its decline \ndoes not capture the wider difficulties in the labor market that are being felt by so many \nAmericans.  My sense is that  evaluation of the labor market  situation requires much more \nattention to these broader measures.  \nUsing the Broader Measures of Labor Market Utilization \n Figure 2  provides the traditional unemployment rate along w ith a vertical line at \nJune 2004 – the first tightening of monetary policy during the previous  recovery, on June \n30, 2004.  The unemployment rate at that time was 5.6 percent, and the PCE inflation rate over the previous year was 2.8 percent.  It is  revealing to contrast  those with current \nconditions.  We have a much higher unemploym ent rate (6.7 percent as of December) and \na much lower inflation rate (1.1 percent as of December).   Also on Figure 2, I have a horizontal lin e showing the average unemployment rate \nfrom January 1994 to December 2007.  We are currently more than one and a half percentage points or about 2.5 million people above that average of the most basic and \nnarrow measure of unemployment. \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Thursday, February 6, 2014 at 5:45 PM Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY  * \n \n \n  \n \n 7 Figure 3  provides a similar chart, but uses the next broader definition of labor \nmarket underutilization.  The December U-4 unemployment rate, which includes \ndiscouraged workers, was 7.2 percent.  This is almost two percentage points above the \naverage for 1994 to 2007, and well above the peak after the previous recession.   \nSimilarly, in Figure 4  the U-5 measure of unemplo yment (adding in all other \npersons marginally attached to the labor fo rce) shows an even wi der gap, 2.1 percentage \npoints, from the pre-rece ssion average (1994 through 2007). \n I find Figure 5,  using the broadest measure (U-6 ) that adds in those employed \npart time for economic reasons, particularly stri king.  Even at this point in the recovery, \nthe measure is still nearly four and a qua rter percentage points or 6.5 million people \nabove the pre-recession average – a gap that is much wider than those for the other \nmeasures of unemployment.9  The large number of individuals working part time for \neconomic reasons highlights, in my view, the need for much more improvement in labor \nmarkets.    Figure 6  compares the current reading of all these measures to their level at the \ntime of the first monetary policy tightening duri ng the previous recove ry (in June 2004).  \nIt highlights how much higher  all the unemployment measures are now than they were in \nJune 2004, when the FOMC first tightened rate s during the previous recovery.  While all \nmeasures are well above the rates in June 2004, the broadest measure of unemployment is \nparticularly far from its level then.    Figure 7  plots the measures of labor market  underutilization on one chart.  Two \nimportant features stand out to me.  First,  the gaps between the traditional, narrow U-3 \nmeasure of unemployment and a ll the broader measures rema in wider than they were \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Thursday, February 6, 2014 at 5:45 PM Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY  * \n \n \n  \n \n 8prior to the recession.  Second, while all the measures of la bor market utilization have \nimproved from their peaks, you can see that the broader the measure, the further the \ncurrent reading is from it s pre-recession level.   \nUnfortunately, the BLS data series of  broader measures of labor market \nutilization, as currently defined, go back only to 1994.  And despite the clear story I think \nthey tell, there are some important questi ons that have yet to be answered.   \nFor example, will the broader measures of labor utilization return to pre-recession \nlevels, or does this represent a more lasting change in labor force dynamics?  If it is the \nformer, it will require much more economic growth to absorb this large pool of \nunderutilized workers.   \nAlso, how large an impact do these pools of underutilized workers have on wages \nand prices?   On the one hand, growth in  wages and prices has been very low by \nhistorical standards; on the ot her hand, wage and price infl ation did not fall as low as \nmany predicted, given the earlier upheaval in labor markets.  \nFinally, inflation of late has remained  stubbornly low, even as labor market \nconditions have improved, to the surprise of ma ny forecasters.  So we need to explore the \nlink between these labor  market indicators and wage a nd price inflation, in part to \nunderstand the likely evolution of inflation, and in part to understand to what degree we \ncan expect these measures to return to their pre-recession norms.  In other words, whether \nwe have seen more permanent “scarring” of the unemployed, which might imply longer-\nlasting effects, broadly construed.  I will expand on this theme in a moment. \nAs the economy continues to improve gr adually, monetary policymakers need to \ncarefully evaluate labor market conditions.  My  own view is that for now we will need to \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Thursday, February 6, 2014 at 5:45 PM Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY  * \n \n \n  \n \n 9place greater weight on these broader measures  of labor market utilization – measures \nthat are not returning to “normal” as quick ly as is the more narrow U-3 measure of \nunemployment.  \nLabor Market Slack and Inflation \n Most forecasters have expected that as  labor market slack diminished, inflation \nwould move back to levels closer to the Fe d’s 2 percent target.  However, the actual \ninflation experience has been more subdued th an forecast over the past two years.  At \nleast one potential reason  for this forecasting “miss” is the presence of s ubstantial labor \nmarket slack, as shown in the broader unemployment measures.  Figure 8  provides the midpoint of the central tendency of the inflation forecasts \nfor 2013, provided by the Federal Reserve gover nors and presidents in our quarterly \nSummary of Economic Projections.  Back in  November of 2011, the midpoint of the \ncentral tendency of the forecasts showed that Fed policymakers expected both PCE and \ncore PCE inflation to be just  under 1.8 percent.  As the fo recasts have been updated for \nsubsequent Committee meetings, the forecast for the year-over-year inflation rate for \n2013 has continued to decline (shown by the midpoint of the central tendency of the \nforecasts, plotted on the chart).  In fact, the PCE inflation rate of 1.1 percent in December \nwas much lower than was expected, even at the beginning of 2013.  A similar pattern \nemerges with core PCE inflation.    Figure 9  shows that private sector forecasts of inflation have been no more \naccurate.  The Survey of Professional Forecaste rs reported a median expectation that the \nPCE inflation rate would be 2 percent as of November 2012.  Much like the SEP, as \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Thursday, February 6, 2014 at 5:45 PM Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY  * \n \n \n  \n \n 10economic data have continued to come in weaker, the Survey’s inflation forecast was \nreduced further.  Even in 2013, the forecast redu ctions have been sizable.  The Blue Chip \nconsensus forecasts show a similar pattern.  Some argue that so-called structural unemployment has risen, by which I mean \nthat the recession has caused cha nges in the labor market that  imply a long-term increase \nin unemployment that will not recede as the economy recovers.  Many who believe that much of our unemployment is structural argue th at there is little that monetary policy can \ndo if weak labor markets reflect structural ra ther than cyclical forces.  While we cannot \ncategorically rule out the presence of some st ructural unemployment, I would note that if \nstructural unemployment is now much higher, then it is difficult to explain why growth in \nprices has continued to be low, both in absolute terms and relative to expectations .   \nIn short, one potential explanation for persistently low price (and wage) growth \nmay be that the weakness we have just seen  in the broader measur es of labor markets \nbetter reflects the state of the labor market than the traditional, narrow U-3 measure of \nunemployment.  \nConcluding Observations \n In summary and conclusion, I would just re iterate that the broader measures of the \nlabor market show less improvement than the more narrowly constructed U-3 measure of \nunemployment, which is widely followed and has been used in the Federal Reserve’s forward guidance on policy.  The broader measures of unemployment are much higher than they were at their peaks following th e previous recession, and remain unusually high \nrelative to the traditional U-3 measure of unemp loyment.  If we take these measures as \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Thursday, February 6, 2014 at 5:45 PM Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY  * \n \n \n  \n \n 11providing important complements to the U-3 measure of labor market slack, then we \nmust acknowledge and address an even larg er amount of remaining labor market slack \nthan the narrower measure indicates.   \nThis is, of course, a discussion of data  points and measures, but we cannot lose \nsight of matters of human to ll and potential, as well.  \n The implications for monetary policy s eem clear – if one believes some of the \nsignals from the broader measures of labor market slack that I ha ve walked you through \ntoday, then we remain very far from historical  average levels of la bor utilization.  As a \nresult, I firmly believe that monetary po licymakers should remain quite patient in \nremoving accommodation.  This perspective, I would add, is consistent with the recent FOMC statement indicating that the Committ ee expects short-term interest rates to \nremain low well past the time that the unemp loyment rate declines below the 6.5 percent \nthreshold.  This policy position is  also bolstered by the fact that  the inflation rate has been \nwell below what most forecasters expected a nd well below the Fed’s 2 percent target.   \nIn short, in light of too much labor market slack and very low inflation rates, \nmonetary policy should continue  to be highly accommodative. \nThank you.  \n                                                  \n \nNOTES: \n \n1 See http://www.federalreserve.gov/ne wsevents/press/monetary/20140129a.htm \n \n2 For inflation measured by the Personal Consumption Expenditures index or PCE. \n \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Thursday, February 6, 2014 at 5:45 PM Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY  * \n \n \n  \n \n 12                                                                                                                                                 \n3 See Table A-15 in the BLS’s monthly Employment Situation reports, which shows these broader \nmeasures of underutilization.  BLS definitions include the following: “Persons marginally attached to the \nlabor force are those who currently are neither working nor looking for work but indicate that they want \nand are available for a job and have  looked for work sometime in the past 12 months.  Discouraged \nworkers, a subset of the marginally  attached, have given a job-market  related reason for not currently \nlooking for work.  Persons employed part time for economic reasons are those who want and are available \nfor full-time work but have had to settle for a part-time schedule.” \n \n4 In January 1994, the Current Population Survey was redesigned to obtain more accurate and \ncomprehensive information.  Among the biggest change s were changes to the definitions of discouraged \nand part-time workers. \n \n5 The technical notes in the BLS’s monthly Employment Situation define unemployed as follows:  “People \nare classified as unemployed if they  meet all of the following criteria:  they had no employment during the \nreference week; they were available for work at th at time; and they made specific efforts to find \nemployment sometime during the 4-week period ending with the reference week.”  The reference week is \n“generally the calendar week that cont ains the 12th day of the month.”   \n \n6 When available, the figures quoted are the seasona lly-adjusted figures which appear in the Employment \nSituation published by the BLS.  The BLS does not seasonally adjust the figures for discouraged workers \nand other marginally attached worker s, so these quoted figures are not seasonally adjusted.  However, for \nuse in Figure 1, the two series have been seasonally adjusted to appear with the seasonally-adjusted series \nfor unemployed and part-time workers which have strong seasonal components.   \n \n7 A BLS “Issues in Labor Statistics” publication from 2009 notes characteristics of  the marginally attached: \nsee   http://www.bls.gov/opub/ils/pdf/opbils74.pdf , especially Table 2. \n  \n8 The BLS definition of Part-Time for Economic Reasons is as follows: “Refers to those who worked 1 to \n34 hours during the reference week for an economic reason such as slack work or unfavorable business conditions, inability to find full-time work, or seasonal declines in demand.” \n \n9 The current U-6 rate was 13.1 percent for December, in contrast to 8.8 percen t in December of 2007.",

Rosengren \nPresident & Chief Executive Officer \nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston \n \n \nThe Boston Economic Club \n \n \nBoston, Massachusetts  \nFebruary 26, 2014 \n \n \n______________________________________________________________________________ \n  \nIt is great to be back to speak at the Boston Economic Club, and I do so with my usual \nnote – that the views that I will express are mine , and do not necessarily re flect the views of my \ncolleagues on the Federal Open Market Committ ee (FOMC) or the Federal Reserve’s Board of \nGovernors.  \nI am particularly happy to have the oppor tunity to speak to this group given the \nabundance of questions and debates surrounding th e economy these days.  Indeed, much of the \nrecent discussion among economists who focus on the near-term economic outlook seems to be \n\n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, February 26, 2014 at 12:30 PM Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY  * \n \n   \n \n2 \n centering on whether weakness in re cent incoming data reflects just the severe winter weather or \nmore fundamental trends.  While locally we have ha d a notable spate of snowstorms, that is to be \nexpected – New England tends to  experience snowstorms in the winter.  If, however, misery \nloves company, we have had plenty of companions  this year.  What is unusual this winter, \naccording to many retailers, is that they can usua lly count on bad weather in the Northeast being \noffset by good weather in the Mid-Atlantic and S outh – but that has not worked out this year. \nThe most recent employment report is a good example of the difficulty encountered in \ndiscerning trends from anomalies (such as weather).  Payroll employment grew by a \ndisappointing 113,000 jobs in January, well below expectations.  December was similarly \ndisappointing, with the addition of only 75,000 jobs.1  The average of 94,000 jobs a month over \nthe past two months stands in sharp contrast to th e average of 256,000 jobs added in October and \nNovember.2    \nSince the February survey took place over the week when snowstorms resulted in \nwidespread disruptions up and dow n the East Coast, it is likely that the February employment \nreport released next month will also be difficult to interpret – given that the movement in the \ndata was certainly influen ced by Mother Nature.   \nIn short, economists and policymakers face th e difficulty of determining whether recent \nemployment reports are just anomalies induced by things like weather, or  reflect a slowing trend \nin the economy – a pattern that we have certain ly seen repeatedly since the onset of this \nrecovery.  In my view, this uncer tainty provides an additional str ong rationale for taking a patient \napproach to removing the monetary policy acco mmodation that the Federal Reserve has been \ndeploying. \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, February 26, 2014 at 12:30 PM Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY  * \n \n   \n \n3 \n  However, today I plan to discuss another ju stification for a patient approach to removing \nmonetary policy accommodation.  Th at reason is that the tradit ional measure of unemployment \nprobably understates the degree of “slack” remaining in labor  markets and the economy more \ngenerally.  My colleagues and I at the Boston Fed have been studying and speaking about these \nissues, and I would like to return to and e xpand upon them with you this afternoon, given their \ncentral importance at this point in time. \nWhile the unemployment rate has recently fa llen to 6.6 percent, there remain 7.3 million \nAmericans who want full-time work but are curr ently working part time – a number that is \ndramatically higher than the 4.6 million workers in  that situation in December of 2007 as the \nfinancial crisis and recession were taking hold.  In  contrast to the observable decline in labor \nforce participation – which prompts a debate abou t whether workers remain qualified and willing \nto work – this “part time for economic reasons” group involves workers who currently have jobs.  \nThey have the skills to do the work, and they stat e that they would prefer to work full time.  So \nthese individuals likely reflect a large supply of underu tilized workers – an assessment that is \nsupported by other indicators of slack labor mark ets like the very low inflation rate, and very \nslow growth in la bor compensation. \n \nRecent Economic Data \n While the payroll employment numbers have been disappointing of late, there has been \nbetter news in the household survey.  The unemplo yment rate declined to  6.6 percent in January, \nand in contrast to many previous declines, this recent decline reflects more jobs rather than a \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, February 26, 2014 at 12:30 PM Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY  * \n \n   \n \n4 \n smaller labor force.  As Figure 1  shows, the unemployment rate was 7 percent as recently as last \nNovember, so we continue to enjoy noticeabl e improvement in this standard measure. \n The horizontal green line shows the 6.5 percen t threshold that was first included in the \nFOMC’s policy statement for the December 2012 committee meeting, when the unemployment rate was 7.9 percent.  This threshold was used in the form of guidance that the committee would \nnot raise short-term interest ra tes as long as the unemployment  rate was at or above the 6.5 \npercent threshold.  It is importa nt to recall that the Committee ma de the distinction between this \nbenchmark as a threshold  – i.e., a point at which discussion about policy options should begin – \nversus a trigger  – a point at which a specific policy acti on would automatically begin.  It also \nincluded other markers that would guide the discussion, including inflation and inflation \nexpectations.   \nAs the unemployment rate has fallen, the Committee’s forward guidance has been \namended to state that it likely will be appropriate to maintain very low short-term interest rates \nwell past the time that the unemploym ent rate declines below 6.5 percent.\n3  This reflects the \nassessment that while the unemployment rate has approached the threshold, there still remains significant slack in labor markets, actual infl ation remains well below the Federal Reserve’s 2 \npercent target, and inflation expe ctations remain stable.  In my view, this is completely \nconsistent with the FOMC’s inte nded interpretation of  the 6.5 percent marker as a threshold, not \na trigger.   \n The crux of my talk today is this: Wh en we reach 6.5 percent unemployment, the \neconomy will still be characterized by significant labor market slack.  I will offer several ways of \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, February 26, 2014 at 12:30 PM Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY  * \n \n   \n \n5 \n looking at this, including histor ical perspectives on the level of unemployment, as well as \nadditional measures of labor market slack. \nWith regard to historical perspective, as the green line shows, the 6.5 percent threshold \nwas set at a level higher than the highest une mployment rate reached during the 2001 recession.  \nI would add that it is well above my own estim ate of “full employment, ” which is 5.25 percent \nunemployment.  So the 6.5 percent threshold was set conservatively, to essentially serve as a \npoint where the Fed’s monetary policy committee w ould begin to focus on a much broader set of \neconomic variables in order to consider whether it was appropriate to begin raising short-term \ninterest rates. \n Figure 2  provides an indication of how long it might  take to reach my estimate of the full \nemployment level of unemployment – 5.25 percen t – under two different assumptions about the \nevolution of the unemployment rate.  The firs t path assumes that the unemployment rate \ncontinues to decline at the same rate it has sin ce unemployment reached 10 percent.  This simple \nextrapolation (the dotted line) shows that we would reach my estimate of full employment by \nmid-2016.   \n A very similar result arises in the second s cenario (the dashed line), which assumes that \na simple Okun’s Law4  holds and that GDP will grow at 3 percent for the next few years, \nsomewhat above my 2 percent estimate of the ec onomy’s potential growth rate.  Of course, this \nscenario assumes that the unemployment rate is currently a good measure of labor market slack – \nand assumes that as the economy continues to improve, there will not be a large inflow of \nworkers who were waiting for stronger employmen t prospects before entering the workforce or \nmoving from part-time to full-time employment.5 \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, February 26, 2014 at 12:30 PM Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY  * \n \n   \n \n6 \n  Unfortunately, Figure 3  provides one reason to believe there is significant labor market \nslack not fully captured by the st andard unemployment rate.  A broader measure of labor market \nunderutilization is the U- 6 measure of unemployment produced by the Bureau of Labor Statistics \n(the BLS).  The U-6 measure includes the wide ly reported U-3 unemployment measure, but also \nincludes workers who are “marginally attached” to  the workforce (that is, who looked for work \nin the past year but not the past 4 weeks) and individuals working part time for economic \nreasons.   \nWhile there is always a difference between  U-3 and U-6, as there are always some \nmarginally attached and part- time workers in the economy, the spread between the U-3 and U-6 \nmeasures of unemployment has increased dramatically  since the start of the financial crisis.   To \nreturn to full utilization of labor as measured by this broade r indicator, we will need stronger \neconomic growth – which would pull workers out of unemployment into employment – but we will also need sufficient demand to see the re-emp loyment of some of those marginally attached \nto the workforce and the conversion of many part-time workers to full-time workers. \n \nPart Time for Economic Reasons \n Figure 4  highlights the data on persons who are working part time for economic reasons.  \nThe left panel shows that 7.3 million Americans ar e working part time but would prefer full-time \nemployment.  While the number working part time  for economic reasons is down from a peak of \napproximately 9 million Americans after the rece ssion, it remains dramatically higher than was \nexperienced from 1994 until the financial crisis, and, in fact, remains well above the past few \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, February 26, 2014 at 12:30 PM Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY  * \n \n   \n \n7 \n times when the most commonly used measure of  unemployment stood at or near 6.5 percent.  \nThe right panel shows that rough ly 5 percent of the labor for ce includes workers who are part \ntime for economic reasons.   \nThe BLS employment survey includes detaile d questions on the st atus of part-time \nworkers, and as such is able to provide additi onal context.  For example, the survey reports \n“slack work or business conditions” as the r eason underlying the largest category of people \nworking part time for economic reasons.  These are people who would be working full time if \nthere were sufficient demand, but firms have reduced  their hours because of business conditions.   \nFigure 5  shows that these 4.4 million workers account for roughly 3 percent of the labor force.  \nNotably, the numbers in Figure 4 and 5 remain  much higher than prior to the recession. \n Figure 6  shows the second-largest category of workers whose status is part-time for \neconomic reasons – those who could only find part-time work.  About 2.6 million Americans currently can only find part-time work.  This series  does not show the same declines as those that \nhave reduced hours because of slack business co nditions.  And while the current reading for \nthese part-time workers is at an elevated level, it is not as dramatic as for those whose reduced \nhours stem from slack business conditions.  \n Figure 7  provides the numbers working part ti me for economic reasons, broken out by \nindustry classification.  The wholes ale and retail trade and the le isure and hospitality industries \nhave the largest number of individuals worki ng part time for economic reasons.  Both are \nindustries that one might expect  to be significantly impacted by a slow recovery – but also \nindustries that should be cap able of adding hours for work ers as business improves. \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, February 26, 2014 at 12:30 PM Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY  * \n \n   \n \n8 \n  Figure 8  shows that being part time for econom ic reasons is a problem for those \ngenerally thought to be of “prime working age”  and not just the youngest  and oldest workers. \nSuch workers typically demonstrate strong attachme nt to the labor force, with fewer spells of \nunemployment and less tendency to work part tim e.  Prime working-ag e individuals follow a \npattern quite consistent with the overall figures shown in Figure 4. \nFigure 9  brings in a consideration of race and ethnicity.6  White workers show the \ngreatest decline from the recession peaks am ong workers who are part time for economic \nreasons.  Black or African American  workers have actually shown no decline in this measure, \nwhile workers of Hispanic or Latino ethnicity ha ve seen some improvement.  However, the slow \nrecovery has not only resulted in very elevated  minority unemployment rates, but also made it \nmore difficult to move from part-time to full-time employment. \nOverall, I see these charts pr oviding evidence that there remain s significant slack in labor \nmarkets, above and beyond the slack usually repr esented by the standard unemployment (or U-3) \nrate.  Observers of the economy and labor mark ets have been debating whether marginally \nattached workers are likely to return to the wo rkforce – whether they left because they are \n(perhaps temporarily) discouraged, lack requisite job skills, or ar e less willing to work.  This \ndebate suggests some uncertainty about the degr ee to which labor force participation rates will \nactually improve.   \nHowever, the labor market slack that is reve aled by the large numbers working part time \nfor economic reasons is different .  Employers have hired thes e workers (so they have the \nnecessary skills), and they are available to work – but economic condi tions have not been \nsufficiently robust to convert thei r part-time work to full-time work.  This may indicate that the \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, February 26, 2014 at 12:30 PM Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY  * \n \n   \n \n9 \n true overall slack in the labor markets is better captured by a portfolio of the unemployment \nmeasures, including the U-6 measure, rather than  only the more traditional and widely reported \nU-3 measure.7 \n \nOther Indications of Labor Market Slack \nAnother indication of what I believe to be signi ficant labor market slack is the absence of \ninflationary pressures.  Figure 10  shows the Summary of Economi c Projections for inflation \nprovided by the presidents and gove rnors within the Federal Reserve System.  The forecasts for \n2013 inflation, made in 2011 and 2012, significantly overestimated how quickly inflation would \nreturn to the Federal Reserve’s 2 per cent target.  The 1.1 percent inflation8 for 2013 was outside \nthe range of earlier forecasts, and remains well below the 2 percent inflation target set by the \nFOMC. \nFigure 11  shows that the 2 percent growth rates of wages and salaries and of total \ncompensation are well below levels experienced pr ior to the most recent re cession.  If some labor \nmarkets were already tightening, we  would expect to observe more  of an upward trend in wages \nand salaries and total compensation.  Figure 12  shows that there is little evidence of \ncompensation pressures, even when viewed by varying occupations. \nThe evidence provided by prices and compen sation corroborate my argument that there \ncontinues to be significant slack in  labor markets.  The absence of pricing pressure is consistent \nwith the still-elevated number of unemployed work ers, as well as the ve ry elevated number of \nworkers who are part time for economic reasons. \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, February 26, 2014 at 12:30 PM Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY  * \n \n   \n \n10 \n Concluding Observations \nAs the unemployment rate falls and appro aches the 6.5 percent th reshold, the Federal \nReserve needs to make an assessment of the degr ee of remaining labor market slack as it sets \nmonetary policy.  I believe the elevated numbe r of workers who are part time for economic \nreasons, the still-high unemployment  rate, and the very low inflati on rate are all consistent with \nsignificant slack in labor markets.  Such conditi ons call for a very patient approach to removing \nmonetary policy accommodation, particularly give n the softness in recent economic data.   \nIt is vitally important that labor markets co ntinue to improve.  M onetary policy should \ncontinue to be accommodative, supporting a re turn to full employment, given the very low \ninflation rates. \n Thank you. \n \n  \n                                                            \n \nNOTES:  \n \n1 The initial report of 74,000 jobs has been revised upward to 75,000. \n \n2 Payroll employment increased by 237,000 jobs in October and 274,000 in November for an average of 256,000 \nover the two months. \n \n3 See the committee statement at http://www.federalreserve.gov/newsev ents/press/monetary/20140129a.htm .  \n \n4 Former Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke described Okun’s Law in a 2012 speech as follows: “About 50 years ago, the \neconomist and presidential adviser Arthur Okun identified a rule of thumb that has come to be known as Okun’s \nLaw. That rule of thumb describes the observed relationship between changes in the unemployment rate and the \ngrowth rate of real gross domestic product (GDP). Okun noted that, because of ongoing increases in the size of the \nlabor force and in the level of productivity, real GDP growth close to the rate of growth of its potential is normally \nrequired just to hold the unemployment rate steady. To reduce the unemployment rate, therefore, the economy must \ngrow at a pace above its potential. Mo re specifically, according to currently accepted versions of Okun’s Law, to \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, February 26, 2014 at 12:30 PM Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY  * \n \n   \n \n11 \n                                                                                                                                                                                                    \nachieve a 1 percentage point decline in the unemployment rate in the cour se of a year, real GDP must grow \napproximately 2 percentage points faster than the rate of growth of potential GDP over that period. So, for \nillustration, if the potential rate of GDP growth is 2 perc ent, Okun’s Law says that GDP must grow at about a 4 \npercent rate for one year to achieve a 1 percentage point reduction in the rate of unemployment.” http://www.federal reserve.gov/newsevents/s peech/bernanke20120326a.pdf   \n \n5 It is important to note that there have been large errors in Okun’s Law recently reflecting periods where the \neconomy has grown around its potential but the unemployment rate has fallen substantially.  \n \n6 The BLS Table A-27 presents the follo wing classifications: ‘White,’ ‘Black or African American ,’ ‘Asian,’ and \n‘Hispanic or Latino ethnicity.’  (Data ar e not presented for all races.)

Rosengren \nPresident & Chief Executive Officer \nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston \n \n \nHusson University \n \n \nBangor, Maine  \nApril 15, 2014 \n \n \n______________________________________________________________________________ \n \nIt is always a pleasure to retu rn to the state of Maine, wher e I spent four wonderful years \nas an undergraduate at Colby College, and where I first developed my interest in economics.  \nAround New England today, April 15, we are ma rking one year since the tragic Boston \nMarathon bombings.  For all those who were affected, our thoughts are very much with you. \nTurning to my topic today, let me say that when driving up I-95 and crossing the bridge \nover the Piscataqua River I always like seeing the sign that says, “Maine, the way life should \nbe.”  Unfortunately, it has been some time si nce anyone would characterize the U.S. economy’s \n\n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Tuesday, April 15, 2014 at  4:10 PM Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY  * \n \n   \n \n2 \n performance as “the way life should be.”  By this  I mean that it has been more than six years \nsince the beginning of the last re cession, and yet we still have a national unemployment rate of \n6.7 percent, and the PCE inflati on rate is less than 1 percent1 – well below the 2 percent inflation \ntarget set by the Federal Reserve’s policymaking body, the Federal Open Market Committee or FOMC.   \nOf course I would add that, as always, the views I express today are my own, not \nnecessarily those of my colleagues on the Board of Governors or the FOMC. \nActually, the widely reported unemployment ra te understates the severi ty of the problem.  \nThe broader labor-market indicators that incl ude workers who are “part time for economic \nreasons” and workers who have looked for a job in the past year but not in the past four weeks – \n“marginally attached” workers – remain unusually elevated by historical standards.  These \nindicators quantify what many Am ericans all too readily observe around them – that significant \nproblems in labor markets persist even  at this stage of the recovery. \nAll this means we have a U.S. economy th at still requires an unusually accommodative \nstance of monetary policy.  At the same time, the economy has indeed been gradually improving.   The most recent labor market report indicated that the U.S. economy produced 192,000 jobs in \nMarch, and there were some positive revisions for th e data in previous months.  So, after some \nweaker data in the winter months, these labor ma rket data suggest that there will hopefully be \nbroader improvement in an array of economic i ndicators this spring.  In fact, most economists \nexpect growth around 3 percent over the rest of this year – a forecast that is quite consistent with \nmy own. \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Tuesday, April 15, 2014 at  4:10 PM Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY  * \n \n   \n \n3 \n As the economy has gradually improved, the Federal Reserve has made adjustments to \nmonetary policy.  In light of the weak economy, and with the federal funds rate essentially \npinned at zero, the Federal Reserve has been st imulating the economy using alternative methods, \nprimarily by making large-scale purchases of longer-term assets such as Treasury bonds and \nmortgage-backed securities.  Thes e purchases are expected to k eep longer-term interest rates \nlower than they would otherwise be, thus stim ulating the economy when  we can no longer do so \nby lowering the funds rate.  Since the beginning of this year, we have been reducing the size of \nthe monthly asset purchase program, and this gradua l tapering is likely to continue as long as the \neconomy’s gradual improvement proceeds.   \nThe second adjustment to monetary policy involves how the FOMC communicates future \npolicy direction, commonly referred to as “for ward guidance.”  When the economy was far from \nwhere it needed to be, the FOMC provided fairly specific guidance – that short-term rates would \nremain low until we had seen significant improvement in labor markets – improvement that could be proxied by seeing the unemployment rate fall to the 6.5 percent threshold.   \nHowever, such a threshold does not provide much by way of forward guidance as we \napproach it.  With a gradually improving la bor market, we could be  below the threshold \nrelatively soon.  This scenario led the Federa l Reserve to make an adjustment to its \ncommunications at the March FO MC meeting, suggesting they w ould hold short-term rates at \nvery low levels “for a considerable time after the asset purchase program  ends, especially if \nprojected inflation continues to run below the Committee's 2 percen t longer-run goal, and \nprovided that longer-term inflation e xpectations remain well anchored.”\n2   \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Tuesday, April 15, 2014 at  4:10 PM Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY  * \n \n   \n \n4 \n Admittedly, this rather qualitative forward guidance is somewhat less specific than the \nprevious forward guidance involving the 6.5 perc ent threshold.  My personal view is that, \nideally, forward guidance should, for the time be ing, remain qualitative but increasingly be \nlinked to progress in achieving our dual ma ndate based on incoming economic data.  In \nparticular, I believe the FOMC’s forward guidan ce should be consistent with keeping interest \nrates at their very low level unt il we are within one year of re aching full employment and our 2 \npercent inflation target – and the guidance could explicitly state that intention.   \nParenthetically, I would note that on a quarterly basis th e Federal Reserve publishes a \nsummary of the economic projections (SEP) made by Federal Reserve Board members and \nFederal Reserve Bank presidents.  The SEP does give information on the expectations of the \nCommittee regarding when the economy would be reaching the dual mandate goals.3   \nToday I plan to discuss why, as we gradua lly do approach achieving our dual mandate \ngoals of maximum sustainable employment a nd price stability, the Fed’s forward guidance \nshould be increasingly focused on how quickly we expect to make progress on inflation that is \nwell below our target, and on the si gnificant underutilizatio n of labor resources that persists well \nafter the official end of the recession.  \nI would like to see a more produc tive state of affairs, where market participants are more \nattentive to the incoming data and how the data fi t (or do not fit) with the expectations in the \nforward guidance.  In this way, market particip ants would be focused more on data and less on \nchanges in the setting of monetary policy tools.   I would also like to see much more focus by \nmarket participants on a broader set of measur es, such as the U-6 measure of unemployment \nwhich captures broader utiliz ation of labor resources.  \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Tuesday, April 15, 2014 at  4:10 PM Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY  * \n \n   \n \n5 \n Recent Developments \n Let me begin by walking you through some charts that reflect the economy’s recent \ndevelopments. \nFigure 1 provides the path of the unemployment rate relative to the Federal Reserve’s \nearlier stated threshold of 6.5 pe rcent.  The figure provides visual  support for the fact that the \nforward guidance needed to change.  Once we reached a point where we could be below the \nthreshold with one or two fa vorable employment reports, th e guidance was no longer providing \nmuch information about our potential actions be yond one or two FOMC meetings.  Keep in mind \nthat one purpose of forward guidance is to rest rain longer-term market in terest rates to support \nthe struggling economy by promising to keep the short-term interest rates the Fed can control at \nvery low levels.  As such, there was not much  to be gained by maintaining our threshold \nlanguage. \n An alternative would be to frame forwar d guidance in relation to achieving the goals \nconsistent with our dual mandate, within suggest ed timeframes.  For example, the FOMC could \npromise to keep short-term interest rates at very low levels until the economy is within one year of reaching full employment and 2 percent inflation, based on the trends in incoming data and an \nassumption about how they will continue.  Such  guidance would hinge on how far the economy \nremains from levels consistent with our dual ma ndate and on the assumed forecasted speed at \nwhich inflation and unemployment are expected to converge to those values.   \nClearly, such guidance would be highly dependent on the incoming data, and what the \ndata suggest about how quickly the economy will r each full employment and 2 percent inflation.  \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Tuesday, April 15, 2014 at  4:10 PM Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY  * \n \n   \n \n6 \n Given the uncertainty about the future course of the economy, and about the estimate of what \nconstitutes full employment, such guidance coul d not be precise.  No r would it provide the \ncalendar certainty that many financial participants  would prefer.  However, these drawbacks are \npreferable to providing forward guidance that is  overly specific, and th at does not take into \naccount the uncertainties – because such guidanc e would risk the possibility of essentially \n“locking in” mis-timed policy moves. \n Figure 2 illustrates the sensitivity of a possi ble “lift-off” of the short-term rates to \ndifferent assumptions about when we reach fu ll employment.  My own estimate of full \nemployment is around 5.25 percent; for other economists it can be different.  However, the figure \nshows that for three different paths for the unemp loyment rate – one consistent with 3 percent \nGDP growth, one consistent with  2.5 percent growth, and one that mirrors the trend decline in \nunemployment over the past four years – the calendar date estimat e for reaching full employment \nwould be quite different.  This  range of outcomes shows that differing assumptions about the \neconomy can generate very different dates for reaching my definition of full employment – \nanywhere between April 2016 a nd January 2020.  With the uncer tainties surrounding anyone’s \nforecast, and with the ambiguity in the data we ha ve seen to date, any of these forecasts represent \nplausible outcomes.   \n Figure 3 highlights a challenge with the in flation side of the Federal Reserve’s dual \nmandate.  Despite the fall in the unemployment rate, the core inflation rate is currently 1.1 \npercent, which is well below our 2 percent targ et.  A model of inflati on used at the Federal \nReserve Bank of Boston takes into  account labor market “slack” a nd an expectation that inflation \nwill return to 2 percent. I would point out that  the model we use generates only a very slow \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Tuesday, April 15, 2014 at  4:10 PM Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY  * \n \n   \n \n7 \n return to a 2 percent inflation ra te.  Other models may converge to 2 percent more quickly.  Still, \nwhile the eventual return to 2 percent inflation is  in the forecast, I see little evidence in the \ncurrent data suggesting that we are yet on this modest path to achieving the targeted 2 percent \ninflation rate. \n \nUncertainty  \nWhile some uncertainty around forecasts is  a given, currently the uncertainty is \ncompounded by the unusual behavior of some ke y economic relationships  since the financial \ncrisis.  For example, a strong housing rebound is an  important component of most forecasts that \nsuggest that GDP growth will be stronger than th e economy’s “potential” rate over the next two \nyears.  The housing sector is expected to impr ove further because interest rates remain low by \nhistorical standards, housing pr ices have been rising, more workers are being employed, and \nstock market wealth has increased.   \nThese housing sector factors should all make positive contributions to stronger GDP \ngrowth.  However, while most forecasters expe ct housing to improve, the path of improvement \ndiffers greatly among forecasters.  This is shown in  Figure 4.  While the consensus forecast is for \nrecent trends to continue improving, there are sign ificant differences in the forecasts related to \nthe speed of the improvement. \n Figure 5 shows one of the challenges in pr edicting housing starts.  While the U.S. \npopulation has grown at quite a consistent, smooth rate – with no visible impact from the \nfinancial crisis and Great Recession – the same is not true for the activity we call “household \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Tuesday, April 15, 2014 at  4:10 PM Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY  * \n \n   \n \n8 \n formation.”  Consider the example, often cited, of recent college graduates returning to their \nparents’ home after graduation rath er than getting their own apartment.  In part, the slowing in \nthe household formation trend line – you see it flattening, compared to population, beginning \naround 2007 – reflects many indivi duals not creating new house holds because of economic \ndifficulties stemming from the financial crisis and recession.  Parenthetically, the chart also \nshows a pickup in the household formation rate dur ing the housing boom that preceded the crisis. \nBut after the crisis, the rate of increase  is clearly slowing relative to population. \nFigure 6 shows even more vividly how differe nt household formation has been since the \nlast recession (shaded in gray) and the financial crisis that preceded it.  Some view this change in \nhousehold formation behavior as temporary, an d if so, suggest we should see significant \nincreases in household formation as economic problems subside.  Alternatively, household \nformation behavior may bear sufficient scar s from the recession and the slow recovery, \nindicating that the crea tion of households will now follow a shallower path.  Unfortunately, at \nthis point either assumption could play out, a nd we may need to wait for more data and the \npassage of time to determine how lasting the im pact of the recession is on household formation. \n Household formation is not the only economic  indicator to show anomalous changes, and \nI will share a few of them in a moment.  But to address the general issue of uncertainty, I would \nsuggest the uncertainty is heightened  just now in part due to the ve ry real possibility that typical \neconomic patterns have been altered by the fina ncial crisis and Great Recession, their lead-up, \nand their aftermath.   \nIn short, a variety of economi c data have behaved differen tly since the recession.  These \npattern shifts may reflect changes in how hous eholds and firms will react as the economy \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Tuesday, April 15, 2014 at  4:10 PM Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY  * \n \n   \n \n9 \n improves.  It is possible that pr evious patterns will be re-estab lished as the economy normalizes.  \nAlternatively, “scarring” from the recession may have longer-la sting impacts if households, \nfirms, and labor markets persist in behaving in wa ys that differ from historical patterns.  This \nuncertainty makes it particularly difficult to pr edict exactly what “normal” will look like – and \nwhy specific forward guidance in monetary po licy becomes difficult as the economy gradually \nimproves. \nBeyond the anomaly of household formation, I would note three other such shifts in \neconomic behavior since the reces sion suggested in the data. \nAt non-financial corporate businesses, the le vel of checkable deposits and currency has \nbeen growing rapidly, as Figure 7 shows.  This  could represent a form of “scarring” from the \nrecession if it means that firms are less confiden t in raising funds from the market or financial \nintermediaries, and are now essentially more risk-averse and banking cas h.  While some risk \naversion is clearly vital, a growing degree of risk aversion among non-financial corporate \nbusinesses may signal subdued investment behavior by firms – behavior that would, on net, lead \nto slower economic growth.  \nSimilarly, Figure 8 suggests that households , too, may have been “scarred” by the \nrecession and may now be driven more by a higher  quotient of fear than before.  While holding \ncash reserves for unexpected events is prudent, substantially increasing cash holdings may be \nconsistent with more risk aversion, which, in turn , may also be reflected in restrained consumer \nspending – a key component of the country’s GDP.   \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Tuesday, April 15, 2014 at  4:10 PM Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY  * \n \n   \n \n10 \n Second, as I have explored in other talks,  broader gauges of the labor markets are \nshowing sizable numbers of Americans working onl y part time for economic reasons, as shown \nin Figure 9.  Also, Figure 10 highlig hts the important issue of long- term unemployment.  In sum, \nit is possible that the labor market may have been  “scarred” in important and lasting ways by the \nrecession and painfully slow recovery. \nAnother source of uncertainty for the U.S. economy is its links ove rseas.  Of course, \ninternational economic forces are only indirect ly impacted by fiscal and monetary policy \ndecisions in the U.S.  My own assumption is th at Europe, and the emerging economies, are likely \nto continue to gradually improve.   \nHowever, such a forecast could change signi ficantly if the baseline assumptions about \nEurope and emerging economies prove to be wrong.  Figure 11 shows bank exposures to \nemerging markets.4  While U.S. banks have a sizabl e exposure to emerging markets, the \nexposure of the Euro area banks is almost triple  that of U.S. banks.  The United Kingdom has a \nparticularly significant exposure (despite having a much smaller economy than that of the United \nStates), given that some of the U.K. banks ar e particularly active in emerging markets.   \nMuch of the exposure of the Euro area banks involves emerging European economies.  \nWere problems in Ukraine, for example, to beco me much more acute, Europe would potentially \nbe impacted by its energy dependence on Russi a and also through European bank exposure to \nemerging European economies.  Given that Europ ean banks are still recovering from a severe \nEuropean recession, such a shock – while unlik ely and not my prediction – would be most \nunwelcome.5   \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Tuesday, April 15, 2014 at  4:10 PM Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY  * \n \n   \n \n11 \n  My forecast for the U.S. economy assumes the impact of foreign linkages will be \nrelatively benign.  However, the risk of forei gn shocks is still large enough to remain a \nsignificant downside risk to the forecast.   Wh ile I expect the economy to grow at roughly 3 \npercent over the next two years, th ese and other uncertainties suggest that as always, it is best to \nbe quite humble about forecasting precision. \n \nConcluding Observations \n Recent incoming data continue to be consis tent with a slowly improving economy.  This \nimprovement is allowing the Federal Reserve to  slowly pare back a sset purchases and to \ngradually become less precise in  our forward guidance.  Howeve r, I believe there are several \nreasons to be cautious and patient before retu rning monetary policy to a more normal, less \naccommodative stance. \n While the economy has gradually improve d, 6.7 percent unemployment and inflation \naround 1 percent remain far from normal economic conditions.  And the broader measures of underemployment tell an even more sobering story.  Furthermore, it is important to keep in mind \nthat negative shocks to the economy will be much more difficult to offset with monetary policy \nthan positive shocks.   \nAll told, in my view, mone tary policy should remain highly accommodative until the \ndomestic and global economies are on more solid footing. \n Thank you.  \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Tuesday, April 15, 2014 at  4:10 PM Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY  * \n \n   \n \n12 \n                                                             \n \nNOTES: \n \n1 The most recent figures for PCE inflation an d Core PCE are 0.9% and 1.1%, respectively. \n \n2 The full statement is available at http://www.federal reserve.gov/newsevents/press/monetary/20140319a.html.  \n \n3 See the SEP at http://www.federalreserve.gov/ monetarypolicy/files/fomcprojtabl20140319.pdf \n \n4 More detailed information on banks’ exposure to emerging market economies, including lists of reporting \ncountries and emerging market economies  and an interactive data tool, can be found on the Bank for International \nSettlements (BIS) website, in the section on international banking statistics – http://www.bis.org/statistics/about_banking_stats.htm -- and in its publication BIS Quarterly  Review  \n(http://www.bis.org/publ/qtrpdf/r_qt1403.htm). \n \n5 For European reporting countries, roughly two-thirds of the emerging European economies exposure is located in \nPoland, the Czech Repub lic, Russia, and Turkey.  ",

I appreciate the opportunity to take part in your Cycle of \nEconomic Lectures, and to be here with so many practitioners from the region.   \nToday, I would like to suggest some context fo r the Federal Reserve’s forward guidance and \nlarge-scale asset purchases (LSAPs), discuss some of the impacts of those policies, and provide my \nown view of how these tools might evolve if the U.S. economy continues to slowly recover and the \nhigh degree of monetary accommodation can be gradually removed. \nAs always, I would note that my comments reflect my own views,  not necessarily those of my \ncolleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee or the Federal Reserve’s Board of Governors. \n\n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL \nMonday, June 9, 2014 at 1:30pm U.S. Eastern Time and 11:30 a.m. local time  in Guatemala City, or upon delivery \n \n \n \n 3While forward guidance and LSAPs have been activ ely used in the United States in recent \nyears, I would suggest that a full assessment of the costs and benefits of these programs is still \nsomewhat premature at this time – since the Federa l Reserve has really only  recently begun a process \nthat will ultimately remove the hi gh degree of monetary accommodation that  is currently in place.  At \npresent, our asset pu rchases continue to add to accommodation, albeit in smaller and smaller \nincrements reflecting re cent policy decisions.  \n Allow me to briefly preview my conclusions today.   \nMy own view is that the “n ew” monetary tools – LSAPs and forward guidance – were \nessential.  Particularly impor tant, I believe, was the Federa l Reserve’s stated emphasis on doing what \nit would take  to generate an economic recovery, a nd on following through with actions that \ndemonstrated we were indeed willing to do what it took.   \nMany of these policies were introduced at a time when the U.S. economy was in the throes of \na significant recession – with the federal funds ra te at the zero lower bound – and clearly required \nmore accommodation from new monetary tools.  As you can see in Figure 1 , the Federal Reserve \nfollowed the first round in late 20081 with additional rounds of stimulus in 20102, 20113, and 20124 \n(still underway) as the economy c ontinued to underperform relative to expectations and historical \nnorms for recoveries.  \nThe LSAPs, Maturity Extension Program, a nd forward guidance policy tools lowered key \ninterest rates and, importantly, also played a role  in rebounding asset prices, such as U.S. housing \nvalues and stock prices.  Certainly we saw more sp ending in interest-sensitive sectors of the economy.  \nIn sum, our new tools were partly responsible for improved economic conditions and improved labor \nmarkets – trends that have proven effective enou gh that the Federal Reserve could begin gradually \nstepping back the degree of accommodation.   \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL \nMonday, June 9, 2014 at 1:30pm U.S. Eastern Time and 11:30 a.m. local time  in Guatemala City, or upon delivery \n \n \n \n 4In terms of the international view, I would say that while the U.S. has benefitted from these \npolicies, they were introduced at a time when many other economies were also lagging – including \nJapan, Europe, and many emerging economies.  The increased willingness of U.S. households to consume, and U.S. firms to invest, has helped gene rate a more robust export market to the U.S. – \ncertainly a more favorable market than would have prevailed if policies had not changed and the U.S. \neconomy had remained as subdued in outcomes as most forecasters expected at that time.  While our policies, in my view, have been  instrumental in achieving better economic \noutcomes, they are not without  challenges.  Allow me to  mention a few of these. \nFirst, because financial market pa rticipants factor in the expectat ion of future policy rates, the \nFed’s exit strategy is of great inte rest to them.  Uncertainty or mi sunderstanding about the contours of \nour exit has the potential to be problematic in both advanced and developing economies – as we were \nreminded a year ago – so effective and transparent communication has become even more important \nthan in the past.  This is not a traditional area of  expertise for most centra l banks, but we are making \nstrides and improving.   \nAs we learn how to better communicate our inte ntions about these new and less-tested tools, \nmarkets too have to learn and adjust – given th at our communication abou t these new tools, along \nwith the effects on the economy, are new to markets.   The period of adjustment on both sides has led \nto a few challenges, but appears to have evened out in recent months.  \nBut we should all acknowledge the possibility that this relative calm may be challenged in the \nfuture.  The eventual exit from very low intere st rates around much of the globe will also be \nunprecedented, and will thus hold challenges for communication and understanding.  Having said \nthat, I would observe that the care ful consideration of a ll of the aspects of the exit strategy provides \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL \nMonday, June 9, 2014 at 1:30pm U.S. Eastern Time and 11:30 a.m. local time  in Guatemala City, or upon delivery \n \n \n \n 5opportunities to consider a broader set of monetary policy tools, and how those tools impact financial \nstability along with inflation and unemployment. \n \nEconomic Conditions Leading to “QE3” \n   It is important to remember the economic context around the selection of policy tools in the \nfall of 2012 – popularly referred to as “QE3,” shor thand for a third round of quantitative easing.   \nFigure 2  shows private sector forecasts for U.S. r eal GDP growth in August of 2012.  The U.S. \neconomy grew just 1.5 percent in the second quarter of 2012,5 and the consensus expectation was that \nthe next several quarters were not likely to be significantly better.  The different paths projected by \naveraging the 10 highest and the 10 lowest foreca sts show that the outlook was clouded by a high \ndegree of uncertainty.  But again, both the consensus forecast and the pessimistic forecast were quite weak over the near term.    \nFigure 3  shows that private forecasters expected d eclines in the U.S. unemployment rate, but \nonly gradual declines consistent with slow progress toward full em ployment.  Notice the large gap \nbetween even the optimistic forecas t and my own estimate of full employment in the United States, \n5.25 percent, shown by the line near the bottom of  the chart.  With forecasters expecting \nunemployment to be above 7 percen t at the end of 2013, it was clear th at we were far from attaining \nnormal conditions in labor markets (even if one’s estimate of the full employment level of unemployment was somewhat higher than my own 5.25 percent).  \nSo in the fall of 2012, the case for additional mone tary stimulus was straightforward to me.   \nUnemployment was quite high, and it was likel y that inflation would undershoot the Federal \nReserve’s inflation target.  We were falling sh ort on both parts of the Federal Reserve’s “dual \nmandate,”\n6 so qualitatively speaking, the appropriate stance for monetary policy was clear. \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL \nMonday, June 9, 2014 at 1:30pm U.S. Eastern Time and 11:30 a.m. local time  in Guatemala City, or upon delivery \n \n \n \n 6As a result, in September of 2012,7 the monetary policymaking Federal Open Market \nCommittee, intending to increase policy accommod ation, undertook an additional program of monthly \npurchases of long-term mortgage-backed securities (MBS ).  In contrast to our previous asset purchase \nprograms, the Committee did not specify how long the purchases would continue or how much it \nwould buy in total.  This was a manifestation of bei ng willing to do “whatever it  takes.”  In addition, \nthe Committee statement emphasized that purchase s would continue if th e outlook for the labor \nmarket did not improve substantially.  The Matu rity Extension Program – through which the Federal \nReserve was extending the average maturity of its U.S. Treasury securities holdings8 – continued.  \nThese actions, declared the Committee’s policy stat ement, “will increase the Committee’s holdings of \nlonger-term securities by a bout $85 billion each month through the end of the year.”  \nIn December of 2012,9 it was announced that the open-ende d purchase program would include \npurchases of longer-term U.S. Treasury securities (once the Maturity Extension Program concluded at \nyear end), and the Committee attempted to clarify that  conditions in the labor market would determine \nthe length of the asset purchase program in their statement – saying that “this exceptionally low range \nfor the federal funds rate will be appropriate at least as long as th e unemployment rate remains above \n6.5 percent” and inflation and inflation expectati ons remain anchored. All in all, the open-ended \npurchase program, along with strong forward gui dance, made it clear that U.S. monetary \npolicymakers were determined to achieve signi ficant improvements in labor market conditions. \nA major source of the U.S. economy’s weakness at  that time had been the failure of the \nhousing market to rebound. In part, this was tied to  concerns that housing pr ices in many areas would \ncontinue to fall, damping the impetus to buy.  Figure 4  shows a standard forecast for U.S. housing \nprices in August 2012.  The figure shows that actual housing prices  fared much better than the \nforecast made prior to our monetary policy decision.   \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL \nMonday, June 9, 2014 at 1:30pm U.S. Eastern Time and 11:30 a.m. local time  in Guatemala City, or upon delivery \n \n \n \n 7Given that the cost of purchas ing a home is tied to long-term  interest rates, the Federal \nReserve’s accommodative monetary policy facilitate d some of the recovery in housing values.  \nIndeed, Figure 5  shows that low interest rates and higher housing prices provide d the driving force \nfor a greater number of housing st arts than had been forecast. \nOther interest-sensitive sectors, such as auto mobile purchases, were also helped by the lower \ninterest rates generated by the Federa l Reserve’s policy stance and actions.  Figure 6  shows that U.S. \nauto sales ended up much stronger than fo recasters had expected in August of 2012. \nFigure 7  shows that U.S. unemployment actually fell more quickly than expected by \nforecasters in August of 2012.  In my view, the unconventional use of forward guidance and LSAPs \ndid contribute to a faster improvement in la bor markets than forecasters were expecting.10  However, \nthe exact mechanism for this faster  recovery is still a source of some debate; since labor markets \nshowed improvement fairly quickly, but the growth in aggregate spending dur ing this period remained \nfrustratingly slow by historical sta ndards.  Still, my own view is that the open-ended nature of the \nFederal Reserve’s purchase program and the stro ng forward guidance togeth er encouraged private \nsector investors to purchase a wide  array of long-term assets, lowe ring long-term interest rates and \nhelping many asset prices rebound – and thus amplifying the impact of the Federa l Reserve’s actions.   \nTo the extent that this generated a stronge r economy and rebounding prices, it was at that \npoint a great benefit.  However, the success in dr iving down long rates bore with it a future downside \nrisk, as well.  Those investors who were buying assets under the assu mption that their prices would \nrebound and their yields fall as the Federal Reserve pur sued its expansionary pol icy were likely to be \nquite sensitive to the reversal of these policies.  Of course, the point at wh ich that reversal would \nhappen was quite uncertain, so that knowing when and how to protect agains t that risk was likely \nsomewhat difficult. \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL \nMonday, June 9, 2014 at 1:30pm U.S. Eastern Time and 11:30 a.m. local time  in Guatemala City, or upon delivery \n \n \n \n 8Indeed, Figure 8  shows the movement of 10-year U.S. Treasury security yields over the \ncourse of 2013.  Once the U.S. economy began to impr ove and the Federal Reserve began to discuss a \ngradual reduction in purchases, ma ny market participants who had been invested “alongside” the \nFederal Reserve became active sellers.   \nThis was particularly true for highly leve raged investors who ha d borrowed “short” and \ninvested “long” by engaging in th e so-called “carry trade” – an i ssue of particular relevance in \nemerging markets where interest rate s were considerably higher than in the United States.  The result \nwas a fairly significant increase in long-term rates and a repatriation of  funds that had been previously \nborrowed short and invested long in  emerging-market securities.   \nThe unwinding of the carry trade was a particularly thorny issue for countries with high dollar-\ndenominated yields and fixed excha nge rates, and for countries that had high yields and a policy of \ngradual currency appreciation rela tive to the dollar.  The speed a nd magnitude of the readjustment \nhighlighted just how low long-term rates had been pus hed.  It also suggested that many models of the \nimpact of Federal Reserve asset purchase programs had not fully ac counted for potential investor \nreaction to the policy, or the impact of a sudden reasse ssment of investor desire to engage in the carry \ntrade. \nDespite the rather abrupt cha nge in market interest rates last spring, the U.S. economy has \ncontinued to improve, as have the economies in ma ny other countries.  To be sure, the increase in \nmarket rates had some noticeable effects: some of the recent slowdown in housing activity is likely \nattributable to the rise in mo rtgage rates in the wake of la st year’s market adjustment.  \nIn sum, this episode made clear the importan ce of Federal Reserve communication and market \nunderstanding about programs and policies.  Th e episode also underlined the importance of \ncalibrating investor reactions in to models of policy impact. \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL \nMonday, June 9, 2014 at 1:30pm U.S. Eastern Time and 11:30 a.m. local time  in Guatemala City, or upon delivery \n \n \n \n 9With the onset of the gradual tapering that  was announced in December of last year, the \nFederal Reserve’s asset purchase program has b een reduced from $85 billion a month to now $45 \nbillion a month – still providing policy accommodation, but at a lessening rate.  Figure 9 shows that \nthe volatility of U.S. Treasury secu rities has recently been quite low.   I would attribute that in part to \nthe very gradual and predictable reduction in th e purchase program, along with an economy that has \ncontinued to improve, albeit on ly gradually and with some  setbacks along the way.   \nImportantly, I suspect that the benign reaction to  the gradual tapering of stimulus over the last \n6 months may be instructive as we consider how best to wind down the Federal Reserve’s balance \nsheet once the tapering of asset purchases is comp lete.  While the optimal program for reducing the \nFed’s balance sheet will need to be dependent on the state of the econom y, the recent tapering \nexperience suggests to me that a predictable, transp arent reduction in the bala nce sheet could be done \nin ways that may minimize the risk of financial disruption. \nLet me offer one scenario that I have been c onsidering, in light of the sorts of financial \nstability concerns that I and my colleagues keep in mind.  In one scenario, a reduction in the balance \nsheet, when that becomes appropria te, could be implemented as a ba sically seamless continuation of \nthe tapering program used for reductions in the purchase program.  For example, the Committee could decide to reinvest all but a given percentage  of securities on the balance sheet as they reach maturity, \nand increase that percentage  at each subsequent meeti ng, assuming conditions allow. \nSuch a tapering of the reinvestment program  could allow for a gradual and transparent \nreduction in the Fed’s balance sheet.  As the eco nomy moved closer to the Federal Reserve’s 2 \npercent inflation target and full employment, there could be a gradual reduc tion in the reinvestment \npolicy – which would allow for a predictable reducti on in the size of the balance sheet.  However, the \npace of reinvestment should always be considered  in the context of the economic outcomes we are \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL \nMonday, June 9, 2014 at 1:30pm U.S. Eastern Time and 11:30 a.m. local time  in Guatemala City, or upon delivery \n \n \n \n 10seeking to achieve.  If the economy was substant ially stronger or substant ially weaker than was \nexpected, the reinvestment program would need ad justment.  Again, I mention this as simply one \nscenario for consideration.   \n \nFinancial Stability and Federal Reserve Exit Strategy \nIn the wake of a financial crisis  with serious global ramificati ons, financial stability and early \nidentification of troubling economic trends have received increased attention at central banks around \nthe world.  As the Federal Reserve considers its  exit strategy from a very accommodative policy \nstance, significant attention is being given, as it should, to poten tial financial stability matters. \nI personally do not expect that it will be appropr iate to raise short-term rates until the U.S. \neconomy is within one year of both achieving full employment and returning to within a narrow band \naround 2 percent inflation.  Again, that is my persona l view.  However, both the transition to higher \nrates and the operating procedure for doing so could entail financial stability effects that should be \nthoughtfully considered – and I am certain will be.   \nAs Figure 10  illustrates, the Federal Reserve’s expansionary monetary policies over the past \nseveral years have resulted in a significant increase in what we call “excess reserves” – bank reserves \nthat exceed regulatory reserve requirements.  As l ong as a large quantity of excess reserves exist in \nthe financial system, the standard tools for raising th e federal funds rate are not  available to the Fed – \nthat is, affecting the supply of re serves and thus the cost of borrowi ng them, translating into interest \nrates.  Fortunately, there are a variety of  other tools the Fede ral Reserve can use. \nOne possible strategy, when it is appr opriate to start raisi ng rates, is to raise the rate of interest \nthat the Federal Reserve pays on excess reserves.  Banks will be unwilling to hold other assets that do \nnot pay at least the rate of interest on excess reserves, so this should raise short-term  market interest \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL \nMonday, June 9, 2014 at 1:30pm U.S. Eastern Time and 11:30 a.m. local time  in Guatemala City, or upon delivery \n \n \n \n 11rates even in the presence of subs tantial excess reserves.  However, since only de pository institutions  \nhold reserves, the effect of this rate on other market rates may be somewhat muted, leading some \nshort-term interest rates in the marketplace to tr ade below the interest rate on excess reserves.   \nIf the Federal Reserve wants to have more cont rol of short-term rates,  it could engage in \novernight reverse repurchase agreements, which are in effect collateralized loans to the Federal \nReserve that would provide a risk-f ree rate of return to investors.   Investors would essentially buy \ngovernment securities from the Federal Reserve and agr ee to sell back those secu rities a day later at a \npre-determined interest rate.  Similar to setting the rate paid on excess reserves, the Federal Reserve \ncould in effect place a floor on how low short-term rates would fall in the marketplace, by setting the \nreverse repo rate – since investor s would have access to the low-risk  reverse repo rates and thus be \nunwilling to accept lower rates of re turn in the markets.  Because reverse repo transactions can \ninvolve a broader set of counterpa rties than just the banking system , this tool might have a more \nreliable effect on short-term market interest rates. \nLet me be quick to add that one negative, collateral impact of e ngaging in reverse repos is that \nduring a period of heightened financial risk, invest ors might flee to the reverse repo market.  This \nwould provide a safe asset for investors, but might  also encourage runs fro m higher-risk, short-term \nprivate debt instruments. This woul d have the potential to create si gnificant private sector financing \ndisruptions during times of stress.  Presumably, capping the size of the reverse repo facility could help \nlimit the impact.  \nOn the other hand, a positive collateral impact of using reverse repos and interest on excess \nreserves in these ways is that the ability to contro l short-term rates would not be tied to actions that \nimpact the size of the Federal Reserve’s balance sh eet.  This means the Federal Reserve could have \nadditional financial stability tools at its disposal, if it chose to maintain a larger-than-traditional \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL \nMonday, June 9, 2014 at 1:30pm U.S. Eastern Time and 11:30 a.m. local time  in Guatemala City, or upon delivery \n \n \n \n 12balance sheet with a greater mix of assets.  Natu rally, maintaining a large balance sheet comprising \nboth U.S. Treasury securities and mortgage-backed securities would provide the Federal Reserve with \ncontinuing options for impacting long-term interest  rates and the spread between mortgage-backed \nsecurities and U.S. Treasury securities.  For exampl e, if a bubble seemed to be developing in housing \nmarkets generally, the Federal Reserve would have  the option of addressi ng it by selling MBS or \nlong-duration U.S. Treasury securities.  This agai n is a notion that I consider worthy of further \nexploration and debate. \nClearly, there will be financial stability implicat ions stemming from the set of transitional and \nlonger-term tools that th e FOMC eventually chooses.  While th e Federal Reserve has the ability to \ncontrol short-term rates, different tools may have different implications  for financial stability.  As the \nFederal Reserve continues to experiment with different ways to alter short-term interest rates, I believe we should focus intently on, and develop a better understanding of, these potential financial \nstability issues. \n \nConcluding Observations \nIn conclusion, I would note that regardless of th e tools eventually chos en, history shows that \nmonetary policy “exits” can be unsettled.  Obviousl y the interaction of ma rketplace and central bank \nexpectations can be quite intricate.   \nAn example is shown in Figure 11.   The dotted ovals reflect the last two times that monetary \npolicy significantly reversed direction as the U.S. economy recovered from a recession.  In 1994, the FOMC began to raise short -term rates, but long-term rates reacted significan tly to the tightening.  The \n10-year rate rose substantially, a nd in fact rose much higher than the level it would settle at over \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL \nMonday, June 9, 2014 at 1:30pm U.S. Eastern Time and 11:30 a.m. local time  in Guatemala City, or upon delivery \n \n \n \n 13subsequent years.  In contrast, the tightening in 2004 caused little reaction in long-term rates, despite \nthe significant increases that were occurring in short -term rates.   \nSo we see that even in a less complicated ope rating environment (like 1994), large discrete \nmovements are quite possible.  While some volatility may actually help reduce the risk that investors \ndevelop ultimately destabilizing ca rry-trade type strate gies, too much volatil ity can obviously be \ncounterproductive.  Of course it is important to avoid binding spec ificity about future actions, since \npolicies should be responsive to actual conditions  as clarity emerges about the strength of the \neconomy and the impact of va rious tightening tools.  \nAs I conclude my remarks today, let me again show you Figure 1 , which summarizes the \ngrowth in Federal Reserve assets given our policy actions since the fi nancial crisis and recession.  In \nsum, as I mentioned at the outset,  my view is that these new mone tary tools – the LSAPs, Maturity \nExtension Program, and forward guidance – were esse ntial in recent years.  However, while these \npolicies have been instrumental in achieving bett er economic outcomes, clearly they are not without \nchallenges.  Despite the challenges, we need to sei ze this opportunity to carefully consider a broader \nset of monetary policy tools and how those tools impact  financial stability in addition to inflation and \nunemployment.   \nThe forum you are holding is a good example of that process of cons ideration, study, and \ndebate, and again I thank you for inviting me to take part. \nThank you.      \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL \nMonday, June 9, 2014 at 1:30pm U.S. Eastern Time and 11:30 a.m. local time  in Guatemala City, or upon delivery \n \n \n \n 14                                                 \n \nNOTES: \n \n1 See the Federal Reserve Press Release: “Federal Reserve announces it will initiate a program to purchase the direct \nobligations of housing-related government-sponsored enterp rises and mortgage-backed securities backed by Fannie Mae, \nFreddie Mac, and Ginnie Mae”, November 25, 2008. \nhttp://www.federalreserve.gov/newsev ents/press/monetary/20081125b.htm  \n \n2 See the November 3, 2010 FOMC Statement: http://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/monetary/20101103a.htm  \n \n3 The Maturity Extension Program began.

I would like to thank President Dudley and all the conference organizers \nfor putting together such a substantive agenda on the risks of wholesale funding.    \nAs always, the views I express today are my own, not necessarily those of my collea gues \non the Board of Governors or the Federal Open Market Committee (the FOMC).  \nI appreciate the context that Bill Dudley just provided for my remarks, and more \ngenerally for the presentations and discussions at today’s conference.  Bill has crisply sketch ed \n\n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL August 13, 2014 at 9:20 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY  * \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 3 out for us the structural vulnerabilities and institutional weaknesses that evolved over time, and \nerupted into full view during the crisis.1 \nToday’s conference continues the vital work of studying and applying the lessons of the \nfinancial crisis.  One of the most important lessons is simply that financial institutions are \nsusceptible to being the targets of runs by their depositors or lenders.   \nThat, of course, is a lesson no one should have needed to learn.  Long ago, the \nDepression -era bank runs resu lted in major regulatory changes and the creation of federal deposit \ninsurance – which was designed to remove the motivation for future runs by limiting the risk of \nloss for insured depositors during periods of financial turmoil.2 \n However, as Bill Dudley just highlighted, many of the most significant runs that we saw \nin 2008 involved financial institutions other than banks .  For example, the failure of one money \nmarket mutual fund spawned fear of losses on investments in such funds generally.  The result \nwas a run on financial services providers more broadly, stemmed only by an extension of the \nfederal insurance safety net, the creation of a new Federal Reserve facility – one designed to lend \nfunds to buyers of the assets that money market mutual funds need ed to sell, in order to meet \nredemption demand during the run3 – and several other new Federal Reserve lending facilities \ncreated to prevent a collapse of financial market functioning.   \nThat experience led to regulatory reforms by the Securities and Excha nge Commission, \nincluding new liquidity requirements for money market mutual funds and recently issued rules \nthat, among other things, will result in the fluctuation of net asset values of shares for some of \nthese funds.4  While I would have preferred even  more protection against financial runs on \nmoney market mutual funds, this element of the recent rulemaking does represent a meaningful \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL August 13, 2014 at 9:20 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY  * \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 4 improvement.5  Still, I am certainly on record as questioning whether the imposition of \nwithdrawal restrictions (“gates” ) and fees will help to stabilize money market mutual funds in \ncrisis situations.6 \n \nConsidering Broker -Dealers  \nObviously I am placing a heavy emphasis on whether funding is “runnable,” to focus on \nthe essential vulnerability we should be concerned about.  The most dramatic runs of the \nfinancial crisis affected security brokers and dealers.  “Broker -dealers” are intermediaries that \neffect general transactions in securities – primarily the buying and selling of securities – and are \ncritical to market infrastr ucture .7  Many of these broker -dealers were part of larger independent \ninvestment banks prior to the financial crisis – including Lehman Brothers and Bear Stearns, \nwhich failed; and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, which are now part of bank holding \ncompa nies. \nImportantly, these broker -dealers fund their holdings in uninsured short -term credit \nmarkets, which makes them inherently more subject to runs than institutions that finance their \nholdings with longer -term or insured borrowing.  As the crisis showed,  when investors lose \nconfidence in broker -dealers, short -term funding “runs” from them, and as a consequence the \nbroker -dealers lose their ability to effectively serve as middlemen in markets, which in turn can \nimpair the ability of investors to buy or sel l a wide variety of stocks and bonds.8   \nPerhaps the defining event of the 2008 financial crisis was the failure of Lehman \nBrothers, one of the largest broker -dealers in the United States.  However, the collapse of \nLehman was not an isolated failure of a s ingle broker -dealer – but rather one of a string of crises \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL August 13, 2014 at 9:20 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY  * \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 5 for multiple broker -dealers.  Bear Stearns had failed earlier that year, Merrill Lynch experienced \nsignificant funding difficulties and was eventually acquired, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan \nStanley  opted to become bank holding companies.  Foreign broker -dealers did not fare much \nbetter: s everal large foreign broker -dealers operating in the United States experienced very \nsubstantial losses that required a significant rebuilding of capital.    \nWhile t here have been significant reductions in some broker -dealers’ holdings of highly \nrisky assets, and some improvements in capital and liquidity positions (and collateral quality), \ntheir reliance on a wholesale funding model that is subject to runs remains su rprisingly \nunchanged.   \nBroker -dealers played a dramatic role during the crisis – and extensive government \nsupport for them was necessary to prevent further market breakdowns and repercussions across \nthe economy.  However, there have been significant struc tural changes in the industry.  Many of \nthe largest domestic former investment banks are now in bank holding companies, and many \nforeign broker -dealers will now be included in intermediate holding companies.   While such \nholding companies have enhanced reg ulations, including being subject to stress tests and higher \ncapital requirements, the dependence on unstable short -term funding may necessitate further \nincreases in capital requirements relative to holding companies that do not include a major \nbroker -dealer.   \nFurthermore, the SEC’s capital and liquidity requirements for broker -dealer entities have \nnot materially changed since the crisis – leaving broker -dealers that are not in bank holding \ncompanies under a similar regulatory environment as before the cri sis.  I would note that senior \nSEC officials have publicly discussed enhancing capital and liquidity for broker -dealers .9 \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL August 13, 2014 at 9:20 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY  * \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 6 In short, the dependence on unstable short -term funding may in my view necessitate \nfurther increases in capital requirements.  Certainly I am not alone in this view, which has been \nexpressed by Fed Chair Janet Yellen10 and Governor Daniel Tarullo,11 among others.  \n \nThe Broker -Dealer Funding Model  \n I would like to focus the balance of my comments today on the broker -dealer funding \nmodel.  Broker -dealers have large balance sheets, which can include long -duration – and \npotentially risky – assets.  Short -term collateralized loans called repurchase agreements are a \nmajor source of funding for these large balance sheets.12  Because the loans  are short -term and \nfully collateralized, the interest rates on repurchase agreements are normally quite low.   \nHowever, during stressful times, that low -cost funding may quickly evaporate.  During \nthe financial crisis, we saw that many of those who tradit ionally lent to broker -dealers feared \ndefault by a broker -dealer – and did not want to risk having to take possession of the collateral \nassociated with the repurchase agreement in the event of a default.  In fact, money market mutual \nfunds, one of the larg est sources of lending to broker -dealers, are prohibited from purchasing the \nkind of long -term or high -credit -risk assets that are sometimes pledged as collateral for loans to \nbroker -dealers.13 \nThe result is that broker -dealers can experience significant fu nding problems during \ntimes of financial stress.  Unfortunately that potential for problems has not been fully addressed \nsince the crisis.  So I would like to discuss some possible responses to this problem, which I \nsuggest should include a major re -examin ation of how broker -dealers are regulated, and an \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL August 13, 2014 at 9:20 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY  * \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 7 increase in the capital required for any holding company with significant broker -dealer \noperations.  \n \nThe Evolution of Broker -Dealer Financing  \nOver the past 50 years, the framework for financing has shifted – traditional bank lending \nhas decreased in importance relative to broader market financing of financial assets.  As Figure \n1 shows, the traditional financing sources for depository institutio ns – checking, savings, and \ntime deposits – have declined as a share of total credit -market instruments over the past 50 years.  \nWhile this ratio has trended slightly upward since the onset of the crisis,14 it currently stands at \nroughly half of what it was  in the early 1970s.   \n In contrast, Figure 2  shows that the assets of  broker -dealers grew markedly as a share of \ntotal credit -market instruments over the past 50 years – from less than one percent in the early \n1960s to almost 10 percent in 2007 – althoug h they remain a modest share, hovering around six \npercent and perhaps trending downward in recent years.   \n It is striking how much broker -dealer balance sheets grew during the time leading up to \nthe financial crisis, as shown in Figure 3.   Indeed, at thei r peak in March of 2008, broker -dealers \nhad assets of $4.9 trillion – roughly a third the size of U.S. GDP.  In addition, broker -dealers \nbecame increasingly more leveraged, an expansion that was aided by the relatively light capital \nrequirements that appli ed to them.   \nIn the aftermath of the financial crisis, many broker -dealers have reduced their risk by \nparing back their assets, as is clear in the figure.  Some of this decline reflects a choice to reduce \nleverage by shrinking assets, in part reflecting t he new capital regulatory requirements that many \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL August 13, 2014 at 9:20 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY  * \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 8 broker -dealers inherited when they made the shift to become part of bank holding companies, or \nthe fact that they are now required to form intermediate holding companies if they have a foreign \nbanking parent . \n \nThe Importance of Repurchase Agreements for Broker -Dealer Financing  \n Asset growth on the scale seen over the last 50 years required significant increases in \nfunding.  Broker -dealers funded this increase in assets by using their securities holdings as \ncollateral for low -cost, short -term financing – an approach that was quite economical – allowing \nthe funding stream to grow easily and cheaply as the securities needed for market -making \nincreased.  Figure 4  shows that financing with repurchase agreements gre w quite dramatically \nand in step with the asset growth of broker -dealers.  \nWhile the scale of broker -dealer funding has risen dramatically, Figure 5  highlights that \nthe use of repurchase agreements to fund their activities is nothing especially new — the figure \nshows that repos as a share of liabilities at broker -dealers have in fact exceeded 50 percent since \nthe early 1980s.15 \n While many financial institutions use repurchase agreements to fund their asset holdings, \nFigure 6  shows that the degree of depende nce on repurchase agreements at broker dealers is \ndramatically higher than that of other large, regulated financial intermediaries.   \nFor example, life insurance companies make relatively little use of repurchase \nagreements.  Given their desire to match th e maturities of assets and liabilities, they tend to \nfinance their long -term insurance obligations with long -term assets.  While there are insurance \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL August 13, 2014 at 9:20 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY  * \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 9 products that can be subject to runs, the overall liability structure is much less dependent on \nshort -term financing.  \n Similarly, repurchase agreements are a relatively unimportant source of financing for \nmost U.S. depository institutions, because they benefit from deposit insurance, which provides \nan alternate low cost (and stable) way of financing assets.  \n In contrast, branches of foreign banks are quite dependent on runnable wholesale funding \n(including repurchase agreements) because they generally cannot offer insured deposits.  While \ntheir exposure to repurchase agreements is large compared to domestic bank s and life insurance \ncompanies, it is three times smaller than the very large exposure of broker -dealers.  \n The largest domestic net suppliers of repurchase agreement financing are money market \nmutual funds.  Figure 7  shows that as money market mutual funds  have grown, so have their \nholdings of repurchase agreements.   \nThe repurchase agreement is a particularly attractive form of lending for money market \nmutual funds, because such funds are explicitly limited to holding short -term, low -credit -risk \nassets.  S o while money market mutual funds cannot purchase long -term securities or high -\ncredit -risk assets, they can provide short -term collateralized loans to broker -dealers based on \nsuch assets  through repurchase agreements – allowing broker -dealers to use money -market funds \nto finance assets that cannot be purchased directly by those same money market mutual funds.   \n When there is confidence in a broker -dealer and its ability to repay their repurchase \nagreements, the broker -dealer enjoys a very low -cost way of f inancing securities.  However, \nwhen – as in a crisis – the investing institution loses confidence in the broker -dealer, they may \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL August 13, 2014 at 9:20 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY  * \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 10 refuse to conduct repurchase agreements any longer, or they may limit the scope of acceptable \ncollateral – either due to risk a version or to explicit investment restrictions that they face.   \nAs an example of the latter case, money market mutual funds may refuse to conduct \nrepurchase agreements on securities of the sort they could not purchase by rule (securities they \nwould be ent itled to assume as repayment, in the event of default).  This type of institutional \nconstraint can cause a run on a broker -dealer even though the financing is secured.  Other risk -\naverse investors, including cash management products with similar investment  mandates to \nmoney market funds, will likely behave in a similar fashion.  \nDuring the financial crisis, deteriorating confidence in broker -dealers was compounded \nby the fact that investors were also fleeing money market mutual funds, after the failure of \nLehman Brothers caused the Reserve Primary Fund to “break the buck.”  This made repurchase \nfinancing particularly problematic.  The crisis in short -term funding caused the Federal Reserve \nto establish a variety of short -term credit facilities to relieve some  of these market pressures and \navert additional economic damage stemming from problems in credit markets – on which \nnonfinancial businesses depend.  \n Given the lessons learned from the crisis, one might have expected less reliance by \nbroker -dealers on repur chase agreements, and a significant increase in capital required of broker -\ndealers.  Figure 8  shows the liabilities and capital mix of broker -dealers from 2007 to 2013.  \nWhat is striking is the lack of change – while there has been some improvement in capi tal, the \n2013 liability structure looks surprisingly similar to the structure that prevailed before the \nfinancial crisis.  \n \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL August 13, 2014 at 9:20 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY  * \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 11 Reducing the Risk of Runs  \n \n Generally speaking, highly capitalized institutions are much less likely to be subject to \nruns.  Because broker -dealers do not have deposit insurance, or access to the Federal Reserve’s \nDiscount Window, the risks inherent in their funding model should result in higher capital \nrequirements than would be the case if they, like domestic depository institutions, could fund \ntheir assets with insured deposits.   \n Perhaps the most direct way to reduce runs related to unstable funding is to require \nfinancial organizations dependent on unstable funding to hold significantly more capital than \nthey would if they used sta ble sources of funding.  This should be true for large independent \nbroker -dealers, foreign broker -dealers now required to form intermediate holding companies in \nthe United States, and major broker -dealers within bank holding companies.  \n To reduce run risk,  a larger share of long -term subordinated debt could also be utilized to \nfinance securities positions.  Long -term financing reduces the need for short -term and more \n“runnable” funding.  While some broker -dealers have utilized long -term financing to reduce run \nrisks, paradoxically, other broker -dealers have been reducing  their use of more stable sources of \nfinancing.  \n Another way to minimize run risks would be to limit the amount of maturity \ntransformation that can be done with repurchase agreements specifically.  This would call for \nlimiting the extent to which short -term repurchase agreements held by regulated financi al \nintermediaries could be used to finance long -term assets or high -credit -risk assets.  Alternatively, \ninstitutional investors such as money market mutual funds could, with new regulation, be \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL August 13, 2014 at 9:20 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY  * \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 12 prohibited from holding repurchase agreements secured by collat eral that they, by rule, could not \npurchase.  \nOther remedies are possible and should be explored – and some will be discussed at \ntoday’s conference.  Allow me to mention a few possibilities.  One would be regulation that \nspecifies eligible collateral for a repurchase agreement and that mandates the “haircut.”     \nTo be sure, policy remedies would have an impact on the profitability of broker -dealers.  \nBut given recent history, that trade -off may be unavoidable and in the public interest from a \nfinancial stability perspective.  \n Allow me to mention one o ther possibility – a complex and likely controversial one, to be \nsure.  In my view, the Federal Reserve’s Discount Window could theoretically provide a way of \nreducing liquidity risk, by providing a standing liquidity facility for broker -dealers like the \nprimary dealer facility that was established during the financial crisis.   The rationale for such a \nstep would be rooted in the notion that market -making is as important as lending in today’s \neconomy.   \nHowever, I realize that such an outcome seems unlikel y.  And at any rate a number of \nother steps I have mentioned – such as a significant re -evaluation of broker -dealer regulatory \nrequirements and, particularly, much -higher solvency standards that would reduce the risk of \nruns – would seem to be prerequisite s for such a path.  \n \nConcluding Observations  \n In summary and conclusion, I would first observe that broker -dealers were at the \nepicenter of the financial crisis.  Their reliance on collateralized borrowing in the form of \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL August 13, 2014 at 9:20 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY  * \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 13 repurchase agreements was assumed to  insulate them from runs, perhaps because many viewed \ncollateralized lending as providing little default risk.   \nThis proved wrong.  Many of their creditors did not want to take possession of the \ncollateral backing the repurchase agreements in the event of  default of a broker -dealer.  As a \nresult, there were widespread runs on broker -dealers, particularly those experiencing acute \nfinancial problems.   \nThis was not, however, just a problem for broker -dealers.  Because of broker -dealers’ \ncrucial role as marke t-makers, liquidity in markets was severely impaired.16  \nThe Federal Reserve created special lending facilities to mitigate some of these broker -\ndealer funding problems.  As shown in Figure 9 , two of the facilities were directly related to \nbroker -dealer fin ancing and lent extensively to broker -dealers, particularly after the failure of \nLehman Brothers.   \nA challenge to the broker -dealer financing model is that repurchase agreements are a very \nlow cost financing method – in fact the costs are lower than those  that banks face with many of \ntheir core deposits, as shown in Figure 10 .  However, unlike core deposits at banks, the absence \nof deposit insurance means there is a run risk – a financial stability concern – when broker -\ndealers become (or are perceived to be) financially impaired, or when uncertainty about their \nfinancial soun dness rises.    \nIn sum, given the widespread support provided to broker -dealers and the difficulties they \nencountered during the crisis, a comprehensive re -evaluation of broker -dealer regulation is \noverdue.  \nThank you.  \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL August 13, 2014 at 9:20 A.M.

Such runs often result in “fire sales” of bank assets, entailing significant costs not only \nto borrowers and depositors, but also t o equity holders.   \n \n \n3 The Asset -Backed Commercial Paper Money Market Mutual Fund Liquidity Facility (AMLF) was \ndesigned to provide a market for asset -backed commercial paper to be sold by MMMFs.   This facility was \nadministered by the Federal Reserve Bank  of Boston.   For a full description and analysis of the program \nsee Burcu Duygan -Bump, Patrick Parkinson, Eric Rosengren, Gustavo A.

The Temporary Guarantee Program (TGP) directly benefitted money market \nmutual funds by extending insurance provided by the U.S. Department of Treasury.   For details, see U.S. \nDepartment of Treasury, “Treasury Announces Temporary Guarantees Program for  Money Market \nFunds,” September 2008.  \n \n4 In 2010, the SEC made several changes to Rule 2a -7, including: tightened weighted average maturity \nlimits; enhanced disclosure requirements; the ability to suspend redemptions to facilitate an orderly \nliquidation; and new weighted average life, stress -testing, and “know your customer” requirements.   Last \nmonth, the SEC voted, among other things, to adopt a floating NAV requirement for certain prime funds \nand grant non -government MMMFs the ability to suspend redemptions or impose redemption fees if \ncertain liquidity thresholds are breached.   For more details on the new rules, see: \nhttp://www.sec.gov/News/PressRelease/Detail/PressRelease/1370542347679#.U -Tr4KMvjSg  \n \n5 While the floating NAV for prime institutional funds and tightening of asset purchase requirements for \ngovernment funds are helpful, retail funds still have a fixed NAV and the potential for imposing gates and \nfees could be destab ilizing.

Some of these measures – such as requiring firms to hold larger amounts of capital, \nstable funding, or highly liquid assets based on use of short -term wholesale funding – would li kely apply \nonly to the largest, most complex organizations. Other measures – such as minimum margin requirements \nfor repurchase agreements and other securities financing transactions – could, at least in principle, apply \non a marketwide basis.” [ http://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/yellen20140702a.htm ] \n \nShe also noted, on April 15, 2014:  \n\"…let me highlight one data point that suggests that there may be net social gains from \nintroducing further reforms to address short -term wholesale funding risks. In 2010, the Basel Committee \nassessed the long -term economic impact of stronger capital and liquidity requirements for global banks. \nFactoring in the Basel III capital re quirements and the NSFR, the Basel study suggested that tightening \nrisk-based capital and liquidity requirements would, on net, provide economic benefits, and that benefits \nwould continue to accrue at even higher levels of risk -based capital than are part of Basel III.  \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL August 13, 2014 at 9:20 A.M.

The first would impose a regulatory charge \ncalculated by reference  to reliance on [securities financing transactions (SFTs)] and other forms of short -\nterm wholesale funding, whether the firm uses that funding to finance inventory or an SFT matched book. \nThe second would directly increase the very low charges under curren t and pending regulatory standards \nattracted by SFT matched books.\"  \n[http://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/tarullo20131122a.htm ] \n \nHe also noted on May 3, 2013:  \n\"…existing bank and broker -dealer risk -based capital rules do not reflect fully the financial \nstability risks associated with SFTs. Accordingly, higher, generally applicable capital charge applied to \nSFTs might be a useful piece of a complementary set of m acroprudential measures, though an indirect \nmeasure like a capital charge might have to be quite large to create adequate incentive to temper the use \nof short -term wholesale funding.” \n[http://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/tarullo20130503a.htm ] \n \n \n12 While repos are the largest source of such funding, runs were also experienced on commercial paper \nand prime brokerage assets.  Also, the run on repos was differentiate d based on the quality of the \nunderlying collateral.  \n \n \n13 Upon default, a fund would have to liquidate an ineligible security unless the board determines it is in \nthe best interest of shareholders not to sell the asset.  But they cannot buy more of such a p osition.   \n \n \n14 Part of the recent step up would be the result of the increase in the size of the covered portion of insured \nbank accounts.  \n \n \n15 Furthermore, the quality of assets held in trading inventory was much better in the 1980s and 1990s \nversus immedi ately prior to the financial crisis of 2008.

Rosengren \nPresident & Chief Executive Officer \nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston \n \n \nNew Hampshire and Vermont Bankers Associations \nAnnual Conference  \n \nBoston, Massachusetts  \nSeptember 5, 2014 \n \n \n \n \n Thank you for inviting me to speak t oday at the New Hampshire and Vermont \nBankers Associations Annual Conference.   \nAs always, the views I express today are my own, not necessarily those of my \ncolleagues on the Board of Governors or the Federal Open Market Committee (the \nFOMC). \nThe economy has been on the mend and the unemployment rate has declined \nalmost everywhere.  You can certainly s ee this in Vermont, where the 3.7 percent \nunemployment rate is about where it was be fore the recession began.  New Hampshire’s \n\n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL September 5, 2014 at 3:50 P. M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *  \n 2unemployment rate is also well below the na tional unemployment rate, at 4.4 percent, but \nis still above where it was in 2006. \nDespite the improvement in labor markets over the past year, today’s employment \nreport was somewhat disappoint ing, with the increase in payroll employment of 142,000 \njobs being below expectations, and the unempl oyment rate declining to 6.1 percent but in \npart because 64,000 Americans drop ped out of the labor force.  And while the number of \nAmericans working part time for economic reas ons declined somewhat, there are still 7.3 \nmillion Americans working part time for economic reasons.    \nThe influence of labor market slack, broadly construed, on monetary policy \ndecisions is the main theme of this talk.  My primary message is that significant slack \nremains, and thus monetary policy needs to be patient in removing stimulus.   \nIn addition, given the uncertainties surroundi ng our forecasts of the pace of labor-\nmarket improvement and the degree of re maining slack, monetary policy has to be \ndetermined largely by incoming data and the sign als that data provide about the health of \nlabor markets.  If the economy disappoints we should be in no rush to raise short-term \nrates, but if the economy improves more quick ly than anticipated we should raise short-\nterm rates earlier.  Thus, we should be m oving away from providing date-based forward \nguidance, and instead focus on what incoming data tell us about reaching full employment and 2 percent inflation within a reasonable time period. \n \nMonetary Policy and Forward Guidance \nWhile the unemployment rates in New Hampshire and Vermont remain well \nbelow the national average, the significant dec lines in measures of national labor market \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL September 5, 2014 at 3:50 P. M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *  \n 3slack have raised questions of how and wh en central bank policymakers should normalize \nmonetary policy.  Indeed, market participants and financ ial prognosticators have begun to fixate on \npotential calendar dates for when the Federal Rese rve will raise short-term interest rates.  \nLet me say that I will not be providing any such guidance t oday.  In fact, I actually hold \nthe view that as we approach levels of unemployment that many consider “full \nemployment,” the Fed should no longer issu e guidance on the approximate timing of any \nmonetary policy changes.   \nI do not intend this to redu ce transparency in monetary  policymaking.  Rather, I \nsimply want to acknowledge that any referen ce to calendar dates has the potential to be \ninaccurate.  The date of “liftoff” from near-z ero short-term rates is highly dependent on \nhow the economy actually evolves – in other words, is going to  be tied to the current and \nexpected path of inflation and employment.  We are getting close enough to targets that, \ngiven the uncertainty around forecasts of these variables, incoming data that cause \nFederal Reserve policymakers to significantly change our outlook for the economy will shift any expected lift-off date  forward or backward in ti me.  So, again, reference to \ncalendar dates as we approach targets has the potential to be inaccurate.  \nThis appropriate dependence on economic c onditions takes on more weight when \none recognizes that many of the variables we focus on have behaved differently than expected over the past two years.  For ex ample, real GDP over the past two years has \nbeen weaker than most forecasters exp ected, unemployment has fallen faster than \nexpected (particularly give n the disappointment in real GDP), and many forecasters \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL September 5, 2014 at 3:50 P. M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *  \n 4expected the inflation rate to reach th e Federal Reserve’s target of 2 percent1 more \nquickly.  Notably, while some analysts are quite w illing to predict precise dates for lifting \nshort-term rates, surveys of such lift-off dates actually provide a very wide range of \npossibilities.  This, of course, is consistent with the uncertain ty associated with predicting \neconomic outcomes.  Indeed, Figure 1  provides a snapshot of the primary dealers’ \nexpectations for when the first rate increase will occur.  While the consensus is centered on the middle of next year, there are significant probabilities attached to the first rate hike \nbeing earlier or later than the middle of next year.  This wi de distribution of predictions \npresumably reflects both uncertainty about the forecast for the economy, and different \nviews about how monetary policy wi ll respond to actual conditions.   \n Critical to any decision on lifting short-te rm rates will be the matter of how much \nlabor market slack exists currently, and how long before the economy reaches what we \nwould consider to be full employment.  While my remarks will be focused on labor \nmarkets, it is important to remember that  labor market slack (which dampens wage-\ngrowth pressure) is one reason that inflation has remained persistently below the Federal \nReserve’s 2 percent inflation target since the financial crisis.   As  labor markets tighten, \nwe would expect the inflation ra te to approach the 2 percent inflation target more rapidly, \nas well.  \nThe Economic Outlook \n Figure 2  provides private-sector forecasts fo r the path of the unemployment rate, \nfrom two groups of economic forecasters – the Blue Chip economic forecast and the \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL September 5, 2014 at 3:50 P. M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *  \n 5Survey of Professional Forecasters.   The fo recasts are quite consistent with each other \n(due in part to some overlap between survey  participants), with both predicting a gradual \nreduction of the unemployment rate from the 6.1 percent level we curr ently see nationally \nas reported in the August employment report.  For the Blue Chip forecast, which extends \nthrough 2015, the forecasters on average expect  that the unemployment rate will be 5.5 \npercent at the end of next year.   \nThe horizontal line at 5. 25 percent indicates the Federal Reserve Bank of \nBoston’s estimate of the unemployment rate consistent with full employment.  I would \nnote that the Boston Fed’s estimate is at the low end of forecasts for FOMC participants, \nwhere the central tendency for the unemployme nt rate in the long run is from 5.2 to 5.5 \npercent, as shown in the June Summary of Economic Projections.2  \nUnfortunately, the forecasts shown in Figure 2  only go through the end of next \nyear.  If one assumes that the unemployment ra te will continue to fall at the same pace in \n2016 as it is expected to fall in 2015, both fo recasts would reach the Boston Fed’s 5.25 \npercent estimate of full employment around the middle of 2016.  As I’ve said on many \noccasions, I personally do not expect that it wi ll be appropriate to raise short-term rates \nuntil the U.S. economy is within one year  of both achieving full employment and \nreturning to within a narrow  band around 2 percent inflation.  Again, that is my personal \nview.  And, if one were to also assume th at tightening would be gin roughly one year \nbefore reaching full employment and the 2 percent inflation target, then one could say that the primary dealers’ estimates of a ra te rise bunched arou nd mid-2015 seem roughly \nconsistent with the forecasts for unemployment in Figure 2 . \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL September 5, 2014 at 3:50 P. M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *  \n 6  However, I would reiterate that there is significant uncertainty surrounding these \nforecasts.  We see this more clearly in Figure 3 , which shows not only the average of all \nthe forecasts in the Blue Chip survey, but al so the average of the 10 lowest and 10 highest \nforecasts for unemployment among the more th an 50 forecasters in the survey.   The \naverage of the 10 lowest forecasts for the unemployment rate dips below 5.25 percent by \nthe end of 2015, while the average of the 10 hi ghest forecasts declin es only to 5.8 percent \nat the end of 2015, still well a bove the 5.25 percent line.    \n Another measure of the uncertainty  surrounding these private- sector forecasts is \nrepresented in Figure 4 , which shows the unemployment pa th that was being forecast by \nthe Blue Chip survey in March 2013 (whe n the 2014 quarterly forecast first became \navailable).  At that time, the average forecas t of unemployment for the second quarter of \n2014 was 7.3 percent.  The consensus (average) forecast was more than a percentage point too high.  Even the 6.9 percent average of the lowest  10 forecasts was still well \nabove the realized rate of 6.2 percent for the second quarter of 2014 and 6.1 percent for \nAugust 2014, just released today. Clearly, mo st forecasters expected a much more \ngradual improvement in the unemploym ent rate than actually occurred. \n  Given that economic forecasters have expected a much slower decline in the \nunemployment rate, we should ask ourselve s if these errors of overestimating \nunemployment rates are likely to persist.  The answer, in my view, is  not necessarily.   \nI say this because one reas on for the large error in estimating the decline in the \nunemployment rate has been the unexpectedly slow growth of the labor force.  Everyone \nknew that the aging of the Baby Boom genera tion would slow down this growth rate.  \nBut it appears that some people who were expected to stay in the labor force became \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL September 5, 2014 at 3:50 P. M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *  \n 7discouraged with their potentia l job prospects and withdrew, wh ile others never joined at \nall.  However, as labor markets tighten, th e job prospects for these discouraged workers \nshould improve.  It is likely that some of the new jobs opening up will be filled by \nindividuals not currently c ounted in the labor force.3 \nIndeed, in terms of monthly gross fl ows, the number of people moving from out \nof the labor force  into employment is considerably larger than the number moving from \nbeing unemployed (but in the labor force)  to employed.  In this way, as labor markets \ntighten, the unemployment rate may decline more  slowly than its recent trend – even with \ngrowth in payroll employment conti nuing at the levels seen in the first half of this year.    \nThis also highlights why the traditiona l unemployment rate may not, by itself, \ngive a full picture of labor market conditions.  \nAlternative Measures of Labor Market Slack \n Figure 5  provides some alternative measures of  labor market slack  in addition to \nthe traditional, widely reported “U-3” civilian unemployment rate.\n4  The U-4 measure \nincludes the unemployed workers counted in  the U-3 plus so-called “discouraged \nworkers.”5  Discouraged workers have looked for wo rk in the past year  and are available \nto work, but have stopped looking because they  believe there are no jobs available for \ntheir skill sets.   \nThe U-5 measure adds so-called “other marginally attached” workers to the \namount of unemployed and discouraged workers.6  Like discouraged workers, these \nadditional marginally attached workers have al so said they want a job, are available for \nwork, and have looked for work in the past year – but they are no longer looking, largely \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL September 5, 2014 at 3:50 P. M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *  \n 8because they believe there are no jobs availabl e for the schedules or in the locations they \ncan work.   \nAnd the broadest measure, U-6, includes unemployed workers, discouraged \nworkers, other workers marginally attached to the workforce, and workers who are part-\ntime for economic reasons. 7  The latter means that they are working, and are available to \nwork full time, but they are working part-time because their hours have been cut back or \nthey have been unable to find a full-time job.    Looking at the shaded recession periods, you see that the more widely-cited U-3 \nmeasure of unemployment, as well as the br oader measures of labor market conditions, \nrose much more during the last recession than in the previous one – and still remain well \nabove pre-recession levels.   Of course, whether this elevated unempl oyment rate reflects the business cycle or \na more lasting structural  shift is a matter of debate am ong economists and others.  While \nmy analysis generally suggest s that a sizable fraction of the increase in unemployment \nshould be attributed to cyclical causes, I acknowledge it is possi ble that the broader \nmeasures also reflect increasing structural  problems in the labor market – and also, \nimportantly, that problems that were initially cyclical may have become more structural \nin nature during a painfully slow recover y.  The implications would be more people \npermanently withdrawing from the labor for ce or working part-time when they would \nprefer full-time work.   \nAllow me to now show you some analysis  that I consider il luminating as I study \nconditions in the labor market. \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL September 5, 2014 at 3:50 P. M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *  \n 9 Figure 6 shows how states look when plotted in terms of the U-3 rate (the \nhorizontal position) and workers part-time for economic reasons (the vertical position), both compared to a pre-recession average (calculated from 2005 to 2007).  A large \nnumber of states are cluste red in the upper right hand quadr ant of the figure, indicating \nthat both U-3 unemployment and those who are part-time for economic reasons remain \nwell above levels from before the recession.  Th ere is also a clear tr end in the data, where \nstates with U-3 unemployment well above that  pre-recession average tend to have higher \npart-time workers relative to pre-recession leve ls.  I would also point  out that many of the \nstates that have very high U-3 unempl oyment and workers part-time for economic \nreasons are states that were disproportionate ly impacted by the fina ncial crisis (states \nsuch as Arizona, Nevada, and Florida).    \nWe should note that the line you see fit to  the data points doe s not go through the \nzero origin on the vertical scale, giving some  quantitative evidence to suggest that even if \na state returned to its pre-recession level of unemployment, one would still see somewhat \nhigher percentages of workers who are part-time for economic reasons. \nAlmost half the U.S. states are close to  or below their pre-recession U-3 average – \nthat is, within a percentage point of, or below, the y-axis .  However, there is less \nbunching near or below zero for those part-tim e for economic reasons – that is, close to \nor below the zero horizontal axis on the chart.   In fact, only three states are now below \ntheir pre-recession level for those part-t ime for economic reasons – North Dakota, \nAlaska, and Arkansas. \nThe table in Figure 7  summarizes the data in the prev ious figure.  There are eight \nstates that now have U-3 unemployment below the average prior to the recession, \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL September 5, 2014 at 3:50 P. M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *  \n 10compared to the three states with worker s part-time for economic reasons below pre-\nrecession levels.  If one looks at the number of states belo w or within one percentage \npoint of the pre-recession average, there ar e 22 states when using the U-3 measure, but \nonly 13 states when using part-time for economic reasons. \nMy next two figures show how the sh are of people working part time for \neconomic reasons has changed since 2006 – before  the crisis – for different age groups.  \nFigure 8  presents the younger age groups – 20 to  24, and 25 to 34.  In the 20 to 24 age \ngroup, the share of workers part-time for econom ic reasons rose dram atically relative to \n2006 levels.  While there has been some dec line relative to 2006, workers part-time for \neconomic reasons in this age group remain a much higher share than pre-recession levels.  The right side of the figure show s that this is also true, but much less dramatically so, for \nthe 25 to 34 age group. \nFigure 9  shows that for older age groups (35 to 44, and 45 to 54), the part-time \nfor economic reasons experience compared to pr e-crisis 2006 is also much less elevated.  \nWhile the share of part-time for economic reason s is still higher than  the 2006 average, it \nis much less dramatic than for the younger cohorts.   \nFigure 10  shows the actual percentages of  workers part-time for economic \nreasons in 2006 and in 2014, by age cohort.  For the two youngest ag e groups, the percent \npart-time for economic reasons remains quite  elevated relative to  2006 and relative to \nother age cohorts.  One might have thought that many in those younger age cohorts are \nrecently educated and mobile, so that as we  experience tighter labor markets it might \nbecome much less common for them to work part time for economic reasons.  However, \nit is certainly possible that there has been a st ructural change in la bor markets that makes \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL September 5, 2014 at 3:50 P. M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *  \n 11it more difficult for those in younger age groups to get full-time employment.  While I \nexpect that much of this patte rn is a function of cyclical sl ack in the labor markets, the \ntrends in those working part-time for ec onomic reasons in younger age groups is an \nimportant dynamic worthy of further study.   \n \nConcluding Observations \n In summary and conclusion, I would note that significant excess capacity remains \nin labor markets.  Today’s somewhat disappoi nting employment report, with only gradual \nimprovement through creation of 142,000 jobs in July, highlights that the time it will take \nto return to full employment remains highl y uncertain.  However, a return to full \nemployment could occur within a two-year  horizon, if the economy continues to \ngradually improve. Of course, the degree of uncertainty surrounding such forecasts readily admits the possibility of a return to  full employment several quarters earlier or \nlater.    \nOne issue that has been raised by some observers is a view that labor markets \nhave tightened sufficiently to make inflation  more of a near-term concern.  However, \nFigure 11  shows that total compensation, and wage s and salaries, have all been growing \nquite slowly.  The current growth rate in compensation remains below most estimates of \nthe standard benchmark of real labor producti vity growth plus 2 percent inflation.   \nIn sum, while we have approached full employment more rapidly than many \nexpected, substantial labor mark et slack remains.  In addition, PCE inflation remains at \nonly 1.6 percent, with no sign of significant wa ge pressures in labor markets. The lack of \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL September 5, 2014 at 3:50 P. M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *  \n 12wage pressures suggests that we  are not yet near full employ ment, and that there is no \nupward pressure on inflation coming from wages.   \nAs a consequence of all this, and given th e evidence that the broader measures of \nunemployment are being driven by cyclical realities, it s eems to me appropriate for \nmonetary policy to continue to be patient – in the interest of en suring that the economy \nreaches full employment and the 2 percent in flation target as quickly as possible.  \nThank you. \n \n  \n                                                 \n \n1 Using the PCE or Personal Consum ption Expenditures price index. \n \n2 See http://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypo licy/files/fomcprojtabl20140618.pdf.  \n \n3 I recommend “Labor Market Exit and Re-Entry: Is the United States Poised for a Rebound in \nthe Labor Force Participation Rate? by Daniel Cooper and María José Luengo-Prado  \n(http://www.bostonfed.org/economic/current -policy-perspectives/2014/cpp1402.htm ). \n4 I discussed this topic at length earlier this year: \nhttp://www.bostonfed.org/news/speech es/rosengren/2014/020614/index.htm.  \n \n5 As a percent of the labor force plus discouraged workers. \n \n6 As a percentage of the labor force plus workers that are marginally attach ed to the labor force. \n \n7 As a percentage of the labor force plus workers that are marginally attach ed to the labor force.",

Rosengren  \nPresident & Chief Executive Officer  \nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston  \n \n \nConference Address \nThe Federal Reserve Bank of Bo ston's 58th Economic \nConference:  “Inequality of Economic Opportunity”  \n  \nBoston, M assachusetts  \nOctober 18 , 2014  \n  \n \n \n \nGood morning, and let me again welcome you to the Federal Reserve Bank of \nBoston’s 58th economic conference.  This year, our conference focuses on inequality of \neconomic opportunity, with the hope of identifying possible policy remedies.   \nWhile income  inequality may be a somewhat controversial issue, most people – \neven most economists – agr ee that equality of opportunity  is a worthy goal.  Yet society \nhas fallen short in delivering on the goal of equality of opportunity.  This conference \n\n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL October 18, 2014  at 8:30 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY  * \n 2 features an intentionally diverse mix of scholars presenting research on a wide range of \ntopics – includi ng measuring inequality of opportunity, barriers to economic opportunity, \nearly childhood intervention, education policy, the effects of geography on opportunity, and the effects of unequal opportunity on overall economic performance.  \nWhile income inequal ity is something of a “hot topic” in policy and scholarship \ntoday, the Boston Fed has long been concerned about the economic well -being of all \ncitizens, including low - and moderate -income individuals.  Indeed, the issue of income \ninequality was the focus of our Annual Report some  15 years ago.  \nTo emphasize our concern with such topics, I would note that this our flagship \neconomic conference series has, over the years, often taken an expanded view of the Federal Reserve’s mandate to maximize employment .  Co nferences have explor ed issues \nthat determine long -run employment, such as  financing public schools (1972), education \nin the 21st century (2002), minority business development (1976), welfare reform (1986),  \ninvestment in public infrastructure (1990), and the importance of the full employment part of the dual mandate (2013).\n1  \nAt the Boston Fed, we have a tradition of emphasis on employment and \nunemployment, not just inflation – that is, on both sides of the Federal Reserve’s dual mandate.  We have traditi onally emphasized  promoting maximum sustainable \nemployment as well as stable prices, which the Federal Reserve has defined as 2 percent inflation.\n2  And as our research conferences and community work demonstrate, we have \nlong been concerned with programs t hat impact low - and moderate -income individuals.  \nThis conference continues with the tradition of examining tools and levers outside of monetary policy that often can more directly help these individuals.   \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL October 18, 2014  at 8:30 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY  * \n 3  In short, this conference continues the Boston F ed’s long -standing practice of \nemphasizing our duty to advance the maximum well -being of all citizens.  Realizing that \nmany of the problems faced by low - and moderate -income citizens are closely related to \nthe economic decline of the cities they live in, i n recent years, the Boston Fed has focused \non determining successful policies for revitalization – a process I will tell you about \ntoday.  \nAs I begin, I would note, as I always do, that the views I will express today are \nmy own, not necessarily those of my colleagues at the Federal Reserve’s Board of \nGovernors or the Federal Open Market Committee (the FOMC).  \n \nOpportunity, in the Context of Local Communities  \nThe first day of this conference covered, in some detail, why economic \nopportunities may not be evenly  distributed.  Conference participants noted, for example, \nthat education from early childhood through college is an expensive proposition, and that \nmany such highly priced opportunities may not be available for those with limited economic resources.  Conf erence participants also discussed why opportunities might \ndiffer depending on parent and family characteristics, which go beyond income and wealth, and may be a particular impediment for some subgroups.   \nThese impediments can be significant barriers to s ocial mobility, and I expect our \nfirst session today will cover why intergenerational poverty is so prevalent, and why individuals from disadvantaged geographies frequently are unable to progress beyond the circumstances of their local community.  \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL October 18, 2014  at 8:30 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY  * \n 4 The focus  of much of the discussion at this conference thus far has been on people  \n– opportunities for people, barriers faced by people, and limited social mobility for \npeople.3  In my remarks today, I am going to take a somewhat different approach, which \nI believe will help bridge the conversation to the upcoming sessions.  Beyond individuals and their families, I would like to ask what the impediments are that make it difficult for entire communities  to escape their disadvantaged pasts.  I emphasize communities \nbecause much of the weight in equalizing opportunity is borne at the local level.     \nMany New England communities experienced one or more significant negative \neconomic s hocks in the past half century – as textile producers, lumber mills, and \nmanufacturing operations that were once the mainstay of many communities declined or completely disappeared.  While it is difficult for individuals to overcome limited opportunities, the ability of entire communities to reinvent themselves has become increasingly important as evidence mounts suggesting how important social surroundings \ncan be for individual success.  \nUltimately, most of the key services that make up the public infrastru cture \nsupporting a healthy economic environment must be provided locally.\n4  How well these \nlocal services are provided can vary considerably across communities, which in turn can have a substantial effect on the distribution of opportunities that impact individual development (the opportunities discussed yesterday at this conference).  For example, most education in a child’s formative years is provided by local school systems or nonprofit agencies, including early childhood education and, if necessary, Eng lish for \nspeakers of other languages classes (ESOL).  Local delivery also, obviously, characterizes elementary through high school education.   \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL October 18, 2014  at 8:30 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY  * \n 5 But education is only one of many key services with a strong local component.  \nStudies have shown that the educa tional attainment of a mother is highly correlated with \nthe eventual educational attainment of her children.  Most services aimed at helping \nteenage mothers complete high school are provided at the local level, as are other services for single mothers.  For another example, programs that aim to reintroduce ex -\noffenders into the workforce – which can be a particularly challenging endeavor – are provided by local communities. Cities with substantial numbers of ex -offenders are often \nparticularly stressed to f und these programs.   \nThese are but a few examples of the local delivery of services that can influence \nboth opportunities and outcomes for a community’s citizens. \nImportantly, the quality of these local services depends on the economic \ncircumstances of th e broader community.  The financial, leadership, and peer resources \navailable can be highly dependent on whether a community is flourishing and effectively \ncoordinating services.   \nThe importance of the “community context” reinforces the notion that \nsucces sfully addressing the issue of economic opportunity will increasingly require \ncommunities that are both in good health economically and effective in delivering key local services.  This raises some questions.  Have we invested enough time and energy into e ncouraging communities to flourish?  And is local civic and social infrastructure \nsufficient to provide opportunities for individuals to overcome economic barriers?   \nToday, I will discuss some of the experience in this regard through the lens of \nsome of the mid -sized cities in Massachusetts.\n5  And I will briefly describe actions being \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL October 18, 2014  at 8:30 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY  * \n 6 taken by the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, along with a host of partners, that may be a \npromising model for helping such cities to help themselves.   \n \nCan Cities  Become “U pwardly Mobile”?  \nFigure 1  shows median family income in 2010 dollars for the United States, \nMassachusetts, and the mid -sized cities in Massachusetts.  For the mid -sized cities, the \nchart shows median family income for three cities – the city with the highe st, median, \nand lowest median family income growth over the roughly 50- year period.  \nAs you can see, the median family income in the Massachusetts mid -sized city \nranked in the middle in terms of growth is relatively close to that of the entire United State s, with both showing improvement from 1959 to 1999, but then showing a decline \nover the 10 years leading up to the end of our data.  However, the cities with the highest and lowest median family income growth show sharply divergent outcomes, not unlike \ncharts summarizing the experience of individuals at the two ends of the distribution.  The mid-sized city with the highest median family income growth of the 33 Massachusetts \nmid-sized cities has shown dramatic gains in family income.  In contrast, at the oth er end \nof the distribution, the city with the lowest median family income growth has shown declining median family income since 1969.  \nFigure 2  suggests how difficult it has been for mid- sized cities to be upwardly \nmobile.  The figure shows the 10 mid- sized Massachusetts cities with the lowest median \nincome at the end of each decade since 1959.  If mid- sized cities were upwardly mobile, \nwe would expect to see successful cities dropping off this list over time.  But, as the color coding illustrates, many of the cities with the lowest median family income in 1959 \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL October 18, 2014  at 8:30 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY  * \n 7 continue to be cities with the lowest median family income through the most recent \ndecade.  For example, Lawrence has been among the six Massachusetts mid -sized cities \nwith the lowest median family in come since 1959, and was in the unfortunate position of \nhaving the lowest median family income over the last three decades.  \nFigure 3  shows how striking the decline in median family income has been in \nmany of these mid -sized cities relative to the median fa mily income in the United States.  \nThe city of Lawrence, which had been close to the median family income for the United States in 1969, was earning only 60 percent of the median family income for the United States by 2009.\n6  In addition, most of the other  mid-sized cities have seen median family \nincome relative to that for the United States fall by between 20 and 30 percent.   \nWhile these cities have experienced difficulties for a variety of reasons, many of \nthem had strong manufacturing sectors in 1960, w hich provided median family incomes \nrelatively close to the national average.  However, as Figure 4  illustrates, many of these \ncities have experienced dramatic declines in manufacturing employment, particularly over the past three decades.  \nAs manufacturing  declined in many of these mid -sized cities, one might have \nthought that the general population of such cities would drop significantly.  Figure 5  \nshows that while there have been modest percentage population declines in some cities, both Chelsea and Lawre nce have experienced increases  in population.  Of the five mid-\nsized cities with the lowest median family income, only Holyoke has seen a sizable percentage population decline.   \nWhile the overall population of these cities generally has not experienced \ndramatic declines, there have been substantial changes in their demographic composition.  \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL October 18, 2014  at 8:30 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY  * \n 8 One change has been the significant increase in Hispanic and Latino populations in many \nof these cities, as seen in Figure 6 .  These cities have often been referred to as “gateway” \ncities because many of them host sizable immigrant populations.  During the decades when manufacturing was growing in New England, many of these immigrants came from Europe; more recently, many of the new immigrants have come from Latin Americ a.  \nThe one exception in the figure, Fall River, reflects that more than half the city’s population traces their ancestry back to the Azorean islands of Portugal.\n7 \nRegardless of their ethnic makeup, it is important to note that the failure of many \nof these  cities to effectively deliver key “backbone” services can have a significant \nimpact on residents.  For example, in Lawrence, the ability of residents to make progress was impeded by the poor performance of the Lawrence Public Schools, culminating in the schools being placed in state receivership.   \nThese local problems are no small matter when you consider that most social and \neducational services are produced, managed, and provided locally.  Local governments and local organizations play key roles in what  is the focus of this conference – equalizing \neconomic opportunity.  As you’ll see in Figure 7 , in Lawrence alone, there are 14 \nlicensed nonprofit center -based preschool programs, 11 nonprofit organizations providing \nsupport to young parents pursuing their  education, and 10 nonprofit organizations that \nprovide ESOL classes.\n8  It stands to reason that local services are likely to have the \ngreatest impact if they can be coordinated effectively and collaboratively – and if local \nprivate, public, and nonprofit resources are working together to address the multifaceted challenges their residents may face.   \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL October 18, 2014  at 8:30 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY  * \n 9 Research by the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston’s Yolanda Kodrzycki and Ana \nPatricia Muñoz found that having effective civic leadership and a common vision wit hin \na city paired with strong cross -sector, collaborative support for that vision can \nsignificantly improve the chances of a city improving its economic circumstances.9  \nTheir research illustrates that a big part of the answer to these complicated and \npersistent challenges facing mid -size cities is people  in multiple sectors working \ncollaboratively with a common vision.  In addition, their research suggests that civic \ninfrastructure is a prerequisite to physical infrastructure, requiring active leadership o f \ncross -sector “muscle,” spirited consensus, and passion and perseverance over the long \nhaul.  Put another way, it may take 10 to 15 passionate but collaborative visionaries \npushing for some 10 to 15 years to achieve transformational change.  \nFor the skept ics among us, allow me to acknowledge the obvious: economic \ndevelopment in these challenged cities will take time.  The task and toil required are not \nunlike the paradox of the long distance runner.  In order to reach the finish line \nsuccessfully, one need s equal amounts of patience and urgency.  What our research \nsuggests is that like -minded local leaders collaboratively focused on an agreed -upon \nvision may be the key ingredient.   \n \nReinventing Cities  \n Figure 8  shows the mid -sized Massachusetts cities with  the largest increase in \nmedian family income, measured relative to the United States as a whole.  Three of the four were relatively prosperous in 1959 and have seen improvements in median family income relative to the United States since then.  However, o ne of those cities, Cambridge, \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL October 18, 2014  at 8:30 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY  * \n 10 stands out as a city that was below the U.S. median family income in 1979, but has done \nespecially well over the past three decades.  In fact, Cambridge was among the 10 mid -\nsized cities with the lowest family income in Massa chusetts in 1979, and has since made \nsignificant progress.    \nClearly, Cambridge has benefited from large and important anchor educational \ninstitutions that have played a significant role in the city’s success.  However, these institutions were in Cambridg e well before 1979, yet only in the past 30 years have we \nseen significant improvements in median family income relative to the United States median.  To be sure, many would cite gentrification as a complicated matter affecting the enhanced performance of some communities over time, Cambridge among them.     While proximity to Boston and its strong educational, financial, and medical \ninstitutions has helped many Massachusetts cities to prosper, there are examples of mid -\nsized cities in New England that have  reinvented themselves in other ways.  Figure 9  \nshows two other mid- sized cities in the region that have suffered major declines in \nmanufacturing, but, as shown in Figure 10, have experienced significantly improved family incomes relative to the United Sta tes median.  Both Portland, Maine, and \nPortsmouth, New Hampshire  – much like Cambridge, Massachusetts  – had median \nfamily incomes well below that of the nation in 1979, but have shown significant improvement since then.  Again, gentrification’s mixed effects and role must be taken into account, as it potentially increases the challenges for low - and moderat e-income \nfamilies in communities that are making progress.  \n Noting that some cities in New England and the nation have succeeded in \nreinventing themselves post -manufacturing, and given our research that highlighted the \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL October 18, 2014  at 8:30 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY  * \n 11 need to have strong cross -sector coll aboration, we at the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston \nconsidered how we could facilitate and support revival in some of our region’s mid- sized \ncities.  The implementation of that vision has been the project we call the Working Cities \nChallenge.10 \n \nWhat Distin guishes “Working” Cities? \n The Working Cities Challenge is an outgrowth of earlier community development \nwork at the Boston Fed.  For example, we participated in a joint Brookings Institution \nand Federal Reserve study on concentrated poverty published in 2008.11  As an \noutgrowth of that project , we began working with the city of Springfield, Massachusetts, \na populous “gateway” city that once had a strong manufacturing base, and studied the civic dynamics in similar mid -sized cities that had experienced success in reinventing \nthemselves post -manufacturing.\n12   \n Looking to translate that research into action, we launched a competition among \n20 mid- sized Massachusetts cities that we identified as having a below -median family \nincome and above -median poverty rates.13   The proposals those cities submitted needed \nto demonstrate strong collaboration between local businesses, nonprofits, and local governments. The cities vied for multi -year grants that would help to support the work \ndescribed in their proposal.  \nInterestingly, in order to get the program up and running, we at the Boston Fed \nneeded to change our own behavior, step out of our comfort zone, and begin to collaborate with cross -sector parties we had not worked with before.  We tried to \n“practice what w e preached” by actively adopting the very collaboration we were \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL October 18, 2014  at 8:30 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY  * \n 12 advocating for in the competition.  Collaborating with outside parties turned out to be a \nmost illuminating experience, one we are still learning from as we consider broadening the program to other states in New England.  \n We didn’t fund the grants ourselves – our private, public, and philanthropic \npartners did\n14 – nor did we choose the winners.15  What we did do was incent the \ndevelopment of the collaborative vision in each city by allowing only one proposal per city and requiring high- level involvement from business, nonprofit, and local government \nleaders.  Proposals could focus on any issue area, as long as they were meant to improve the lives of low - and moderate -income citizens in their commu nity.   \nWhile we were looking for innovative proposals, this was as much about the \nprocess as the project.  By that I refer to the ability of business leaders, government officials, and nonprofit organizations in a particular city to focus on a specific pr oblem \nfacing low - and moderate -income individuals in their city and work collaboratively to \nsolve it.   \nHopefully, this process of working together will provide benefits well after the \nparticular project that the Working Cities Challenge funded is over.  T his is particularly \ntrue in relation to the private sector, which in some cases has not been at the table and \nactively engaged.  \nAs a result of this relatively unconstrained application process, each of the 20 \nWorking Cities put forward a proposal that addr essed specific, systemic challenges facing \ntheir low - and moderate -income residents.  In the western Massachusetts city of Holyoke, \nthe city team focused their proposal on ways to encourage Hispanic and Latino entrepreneurship.  While nearly half of the ci ty’s population identifies as Hispanic or \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL October 18, 2014  at 8:30 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY  * \n 13 Latino, only 9 percent of Holyoke’s businesses are currently Latino- owned.  By \nstreamlining access to the city’s economic development services, the Holyoke team’s \ninitiative aims to bring this figure to 25 percent over the next 10 years.  \nA number of the proposals focused on helping cities make informed decisions \nusing data, a complicated and challenging area for smaller cities.  In Fitchburg, the city is implementing a “report card” for its North of Main neighborhood that tracks municipal indicators including education, public safety, economic development, and housing – to name a few.  They hope to use the results to make better decisions about how the city allocates funding and resources for the neighborhood and it s residents.  \nEarlier in this talk I mentioned the city of Lawrence and the challenges its \nresidents faced due to poor performance in the school system.  Lawrence actually won the top prize in the Working Cities Challenge for a proposal that focused on its  schools in \na unique way.   \nTheir plan aims to strengthen the economic security of parents of children in the \nLawrence Public Schools by creating a network of workforce -supportive services ranging  \nfrom specialized adult education and certificate training,  employer internships, financial \ncoaching, and expanded access to child care – which  is often crucial to helping a parent be able to work more hours.  Lawrence is also committed to making the school \ncommunity open and accessible to Latino residents – hist orically a challenge for many \ngateway cities.  In implementing this comprehensive network of services, the Lawrence team has a goal of raising the income of parents with children in the Lawrence Public School System by 15 percent over a 10- year period.  \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL October 18, 2014  at 8:30 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY  * \n 14 In Chelsea, the team is working to transform the city’s Shurtleff -Bellingham \nneighborhood from a transient, high- poverty area into a neighborhood where residents \nhave the opportunity to climb out of poverty, then choose to stay long- term and invest \ntime and resources.  \nOn Thursday, Chair Yellen and I visited Chelsea to meet with the leaders and \nclients of CONNECT, a consortium of local organizations that works collaboratively to \nprovide integrated employment services for local residents related to economic instability, housing, and financial and educational opportunities.\n16 While there, we were \nable to hear from residents directly about how programs like CONNECT are making a difference in their community, especially for those residents who are trying to enter or re -\nenter the workforce.  I found it very rewarding to be able to talk with Chelsea residents \nand see that the sort of collaboration encouraged by effort s like the Working Cities \nChallenge is indeed having a positive impact on their lives.  \nWe are still in the first year of implementation , and realize that it will take some \ntime to see the full results.  One positive outcome that we have seen so far is that the engaged participation of cities in the competition has encouraged other organizations to underta ke similar endeavors.  While the ultimate socioeconomic impact of this \ncompetition may take years to observe in the data, the initial qualitative results look \npromising.  The Federal Reserve Bank of Boston will be looking to replicate the experience in oth er states in New England, with the unique characteristics of each state \nimpacting the exact design of the competition.  \n \n \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL October 18, 2014  at 8:30 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY  * \n 15 Concluding Observations  \n In summary and conclusion, I would note that a variety of studies have \nhighlighted important interventions tha t can affect economic opportunity.  Most of these \ninterventions – services and education, for example – are produced at the local level, so it \nstands to reason that the effective delivery of such services can be significantly impacted by the effectiveness with which communities and local institutions work together in providing the services.  Money alone is not sufficient.  Many of the Massachusetts cities that have lagged the nation have performed worse over time despite significant expenditure of governmental or nonprofit funds in these cities.   \nOur research at the Boston Fed suggests, in addition, that a crucial factor in these \noutcomes may be the inability of institutions and groups in these cities to mobilize around, support, and pull toward a collabora tive vision for change.  \n This highlights that creating true economic opportunity may require new thinking \nand tactics, and new points of emphasis – such as civic collaboration and leadership – rather than just an increase in funds.  The Boston Fed, sparked by its research that highlighted the long -term benefits of cross -sector collaboration around a common vision, \nis looking to expand the Working Cities Challenge to try to incent communities to help themselves.  \nConcentrated, intergenerational poverty sugge sts that inequality of opportunity is \na community issue.  Most agree that equality of opportunity is a crucial social goal.  Hopefully, research such as that done at this conference and policy experimentation of the sort  promoted by the Working Cities Chal lenge will make noticeable headway in \nattaining this vital goal.  While we must not underestimate the challenges, hopefully we \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL October 18, 2014  at 8:30 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY  * \n 16 will be able to look back a decade or so from now and see significant progress in our \ncommunities and steady improvements in equa lity of opportunity for people.  \nThank you.   \n \n \n                                                 \n \n1 Nor are these issues  just an annual event.  For example, the Boston Fed’s interest in ensuring fair access \nto credit for all individuals was evident in research and analysis in the early 1990s culminating in the \nlandmark study of mortgage lending in 1992 that found that race was being used as a factor in mortgage \nlending decisions.  Nor is it restricted to research, as the Boston Fed worked with banks and community \norganizations to try and make fair lending a reality.  And more recently, the Boston Fed attempted to \nmitigate th e effects of the recent mortgage market crisis by pursuing a variety of programs to help prevent \nunnecessary foreclosures – most notably three large foreclosure -prevention workshops.  \n \n2 Not surprisingly, the Boston Fed’s concern for the unemployed is evide nt when it comes to the \nformulation of national monetary policy.  The Bank has a longstanding emphasis on the employment side \nof the Fed’s mandate that has characterized the policymaking and speeches of the Boston Fed presidents \nsince the 1970s –  Frank Mor ris, Dick Syron, Cathy Minehan, and myself.  \n \n3 For a good overview see Richard Reeve’s essay “ Equality, Opportunity, and the American Dream.”   \n \n4 Ron Haskins and Isabel Sawhill in their book, “Creating an Opportunity Society,” discuss a variety of \neconomic policies that could improve economic opportunity.  Many of the policies would require effective \nprovision of local services.  \n \n5 We define Massachusetts mid -sized cities as cities and towns with a population of 35,000 – 200,000 in \n2010 and a population of at least 30,000 in 1960.  Thirty -three Massachusetts cities and towns meet these \ncriteria: Arlington, Beverly, Braintree, Brockton, Brookline, Cambridge, Chelsea, Chicopee, Everett, Fall \nRiver, Fitchburg, Framingham, Haverhill, Holyoke, Lawrence, Lowell, L ynn, Malden, Medford, New \nBedford, Newton, Peabody, Pittsfield, Quincy, Revere, Salem, Somerville, Springfield, Taunton, Waltham, Weymouth, Woburn, and Worcester.  \n \n6 For this analysis , we used the 2008 – 2010 American Community Survey (ACS) data . \n \n7 http://www.massinc.org/Programs/Gateway -Cities/About -the-Gateway -Cities.aspx  \n \n8 Another consideration is the dissemination of state aid to local communities.  Policy ana lysts in the \nBoston Fed’s New England Public Policy Center (NEPPC) explored this for Massachusetts and found that \nthe current local aid formula effectively gives favorable treatment to communities receiving more existing \naid compared with those receiving l ess or no existing aid. As a fairer alternative, the authors propose d a \nnew approach that considers existing and new aid together in filling the l ocal gap.

I would like to thank Jose f Tosovsky, chairman of the Financial \nStability Institute of the Bank for Internationa l Settlements, for inviting me to this forum \nto discuss financial stability issues.  The Fina ncial Stability Institute serves an important \nrole, increasing awareness of financial stab ility issues and highlighting actions being \ntaken around the world to address some of the weaknesses that became all too apparent \nduring the financial crisis. \n                                                 \n* Organized by the Association of Supervisors of Banks of the Americas, the Basel Committee on Banking \nSupervision, and the Financial Stability Institute. \n\n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL November 5, 2014 at 9 AM U.S. Eastern Time (and 9 AM in Lima, Peru) OR UPON DELIVERY  * \n \n \n  \n 2As I begin, I would note as I always do that  the views I will express today are my \nown, not necessarily those of my colleagues at  the Federal Reserve’ s Board of Governors \nor the Federal Open Market Committee (the FOMC). \nLet me begin by saying that actions taken to  bolster the stability and resilience of \nthe financial infrastructure have frequently focused on the banking  system.  In the United \nStates, for example, significant increases in ba nk capital ratios and important changes in \nthe supervisory process have occurred – st eps that put an empha sis on understanding \ncapital and liquidity conditions  that would occur during stre ssful situations.  I would \nargue that one of the most important i nnovations in bank supervision has been the \nestablishment of credible stress tests.   \nIn terms of preparing bette r for possible stress conditions, supervisors have made \nsignificant progress with organizations focused on traditional deposit-taking and lending activities.  However, there is more work to be done with financial organizations — firms \nthat engage in bank-like activities outside the conventional banking system — that have \nless traditional business models, especially in their sources of funding.  Particular concern \nhas been raised by Federal Reserve officials on the reliance by some financial institutions \non short-term wholesale funding.\n1   \nShort-term wholesale funding has been part icularly important for firms with large \nbroker-dealer activities.  Gi ven their role in making ma rkets, broker-dealers hold an \ninventory of securities.  These securities holdings fr equently are financed by \ncollateralized borrowing commonly called repurcha se agreements or “repos.”  A repo, in \nthis context, would involve a broker-dealer (the cash borrower) selling a security (the \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL November 5, 2014 at 9 AM U.S. Eastern Time (and 9 AM in Lima, Peru) OR UPON DELIVERY  * \n \n \n  \n 3collateral) to an investor (the  cash provider) with an agreement to repurchase the security \nat a later time.  Repos have very short maturities, usually overnight.2   \nThere are three parts of the repo market – first the Tri-Party market, where repos \nare intermediated by two large U.S. “clearing banks”; secondly the General Collateral \nFinance or GCF market, where broker-dealers  finance “general collateral”; and thirdly \nthe bilateral market, where parties engage in repos w ithout an intermediary.   \nPrior to the recent financial crisis, many had assumed that repurchase agreements \nwould be stable during stressful conditions b ecause they are collateralized with a margin \nto cushion possible fluctuations in the price of the underlying collateral.  Unfortunately, a \nlesson learned from the financial crisis was that this important form of short-term wholesale funding was actually not near ly as stable as many had expected. \nToday I will discuss the experience of short-term wholesale funding during the \ncrisis.  I will then explore why the move ment of many broker-dealers into domestic \nholding companies does not obviate the concern over the potentially  adverse financial \nstability risks of short-term wholesale fundi ng.  Finally, I will disc uss related regulatory \nreporting requirements, and argue that greater disclosure of the maturity and collateral \nused in wholesale funding arrangements will enable investors and analysts to better \nunderstand, and make more informed pricing de cisions with respect to, a borrower’s “run \nrisk.” I will suggest that this greater disclosure would be useful  at the legal entity level of \nthe broker-dealer, as well as at  the bank holding company level. \n \n \n \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL November 5, 2014 at 9 AM U.S. Eastern Time (and 9 AM in Lima, Peru) OR UPON DELIVERY  * \n \n \n  \n 4Short-Term Wholesale Funding Du ring the Financial Crisis \nThe assets of broker-dealers grew quite dramatically during the period leading up \nto the financial crisis, as di d broker-dealers’ use of repurchase agreements to finance \nthose assets.3  Figure 1  shows that between 2000 and 2007, both broker-dealer assets and \nthe use of repurchase agreem ents increased by over 150 percent.  While broker-dealer \nassets increased rapidly over the seven-year period, the decline in the wake of the \nLehman Brothers fail ure was precipitous. \nFigure 2  highlights that problems within Lehm an Brothers were troublesome well \nbefore the middle of September 2008 – ba sed on information from the bankruptcy \nexaminer’s report.    In the three-mo nth period between May 30 and August 29 of 2008, \nthere was a significant funding runoff underway  from multiple sources of short-term \nwholesale funding – particularly involving Lehman Brothers’ repurchase-agreement and \nderivatives counterparties.   \nFigure 3  shows the dramatic decline in Lehman Brothers’ repurchase agreement \nfinancing in the Tri-Party repo market as  concerns about a failure became more \nimminent.  While declines in repurchase ag reements had already occurred in July – \nparticularly for repurchase agreements secured by non-U.S. Treasury security collateral – \nthe withdrawal of repurchase financing becam e quite acute for Lehman Brothers in the \nfinal week before its bankruptcy filing.   \nFigure 4  shows the aggregate decline in repu rchase agreements collateralized by \nsecurities not guara nteed by the government4 for the entire Tri-Party repurchase market.  \nDuring the second half of 2008, this market dropped from approximately $600 billion to \n$300 billion.  (Please note that  the chart only includes the Tri-Party repurchase market \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL November 5, 2014 at 9 AM U.S. Eastern Time (and 9 AM in Lima, Peru) OR UPON DELIVERY  * \n \n \n  \n 5and does not include the bilateral repurchase market.)  Not surprisi ngly, the disruption of \nfinancing for collateral not guaranteed by the federal government exacerbated the financing difficulties occurring across many different types of financial instruments as \nthe crisis worsened. \nUnfortunately, no comprehensive pub lic data source exists for the entire  \nrepurchase agreement market by broker-dealer.  Aggregated  information on the Tri-Party \nand GCF repo market is published periodically, but there is little information on bilateral \nrepos.\n5, 6 Thus, even the estimates of the size of the entire U.S. repo market require some \nassumptions.  Still, economists at the New York Federal Reserve Bank have provided an \nestimate of the size of the entire market in 2014.   \nFigure 5  provides their estimates of the com position of the market.  Tri-Party and \nGCF repo activity accounts for about one-h alf of the overall repurchase agreement \nmarket.  However, we do not have other estim ates for all of the various components of \nthe entire market – or good estimates of what is held by particular broker-dealers.  I will say more in a moment about this lack of  comprehensive public data on the market. \nWhat is clear is that the events of 2008 pr esent ample reason to have concerns \nabout short-term wholesale funding.  The pr oblems caused by reduced financing extend \nwell beyond broker-dealers.  Faced with funding problems, many broker-dealers sold \nsecurities under duress at fire-sale prices – causing collateral problems for other buyers \nand sellers of securities. \nAs previously noted, broker-dealers re ly on short-term wholesale funding to \nfinance their securities invent ory.  During the crisis, the larg est U.S broker-dealers (i.e., \nthose affiliated with investment banks) either became bank holding companies or were \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL November 5, 2014 at 9 AM U.S. Eastern Time (and 9 AM in Lima, Peru) OR UPON DELIVERY  * \n \n \n  \n 6acquired by bank holding companies.  Add itionally, many of the other largest broker-\ndealers are owned by foreign bank holding comp anies, and soon will be required to form \nintermediate bank holding companies.  Only a few remaining large broker-dealers are not \npart of either a domestic or  foreign bank holding company.7   \nThat said, I would now like to discuss w hy being part of a bank holding company \ndoes not obviate wholesal e financing concerns. \n \nBroker-Dealers and Bank Holding Companies \nSome may assume that broker-dealer runs should not be a concern, now that most \nof the largest broker-dealers are in bank holdi ng companies.  However, it is important to \nnote that, to protect depositors and the financial well-being of banks, there has \nhistorically been an array of  bank laws and regulations desi gned to, among other things, \nensure bank liquidity – and these longsta nding laws and regulations place significant \nrestrictions on the ability of a bank to fund li quidity problems or ot her activities of its \nnonbank affiliates or the nonbank subsidiaries of its bank holding company.  In addition, \nthe Dodd-Frank legislation has made it even  more difficult for banks to fund their \nnonbank affiliates, even during periods of financial stress. \nThe Federal Reserve has legal authorit y to provide loans to banks facing liquidity  \nproblems but not solvency  issues.8  These so-called Section 10(b) or “discount window” \nloans are available to the banks, but not to the holdi ng company parent or nonbank  \nsubsidiaries.  \nDuring the financial crisis, many nonbank affiliates of bank holding companies \nand nonbank financial institutions had significant liquidity problems.9  Section 13(3) of \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL November 5, 2014 at 9 AM U.S. Eastern Time (and 9 AM in Lima, Peru) OR UPON DELIVERY  * \n \n \n  \n 7the Federal Reserve Act allows the Federa l Reserve to lend to nonbanks under “exigent \ncircumstances.”  Commonly referred to as its “l ender of last resort” authority, that section \nenabled the Federal Reserve to take emerge ncy measures and extend loans to nonbanks, \nsuch as broker-dealers that acted as primar y dealers for the Federal Reserve, during the \ncrisis.   \nWhile lending facilities made available to broker-dealers significantly mitigated \nproblems with broker-dealer financing flows th at were contributing to the crisis, such \nfunding authority is now subject to additional limitations.  In particular, the Dodd-Frank \nAct10 now requires that Federal Re serve facilities or lendi ng programs have broad-based \neligibility and be designe d to provide liquidity to the financ ial system (not assist just one \nindividual firm).  The Dodd-Frank Act also prohibits the use of su ch facilities by firms \nthat are insolvent and requires that such  facilities be approved by Treasury.   \nIn addition, the Dodd-Frank legislation enc ourages supervisory actions that would \nprevent the need for future 13(3) lending facili ties to be established at all.  That is, \nnonbank affiliates of bank holding companies and financial firms that are not banks \nshould have the capacity to fund themselves through stressful situations without the \nexpectation of resorting to Federal Reserve emergency powers.  In addition, the likely \nintent of the legislation is to ensure that such institutions do not take on excessive risk \ntoday based on an assumption that subsequent  severe losses will be backstopped by Fed \nlending.  \nIn addition to the limitations on the Fe deral Reserve’s emergency lending that I \nhave noted, there are also othe r statutory rules and regulatio ns designed to protect banks, \nbut not nonbank affiliates, as shown in Figure 6 .  For example, Sections 23A and 23B of \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL November 5, 2014 at 9 AM U.S. Eastern Time (and 9 AM in Lima, Peru) OR UPON DELIVERY  * \n \n \n  \n 8the Federal Reserve Act are intended to prot ect the bank so that neither a bank nor the \nFDIC deposit insurance fund suffers losses from transa ctions between a bank and its \nnonbank affiliates.  A bank’s extensions of credit  to and purchases of assets from any one \naffiliate are limited to 10 percent of the bank’s capital stock and surplus.11  In addition, \nbank transactions with affiliates need to be done at market terms.12  These laws are \nintended to prevent the bank from being exposed to losses at, or caused by, nonbank \naffiliates.13 \nDuring the crisis, the Federal Reserve granted temporary exemptions from \nSection 23A restrictions, to facilitate the borrowing needs of unaffiliated market \nparticipants.14  In addition, exemptions from the quantitative limits, collateral \nrequirements, and restrictions on “low-quality ” asset purchases were granted to banks in \nSeptember of 2008.15  However, as previously me ntioned, the Dodd-Frank Act was \nintended to further restrict some of the pr ecedents and emergency powers lawfully used \nduring the crisis.  In particular, the FDIC must now concur with any such exemptions, \nand the FDIC may object to th e granting of an exemption if the exemption would present \nan unacceptable risk to the Deposit Insurance Fund.16  Again, these restrictions highlight \nthe need to take actions in normal times, to avoid such exemptions ever being needed in \nthe future. \nFinally, there has historically been an  expectation that bank holding companies \nmust serve as a “source of stre ngth” to their bank subsidiaries .  This was further codified \nin the Dodd-Frank Act.17  Thus, a bank holding company’s support of a nonbank \nsubsidiary would be limited by its primary obligation to support its bank  subsidiaries.   \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL November 5, 2014 at 9 AM U.S. Eastern Time (and 9 AM in Lima, Peru) OR UPON DELIVERY  * \n \n \n  \n 9Overall, the legislation that was designe d to protect banks pre-crisis, and the \nfurther limitations imposed by the Dodd-Fr ank Act, pose significant impediments to \nfuture funding of broker-dealers by the Federa l Reserve or their affiliated bank should \nthey experience a run.  These impediments ma ke it imperative that preventive measures \nbe taken to ensure that in future crises, broker-dealers’ financing mechanisms are robust \nenough to endure potential fina ncial stress.  And clearl y there should not be an \nexpectation that such runs could necessa rily be addressed through the bank holding \ncompany structure.  \nThe Need for More Disclosure on Balance Sh eet Items that are Susceptible to Runs \nBoth the significant reduction in repurcha se agreement financing during the crisis \nand the difficulty in addressing runs thr ough the bank holding company structure provide \na significant motivation for taking appropriate  preventive actions.  Specifically, Federal \nReserve Governor Daniel Tarullo and Chai r Janet Yellen have suggested regulatory \nmeasures such as additional capital charges fo r banks that house significant short-term \nwholesale funding operations. \nWhile these additional regulatory measures  are important, to date there has not \nbeen a significant focus on public and more timely disclosu re of broker-dealers’ \nfinancing activities.  Disclosure has the pot ential to provide better information on the \ndegree of reliance on repurcha se agreements – particular ly repurchase agreements \ninvolving collateral not guaran teed by the federal government – to the institutions’ \nstakeholders interested in the extent of its risk-taking, such as hol ders of its long-term \ndebt.  Because of the lack of comprehensiv e disclosure requirements in place at the time \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL November 5, 2014 at 9 AM U.S. Eastern Time (and 9 AM in Lima, Peru) OR UPON DELIVERY  * \n \n \n  \n 10of the crisis, neither the significant ramp-up in  the use of repurchase agreements nor the \nmovement to repos that were backed by less secure collateral were  obvious to investors.18 \n Let me recognize that disclosure is not a standalone cure-all.  It has the potential \nto be an important supplement to other im portant actions, like capital requirements.  \nFigure 7  shows the line items typically in cluded on the public forms filed by \nbroker-dealers on an annual basis (the SEC’s so-called FOCUS Report, Part III).19  Given \nthat broker-dealers played a key role in the cr isis, and are often very large institutions, it \nmay be appropriate to consider whether mo re complete disclosures by broker-dealers \nwould better leverage the role of investors and analysts in provid ing additional market \ndiscipline.  Such discipline requires more transparency a nd frequency of data reporting \nthan is occurring currently.   \nIn particular, given the emphasis on run ri sks at broker-dealers, it would be useful \nto have far more detailed publicly availa ble data on repurchase agreements used to \nfinance broker-dealers and related affiliates.20  However, for more transparency to be \nbeneficial, the right information needs to be disclosed.  Information – such as repo \ncollateral composition (for example, U.S. Treasury, private colla teralized mortgage \nobligations), haircuts , the counterparty, and maturity st ructure – reported in a timely \nmanner, would provide investor s an opportunity to observe ch anges in financing patterns, \nand might prevent management from taking risk s that its investors ma y deem excessive.   \nHad such information been available prior to the crisis, the reliance on short-term \nfunding based on both government and nongovern ment collateral (the latter meaning \ncollateral not guaranteed by the federal governme nt) would have been apparent and might \nhave resulted in greater ma rket discipline than we saw leading up to the crisis. \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL November 5, 2014 at 9 AM U.S. Eastern Time (and 9 AM in Lima, Peru) OR UPON DELIVERY  * \n \n \n  \n 11While bank holding companies report far more  detail than is found in the FOCUS \nreports, their disclosures likewise include only limited detail on repurchase agreements.  \nBank holding companies’ reliance on short-te rm wholesale funding indicates that further \ndetail on repurchase collateral and maturiti es at the consolidated bank holding company \nlevel would also be useful.  In addition, b ecause of the potential for “window dressing,” \nhaving quarterly peak an d average information as well as  end of quarter information on \nthese positions would be helpful.  However,  such detail would not  cover broker-dealers \nthat are not currently part of bank holding companies – which is why the legal entity \ndetail in the FOCUS reports w ould be particularly important. \nWork has begun to look for opportunities to provide more detail on short-term \nwholesale funding in bank holding company re ports.  I am hoping that this effort will \ndevelop sufficient detail on colla teral type and maturity structure so that risks in this \nmarket can be better assessed, going forward. \n \nConcluding Observations \n During the financial crisis a large number  of broker-dealers either failed, were \nacquired, formed bank holding companies, or needed support from parent companies.  \nThese problems occurred despite the signifi cant intervention to support broker-dealers \nthat was provided during the crisis, in order to restore credit flows in the financial infrastructure.   \nA key element of the problems was the over-reliance on short-term wholesale \nfunding. \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL November 5, 2014 at 9 AM U.S. Eastern Time (and 9 AM in Lima, Peru) OR UPON DELIVERY  * \n \n \n  \n 12 Today I have discussed why potential  runs on large broker-dealers may be \ndifficult to preclude or offset, even if the broker-dealer is in a bank holding company.  \nThe clear intent of the myriad regulations  on bank holding companies and banks is to \nprotect the banks and prevent bank support fo r affiliated nonbank subsidiaries (like \nbroker-dealers) in the bank’s holding company at the expense of the bank.  This \nhighlights the need for additional actions to limit the likelihood of future problems or crises that could require government interventions. \n As noted previously, a significant capita l charge on short-term wholesale funding \nwould certainly help.  In addi tion, much greater disclosure on “runnable” liabilities would \nutilize the power of markets to help curb unhealthy levels of reliance on such funding.  \nMore detailed reporting requirements shoul d include more disclosures on both the \ncollateral composition and maturity st ructure of repurchase agreements.  \nThank you again for inviting me to speak w ith you today about the lessons of the \ncrisis and the as-yet  unfinished work of preventing future problems – in part by \naddressing short-term w holesale funding risks. \n    \n                                                 \n \n1 Governor Tarullo noted in test imony on September 9, 2014:  \n “Federal Reserve staff is currently worki ng on three sets of initiatives to address residual \nshort-term wholesale funding risks. As discussed a bove, the first is a proposal to incorporate the \nuse of short-term wholesale funding into the risk-based capital surcharg e applicable to U.S. \nGSIBs. The second involves proposed modificati ons to the BCBS's net stable funding ratio \n(NSFR) standard to strengthen liquidity requireme nts that apply when a bank acts as a provider of \nshort-term funding to other market participan ts. The third is numerical floors for collateral \nhaircuts in securities financing transactions ( SFTs)--including repos and reverse repos, securities \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL November 5, 2014 at 9 AM U.S. Eastern Time (and 9 AM in Lima, Peru) OR UPON DELIVERY  * \n \n \n  \n 13                                                                                                                                                 \nlending and borrowing, and securities margin lending.” \nhttp://www.federalreserve.gov/new sevents/testimony/tarullo20140909a.htm  \n  \nHe also noted on May 3, 2013:   \"…existing bank and broker-dealer risk-based cap ital rules do not reflect fully the financial \nstability risks associated with SFTs. Accordingly, higher, generally applicable capital charge \napplied to SFTs might be a useful piece of a complementary set of macroprudential measures, \nthough an indirect measure like a capital charge mi ght have to be quite large to create adequate \nincentive to temper the use of short-term wholesale funding.” http://www.federalreserve.gov/new sevents/speech/tarullo20130503a.htm  \n \nChair Yellen noted on July 2, 2014:  \n \"… The Basel III framework also includes liquidity requirements designed to mitigate \nexcessive reliance by global banks on short-term wholesale funding.   “… In addition, measures are being undertak en to address some of the potential sources of \ninstability in short-term wholesale funding markets, including reforms to the triparty repo market \nand money market mutual funds – although progress in these areas has, at times, been \nfrustratingly slow.  \n \"Additional measures should be taken to address residual risks in the short-term wholesale funding markets. Some of these measures – such as requiring firms to hold larger amounts of capital, stable funding, or highly liquid assets based on use of short-term wholesale funding – would likely apply only to the largest, most complex organizations. Other measures – such as \nminimum margin requirements for repurchase agreements and other securities financing \ntransactions – could, at least in prin ciple, apply on a marketwide basis.” \n[http://www.federalreserve.gov/new sevents/speech/yellen20140702a.htm ] \n \nShe also noted, on April 15, 2014:  \"…let me highlight one data point that suggests that there may be net social gains from \nintroducing further reforms to address short-term  wholesale funding risks. In 2010, the Basel \nCommittee assessed the long -term economic impact of stronger capital and liquidity requirements \nfor global banks. Factoring in the Basel III capita l requirements and the NSFR, the Basel study \nsuggested that tightening risk-based capital and liquidity requirements w ould, on net, provide \neconomic benefits, and that benefits  would continue to accrue at ev en higher levels of risk-based \ncapital than are part of Basel III.  \n “While it would be a mistake to give undue we ight to any one study, this study provides some \nsupport for the view that there might be room for stronger capital and liquidity standards for large banks than have been adopted so far.\" [http://www.federalreserve.gov/new sevents/speech/yellen20140415a.htm ] \n \n2 See the paper by Krishnamurthy et al, “Sizing Up Repo” \n(http://www.gsb.stanford.edu/sites/gsb/files/Publication%201.pdf ), which states “Maturities get \ncompressed with the onset of the financial cr isis. Figure 4 illustrates the shortening in the \nmaturity structure of repos during the crisis. In 2007, the 99th percentile of maturity (weighted by \nnotional amount) reached 250 business days, but it subsequently shrank to 60 business days in \n2008. The reduction in maturity is consistent w ith an increased demand for liquidity from cash-\ninvestors, since shorter maturity repo is de-facto more liquid than longer maturity repo.”  Krishnamurthy et al.’s analysis is limited to  MMMFs and securities lending data, which they \nestimate covers more than 50 percent of repo lendi ng that flows into the shadow banking system.  \nImportantly, it does not include bilateral repos. \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL November 5, 2014 at 9 AM U.S. Eastern Time (and 9 AM in Lima, Peru) OR UPON DELIVERY  * \n \n \n  \n 14                                                                                                                                                 \n  \n3 As mentioned in the speech text, there are a lternative repurchase market s that deal with the \ntransfer of collateral and payment somewhat differently.

Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *  \n 1 \n \n \n \n  \n“Implications of Low Inflation Rates for \nMonetary Policy”  \n \n \nEric S. Rosengren \nPresident & Chief Executive Officer \nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston \n \n \nWashington and Lee Unive rsity’s H. Parker Willis \nLecture in Political Economy \n \n \nLexington, Virginia \nNovember 10, 2014 \n \n \n \n \n \nIt is a great pleasure to visit Washin gton and Lee University and have this \nopportunity to talk to students and faculty  about the economy and monetary policy.  The \nFederal Reserve places a high value on transp arency and public understanding, so I am \npleased to be able to share some in sights into our work with you today.  \nI should note, of course, that the H. Park er Willis lecture in political economy is \nnamed for a distinguished re presentative of Washington and Lee and a leader in the \nfounding of the Federal Reserve System, as colleagues like Ben Bernanke have noted \n\n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL November 10, 2014 at 5:10 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *  \n 2from this stage.  Willis served on the National Monetary Commission, which \nrecommended the creation of the Federal Reserve.   And he served as research director at \nthe Federal Reserve from 1918 to 1922.1 \nAs I begin, I would note as I always do that  the views I will express today are my \nown, not necessarily those of my colleagues at  the Federal Reserve’ s Board of Governors \nor the Federal Open Market Committee (the FOMC). \nOne of the consequences that many centr al banks around the world have had to \nface since battling a severe recession in conjunc tion with the financial crisis of 2008 is an \ninflation rate that is too low  rather than too high .  Even though the U.S. economy has \nbeen improving and the FOMC ended its asse t-purchase program last month, we have \nconsistently and persistently undershot the Fe deral Reserve’s 2 percent inflation target \nsince the financial crisis.   \nTo many of you, the idea that inflation could be “too low” may seem puzzling.  \nWhy would it be desirable to push the inflation rate up from its current rate of 1.4 \npercent2 to something a bit higher?  Today I want to talk about the costs of an inflation \nrate that is too low, and thus why it is impor tant that our inflation target be viewed as \n“symmetric” – meaning the Federal Reserve mu st respond as vigorously  to inflation that \nis too low as we have, historically, when in flation has been too high.  I will then suggest \nthat monetary policymakers should remain patient about removing accommodation until it is clear that we are on the path to achiev ing both our 2 percent inflation target and \nmaximum sustainable employment. \nIt may seem counterin tuitive to say that too low  an inflation rate is problematic, so \nlet me describe why this situation can be so  costly.  My first concern with very low \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL November 10, 2014 at 5:10 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *  \n 3inflation rates is that when  the starting point is very low inflation, an unexpected \nweakening of the economy could push inflati on down even further, into a situation of \noutright deflation – that is, a fall in the overall level of pr ices in the economy.  When \nhouseholds and firms expect that prices in the future will be lower than they are at \npresent, they tend to postpone  expenditures, awaiting the lo wer prices.  Historically, \nunder such circumstances, economic activity has tended to remain depressed.   \nIn addition to spending effects, deflation is  particularly problematic for debtors.  \nThe real value of their loan payments rise s over time, making it more difficult to make \nrepayment.    \nFor a real-life example, the long period of mild deflation that Japan just faced was \nalso a period of slow growth in the Japane se economy.  Only recently, with strong policy \nactions taken by the Japanese central bank, has positive inflation been achieved in Japan.  Similarly, there are growing concerns by some  that Europe, too, could experience mild \ndeflation. \nAnother concern is that very low inflati on rates are typically accompanied by very \nlow interest rates. Because nominal interest  rates can’t go below zero, when inflation and \ninterest rates are already quite low, moneta ry policy has only limited room to further \nlower interest rates to offset  negative shocks to the economy.  Another way of thinking \nabout this is that an economy with significant slack may need very low real interest rates \nto return with any speed to full employment.  If the short-term inflation rate is close to \nzero, it’s hard to push real interest rate s much below zero.  Estimates of the costs \nassociated with the zero lower bound before 2007 now seem too low.  Japan’s experience \nseems to corroborate that view. \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL November 10, 2014 at 5:10 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *  \n 4 As a recent case in point, nominal short- term interest rates have been close to \nzero since the fall of 2008 (as Figure 1  shows), leading the Fede ral Reserve to use less \ntraditional monetary policy actions to counteract  the significant slack in the economy.   \nNecessary labor market adjustments can be  more difficult in a very low inflation \nenvironment as well.  Consider some of the nuances of labor markets, as economists view \nthem.  Although not conclusive, there is si gnificant evidence that workers and firms \nappear to resist outright d eclines in nominal wages – ec onomists call this “downward \nnominal wage rigidity.”  Du ring recessions, when demand for workers falls, real wages \nneed to fall to help reduce (that is, employ) the excess supply of labor.  But with wage \ninflation near zero and resistance to pay cuts , a reduction in real wages must primarily \ntake place through rising prices.  In a ve ry weak economy with low inflation, the \nlikelihood that rising prices will produce the ne cessary reduction in real wages is slim.  \nThus, the combination of low inflation and downward nominal wage rigidity likely make \nrecovery from recessions, especially a recove ry in the labor market, more protracted and \npainful.  \nFinally, failing to achieve a clearly st ated inflation target can undermine the \ncredibility of a central bank.  Confidence that a central bank can achieve  its goals helps to \nkeep expectations well anchored.  Failure to  achieve these goals can cause expectations \nabout inflation to become unstable.  In part icular, persistently unde rshooting the inflation \ngoal could cause expectations about future  prices to drift down, bringing along any \nrealized inflation with them, and thus making it even more difficult to push inflation back \nto its 2 percent target. \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL November 10, 2014 at 5:10 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *  \n 5The significant costs associated with low as well as high inflation explain why the \nFOMC has set a 2 percent inflat ion target.  It is a symmetric target in that persistent \ndeviations in either direction should generate a monetary policy response.   \nBoth core and total PCE inflation are currently running somewhat below our 2 \npercent target.  Moreover, in the short-term, falling oil prices  and other commodity prices \n– as well as the appreciation of  the dollar and slow wage growth – are likely to prevent \nmuch progress in returning to our  2 percent inflation target.   \nThese economic conditions should allow monetary policymakers to remain \npatient in removing accommodati on.  I would also note that such patience provides the \nopportunity to better determine how much la bor market slack remains, above and beyond \nthe widely reported un employment rate.  \n \nInflation Forecasts \nMany forecasters expected that as la bor market slack – meaning unemployed, \nunderemployed, or discouraged workers, for example; not to mention those who have \nstopped participating in the formal labor market – declined and was eventually \neliminated, the 2 percent infla tion target would be achieved.  Figure 2  shows the \nSummary of Economic Projections (SEP) fo recasts for PCE inflation and core PCE \ninflation in 2014, made from June 2012 through September 2014.  At the time of the June \n2012 FOMC meeting, the median forecast of FOMC  participants predicted that both PCE \nand core PCE inflation rates would be at al most 2 percent by the end of 2014.  However, \nas the chart shows, the forecast for 2014 infla tion has been gradually declining.  As of the \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL November 10, 2014 at 5:10 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *  \n 6most recent SEP outlook, the forecasted 2014 infla tion rate is not far from the 1.4 percent \ninflation rate that we ha ve had over the past year. \nThe SEP has not been the only forecast th at is too optimistic about how quickly \nthe 2 percent inflation goal would be achieved.  Private sector forecasts have also been \ntoo confident about returning to the target.  As you can see in Figure 3 , the median \nforecast from the Survey of Professional Forecasters in May 2012 actually anticipated \nthat total PCE for 2014 would be above  the 2 percent inflation target.  However, as \nincoming inflation data have consistently fallen  short of 2 percent, the Survey forecasters, \ntoo, have been lowering their forecast for 2014 inflation. \nGiven the normal forecasting errors for pr edicting PCE and core PCE inflation, a \nmiss of half a percent is not th at unusual.  However, a little  more surprising has been how \npersistently we have been undershooting both inflation expectations and our inflation \ntarget, particularly as the unemploymen t rate has fallen more than expected. \nOne possibility for why we have been mi ssing on the Federal Reserve’s 2 percent \ninflation target could be that there remains significant labor market slack.  Figure 4  \nshows that the typical, widely reported m easure of unemployment, also known as the “U-\n3” measure, is currently at 5.8 percent.  While  this is still above my own forecast of full \nemployment – 5.25 percent – there may be even more slack in the labor market than is \ncaptured in U-3.  For example, a broader measure of unemployment called the “U-6,” which includes workers who are part time for economic reasons and workers who are marginally attached to the labor force, still remains elevated.  While U-6 has fallen significantly from its peak after the last recessi on, this measure is still greater today than \nit was at its peak following the prior  recession.  \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL November 10, 2014 at 5:10 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *  \n 7Figure 5  plots the gap between the unemployme nt rate and the so-called natural \nrate of unemployment, and the change in th e core CPI inflation rate from three years \nearlier – for each quarter since 1980.3  The periods when the ga p is positive are periods \nwhen the unemployment rate is higher than the unemployment rate at which the economy \nis considered at full employment.  One of the largest gaps was experienced following the \nfinancial crisis, as the figure shows.   \nDuring periods when the gap is wide, the inflation rate tends to fall over \ntime.  This negative correlation is an imperfect  indicator of inflation changes.  However, \nit does highlight that slack in the econom y tends to place downward pressure on the \ninflation rate over time, which is one reason to expect that as the U.S. economy returns to \nfull employment we may gradually return  to our 2 percent inflation target. \nFigures 2 and 3 showed that expectati ons for 2014 inflation have declined, and \nwith inflation having consisten tly undershot the Federal Reserv e’s 2 percent target, it is \npossible that longer-term infl ation expectations are star ting to decline as well.  Figure 6  \nprovides one way to capture longer-run infla tion expectations.  By  subtracting the 10-\nyear inflation-indexed Treasury yield (TIPS)  from the 10-year Treasury yield, you get a \nmeasure of so-called “break-even” inflation.  That is, this difference represents the \nprevailing inflation rate that  should make you indifferent be tween holding a fixed-rate \nbond and holding a Treasury bond of the same matur ity that floats with the inflation rate.  \nThe latest readings have been at the low end of recent experience.  However, one must be \ncautious to infer too much from Treasury inte rest rates, particul arly given the recent \nvolatility and the “flight to quality” by many global investors that may have temporarily \nreduced Treasury yields. \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL November 10, 2014 at 5:10 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *  \n 8Figure 7  provides a measure of inflation exp ectations from survey data.  The \nsurvey data have not shown the same dec line and look little ch anged from previous \nperiods. \nHowever, it is also possible that temporar y supply shocks rather than changes in \nthe labor markets or inflation expectations can explain the low rates.  I will say more about this in a moment.  \n \nFactors Influencing Recent Measures of U.S. Inflation \n Figure 8  provides the recent movement of oil prices, as measured by West Texas \nIntermediate crude.  As you can see, oil pr ices have recently fallen below $80 a barrel.  \nThis chart also shows that oil prices are qui te volatile.  That is one reason to focus on \ncore PCE inflation – not because oil prices are not important, but because oil can be so \nvolatile that its fluctuations  may not aid in our understa nding the overall movement of \nprices in the aggregate.    \nHowever, as Figure 9  illustrates, domestic  production of oil has increased.  Some \nof the recent decline in oil prices may reflect  the expansions of dr illing practices that \nhave increased the supply of oil.  This may result in recent oil pri ce declines persisting \nfor some time.  Nonetheless, the price m ovements of one commodity, oil, suggest a \nreason to focus more on core measures of inflation.  Figure 10  illustrates that many ot her commodity prices have also been falling.  \nThe slowing of economic growth among many of  our trading partners has reduced the \ndemand for a variety of commodities.  This ha s depressed other material prices, and has \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL November 10, 2014 at 5:10 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *  \n 9occurred at a time when relativ ely plentiful harvests have resulted in declines in many \nagricultural prices.  Figure 11  shows that the exchange rate for the dollar has appreciated, given that \nthe U.S. economy has grown more rapidly than the economies of many of our trading \npartners.  In general, this reduces the price of imported goods, placing a temporary \ndownward pressure on inflation.\n4 \n Figure 12  provides the employment cost index by broad occupational categories.  \nWhile there clearly are specialized skills that  are experiencing significant increases in \nwages and salaries, it is  striking to see no substantial in creases in any particular broad \ncategory.    Figure 13  shows the employment cost index by the four main regions in the \nUnited States.  While particular states w ith a concentration in  oil production have \nexperienced very low unemployment rates and rising wages and salaries, the broader \nregional patterns do not show much eviden ce of a pickup in wages and salaries. \n \nGlobal Inflation Patterns \n Figure 14  shows that Japan, the United States, and Europe have all been \nundershooting their inflation targets.  Japan ha s been able to achie ve positive inflation \nafter a long period of mild deflation by taki ng aggressive monetary policy action, yet it \nstill remains below its stated inflation target of 2 percent (when adjusted for the April 2014 increase in the consumption tax).\n5   European inflation rates have continued to \ndecline, and combined with very weak ec onomic growth, have raised concerns among \nsome observers that the Eurozone could experience mild deflation as well.   \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL November 10, 2014 at 5:10 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *  \n 10In sum, while the United States is  only somewhat below the 2 percent inflation \ntarget, the challenges currently faced by othe r central banks indicate that we should not \nbe complacent about persistently missing our inflation target. \nFigure 15  shows short-term interest rates in Japan, Europe, and the United States.  \nAs weak economic growth and low inflati on during the recovery from the recession \nprompted expansionary monetary policy res ponses, all three centra l banks kept short-\nterm rates at the zero lower bound, leading to the use of less traditio nal monetary policies \nto stimulate growth and attempt a return to inflation targets. \nFigure 16  highlights how low 10-year Treasu ry rates have fallen recently.  \nJapan’s experience and now Europe’s current si tuation both indicate that indifference to \nvery low inflation rates can generate a signifi cant loss of confidence in the ability of a \ncentral bank to hit its inflation goal.  It is  hard to reconcile the market evidence – a 10-\nyear German bond trading around 85 basis poi nts and a 10-year Ja panese bond trading \nbelow 50 basis points – with the publicly a nnounced inflation targets.  Bond market \nevidence suggests that investors have little expectation that 10-year average inflation \nrates will be anywhere close to th eir publicly announced targets.  \nBy the way, these low long-term nominal rates also suggest the relatively limited \nimpact that non-traditional e xpansionary monetary policies can have on lowering long-\nterm borrowing rates in these countries – when  long rates are already close to zero it is \nnot possible to lower the rates much more, b ecause they cannot be negative.  This is \nanother reason for worrying about and wanti ng to avoid protracted periods of low \ninflation and slow growth. \n \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL November 10, 2014 at 5:10 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *  \n 11 \nConcluding Observations \nIn summary and conclusion, I would obser ve that many central banks around the \nworld have persistently missed their stated inflation targets.   Experience in Japan and \nEurope increasingly indicate that it can be cost ly to be complacent when inflation gets too \nlow.  While recent inflation rates in the Un ited States have been higher than in many \ndeveloped economies, it is still important for the Federal Reserve to achieve the 2 percent \ntarget it has set for itself. \nA variety of recent positive supply shocks (e.g. to oil) are likely to result in \nreported inflation rates remaining well belo w the target.  Disti nguishing short-term \nfluctuations in inflation from  longer-run trends is not always  straightforward.  However, \nuntil there is stronger evidence that inflation will return to 2 percent – versus a repeated \nforecast  that it will – I believe monetary po licymakers should remain patient about \nremoving accommodation.        \nThank you.    \n  \n \n                                                 \n \n1 http://www.federalreserve.gov/boardDo cs/speeches/2004/200403022/default.htm  \n \n2 Or 1.5 percent using the Core PCE or the Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index \nexcluding food and energy. \n \n3 Figure 5 uses the Congressional Budget Office’s estimate of the natural rate of unemployment \nwhich is an estimate of the unemployment rate at which the economy is considered at full \nemployment.

Rosengren \nPresident & Chief Executive Officer \nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston \n \n \nGreater Providence Chamber of \nCommerce Policy Forum \n \n \nProvidence, Rhode Island \nJanuary 15, 2013 \n \n \n \n \n I appreciate having been invited to speak ag ain to the Providence Ch amber of Commerce.  \nAs all of you know, Rhode Island was one of the st ates most severely im pacted by the recession, \nand it remains one of the hardest-hit states even at this point in the economic recovery.  Rhode \nIsland is one of only two states th at as of November continued to have a state unemployment rate \nin excess of 10 percent.    \nPersistently high unemployment rates have enor mous personal and societal costs.  So in \nmy view it is critical that public policy continue s to actively support the economy’s return to full \nemployment. \n\n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Tuesday, January 15, 2013 at 8:15 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY* \n \n \n  \n 2Today I would like to highlight  that the Federal Reserve’s approach to monetary policy \nhas played an important role in the recovery we have seen to date.  A nd I would like to explain \nwhy I consider it imperative that monetary po licy continue to activel y support the economy at \npresent – since we continue to have an unacceptably high unemployment rate while, at the same \ntime, inflation is under shooting the Federal Reserve’s 2-percent target.1 \n As always, I would note that my remarks en compass my own views, not necessarily those \nof my colleagues at the Federal Reserve Board or on the Federal Open Market Committee (the \nFOMC).  \nEconomic Conditions \n The U.S. economy has grown at an averag e 2.2 percent annual rate  since the recovery \nofficially began in June of 2009.  Data suggest that  growth was likely a bit below that rate for the \nmost recent quarter, and the employment report for December showed that the national economy \ncontinues to only gradually improve.  Given th at many businesses and households were deferring \ndecisions until there was more clarity on the fisc al outlook, the emerging picture of the fourth \nquarter (stemming from sources such as the em ployment report) is encouraging. The national \nfiscal uncertainty cast a shadow on the economy,  but it seems there have been some signs of \nunderlying strength.  I consider it particularly en couraging that some interest-sen sitive sectors, which are likely \nto be especially responsive to monetary stimulus, are clearly showing themselves to be “on the \nmend.”  Both the housing sector and purchases of  consumer durables have been recovering, in \npart as a response to the accommodative monetary policy the Federal Reserve has been pursuing.   \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Tuesday, January 15, 2013 at 8:15 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY* \n \n \n  \n 3Unfortunately, recent economic improvements have  been partially offset by the deferral \nof spending decisions by households  and firms.  In all likelihood, these deferrals result in part \nfrom uncertainty over national fiscal policy, as well as  from the impact of fiscal austerity that has \nalready taken place – particularly at the state and local government levels.   If some of the \n“headwinds” from fiscal austerity discussions here  and in Europe abate, we should begin to see \ngrowth come in at a pace that is above the ec onomy’s long-run potential growth rate.    Such \ngrowth would bring about both economic expans ion and improvements in labor markets.  \n  \nInterest sensitive sectors are responding to monetary policy \n The sectors of the economy that are showi ng the most improvement recently are those \nthat economists generally consider to be the mo st responsive to monetary policy and interest \nrates.  Particularly notable  is the improvement in the outlook for the housing market.  Figure 1  \nshows growth in real residential i nvestment compared to growth in real GDP.  Over the past year \nreal GDP growth has averaged 2.6 percent.  In  contrast, growth in residential investment \noccurred at much higher rates, and I expect this positive momentum to continue through 2013. \n Figure 2  provides the rationale for my optimism about residential investment.  Housing \nprices in many parts of the country have begun to rise, and although it is not broken out on the \nchart, this includes prices in some  of the areas that were hardest hit by declines in housing prices.  \nIn addition, mortgage rates remain near their cy clical lows and well below the average mortgage \nrate experienced over the past 25 years.   With prices edging up and intere st rates at historic \nlows, there is now something of an incentive for a potential  home buyer to actively pursue \nbuying a home.  This is the case because both mort gage rates and house pri ces could be higher if \npotential buyers delay th eir purchase decisions.   \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Tuesday, January 15, 2013 at 8:15 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY* \n \n \n  \n 4This current dynamic substantially improves th e outlook for housing in my view, together \nwith the fact that houses have become more affo rdable.  The ratio of house prices to rents – a \nsummary measure of the cost of owning versus renting – has fallen back to traditional levels after \nrising to significant heights during the housing bubble.  Finally, in th e wake of the financial crisis \nand recession, many people postpon ed creating new households as they sought to improve their \nfinancial position.  But there has been an im provement in household formation recently and \nmany of these new households will  be potential home buyers.   \n Figure 3  shows that consumer-durable purchases ha ve also increased, in part as a result \nof the very low interest rate environment.  C onsumer-durable purchases have been a source of \nstrength over the past year, a nd have grown much more quickly  than real GDP.  I expect \nconsumer-durable purchases to continue to be a source of strength over 2013.   \nOne particular area of rapid grow th has been new car purchases ( Figure 4 ).  Recent \npurchases may have something to do with the fact that the average age of cars on the road is now \n11.1 years.2  Some potential car buyers surely po stponed decisions until the economic outlook \nwas clearer.  So we are seeing a need to re place some aging cars, along with particularly \nattractive terms available because of the low intere st rate environment.  The result was purchases \nof cars and light trucks at a seasonally adjusted  annual rate of well over 15 million in November \nand December.  However, a potential concern is that  the payroll tax increases that were part of \nthe recent tax agreement will impact the real di sposable income of potential buyers.  Partially \noffsetting this had been the lower average gas pr ices in the fourth qua rter, although they have \nrisen somewhat, recently.  \nSo overall, I see monetary policy having an impact, in encouraging the purchase of \ninterest-sensitive assets like homes, cars, and consumer durables.  The most interest-sensitive \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Tuesday, January 15, 2013 at 8:15 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY* \n \n \n  \n 5sectors have been responding to  the monetary stimulus from th e Fed, and this stimulus has \nprovided a major source of strength for the economy la st year.  And it is like ly to be a source of \nsupport in 2013.   \nUnfortunately, the strength in interest-sensitiv e sectors is partially offset by weakness in \nother areas of the economy.  In particular, wh ile the country certainly  needs to get to a \nsustainable long-term fiscal pat h, the direct and indirect imp acts of recent fiscal austerity \ndeliberations have in my view been one reas on that the economy has not snapped back more \nquickly. \n \nFiscal policy, policy uncertainty, and Europe remain potential constraints \n Indeed, a major source of economic weakness during the recovery has been the need for \nstate and local governments to cut budgets.3  Whatever your views on the political economy of \ngovernment spending, in the short term fiscal au sterity removes spending from the economy.  In \nmany cases this drop in public spending increase s unemployment as teachers, police, and other \nworkers are laid off.   \nIn part due to the weakness in housing that strained state and local government finances, \nstate and local government spending has been a large drag on the economy.  This spending \naccounts for close to 12 percent of the goods and services purchased  in the economy.   \nAs Figure 5  illustrates, while state and local government spending remained a drag in \nlate 2011 and the first half of last year, there was actually a slight increas e in real state and local \ngovernment spending in the third quarter of last year.  Many expect that state and local spending \nwill increase modestly this year , too.  Federal spending has been more volatile, but generally has \nbeen a source of weakness as a compone nt of economic activity as well.   \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Tuesday, January 15, 2013 at 8:15 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY* \n \n \n  \n 6Since federal spending accounts for roughly 8 percent of the goods and services \npurchased in the economy, this is a major source of uncertainty for 2013.  Given the large fiscal \ndeficits still being run, the pro cess by which the nation can reac h a more sustainable long-term \nfiscal policy remains rather uncertain.  What does seem certain is that there will be cuts in \ngovernment spending which, like higher taxes, will by the simple math of the GDP calculation \nslow down overall economic growth.   \nThere is substantial uncertaint y over the fate of federal government grants to state and \nlocal governments.4  Substantial cutbacks in these grants  would have a ripple effect on the \neconomy.  Similarly, there is the i ssue of potential federal tax base broadening in order to reduce \nthe federal budget deficit.  This will have implications for business and family budgets. \nWhile the need for long-run sustainable fiscal  policy is both clear and uncontroversial, I \nbelieve it is important to achieve sustainability in a way that does  not risk the tentative economic \nimprovements we have experienced to date.  One area that has probably been impacted  by the uncertainty surrounding fiscal policy \nhas been business investment, shown in Figure 6 .  Nationally, business investment had been a \nsource of strength in the early stages of the recovery, but ca pital spending by firms weakened \nsignificantly in the third quarter of last year – as many firms s ought more clarity on government \ntax and spending decisions before committing to long-term investments.  Fiscal uncertainty \ntherefore accounts for at  least some share of the recent weakness in business spending, and \nunfortunately this potential cause for weakness in business spending is likely to persist this year. \n A third source of weakness remains the weak outlook for many of our trading partners, as shown in Figure 7 .  Both Japan and Europe have grown more slowly than the United States.  \nAdditionally, Japan still struggles with a serious deflation problem, and Europe continues to \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Tuesday, January 15, 2013 at 8:15 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY* \n \n \n  \n 7address fiscal imbalances in many of its periphera l countries.  Both regions are also experiencing \naging populations, demographically speaking, whic h brings some difficu lt fiscal and economic \nchallenges.  \n Despite these headwinds at home and abroad, I do expect improvement in U.S. economic \ngrowth this year.  While in the first half of 2013 I think the economy is lik ely to grow at roughly \nits potential level of growth, I e xpect growth in the second half of  the year to be closer to 3 \npercent – assuming that headwinds from fiscal imbalances around the world are not resolved in \neconomically disruptive ways. \n \nBoth inflation and unemployment remai n far from long-run FOMC estimates \n Figure 8  shows the U.S. inflation experien ce since 2003.  While many critics of \nmonetary policy have been concer ned with inflationary pressures,  through most of  the recovery \ncore PCE inflation has remained below the Federa l Reserve’s 2 percent target.  Notably, despite \nthe rapid growth of the central bank’s balanc e sheet in 2008, as well as  the balance sheet’s \ncontinued growth more recently, there ha s been no upward trend in inflation.  Total  PCE \ninflation is only 1.4 percen t over the past year and core PCE inflation is at 1.5 percent.    \nSo current inflation is well below the Fed’s target, and e xpected inflation5 is well below \nlevels that the FOMC has stated would gene rate a discussion of lifting short-term rates.6  Being \nmore than half a percent below our target for PCE inflation highlights why I believe aggressive \nmonetary policy remains appropriate, given that the 7.8 percent unemployment rate is well above \nwhere the FOMC expects the unemploymen t rate to settle in the longer run. \n The national unemployment rate has fa llen during the recovery, as shown in Figure 9 , \nand in fact payroll employment growth has av eraged 151,000 jobs over the past three months.  \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Tuesday, January 15, 2013 at 8:15 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY* \n \n \n  \n 8Nonetheless, the societal costs to elevated unemp loyment rates that are falling only slowly show \nwhy accommodative monetary policy is  both appropriate and needed.   \nFigure 10  shows employment in the constructio n and consumer durable sectors as a \nshare of the U.S. labor force.  By our calcula tion, if construction employment returned to its \n2004 levels and durable goods manufacturing regained half of the jobs lost since 2004, the \nunemployment rate would be 6.5 percent (mean ing an additional 2.1 million people would be \nemployed).7 \nWhile interest-sensitive sectors are one of the areas of growth, a more rapid return to the \nmore normal employment shares for those sector s would significantly improve job prospects for \nworkers that have been unemployed or underemp loyed.  Construction and durable goods are both \nindustries that have provided employment oppor tunities for some with less educational \nattainment, an area of particularly elevated unemployment rates (as shown in Figure 11) .  A \nfaster recovery in construction and durable goods would help re-employ those working in sectors \nof the economy that have suffered greatly during th e recession and the painfu lly slow recovery.   \n \nConcluding Observations \n In conclusion I would just reiterate my vi ew that continued mone tary accommodation is \nabsolutely appropriate and indeed needed as long  as we are projected to miss on both elements of \nthe Fed’s dual mandate, inflation and employment.  Currently infl ation is somewhat below our 2 \npercent target, and unemploym ent is well above a longer -run sustainable rate.   \nAs the recent FOMC statement highlighted, monetary policy should be guided by current \nand future economic outcomes, not calendar date s.  Interest-sensitive sectors have been \nresponding to accommodative policy, and we shoul d all continue to encourage a quicker \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Tuesday, January 15, 2013 at 8:15 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY* \n \n \n  \n 9recovery in those sectors.  If we were able  to see construction a nd durable-goods production \nreturn to a more normalized share of the work force, it would have a meaningful impact on \npotential employees in those interest-sensitive  sectors and also on th e broader national labor \nmarkets.  \nAgain I thank you for inviting me to speak with you today.  And particularly in light of \nthe challenges Rhode Island has encountered in r ecent years, I wish you all an improved year in \n2013.   \nThank you.  \n \n \n                                                 \n \n1 As measured by Personal Consumption Expenditures or PCE. \n \n2 As of July 2011. \n \n3  A new report from the Rockefeller Institute presents  information on \"unprecedented\" cuts in state-local \ngovernment employment [http://www.rockinst.org/pdf/government_finance/2013-01-09-State-\nLocal_Government_Employment.pdf].  The report notes that reductions in state and local government employment between August 2008 and November 2012 in Rhode Island were second largest of all the states in percentage terms \n(see Table 4 of the report).  Connecticut and Vermont were also in the top 10 in this regard. \n \n4 The Pew Center on the States calculates that the federal grants subject to sequestration amount to about 6.5 percent \nof state government revenues nationwide.  \n5 The statement refers to a situation where “…inflation betw een one and two years ahead is projected to be no more \nthan a half percentage point abov e the Committee’s 2 percent longer-ru n goal, and longer-term inflation \nexpectations continue to be well anchored.” \n \n6 http://www.federalreserv e.gov/newsevents/press/monetary/20121212a.htm  \n \n7 This considers that there is a secular decline in durable-goods manufacturing.  If durable goods employment \nreturned to its 2004 levels as well, the unempl oyment rate would fall further, to 6.0 percent.",

Eastern T ime OR UPON DELIVERY  * \n 1  \n \n  \nComments on the Paper  \n“Crunch Time: Fiscal Crises and the Role \nof Monetary Policy”   \n  \nEric S. Rosengren  \nPresident & Chief Executive Officer  \nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston  \n \n \nU.S. Monetary Policy Forum  \n \nNew York, New York  \nFebruary 22, 2013  \n \n \n The paper “Crunch Time: Fiscal Crises and the Role of Monetary Policy” by \nGreenlaw, Hamilton, Hooper, and Mishkin provides both a theoretical and empirical look \nat the fiscal challenges facing many advanced economies.  The first part o f the paper \nfocuses on the sustainability of current trends, given the number of countries with high levels of fiscal debt to GDP and serious trade imbalances.   \nThe paper makes some observations with which I concur:  \n1. That unsustainable fiscal policies need  to be made sustainable.  \n2. That the “tipping point” for fiscal policies in many developed countries should be an area of concern and continued attention. \n\n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, February 22, 2013 at 10:15 A .M. Eastern T ime OR UPON DELIVERY  * \n 2 3. That the tipping point can be difficult to precisely determine for individual \ncountries, but the range o f debt -to-GDP levels in many advanced economies \nshould make policymakers attentive to imbalances.  \nI would like to split my discussion of the paper into two parts.  First , I will discuss \nthe authors’ empirical work on tipping points.  In that discussion I w ill emphasize that the \nempirical work is a good first step in analyzing the potential of reaching a tipping point, but that the empirical work would probably benefit from a more extensive examination of other factors that influence tipping points.   \nIn the  second part of my comments today I will discuss the costs and benefits of \nthe large- scale asset purchase (LSAP) program as an instrument of monetary policy.  \nWhile remittances – which the authors focus on –  are one potential factor worth \nconsidering when estimating the costs of this program, I will suggest that a fuller set of \nbenefits and costs of the program for the economy are needed.  \nAs always, I would note that the views I express here today are my own, not \nnecessarily those of my colleagues at the Federal Reserve Board of Governors or on the Federal Open Market Committee (the FOMC).  \n \nEmpirical work on tipping points  \nThe paper provides an empirical model of long- term government bond rates.  The \nbasic model estimates the government bond rate as a functi on of debt to GDP (both net \nand gross), the current account deficit, and time and country dummy variables.  This model is in the spirit of much  literature that looks at the probability of a sovereign default \nor tries to empirically estimate sovereign debt default premiums.  While much of the \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, February 22, 2013 at 10:15 A .M. Eastern T ime OR UPON DELIVERY  * \n 3 earlier literature was focused on problems with sovereign default for less developed \ncountries, this study focuses on the potential for sovereign default premiums to rise in a set of advanced economies.      \nFrom this r ather parsimonious model the authors draw a number of conclusions.  \nIn particular, that at the level of current account deficits and debt -to-GDP ratios currently \nexperienced in many advanced economies, the risk of rising sovereign default premiums is quite  high.  Furthermore, if unaddressed, these premiums could reach a tipping point \nthat becomes unsustainable.  \nWhile this degree of parsimoniousness in a model can be a virtue, I would suggest \nthat if there are important omitted variables from the empirical w ork then the coefficient \nestimates can be biased, and the effects attributed to the variables in the model can be a \nproxy for effects that are really driven by movements in the omitted variables.  Because \nthe model includes both dummy variables for countri es and time, the omitted variables \nwould need to be variables that could drive long -term rates that vary over time and by \ncountry.  How likely is that to be the case with this simple regression?  \n Consider the example of Ireland.  Figure 1  shows that in 2006 Ireland had a very \nlow debt -to-GDP ratio.  In fact, debt to GDP was substantially lower than that of the \nU.S., U.K., and France.  The current account deficit was better than that of the United States, similar to that of the U.K., and somewhat worse than that of France.  Despite this relatively sanguine situation in 2006, Ireland was close to the tipping point.  Debt to GDP was about to rise quickly, as seen in Figure 2 , and Ireland was about to lose the ability to \nissue long -term debt.  \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, February 22, 2013 at 10:15 A .M. Eastern T ime OR UPON DELIVERY  * \n 4 The problem in Irel and was that while fiscal debt was well controlled, the country \nwas facing a serious financial stability problem.  So, what type of financial stability \nvariables might capture the impending tipping point in a way that is not captured by the simple empirica l model?   \nOne example of a potentially important omitted variable is the financial strength \nof the banking sector .  For example, non- performing assets of the banking sector relative \nto GDP would capture the impact of building banking pressures. In Ireland, banking \nproblems rather than fiscal problems were an important driver in hitting the tipping point.  Another variable that varies over time and by country would be the percentage change in real estate prices or possibly the difference between the return on owning and the return on renting.  These types of variables would try to capture the growing risk of bubbles in Ireland and Spain. \nA second set of potential omitted variables relates to the political determinants of \nrisk premiums.  One frequently  sees that credit default rates spike around elections, and \nthat countries that are politically destabilized have difficulty generating the political will to address problems – particularly if public opinion is as fragmented as the political process.  This  might be captured by how frequently national elections were held over the \npast four years , or by other political variables capturing the difficulty in obtaining a stable \nmajority political party in some countries at some times.   \nAnother political variabl e that might be relevant is a variable that captures \nwhether there is stable fiscal federalism in a country.  For example in Spain, debt and banking problems have been exacerbated by the reality of regions that were autonomous \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, February 22, 2013 at 10:15 A .M. Eastern T ime OR UPON DELIVERY  * \n 5 but not necessarily fiscally responsible.  A variable that might capture this impact is state \nand local government debt to GDP. \nA third set of potential omitted variables would reflect labor market conditions .  \nWith a currency union, persistent differences in competitiveness can push countries to the \ntipping point.  Measures of labor market productivity might capture this impact, which \nmay vary over countries and over time.  Another potential important variable would be differences in unfunded pension liabilities relative to GDP.  Countries with growing unfunded pension liabilities relative to GDP may need to eventually raise government debt to fund these liabilities, pushing a country to the tipping point. \nA variety of other potential omitted variables could be explored.  Credit defaul t \nswap rates tend to move as countries approach high rollover periods.  A debt management variable might capture this rollover risk by looking at short -term debt \nrelative to GDP.  And demographic variables may also be relevant.  Countries with fast -\ngrowing, well -educated populations may be less at risk of tipping points than countries \nwith declining populations that are not well educated.   \nWhile this is not an exhaustive list of omitted variables, it does highlight that such \na pared -down model may ignore i mportant drivers of tipping points.  In addition, one \ncannot be sure that the coefficients used in simulations might not change significantly with a more richly specified model.  \nWhile this paper provides a good discussion of tipping points, the coefficient s and \nsimulations should be viewed as indicative of a more general point – that policymakers should consider how a variety of public policies, including fiscal policies, can influence tipping points. \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, February 22, 2013 at 10:15 A .M. Eastern T ime OR UPON DELIVERY  * \n 6  \nBenefits and Costs of LSAPS  \n The final section of the p aper discusses the expansion of the Federal Reserve’s \nbalance sheet.  It highlights a potential problem – that if monetary policy is successful in \nreturning us quickly to full employment, or if interest rates rise for other reasons such as reaching a tippi ng point, remittances to the Treasury would be impacted.  The baseline \nscenario the authors provide reflects gains overall for the LSAP, but under the authors’ most pessimistic scenarios significant losses are generated.   \nUnfortunately, this discussion does not do justice to the policy trade -offs, in my \nopinion.  To take them into account, ideally one would do a more complete comparison of how the economy and fiscal policy would evolve with and without large -scale asset \npurchase (LSAP) programs in place.  \n The purpose of the LSAP is to reduce long -term interest rates to stimulate the \neconomy.  Analysis of the LSAP program requires looking at more than remittances.  Ideally one would start with how well policy – with and without LSAPs – fulfills the Federal R eserve’s dual mandate, provided by Congress.  Even if one wanted to focus on \nthe more narrow fiscal impact, I believe one would need a much fuller analysis.  And to capture the benefits  of the LSAP you need a fuller model.  One of the \nmodels currently used by the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston provides a relatively conservative estimate of the economic benefits of a hypothetical additional $750 billion \nLSAP.  Based on historical experience, the model implies that such a purchase would lower long -term rates by 20 to 25 basis points, relative to not making the additional \npurchases.  The impact of this large a reduction in long -term rates is a cumulative gain in \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, February 22, 2013 at 10:15 A .M. Eastern T ime OR UPON DELIVERY  * \n 7 real GDP, relative to the base, of 1.6 percent or $260 billion. In our model such a \npurchase also results in a decline in the unemployment rate of 0.25 percent or 400,000 jobs.  Some of the models we run provide a larger impact to such purchases. \nNonetheless, such estimation provides a baseline for considering the economic \nbenefits of additional purchase s.  These estimates are subject to a considerable degree of \nuncertainty, and the impact could easily be higher or lower than that implied by our model.  However, based on our statistical work using historical data, we believe these are reasonable estimates  of the benefits.  \n Even if one wanted to focus on the fiscal impact of the LSAP program, I would \nsuggest that the impact goes beyond remittances provided to the Treasury.  The first effect would be to examine the path of interest rates on government debt w ith and \nwithout the LSAP program.  Since the LSAP reduces interest rates, such a simulation would show that the debt -to-GDP ratio is reduced by the lowered cost of financing fiscal \ndeficits as a result of the LSAP program.   \nThe second fiscal impact would be from faster economic growth.  Faster \neconomic growth produces more tax revenue and, by reducing unemployment, reduces government entitlement expenditures on programs such as unemployment insurance.  Thus, LSAPs actually produce a much more positive fisc al impact than the authors \nsuggest.  \nMoreover, the evaluation of the program needs to include the contributions of \nLSAPs to achieving the goals of the dual mandate for U.S. monetary policy.

As a result, fiscal and monetary policymakers need to be mindful of the potential of their actions to impact tipping points.   \nBut I hope my discussion today has highlighted that, with respect to monetary \npolicy, the LSAP program improves the broader fiscal outlook by lowering interest rates and providing more economic growth.

Bank regulation before the \nfinancial crisis had become focused on usi ng risk weighting to determine appropriate \nregulatory levels of bank capital.  However, the risk weights on certain assets did not perform \nas expected when mortgages with low risk we ights became the epicenter of problems, when \nmany securities that had high ratings and low capit al charges fell dramatically in price, and \nwhen the originate-to-distribute (versus originate and hold) model1 of lending was exposed as \nnot distributing risk as widely as assumed.   \nAssets with high ratings received little  supervisory attenti on, as risk-focused \nsupervision focused on lower-quality assets.  And off-balance-sheet  exposures received \ninsufficient supervisory scrutiny.  Supervisors ga ined a false sense of comfort from models \nthat aimed to look far out into the so-called ta il of banks’ potential lo ss distributions.  But, \nthese models failed to explicitly consider what would occur during times of severe \nmacroeconomic stress.   \nIndeed it seems in hindsight that the very  concept of financial stability was poorly \nunderstood before the financial crisis.   Too lit tle attention was devoted  to the consequences \nof large institution failures, as the impact of such failures had not been fully considered in a \nway that adequately reflected a broader understa nding of interconnected relationships.   While \nliquidity had been receiving more attention at  commercial banks, insufficient attention was \ngiven to the potential for runs on other financ ial institutions (for example broker-dealers) or \nproducts (such as money market mutual funds).   Run risk was also badly underestimated in \nstructured investment vehicl es and asset-backed commerci al paper (ABCP) conduits, which \nbecame difficult to finance during the crisis. \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL 9:15 AM on Monday, February 25,  2013 in Seoul, Korea or Upon Delivery, and \n7:15 PM on Sunday, February 24, 2013 U.S. Eastern Time* \n 3As a result of these important crisis less ons, dramatic changes have been made.  The \nDodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consum er Protection Act of 2010 (the DFA), in \nconjunction with Basel III capital standards, significantly incr eased the quantity and quality of \ncapital expected to be held by banks.  The intr oduction of stress tests, mandated by the DFA, \nincreased attention on whether capital will be sufficient during stressful situations.  While \nrules have not yet been finalized in the U.S ., there will be additional capital charges for \nsystemically important financial institutions.  In addition, as required by the DFA, the largest \nbanks have already submitted plans describing how they may be resolved should that be \nnecessary. \nGiven the rapid changes occurring in s upervision and regulation, some commenters \nhave argued that the regulato ry pendulum has already overcom pensated, and that capital \nrequirements are increasing too much and too fast.  In particular, given th e fragile state of the \nrecovery that has occurred in most advan ced economies, some argue that new capital \nrequirements are overly conservative relative to  historical experience and their imposition \ncould stall the economic recovery.   \nToday, I will briefly examine the evidence for these arguments in the United States.  I \nwill first examine whether regulatory capital thresholds are too high, based on evidence from the financial crisis which will be more fully described in a forthcoming Federal Reserve Bank of Boston working paper.  The results of that work will highlight that capital depletion during the financial crisis was extensive, and occurr ed relatively quickly, for many of the largest \nfinancial institutions in the United States – whic h is why it is critically  important to examine \nwhether large financial institutions are holding sufficient capital.   \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL 9:15 AM on Monday, February 25,  2013 in Seoul, Korea or Upon Delivery, and \n7:15 PM on Sunday, February 24, 2013 U.S. Eastern Time* \n 4I will argue that the improvement s in capital ratios that have occurred since the crisis \nare quite striking and have placed the U.S. economy in a better position to finance the \nrecovery going forward.  If, howev er, enhanced capital were the only regulatory response to \nthe crisis, then our analysis would suggest th at the size of the “SIFI surcharge” could be \ninsufficient.  But in conjunction with the SIFI surcharges, regulators have undertaken several \nother significant reforms – includi ng liquidity standards, stress te sts and resolution plans.  Our \nresults highlight the importance of taking this multi-pronged approach.   \nAnd contrary to arguments put forth by so me commenters, our results suggest that \neven under the current multi-pronged approach, th e current calibration of the SIFI surcharge \ndoes not appear excessive.  Throughout I will argue  that as we better understand systemically \nimportant financial institutions , we may want to better integr ate lessons from stress testing \nand resolution procedures into capital requirements for the largest banks. \n \nI. Capital Depletion at Systemically Important Institutions During the Financial Crisis  \n A paper that will soon be released by the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston uses \na panel of large, systemically important banks  to examine the magnitude of capital erosion \nthat occurred during the financia l crisis.  The panel includes banks  that failed, banks that were \nmerged into other institutions, a nd banks that survived the crisis intact.  The analysis uses a \nvariety of adjustments to make the accounti ng measures of capital consistent across \ninstitutions – including removi ng sources of direct government capital support, adjusting for \nstructural changes to the firm, and making acco unting adjustments for firms that were not \nbank holding companies throughout the period.2   \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL 9:15 AM on Monday, February 25,  2013 in Seoul, Korea or Upon Delivery, and \n7:15 PM on Sunday, February 24, 2013 U.S. Eastern Time* \n 5The paper examines how much Tier 1 common e quity ratios deterior ated (the “capital \nerosion”) during each institution’s crisis period – defined as the period during the financial crisis when the institution suffered its largest capital erosion.\n3 \n The results are shown in Figure 1.  Not surp risingly, those institutions with the largest \ncapital erosion tended to be in stitutions that merged or fa iled during the crisis.  These \ninstitutions tended to have a heavy exposure to residential real estate, like Washington Mutual \nand Countrywide, or tended to have a business m odel particularly susceptible to runs because \nof dependence on wholesale funding – such as the investment banks Lehman Brothers and \nMerrill Lynch.  The loss of capital during this period is st riking, and underscores how much \ncapital can be depleted during an unusually severe financial crisis. \n Figure 2 shows the erosion of Tier 1 common equity relative to buffers being used in \nthe Basel III framework.  During the stress te st exercises associated with the Federal \nReserve’s annual Comprehensive Capital Adeq uacy Review (CCAR) program we have \nrequired that bank capital exceed 5 percent Ti er 1 common equity over the forecast horizon, \nbased on the premise that such a buffer would be  required for financial firms to fully operate \nand maintain investor and counterparty confiden ce during stressful periods.  Basel III sets the \nminimum Tier 1 common equity plus the cons ervation buffer at 7 percent.  Furthermore, \nunder Basel III, systemically important financ ial institutions are expected to maintain \nadditional buffers of 1 to 2.5 percentage points.   This heightened standard provides capital \nbuffers of 200 basis points, 300 basis points, and 450 basis points above the Tier 1 common \nequity benchmark used during the stress tests.   \nFor the 26 large banks examined in the Boston Reserve Bank’s study, half had losses \nbelow the 200 basis point buffer.  That is, gi ven the losses experien ced during the financial \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL 9:15 AM on Monday, February 25,  2013 in Seoul, Korea or Upon Delivery, and \n7:15 PM on Sunday, February 24, 2013 U.S. Eastern Time* \n 6crisis, which was quite severe, half of the largest banks – if they held at least 7 percent Tier 1 \ncommon equity – would have remained above th e 5 percent Tier 1 co mmon ratio during their \nperiod of most severe capital er osion during the crisis.  On the other hand, this also highlights \nthat for some banks, such a buffer would not have been sufficient.  Turning to those financial institutions with  the largest capital erosion, eight of the 26 \nbanks would have had losses that exceeded 450 basis points.  Such losses would have \nexceeded the buffers provided by the currently proposed maximum \"SIFI surcharge\" (for systemically important financial institutions)\n4 and conservation buffer, and would have caused \ncapital to fall below the 5 percent tier 1 comm on equity floor that has been used in the CCAR \nstress tests unless banks were holding capital above the regulatory required minimum.  This \nhighlights that while the capital buffers should provide significantly gr eater capital than was \nheld prior to the crisis, the capital buffers do not seem excessive given the losses experienced \nduring the financial crisis at some of our largest institutions.   \nWhile such results arguably substantiate the need for relatively large SIFI surcharges, \nhigh capital levels alone are not  enough.  Our results highlight the need for a multi-pronged \napproach that employs newly-developed superv isory tools – including st ress tests, liquidity \nstandards, and resolutio n plans – in conjunction with capital charges. \n \nII. Improvements in the quality and quantity of capital \n Figure 3 shows how dramatic the improvement in capital ratios has been at large U.S. \nfinancial institutions.  For example, the Tier 1 common capital ratio aggregated across 15 large U.S. banking organizations fell to close to 5 percent in late 2008.\n 5  However, during the \neconomic recovery these institut ions have significantly improve d their Tier 1 common capital \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL 9:15 AM on Monday, February 25,  2013 in Seoul, Korea or Upon Delivery, and \n7:15 PM on Sunday, February 24, 2013 U.S. Eastern Time* \n 7ratio, to above 10 percent.  The broader definitions of capital show similar strong \nimprovement relative to pre-crisis norms.  In addition, Figure 4 highlight s that the quality of capit al has also significantly \nimproved.  Tier 1 common capital accounts for a larg er share of total risk-based capital, as \nshown in the top chart.  Tangible common equit y, a narrow definition of capital shown in the \nbottom chart, has improved significantly since the fourth quarter of 2008.  While total capital \nhas improved, the particularly la rge increase in narrowly define d tangible capital highlights a \nsignificant improvement in loss absorption capacity.  \nRelative to the 7 percent minimum for Ti er 1 common equity plus the capital \nconservation buffer, banks that are reporting pr o forma Basel III capital ratios for the end of \n2012 have already reached this minimu m standard, as seen in Figure 5.\n6  Furthermore, many \nof these large banks are now holding more than 8 percen t Tier 1 common equity on a pro \nforma basis. \n Figure 6 compares the pro forma Basel III Tier 1 common equity standard relative to \nthe Tier 1 common equity under Basel I.  It shows that the Basel III standa rd results in a much \nlower – and thus more stringent – capital ratio than the Basel I standard, although the \ndifference can vary greatly depe nding on the business ac tivities of the financial institution and \nthe quality of assets held.  Overall, for t hose banks disclosing pro forma Basel III capital \nratios, the difference between the Basel III pr o forma Tier 1 common equity ratio and the \nBasel I Tier 1 common equity ratio averages more than 2 percent.  It is encouraging that many \nlarge U.S. financial institutions have alrea dy reached the minimum Basel III Tier 1 common \nequity standard – which is more restrictive than  under Basel I, and is set at higher thresholds. \n \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL 9:15 AM on Monday, February 25,  2013 in Seoul, Korea or Upon Delivery, and \n7:15 PM on Sunday, February 24, 2013 U.S. Eastern Time* \n 8III. Capital and Other Regulatory Tools \nIn the United States the new supervisory tools being employed are far more extensive \nthan just raising minimum capital standards.  In conjunction with the SIFI surcharges, \nregulators have undertaken severa l other significant reforms – in cluding liquidity standards, \nstress tests and resolution plan s.  Examining capital under stress situations, improved liquidity \nstandards, and resolution plans (the so-called “l iving wills”) are some of the more important \ninnovations that complement the higher capital standards.   \nOur results highlight the importance of taking this multi-pronged approach.  None of \nthese tools were used before the crisis, and they  are likely to be increasingly important tools \nas regulators and financial institutions gain mo re experience with them.  Thus any historical \nexamination of capital erosion may not fully re flect the many changes that have occurred at \nfinancial institutions and in supervis ion and regulation in recent years. \n It is also worthwhile considering how the various new supervisory tools could be \ncombined for enhanced impact.  For example, one possibility is to make the trade-off between \nhigher capital and the ability to easily resolve large institutions more explicit.  One reason for \nimposing a SIFI surcharge is that large, comp licated banks are likely to cause problems that \nspill over throughout the financial system (and by extension the economy) if they need to be \nresolved.  Smaller banks are usually resolved over a weekend, with most of the assets and \nliabilities transferred to an ac quiring bank.  However, such a pro cess is not always feasible for \nlarge institutions – as we saw in the case of  Lehman Brothers.  The failure of Lehman \nBrothers disrupted othe r financial intermediaries, seriously  impaired functioning of a number \nof markets, precipitated runs on other financial intermediaries , and highlighted the need for \nbetter resolution of large institutions.7  To address this risk, difficult-to-resolve large \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL 9:15 AM on Monday, February 25,  2013 in Seoul, Korea or Upon Delivery, and \n7:15 PM on Sunday, February 24, 2013 U.S. Eastern Time* \n 9institutions could receive a highe r SIFI surcharge than those larg e institutions that are more \neasily resolvable.8  Such an approach would both enc ourage large firms to enhance their \nresolvability and would further reduce the probability  of failure for remaining difficult-to-\nresolve institutions. \nThus, the cost to society of disruptive failures of systemically important institutions \nwarrants that these institutions hold more capital – and indeed th e Basel III accord is already \nimposing capital surcharges for large and difficult-to-resolve institutions.  At this point the resolution process is new and untried.  However, presumably SIFI surcharges should reflect in \npart how successful resolution plans are likely to be.   \nContrary to arguments put fo rth by some commenters, our results suggest that even \nunder the current multi-pronged a pproach, the current calibration of the SIFI surcharge does \nnot appear excessive.  Given the losses in ex cess of 450 basis points at  a number of large \ninstitutions during the last financial crisis, minimum standards for large institutions may be \ntoo low. \n \nConcluding Observations  \n The changes to supervision and regulati on since the financial crisis have been \nextensive.  Many of those changes are not ye t fully implemented, and many of the regulatory \ntools remain untried during times of stress.  N onetheless, U.S. financial institutions are now \nwell placed to finance the economic recovery, as many of the institutions have already \nrecapitalized.    Despite the dramatic improvement in ba nk capital positions, examination of capital \nerosion during the financial crisis highlights how large and quick  the capital erosion was at \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL 9:15 AM on Monday, February 25,  2013 in Seoul, Korea or Upon Delivery, and \n7:15 PM on Sunday, February 24, 2013 U.S. Eastern Time* \n 10some of the largest financial institutions.  Wh ile the SIFI surcharges have the potential for \nproviding even more of a capital buffer for the largest institutions, it will be critically \nimportant to determine how other tools such as  stress tests, tougher liquidity requirements, \nand resolution plans supplement the higher and more stringent cap ital standards.  \n The high levels of government support during the financial crisis were problematic.  \nGovernment authorities don't want to be in a position of having to provide support again, and \nin fact, might not be able to so.  And it is certainly in the indust ry's best interest not to need \ngovernment support.  That makes the enactment of effective capital regimes all the more \nimportant.

Tier 1 risk-based capital  is defined in the Capital Adequacy Guide lines for Bank Holding Companies:  Risk-\nBased Measures (12 CFR part 225, Appendix A) as the sum of core capital elements less any amounts of \ngoodwill, other intang ible assets, interest-only strips receivabl es, deferred tax assets, nonfinancial equity \ninvestments, and other items that are required to be deduct ed in accordance with sectio n II.B. of this appendix.  \nTier 1 capital must represent at least 50 percent of qua lifying total capital.” The specific elements included in \nTier 1 capital and their various limits, restrictions, and deductions are discussed in detail in 12 CFR part 225, \nAppendix A.   \n Tier 2 capital includes supplementary items such as  qualifying subordinated debt and a portion of the \nallowance for loan and lease losses.

The denominator  for three ratios -- the Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio, \nthe total risk-based capital ratio and the Tier 1 common capital ratio -- is risk-weighted assets.  The denominator for the tangible common equity ratio is tangible assets, defined as total assets less goodwill and other intangible \nassets. \n \n6 The Basel III Tier 1 common capital ratios are estimates provided by the banking organizations in their recent \nearnings press releases.  They are based on Notices of Pr oposed Rulemaking (NPRs) released in June 2012.

However, given the recognition that banks have grown extremely large and \nincreasingly complex, it is less likely that future acquisitions will be as forthcoming.   \n \n8 Admittedly, implementation challenges remain in this matter.",

While economic growth was modest  in the latter part of 2012, recent data \nsuggest some improvement in the first part of  this year.  On balance economic growth has \nbeen a bit better than expecte d, considering the notable headwi nds of fiscal restraint and \nissues in Europe that reflect the still-fragile globa l recovery.  The current expectation of \nmany private-sector forecasters is that the economy will expand slightly more rapidly than its potential rate of gr owth in the near term.   \n\n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, March 27, 2013 at 12:30 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY  * \n \n 2Still, the economy remains far from where we want it to be, especially given the \nFed’s dual mandate for maximum sustainabl e employment and price stability.  The \nnational unemployment rate is 7.7 per cent, far higher than the 5.25 percent \nunemployment rate to which I think the econom y will eventually return.  Similarly, the \ninflation rate (measured by the Personal C onsumption Expenditures price index or PCE) \nover the twelve months ending in January 2013 averaged only 1.2 percent, far below the \nFederal Reserve’s PCE inflation target of 2 percent. \nToday, I will discuss both the economic ou tlook and the role that monetary policy \nhas played in the improving economy.  Certai nly the “no free lunch” doctrine applies \nhere, so along with the benefits there are some potential costs.  I will discuss some of the potential costs of our current po licies, particularly those dealing with financial stability.  \nOf course I would add that the views I expre ss today are my own, not necessarily those of \nmy colleagues on the Board of Governors or the Federal Open Market Committee (the \nFOMC).   \nTo preview my conclusions, I will argue that the Federal Reserve’s policy of \nopen-ended purchases of mortgage-backed s ecurities and U.S. Treasury securities – \ncurrently proceeding at a pace of $85 billion a month – has contributed importantly to the \ngradual improvement in labor markets that we have seen, despite the fiscal headwinds.   I \nwill also argue that the costs of these policie s are outweighed by their benefits, and by the \ncosts likely to result if we did not pursue them. \nIt is clear to me that monetary policy ac tions have been benefiting the economy.   \nSome observers argue that the beneficial effect s are offset by the cost of reduced financial \nstability.  Certainly, this is an area we n eed to watch closely.  Financial stability is \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, March 27, 2013 at 12:30 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY  * \n \n 3exceptionally important to me personally, as my research and talks underscore. I have \nbeen vocal about significant policy actions th at, in my view, should be taken to avoid \nfinancial stability problems in the future.  However, I see little evidence that our \nmonetary policies are generating significant fi nancial stability problem s at this time.   \nPut simply, the benefits of our asset purchases have exceed any reasonable \nestimate of the costs.  The asset-purchase program is having the desired impact, and the \nfaster economic growth that is in part the result of monetary policy actions will bring us more quickly to a situation where this degree of additional accommodation is no longer necessary. \n \nThe Economic Outlook \nI expect the economy to grow at a rate a bit above 2 percent in the first half of this \nyear, despite the headwinds resu lting from more fiscal auster ity than many expected.  As \nFigure 1 shows, government spending, a GDP component, has declined for the past two \nyears – even before the federal sequester.  Th is is true for federal spending as well as \nstate and local government spending.  Fiscal  austerity has been offset in part by \nimprovements in housing and also auto sales (part of consumer durables).  Housing and \nautos are the most interest-sen sitive components of GDP, and their strength partly reflects \nthe positive impact of Federal Reserve policies to push long-te rm interest rates down with \nour large-scale asset purchase program. \nFigure 2 provides the longer-run economi c forecasts of the 19 Reserve Bank \npresidents and Federal Reserve Board gove rnors who participat e on the FOMC, taken \nfrom the periodic report known as the Su mmary of Economic Projections or SEP.\n1  Once \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, March 27, 2013 at 12:30 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY  * \n \n 4a quarter, each FOMC participan t is asked to provide an economic forecast for a variety \nof variables, including th e unemployment rate and the PCE inflation rate.   \nIn the left panel, the rang e and midpoint of forecasts for unemployment at the end \nof 2013 and 2014 are provided for the most r ecent FOMC meeting, in March, and for the \nFOMC meeting last September when we be gan the open-ended purchases of mortgage-\nbacked securities.  Last September the FO MC participants exp ected the unemployment \nrate at the end of 2013 would ra nge from 7 to 8 percent, with a midpoint of 7.5.  At the \nMarch FOMC meeting the range from the SE P was narrower and lower – the range was \nnow from 6.9 to 7.6 percent, and the mi dpoint had dropped by 25 basis points.   \nMy own forecast for the unemployment rate  at the end of 2013 is just above the \nmidpoint of the range.  Similarly, the forecast range for unemployment at the end of 2014 is now lower, and the midpoint fell by 30 basis points to 6.6 percent.  For 2014, my forecast is again just a bit above the mi dpoint.  In sum, FOMC participants see \nimprovement in the unemployment forecast since last September – for both 2013 and \n2014.  And, comparing the midpoints of the unemployment rate forecast for the two years shows that the overall level  has declined, but the size of the decline expected over 2014 is \nthe same – six tenths. \nTurning to the right-side panel, the midpoint of the PCE inflation forecast for \nFOMC participants fell from 1.8 to 1.65 for 2013 between the September FOMC and the March FOMC meetings.  Furthermore, the midpoint forecast for 2014 fell from 1.9 to \n1.75.  My own forecast is below the midpoi nt of the range for both 2013 and 2014.   \nIn sum, the March SEP was quite positive,  with declines in the midpoint of the \nforecast ranges for both unemployment and PCE inflation, in 2013 and 2014.  However, \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, March 27, 2013 at 12:30 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY  * \n \n 5even at the end of 2014, unemployment is exp ected to be almost 1.5 percentage points \nabove most estimates of full employment.  Given that the midpoint for the inflation \nforecast for both years is below our 2 percent ta rget, I believe we have  the flexibility to \npursue a policy that encourages faster economic  growth and a more rapid improvement in \nthe unemployment rate.  To me, that implies th at we should continue our large-scale asset \npurchases of Treasury and mortgage-backed s ecurities through this  year – although the \namount may need to be adjusted up or down, depending on how the economic situation \nevolves. \n \nBenefits and Costs of Large-Scale Asset Purchases \nThe Fed’s purchases of long-term securi ties are intended to lower longer-term \ninterest rates, like rates on home mortgages and auto loans, in order to promote faster \neconomic growth.  These purchases also en courage households and businesses to shift \nsomewhat from riskless low-yielding short- term government securities to investments \nthat bear a sensible degree of risk and ha ve a stronger economic ef fect, like corporate \nbonds and stocks.    \nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston staff use two different models to estimate the \nimpact of asset purchases on the economy. One explicitly arti culates household and \nbusiness behaviors2 and the other is a purely statistical model.3  Reassuringly, both \nmodels give similar results.  Our best estimate implies roughly a one-quarter-point \ndecrease in the unemployment rate for a $500 billion asset-purchase program.   \nBy this estimate, the benefits of the large-scale asset purchase (LSAP) program \ninclude almost 400,000 additional workers empl oyed for every $500 billion in purchased \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, March 27, 2013 at 12:30 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY  * \n \n 6assets (which earn a return while on the Fed’ s books), returning to our inflation target \nsomewhat more quickly, and a somewhat better  debt-to-GDP ratio as a result of the lower \ninterest rates and improved GDP and revenue growth.  While these estimates are model \ndependent, and are clearly subject to estimati on error, they are broa dly consistent with \nother studies – and with the growth in asse t prices and the expans ion of the interest-\nsensitive components of GDP seen since last September.    \n One of the potential costs of LSAPs w ould be that they could be viewed as \ninflationary.  Most of the original critic s of LSAPs voiced concerns over the potential \nimpact on inflation and inflation expectations .  However, the expansion of the Federal \nReserve’s balance sheet began in 2008 and fi ve years later we currently have a PCE \ninflation rate of 1.2 percent, well below our 2 percent target.  As the years have passed \nand inflation has remained stable, this  criticism has become more muted.   \nFOMC participants seem to agree with the assessment: looking at the range of \nFOMC participant forecasts from the SEP for March, most FOMC participants expect us \nto undershoot our 2 percent target this year .  And in 2014, while the range extends to 2.1, \nmost indicate that infla tion would be between 1.5 a nd 2.0 percent, undershooting or \nachieving the target (an observation based on the published central tendency of 1.5 to 2.0 \npercent).   \nA second concern expressed about LSAPs is that they might undermine financial \nstability.  For example, if one expects the Fed to hold short-term rates at zero for a long \ntime, one could choose to earn higher yields by taking on substantially more credit risk or \ninterest rate risk.   \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, March 27, 2013 at 12:30 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY  * \n \n 7It is true that the Fed’s low interest rate  policies are intended in part to encourage \nadditional, responsible risk-taking of the so rt that advances real economic activity and \ngrowth – for example, spurring banks to le nd more rather than hold cash or government \nsecurities, and non-financial firms to seek higher-return investment  opportunities rather \nthan hold cash or government securities.  Howeve r, it is possible that the expectation of \nvery low interest rates could encourage too much risk-taking – in the form of excessive \nleverage, or taking credit ri sks that could not withsta nd another economic slowdown.  \nWhile some households or firms may choose to  take excessive risks, even with more \nnormalized interest rates, it is the widespread  taking of excessive ri sk – particularly by \nleveraged institutions – that is likely to generate macroeconomic financial stability \nproblems. \nSome observers have noted that stock pr ices have risen quite substantially, as \nshown in Figure 3.  Of course our policy doesn ’t specifically target  a particular asset \nmarket, but encouraging investors and firms to  take more of the responsible risks that \ncontribute to economic activity and growth would normally mean  a shift into assets such \nas stocks and investments with higher expected returns.   \nMake no mistake, this would pose a financia l stability problem if  stock prices had \nsignificantly outstripped likely ear nings – particularly if thos e investing in stocks had \nbecome highly leveraged and were particularly susceptible to a reversal in share prices.  \nFigure 4 shows the S&P stock index relative to composite operating earnings over the \npast 20 years.  While share prices have risen, so have operati ng earnings.  And while \nthere has been some increase in the ratio, it remains well below the 20-year average. \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, March 27, 2013 at 12:30 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY  * \n \n 8Other observers have noted that reside ntial real estate prices have risen \nsignificantly in some markets, and that this  could pose a financial stability problem.  \nSince homes are normally purchased with signi ficant debt, a rapid increase in prices \ncould risk a repeat of the problems of the past  decade.  Figure 5 looks  at the Case-Shiller \nhome price index in a variety of metro areas .  While housing prices have risen in many \nmarkets recently, they remain well below their peak prices.4  Furthermore, if one \ncompares an index of house prices to a rent  index (shown in Figur e 6), assessing whether \nthe values of homes are approxi mately in line with the servic es that housing provides, as \nreflected in rental rates, h ouse prices have now fallen enough that this ratio is back to \nwhere it was in 1993, well before the run-up in house prices. \nAnother area of potential concern has been the increase in  high-yield bond \nissuance.  As Figure 7 shows, high-yield bond rates are now quite low by historical \nstandards.  Firms with high-yield bonds are refinancing those bonds, much like many \nhomeowners have refinanced their houses.  This refinancing impr oves the cash flow of \ncompanies and makes them more able to weat her shocks.  However, if these yields are \nlow because investors are bidding aggressively  for such bonds, reaching or over-reaching \nfor higher yields in a low inte rest rate environment, then one would expect to see high-\nyield bond rates fall more than relatively safe rates, reflecting the st rong desire to take on \nmore of this debt at lower yiel ds, despite its higher risk.   \nBut Figure 8 shows that while the rates ha ve fallen, the decline has largely been \ndue to the decline in all longer-term interest  rates, including safe  Treasury rates.  The \nspread between high-yield bonds and 10-year Tr easury securities is currently a little \nbelow the average spread over nearly two decades.5  That means that high-yield rates \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, March 27, 2013 at 12:30 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY  * \n \n 9have fallen approximately in line with the rates on safe assets, implying stable rather than \nsignificantly diminished compensation for ris k.  As Figure 9 shows,  high-yield bond rates \nhave been declining in a manner quite simila r to other rates, such as rates on home \nmortgages and auto loans.   \nAnother way of looking at this data is th at it highlights that the Fed’s program of \npurchasing long-term securities has affected a wide range of financial markets – from \nsafe Treasuries to mortgages to auto loan s, well beyond the specific market where the \npurchases are occurring.  Thus, the decline in high-yield bond rates looks broadly in line \nwith other market rates, and the widespread rate declines are cont ributing to a faster \nrecovery than we would otherwise have seen. \nAnother potential area of c oncern is banking.  Asset price declines have much \ngreater economic impact if the assets are he ld by highly leveraged fi nancial institutions \nthat may respond to losses by re ducing credit availability.   \nBut here the news is somewhat encourag ing as well.  Figure 10 shows the capital \nratios for the largest banks.  Since the fina ncial crisis in 2008, banks  have restored their \ncapital ratios and have raised capital levels mu ch higher than they were prior to the crisis \nand recession.6  This reflects both the banks’ tighten ing of their own capital levels, and \nthe impact of our stress tests which reveal whether banks are holding sufficient capital to \nweather an adverse economic, in terest rate, or market shocks .  The increased scrutiny of \ncapital and liquidity at banks has made banks much better positioned to withstand \npotential future economic shocks. \nEven with more capital and liquidity, how ever, banks can experience difficulties \nif they have very large positions in asset cl asses that could experience sharp declines in \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, March 27, 2013 at 12:30 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY  * \n \n 10prices.  Some observers have  noted that farmland prices have experienced significant \nincreases in prices over the past several years.   Figure 11 provides the banking industry’s \nexposure to agricultural loans by bank size.  The largest banks have relatively small \nexposures to agricultura l loans, less than 1 percent for the largest two categories (banks \nexceeding $1 trillion in assets and banks from  $100 billion to $1 trillion in assets).   \nFurthermore, in some parts of the country, like New England, and in urban based areas, \nbanks’ exposure to agricultura l loans is quite modest.   \nHowever, in agricultural areas of the country, some smaller banks have a \nsignificant exposure to agricultural loans.  Su ch exposures are unlikely to pose financial \nstability concerns that affect the nation.  In such circumstance s, raising interest rates on \nall household and business borrowers, as some have suggested might be appropriate in \nresponse to a boom even in such a narrowly-held  sector, seems to me a very blunt tool to \naddress this exposure.  Instead, this s eems a particularly good area for continued, \nenhanced supervisory focus with individual banks – with large ag ricultural exposures \nbeing challenged by bank supervisors to ensure the banks have sufficient capital to sustain a theoretical reversal in farmland prices. \nIn sum, broad-based financial stability con cerns do not seem particularly acute at \nthis time.  Interest rates in most markets ha ve fallen, and asset prices  are rising.  This is \nthe expected and intentional result of the Fed’ s efforts to promote a more rapid return to \nmore normalized conditions.  As the economy continues to improve, and labor markets \nand inflation return to more normalized levels, the recent levels of monetary \naccommodation can be reduced.  \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, March 27, 2013 at 12:30 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY  * \n \n 11This is not to say we should not be vi gilant about potential financial stability \nconcerns.  We should remain humble about ou r ability to detect such imbalances, given \nour failure to do so in the recent crisis.  Thus we should closely monitor whether the high degree of monetary accommodation is having unintended consequences.  I would now \nlike to briefly discuss some particular financia l stability concerns that I believe should be \nwatched carefully.  \nFinancial Stability Monitoring and the Need for Additional Regulatory Focus \n While the Federal Reserve’s accommoda tive monetary policy has been an \nimportant driver of the current economic recove ry, and the financial stability costs appear \nrelatively modest at this time, we cannot be Pollyannas.  There are areas that we should \nclosely monitor.  Some areas that bear watc hing, in my view, are specific markets where \nunderwriting standards are sli pping – or where rapid growth in financial products could \nbecome a more significant concern. \n In terms of underwriting standards, the covenant quality on new high-yield bond \nissuance should be closely monitored.  Bond covenants are intended to  protect investors, \nand the issuance of bonds that reduce or eliminate common c ovenants in their contracts \ncould become an area of concern.  In fact, there is some evidence that some new bond \nissuance reduces covenants that protect investors.\n7 \n Also, financial structures that involve the use of shor t-term borrowing to finance \nlonger-term assets should be monitored caref ully.  For example, agency real estate \ninvestment trusts (agency REITS) have grown rapidly, involv e leverage, and are \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, March 27, 2013 at 12:30 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY  * \n \n 12susceptible to sharp interest rate movements.   Such financing structures need to be \nmonitored to ensure they do not pose broader financial st ability concerns. \n Finally, many non-depository financial instit utions that were susceptible to runs \nduring the financial crisis still have not re solved that run risk. For example, money \nmarket mutual funds experienced a seve re run requiring substantial government \nintervention during the crisis, yet the regulatory reform effo rt is moving only slowly.  \nSimilarly, Federal Reserve Governor Daniel Tarullo8 and New York Fed President \nWilliam Dudley9 have raised concerns about br oker-dealers and wholesale funding \nmarkets.  These concerns have subs tantial merit and deserve attention. \n \nConcluding Observations \n In conclusion and in sum, the economy continues to improve, but at a painfully \nslow pace.  Actions taken by the Federal Re serve to speed up the pace of the economic \nrecovery seem to be having the desired imp act.  Interest-sensitive sectors are growing \nmore rapidly, asset markets are returning to pre-crisis levels, and economic forecasters \nare expecting continued improvement s over the next several years. \n While the benefits of our actions conti nue to outweigh the costs, we need to \nclosely monitor financial instruments, financial institutions, and financial markets for potentially emerging financial st ability concerns.  There are ar eas that I have highlighted \ntoday that require close monitoring – incl uding, unfortunately, some problems in \nfinancial market that were signi ficant contributors to the fina ncial crisis but have not yet \nbeen fully remedied.   \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, March 27, 2013 at 12:30 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY  * \n \n 13While the economy is improving, global fi nancial conditions remain fragile, as \nevents in Europe are highlighting.  And the economy still has a long way to go before we \nhave full employment and PCE inflation at abou t 2 percent.  Still, I believe the Federal \nReserve will continue to do its  part in this process, w ith a clear focus on improving \neconomic conditions for all Americans. \nThank you.   \n                                                 \n \n1 The complete Summary of Economic Projections is re leased with the minutes of  the FOMC meeting three \nweeks after the date of the policy decision.  Table 1 of the SEP, containing th e economic projections, is \nreleased in advance, following the FOMC meeting at the time of the Chai rman’s press conference.

There has also been a significant \nimprovement in the quality of capital as evidenced by the large increase in the more narrowly-defined \ntangible capital.

Rosengren  \nPresident & Chief Executive Officer  \nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston  \n \n \nEarly Childhood Summit 2013: Innovation and \nOpportunity  \n \nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston,  \nBoston, Massachusetts  \nApril 5, 2013  \n \n \n \n \n \nI am pleased to be  participat ing in this early childhood summit . And I would \nparticularly like to thank the Boston Children’s Mus eum for continuing its tradition of \ninnovative work on behalf of children by co -sponsoring this and other events duri ng this \ntheir centennial year.  T he Boston Children’s Mus eum is a close neighbor of the Federal \nReserve Bank of Boston , and my children and I pers onally benefitted from this proximity \nas we often took advantage of its many exhibits and programs.   It was the only museum \n\n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, April 5 , 201 3 at 8:10 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY  * \n 2 that my children did not respond  with, “not another museum” when I told them where we \nwere going that day . \nI became aware of some of  the important economic work being done on  early \nchildhood programs in a series of discussions  I had over the years with fellow Fed \neconomist, Art Rolnick.  Art was then the research director at the Federal Reserve Bank \nof Minneapolis and made two importan t observations.  First, if you help someone early in \nlife, they reap a lifetime of benefits.  A nd a second close corollary is that programs that \nhelp kids learn have  a high return for them as individuals and for society as a whole.  \nThese observations have  been validated by good empirical research and have served as a \nfoundation for the funding of important programs that apply these observations.  Others \non the agenda today are going to discuss such programs in more detail.  \nWhile many of the economic studie s on the value of good early childhood \nprograms have focused on the average return from these investments, I am going to \ndiscuss how educational attainment can impact the variability  of a person’s  economic \noutcomes .  In particular, during economic downturns, those with poor educational \nattainment are disproportionately likely to become unemployed and that unemployment \ncan have a far -reaching impact on other aspects of life, including expected future \nearnings, wealth  and home ownership.   \nThe second point I will emphasize today is the importance of helping those \ncommunities that have the fewest resources available to address both economic and social \nproblems.   The Federal Reserve Bank of Boston has been doing signific ant work in mid -\nsized cities in New England, and we will be announcing a new mid -sized cities initiative \nin Massachusetts next month i n conjunction with a number of partners including th e \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, April 5 , 201 3 at 8:10 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY  * \n 3 Commonwealth of Massachusetts, Living Cities , and the Massachusetts Competitive \nPartnership .  Today I want to highlight that if you are living in a mid -sized city in \nMassachusetts with a high poverty rate, your chances of educational attainment look \nquite different from what they would be if you lived in a mid -sized city w ith a low \npoverty rate.   While there has been progress in more widespread adoption of early \nchildhood education – especially in reaching communities that have difficulty affording \nsuch programs – it is exactly these communities that potentially generate t he highest \nreturns on such investment.  This is particularly important because these investments not \nonly influence educational attainment as a youth, but can be an important element in \nemployment opportunities and job retention as an adult, even during di fficult economic \ntimes, such as those we continue to experience.  \n \nEducational Attainment and the Variability of Economic Outcomes  \nFigure 1 displays the unemployment rate by educational attainment.  First, notice \nthat the unemployment rate for less educated  workers is always significantly higher than \nthe rate for more highly educated workers.  Second, while the unemployment rate \napproximately doubled during the Great Recession across  all education categories,  the \nunemployment rates of people  with low educational attainment rose to staggering levels.   \nFor those with less than a high school education, the unemployment rate was a bit below \n8 percent prior to the recession and reached a peak of almost 16 percent as a result of the \nrecession.  Thus, nearly one in six people with less than a high school education were \nunemployed at one point during the recession.   Thankfully, the unemployment rate for \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, April 5 , 201 3 at 8:10 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY  * \n 4 those with low educational attainment has come down, despite the only modest overall \nrecovery we have had to date.  \nWhile it is well estab lished that spells of unemployment have a significant \nnegative impact on labor income for years, Federal Reserve Bank of Boston  staff recently \nexamined the impact that a long duration of unemployment has on future labor income.1  \nTheir research  found  that 10 years after a spell of unemployment , an individual makes 16 \npercent less on average than an individual who did not experience that spell of \nunemployment.  The impact is even larger  with longer -duration unemployment . After 20 \nyears , the earnin gs of a short -duration unemployed worker are roughly the same as those \nwithout a spell of unemployment , but the individual with a long -duration spell of \nunemployment is still somewhat worse off.  Furthermore, there is no “catch up ” for the \nyears of lost income.  It is important to no te that our staff found that longer -duration \nunemployment is negatively correlated with education . \nNot surprisingly, those lost opportunities result in unfavorable collateral effects.  \nFor example, spells of unemployment have a  significantly negative impact  on future \nhomeownership rates , and those who experience a period of long -duration unemployment \nhave a signifi cant permanent loss in wealth.2  Spells of unemployment  also entail  huge \nnon-pecuniary costs to the individual and the family.  \nSuch observations are important in a variety of contexts, but let me mention two. \nIn terms of monetary policy, it implies that spells of unemployment can have a lasting \nimpact long after the econo my recovers.   If spells of unemployment have a persistent \nimpact on income, wealth and home ownership, then a more aggressive response to \npersistently high unemployment rates is warranted.  More rapid economic growth is \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, April 5 , 201 3 at 8:10 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY  * \n 5 likely to not only reduce the unemp loyment rate, but also reduce some of the collateral \ndamage the economy may otherwise face from the spells of long -duration unemployment.  \nContinued accommodative policy, such as continuing our asset purchase program \nthrough this year, is an appropriate re sponse to labor market scarring.  \nParticularly relevant for today’s discussion is that the failure to help children \nreach their highest potential educational attainment level can have a significant impact on \ntheir likelihood of experiencing significant econ omic shocks when the economy \nexperiences a downturn.  This much greater risk of unemployment as an adult for the \nchild who does not receive a sufficient education impacts a variety of other economic \noutcomes, such as whether an individual can buy a home or  accumulate wealth to afford a \nreasonable retirement or educate their children.   \nA critical factor in obtaining sufficient education in many disadvantaged areas is \nthe availability of programs that help maximize a child’s potential. Government cuts that \ndo not consider the long -run return on investment from such programs are likely to be \nboth economically inefficient and could potentially cause longer -run harm to the \neconomy.   \n \nA Comparison of Massach usetts Cities  \nI would like to highlight differences in educational attainment by examining \nMassachusetts mid -sized cities with the highest poverty rates versus those with the lowest \npoverty rates.3  These charts demonstrate that patterns in failure to obta in a high school \neducation actually are fairly persistently present in the data by educational outcome at \nmuch earlier ages.  \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, April 5 , 201 3 at 8:10 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY  * \n 6  Figure 2 shows the differences in the share of children under age five living below \nthe poverty level, comparing those cities with the lowest  overall poverty rates to those \nwith the highest poverty rates  as well as to the statewide average for all cities and towns .  \nIn four of the five high poverty mid -sized cities, more than 40 percent of the children \nunder age five are living below the poverty l evel.  In all five cities, the share of children \nunder age five living below the poverty level is more than double the average for \nMassachusetts.  Among the cities with the lowest poverty rates, four of the five cities \nhave child poverty rates less than half the Massachusetts average of 16.8 percent.  \n Figure 3 shows that differences for children occur as early as three or four years \nof age.  In the low poverty mid -sized cities, 67.7% of children age three and four are \nenrolled in a preschool or pre -kindergarten program .  In contrast, less than half – 42.6% – \nof children age three and four are enrolled in school in the high poverty mid-sized cities.  \nLawrence has the lowest share at 26.8%.  \n Figure 4 shows that the patterns of enrollment visible in Figure 3 are quite similar \nto the patterns in third grade Massachusetts Comprehensive Assessment System (MCAS) \ntest scores.  Cities with high poverty rates report much lower scores on both the reading \nand math MCAS tests, sometimes having less than half the proficiency rate of cities w ith \nlow poverty rates.  Though there are many population differences between high and low \npoverty mid -sized cities that can affect test scores, it appears that early school enrollment \nis a critical factor that clearly has an effect on student achievement.4  \nFigure 5 shows that these patterns persist with high school graduation rates.  In all \nfive low poverty cities, 80 percent or more of students graduate from high school in four \nyears.  In all five high poverty cities, less than 70 percent of students graduate from high \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, April 5 , 201 3 at 8:10 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY  * \n 7 school in four years.  In four of the five high poverty cities, the high school graduation \nrate is 61 percent or lower.  This has implications for future earning power, as those who \ndo not graduate from high school earn much less on average than those with higher \neducational attainment.  As I highlighted in the beginni ng of my talk, this also has \nsignificant implications for the likelihood of experiencing a spell of unemployment with \nthe associated collateral impact.  Thus, not only the stream of earnings but also the \nvolatility of earnings may be impacted.   \n Children in high poverty cities face considerable challenges on many levels.  \nHowever, access to educational opportunities can have a significant impact on their \neconomic outcomes throughout their lives.  Given the discrepancies between childhood \noutcomes related t o education, both public and private resources need to be focused on \nproviding more educational and developmental opportunit ies for children living in cities \nwith fewer resources, resources that have been particularly strained over the past five \nyears.  \n \nConcluding Observations  \n The work of this conference is important.

            "content": "“Should Full Employment Be  \nA Mandate For Central Banks? ” \n  \nEric S. Rosengren  \nPresident & Chief Executive Officer  \nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston  \n \n \nRemarks at the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston’s 57th Economic \nConference:  \n“Fulfilling the Full Employment  Mandate – Monetary Policy & The \nLabor Market”  \n  \nBoston, Massachusetts  \nApril 12, 2013 \n \nThe data in this speech have been updated to reflect revisions  to the data series that occurred \nafter it was delivered.  These updates were made because the speech was being prepared for \npublication in an issue of the  Journal of Money, Credit, and Banking. \n \n \n It is a pleasure to w elcome everyone attending  the Boston Fed’s  57th economic \nconference.  The topic of this year’s conference – fulfilling the full employment mandate – is \nparticularly relevant today, when most developed countries have unemployment rates \nsubstantially above their  estimates of full employment.  \nI see a number of important questions about the full employment mandate that should be \nexplored at this conference and beyond.  For example, how should central banks react to high \nunemployment rates in a period of well -anchored inflation expectations?  Does the \nunconventional  nature of many of the monetary policy tools currently being employed alter how \n 1 \n\ncentral banks should think about their mandate?  And even more fundamentally, what should be \nthe mandate of central banks – should there be a single inflation goal, as occurs in many \ncountries around the world, or should there be a dual mandate as ha s evolved in the United \nStates?  \nMy answer to this last question is an emphatic yes, by the way – the Fed should have a \ndual mandate.  But I expect that conference p articipants and those reading the papers and \npresentations from afar will gain fresh perspectives on these and other important questions. \nBefore I begin my remarks I would like to note that the views I express today are my \nown, not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Board of Governors or the Federal Open \nMarket Committee (FOMC).  \nIn the United States, we currently have an unemployment rate of 7.5 percent and an \ninflation rate of 1.5 percent using the personal consumption expenditure (PCE) price index.  Falling short on both elements of the Federal Reserve’s dual mandate from Congress – inflation \nand employment – provides a strong rationale for continuing our highly accommodative monetary policy.  With inflation at 1.5 percent, and with my own forecast that inflation will remain well below our 2 percent target over the next two years, one could argue that consistently missing our inflation target alone  would justify a highly accommodative policy.  However, \ncoupled with persistently high unemployment, the  justification for continuing highly \naccommodative policy by large -scale asset purchases is clear.  This is a time when the dual \nmandate is important and, I would add, particularly useful for communicating policy  to the \ngeneral public.  \n The dual mandate is  being utilized in recent Federal Reserve policy statements to clearly \ndescribe to the public how monetary policy will be conducted, going forward.  In particular, \n 2 \n\nrecent FOMC policy statements have made explicit reference to the role of employment in \nconsidering changes to our monetary policy stance.  With regard to the Fed’s large -scale asset \npurchase program, the March statement said the FOMC will continue purchases “until the outlook for the labor market has improved substantially in a context of price stability.”  \nThe FOMC statement highlights that maintaining interest rates at exceptionally low \nlevels will be appropriate “at least as long as the unemployment rate remains above 6.5 percent, inflation between one and two years ahead is projected to be no more than a half percentage point above the Committee’s 2 percent long -run goal, and longer -term inflation expectations \ncontinue to be well anchored.”  Data for both inflation and unemployment measures are readily available, and with the publication four t imes a year of the Committee’s projections for these \nvariables via the Summary of Economic Projections (SEP)\n1 the public can observe the FOMC’s \noutlook for these measures as well.  \nBoth inflation and unemployment are viewed by the public as important gauges  of \neconomic well -being, so tying the trajectory of policy to data and published forecasts for these \neconomic outcomes clarifies things for the public.  In fact, this type of central bank communication has been quite effective.  With a clearer understanding of the policy objective, yield curves have flattened and forward rates have fallen to  reflect policy announcements.  \n Such announcements would likely not be as straightforward in countries with a single \nmandate related only to inflation.  In such countrie s, a modest shortfall in inflation relative to \ntarget would not by itself justify a significant monetary policy response.  In circumstances such \nas today’s, invoking a non- mandated “escape clause” to attend to real activity while inflation is \nwell-containe d would not do justice to the size of the problems in the real economy.  To be sure, \nmany countries have found ways around these difficulties in recent times, but the Federal \n 3 \n\nReserve’s dual mandate is especially well suited for times like these, when it is  clear that the \nprimary rationale for our aggressive policies derives from the first -order problems in labor \nmarkets, not from a second- order escape clause that “permits” (but does not mandate) monetary \npolicymakers to consider labor markets.  \nGiven the com munication challenges that are present with a single inflation mandate at a \ntime of a significant slack in resources (high unemployment), it is natural to ask if there are \nsignificant differences in how central banks with a single inflation mandate behave relative to central banks with a dual mandate.  The conclusion I will reach – by looking at the data – is that with a dual mandate in the United States, our inflation outcomes have been at least as good as those in countries with a single mandate, and we h ave the added benefit of a much clearer and \nmore direct way t o communicate with the public. \nI would note that several nations have been considering revisiting their central bank \nmandate.  The evidence I will share with you today suggests that there should be a broader \nconsideration of moving to a dual mandate, such a s we have in the United States.  \n To give you an overview of my presentation today, I will first explore whether countries \nwith a single mandate, focused solely on inflation, generate different outcomes.  Then I will explore the issue of central bank actions when inflation exceeds  the target.  I will follow with a \ndiscussion of current policy in the United States and the role played by the dual mandate, before offering some concluding observations . \n \nDo Countries with a S ingle I nflation M andate G enerate B etter O utcomes?  \n The first matter I would like to explore is the inflation experience of single mandate \nversus dual mandate countries.  The data show that many countries over the past 20 years have \n 4 \n\nbeen very close to a 2 percent average inflation rate over that period; a result that is surprisingly \nconsistent with price level targeting, where large increases or decreases in inflation are offset in future periods to maintain the same average inflation rate.  Interestingly, by this measure the United States performs a bit better than countries that use only an inflation mandate.  \nFigure 1 shows the inflation experience of the U.S., the Euro area,\n2 and Japan over the \npast 20 years.  The price level for each is indexed to 100 in January of 1993.  The Federal \nReserve now has a 2 percent inflation target tied to the PCE inflation index, and the red line \nindicates the path the price level would take if inflation were exactly 2 percent for the entire 20 \nyear period (which would be consistent with either error -less inflation targeting or p erfect price \nlevel targeting).  \nWhile the 2 percent inflation target was only officially adopted by the FOMC in January \n2012, the figure suggests that the Federal Reserve observe d an implicit inflation target of 2 \npercent over this 20- year period.  The actual path followed by the PCE level is represented by the \ndarker blue line.  The fact that the PCE price index always returns to the 2 percent line over the 20-year period implies , naturally, that the average inflation rate over that period was 2 percent.  \nAlso, the proximity of the PCE price index to the 2 percent line indicates that inflation deviated \nvery little from 2 percent during that period.  The only period of significant divergence occurred when oil prices rose significantly in 2008, and that diver gence clearly proved temporary.  \nOne might think that the unexpectedly severe “Great Recession” forced the inflation rate \nback to the 2 percent path.  However, it is interesting t o note that even before the Great \nRecession, the average was very close to 2 percent.  With inflation generally falling at the beginning of this period, the pattern is consistent with a U.S. monetary policy that may not have “forgiven” the period of above -target inflation as “water over the dam,” as a 2 percent inflation \n 5 \n\ntargeting central bank would, but instead engineered below -2 percent inflation in the ensuing \nperiod, to achieve a 2 percent average inflation rate – much like a price -level targeting centr al \nbank would. \nThis in turn implies a central bank that was more restrictive following the period of \nabove -2 percent inflation than a pure inflation- targeter would be, potentially leading to a higher \nunemployment rate than would otherwise have been the cas e.  Of course, it is possible that these \ninflation outcomes simply arose from a pattern of exogenous shocks (such as oil shocks) to \ninflation that produced an average inflation rate of 2 percent, in spite of the central bank’s actions.  But whether this pa ttern arose by chance or design, the chart is striking.  The chart also \nhighlights that during the most recent period of highly elevated unemployment – when we have remained persistently below 2 percent inflation – we could have justified even more accommo dative policy than was generally enacted.  \nThe Euro  area’s harmonized price level index is shown on the chart in lighter blue.  \nWhile also quite close to the 2 percent line, the inflation rate in Europe has tended to be higher than that of the United States , and at the end of the 20- year period is above the 2 percent line, \nand above the inflation index for the United States.  Of course, the ECB took control of monetary policy in January 1999, at the inception of the euro, but the statement is still true if one begins this exercise at that time.  \nThe other line provides the index for Japan.  While recently the Bank of Japan has \ndiscussed a 2 percent inflation target, that does not appear to have been the target over the last 20 years.  Reflecting the inflation outcome, it would appear that the Bank of Japan has been following essentially a zero percent price level target and that the recently announced intent to \n 6 \n\nhit a 2 percent target, if implemented, will be a significant change fr om the past 20 years in \nJapan.  \nGiven the very different inflation target and outcome for Japan during much of the last \ntwo decades, I will today focus on countries that have been following a 2 percent inflation target.  \nFigure 2 shows the price level path for the U.S., the U.K., and Swe den.  Both the U.K. and \nSweden have 2 percent inflation targets, and both remain fairly close to the 2 percent line.  \nHowever, at the end of the 20- year period, the U.K. is  above  the 2 percent line and above the \ninflation experience of the U.S.  while Sweden is below .  Clearly the United States has yielded no \nworse outcomes on inflation than other countries with a single mandate.3 \n In terms of inflation outcomes, all countries have been relatively close to the 2 percent \ninflation line (with the exception of Japan), consistent with a move toward well -anchored \nexpectations in all of these countries.  However, it is notable that even with a dual mandate the United States is the country closest  to the 2 percent line at the end of the 20 -year period.  \n It is, of course, possible that over two decades inflation could average 2 percent, but that \na country with a dual mandate might allow inflationary pressures to build up more than a country whose sole mandate was inflation, leading to more pronounced swings of inflati on (and the pr ice \nlevel) around its target.  One way to explore this possibility is to examine the cumulative squared \ndeviation of inflation from the 2 percent target – a measure that places greater weight on large misses from the target.  Figure 3 provide s the cumulative squared deviations of the annual (year \nover year) inflation rate from a 2 percent inflation target.  The analysis\n4 is symmetric, meaning it \nplaces an equal weight on large misses above  2 percent and similarly on large deviations below  2 \npercent.  \n 7 \n\n The most rapid increase in the cumulative squared deviation from the inflation target for \nthe United States was in 2008, when rising oil prices caused a sharp increase in energy prices \nthat persisted for several quarters.  However, in the peri od after 2009 the U.S. line really flattens.  \nThe unemployment rate remained quite elevated, and the inflation rate stayed quite close to the 2 percent target and, in fact, is much flatter than in Sweden and the U.K., which have only an inflation mandate.  In addition, the misses – the cumulative squared deviations from the inflation \ntarget – over the entire  period are smaller for the U.S. than for the U.K. or Sweden, but \nsomewhat higher than for the Euro area.  \nHowever, since much of the miss in the United States is the result of the temporary spike \nin oil prices in 2008, it is worth examining whether underlying inflation measured by core inflation provides the same picture.  Core inflation measures exclude the volatile food and energy segments that are obvi ously very important but are not controllable by central banks.  \nFigure 4 provides the cumulative squared deviations of core inflation from a 2 percent target.  \nFor the United States we see that the increases in the cumulative squared deviations from the inflation target are quite gradual over the entire period.  Perhaps even more notable, using core \ninflation the cumulative squared deviations for the U.S. are lower than those of the U.K., Sweden, or the Euro area.  Furthermore, when the unemployment rate i s the highest in the United \nStates, the increases in the cumulative squared deviations are less t han in the other three areas.  \n Now I’d like to show a figure, first with the countries not labeled and then with them \nlabeled.  This figure, Figure 5, provides  a scatter chart depicting core inflation and \nunemployment outcomes over the past 16 years.  The key question, I would suggest, is whether inflation and unemployment outcomes for the United States, with a dual mandate, look significantly diff erent than for  other countries.  \n 8 \n\nIn terms of quarterly inflation outcomes, both Sweden and the U.K. have more high -\ninflation observations than the United States.  Sweden, the U.K., and the Euro area all have a \nhigher range of quarterly inflation outcomes than the United States.  In terms of unemployment, the United States has more density in unemployment rates between 4 and 6 percent relative to the other three, but the range of unemployment rates is wider than that of the U.K. and Sweden.  \n That the U.S. has a tighter inf lation range and a broader unemployment range than many \nother countries with a single inflation mandate is striking, as is the very high unemployment rate in Europe.  The results suggest that criticism that a dual mandate country might suffer from more frequent and enduring spells of high inflation is overdone – and if anything the evidence might \nraise the question of whether, with a dual mandate, there should have been more aggressive monetary accommodation during periods of elevated unemployment, particul arly in the past five \nyears.  \n Another interesting aspect of the analysis shown in Figure 5 is whether the dual mandate \nresults in the United States having a larger concentration of high- inflation outcomes during \nperiods of high unemployment .  But the oppos ite is true, as most of the high -inflation \nobservations occur during periods of low unemployment.  Interestingly, for Sweden and the U.K. more of the high- inflation observations are during periods of high unemployment, which might \npartly be attributable to  open economies that may be more exposed to exchange rate and energy \nshocks.  To summarize, I would note that the dual mandate in the United States has been criticized \nby some for providing an inflationary bias.  However, the data show little such evidence .  \nInflation outcomes in the United States over the past 15- 20 years appear to compare quite \nfavorably to those  of single mandate countries.  \n 9 \n\nCentral Banks’ Actions When Inflation Exceeds the Target  \n One way of capturing differences that might exist between  single and dual mandate \ncountries is to examine whether single -mandate central banks were much more reticent to ease \npolicy if unemployment were high and they were currently somewhat above their inflation target.  \nSuch an approach can certainly be justifi ed when bound to a single mandate for inflation, but the \njustification for easing policy in such a circumstance would be that the inflation forecast suggests that inflation will return to 2 percent.  Contrast this with a dual mandate country, where rather than relying on an inflation forecast that is expected to fall – possibly because of slack resources – the central bank can directly appeal to the elevated unemployment rate as balancing the concerns over a somewhat elevated inflation.  \n Over the past five years, short -term interest rates in many countries have been close to, or \nat, the zero lower bound.  So it may be instructive to explore just how willing countries have been to expand their central bank’s balance sheet during peri ods of above -target inflat ion.  \nFigure 6 shows the core rate of inflation in the U.S. and the size of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet in recent years.  The only observations of core inflation above 2 percent were in 2008.  However, this was the period of the most rapid expansion of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet.  With a dual mandate, a period of fast -rising unemployment rates makes it straightforward to \ncommunicate the need to rapidly expand the balance sheet.  \n Figure 7 provides similar information for the Bank of England.  Unlike the United States, \nthe core inflation rate in the U.K. has been above 2 percent for much of this period.  Interestingly, the most rapid expansion of the balance sheet occurred in late 2008 when core inflation was above 2 percent, and the balance s heet began to grow further in 2011 when \ninflation was well above the 2 percent target.  So, despite the single mandate, the Bank of \n 10 \n\nEngland has been willing to expand its balance sheet even with core inflation rates pe rsistently \nhigher than target.  \n Figure  8 contains similar information for the Euro area and the European Central Bank.  \nThe most rapid increase  – but not the largest  – in the balance sheet was in 2008 when the core \ninflation rate was above 2 percent.  While core inflation remained below 2 perc ent for the rest of \nthe period, the expansion of the balance sheet resumed in 2011 when the core inflation rate was \nat a local maximum very close to 2 percent.  \n Figure 9 provides the same information for Sweden.  Sweden, like other countries, \nincreased its  balance sheet when core inflation was above 2 percent.  What is distinctive about \nSweden is the reduction in the central bank’s balance sheet, and how low their balance sheet has remained despite being well below 2 percent core inflation.  \n The good news i s that periods of higher inflation do not seem to constrain any of these \ncountries from easing monetary policy when the real economy is in serious distress, even if they \nare above a 2 percent inflation target.  But again, I would observe that with a dual m andate, the \ncommunication around these periods and policy actions is likely to be much more straightforward.  Perhaps a lesson to draw from these episodes is that, regardless of the formal structure of the central bank, all of us are dual mandate banks “at  heart.”  \n \nCurrent Policy in the United States and the Dual Mandate  \n Figure 10 looks at an estimate of the period- by-period loss function for the U.S. central \nbank, proxied by the squared deviations of inflation from an inflation target (not cumulative) in \nthe top panel, and the squared deviations of unemployment from an estimate of full employment utilizing the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) assessment of the natural rate for each year \n 11 \n\n(not cumulative) in the bottom panel.  There is no stated inflation t arget for the United States \nduring much of the sample period, so that during the earlier periods a filter is utilized that \nprovides a smoothed inflation target that ranges from 2 to 5 percent.5 \nFigure 11 stacks the deviations from the previous two charts.  The misses from inflation \nare shown in dark blue and the misses from unemployment are in light blue.  In effect this \nreflects a loss function that places an equal weight on inflation misses and unemployment \nmisses.  Parenthetically, I would point out that  an interesting question to consider is whether the \npossibility of long -term effects of unemployment, as will be discussed during this conference, \nshould alter the relative weights of inflation and unemployment in the loss function. \nMost of the large misse s in the 1970s and early 1980s were the result of very high \ninflation rates.  After the Federal Reserve dramatically reduced inflation rates under the \nleadership of Chairman Volker, inflation has remained well anchored and has not resulted in large inflation misses.  What is more striking is that now the misses have been associated with \nperiods of high unemployment.  The Great Recession resulted in such a large miss in unemployment that the squared deviations were higher than in any period in the past 30 ye ars.  \nEven now, the squared deviations remain at a high point for the past 20 years.  This may indicate that during the period of the 1970s and early 1980s too little weight may have been placed on inflation misses but in the more recent past  we may have p laced too little weight on \nunemployment misses – and if anything, we should have act ed more aggressively to reduce the \nunemployment rate.  \n With the unemployment rate at 7. 5 percent and both core and total PCE inflation at 1.5 \npercent, the communication of accommodative monetary policy is quite straightforward.  We are \n 12 \n\nwell above our unemployment target and well below our inflation target, so highly \naccommodative policy is both appr opriate and necessary.  \nFurthermore, the dual mandate, coupled with the FOMC’s  January “framework” \nstatement, has made it easier  to provide forward guidance.  The threshold language has clearly \nstated that unemployment is an important objective of monetary policy and an important determinant of when we will begin to raise short- term interest rates.  Similarly, the FOMC \nstatement makes clear that we are looking for substantial improvement in outlook for the labor market , in a context of price stability, before stopping large -scale asset purchases.  Given how far \nwe are below the 2 per cent inflation target, these actions could be motivated by large misses on \ninflation – but the dual mandate provides a much clearer, more transparent, and direct way to communicate with the public.  \n \nConcluding Observations  \n The dual mandate in the United States has provided a clear and transparent way to \ncommunicate the need for aggressive monetary policy .  Our inflation outcomes have been as \ngood as, if not better than, many countries with a single inflation mandate.  Furthermore, many \ncentral banks with only a single inflation mandate have chosen to expand monetary policy accommodation despite being at or above  a 2 percent inflation target.  \nThe general similarity of actions across central banks, despite differing mandates, is \nilluminating.  Again I would suggest that the dual mandate may have made the communication around our actions easier than in single mandate countries.  But the historical record shows that even this dual mandate central bank may have been a bit slow to place sufficient emphasis on unemployment deviations.  If that is the case, then as countries consider or reconsider their \n 13 \n\ncentral banks’ mandate, moving to a dual mandate may provide dual benefits: on the \ncommunications front, it will make it easier to provide forward guidance that conditions on both inflation and employment outcomes.  On the policy action front, a dual mandate may help to ensure that employment gets an appropriate weighting in the central bank’s assessment of appropriate policy, particularly during times when employment ranks f irst in terms of economic \nwoes.

The U.S. is the classic large \nsemi -open economy, while S weden is close to a classic small open economy; the U.K. and the larger pre- Euro E.U. \ncountries fall somewhere in between.  One would expect monetary expansion in a small open economy to cause a temporary increase in measured inflation due to exchange rate depreciation (as the prices of tradables increase) even \nwhen unemployment is above the natural rate (although the inflation increase would be small if there is limite d \nexchange rate pass -through).  \n \n4 A quadratic loss function.  \n \n5 The target inflation series is constructed by running a Hodrick- Prescott filter with smoothing parameter 1,600,000 \nover the core PCE inflation rate from 1959 to the present.

While deposit insurance \nreduces the risk that depositors will flee en masse from commercial banks, the financial \ncrisis highlighted that other types of financia l institutions and structures were also highly \nsusceptible to runs.  For example, money mark et mutual funds, which are not required to \nhold capital, experienced credit losses and signi ficant investor flight (i.e., runs) during the \ncrisis.  Policymakers put in place temporar y backstops – insurance funded by the U.S. \nTreasury and a liquidity facility facilitate d by the Federal Reserve – to avoid further \ncollateral damage.  Since then, there has been much public discussion of regulatory \nactions that could significan tly reduce the financial stab ility concerns around money \nmarket mutual funds – which are regulated by the SEC – but industry opposition has been vocal, and no significant actions have as yet been taken.\n1  Former SEC Chair Schapiro \nwas right to pursue money mark et fund reform, and now that her successor is confirmed I \nam hopeful that the SEC will revisit this issue.      Structured investment vehicles (SIVs), which financed long-term, risky financial \nassets with short-term commercial paper, al so encountered troubl e during the crisis.  \nInvestors who were concerned about the valu ation of the SIVs’ long-term assets “ran” \nfrom the short-term commercial paper the SI Vs issued to finance their assets, causing \nmany SIVs to fail or be wound down.   \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday Ap ril 17, 2013 at 1:00 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY  * \n 4Additionally, broker-dealer fi rms – which were assumed by most observers to \npresent less risk of a run b ecause their borrowing is often fully collateralized – proved \nvulnerable and also played a prominent role  during the crisis.  However, widespread \nquestions about the appropriate valuation of collateral during the crisis made it apparent \nthat collateral in and of itself wa s not sufficient to avoid runs.   \nBrokers act as agents for others and are defined by the Securities and Exchange \nAct to include those that “engage in the busine ss of effecting transactions in securities for \nthe account of others.”2  Dealers are “engaged in th e business of buying and selling \nsecurities for their own account.”  Both are regulated by the Securities and Exchange \nCommission (SEC) and are subject to a vari ety of regulations in cluding net capital \nrequirements, restrictions on the use of customer accounts, and various accounting and \nreporting requirements.   \nBroker-dealers are a critical component of our financial infrastructure.  They act \nas “market-makers” in securities,  ensuring that markets remain highly liquid and that \nfinancial transactions can be conducted effici ently and effectively.  Still, notwithstanding \ntheir market making strengths and capabiliti es, these organizations were not immune \nfrom the widespread seizing up of markets – a nd indeed found themselves  at the center of \nevents in the financial crisis. \nTwo prominent broker dealers failed at critical junctures during the crisis.  The \nfirst major broker-dealer failure involved B ear Stearns.  Arguably the most disruptive \nfailure was Lehman Brothers.  Emergency lo ans were provided to Bear Stearns, and in \nthe wake of its assisted merger a variety of  emergency credit facilities to backstop the \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday Ap ril 17, 2013 at 1:00 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY  * \n 5industry were set up.  Additional actions were taken, to forestall more widespread runs \nafter the failure of Lehman Brothers.    \nDespite the central role that broker-dealer s played in exacerba ting the crisis, too \nlittle has changed to avoid a repeat of the prob lem, I am sorry to say.  In short, I firmly \nbelieve that a reexamination of the solvency  risks of large broker-dealers is warranted.3 \n Hence, my remarks today will highlight the need for more regulatory focus on broker-dealers.  I will begin by discussing the role of broker-dealers and their experience \nduring the financial crisis.  I would then like to detail some of the policy actions taken \nduring the crisis – actions that backst opped broker-dealers and prevented further \ncollateral damage.  Then I will examine why being housed within a bank holding \ncompany should not obviate the need for the broker-dealer subsidiary to hold more \ncapital.  Then I will provide some concluding observations.  \nBroker-Dealers and the Financial Crisis \n Some of the largest broke r-dealers serve as a counterparty to the Federal Reserve \nwhen the Fed buys and sells securities – pe rforms so-called “open market operations” – \nin the conduct of monetary policy.  Trad itionally, most of the Fed’s open market \noperations involve the buying and selling of Tr easury securities, so broker-dealers that \nare the largest players in this critical mark et play a significant role in maintaining \nliquidity and market functioni ng.  Most of these firms are also very active in making \nmarkets in a variety of other financial instrume nts, and as such they help to facilitate \nwell-functioning credit markets more generally. \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday Ap ril 17, 2013 at 1:00 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY  * \n 6Figure 1 describes 10 large br oker-dealers in 2006, with the fourth column noting \ntheir crisis-era change s.  Rather striking changes have  occurred among the largest broker-\ndealers as a result of the financial cris is.  Two of the largest became bank holding \ncompanies (Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanle y).  Lehman Brothers and Bear Stearns – \nformerly ranking among the ten largest – both failed.  Merrill Lynch, which fell just short \nof the top 10 in 2006, was acquired while it wa s experiencing financial difficulties.  And \none of the largest foreign broker-dealers in 2006 (UBS) need ed to be supported by its \nhome government.  These outcomes occurred despite two substantial emergency lending \nprograms that provided backstop support to the large broker-dealers during the crisis. \nDramatic changes in organization and ow nership occurred among these critical \nentities. That, and the extent of their problems during the fi nancial crisis, make it clear \nthat they did not hold sufficient capital to weather the magnitude of problems they would \nface during the crisis.   \n    \nLiquidity Facilities during the Crisis \nIn 2008, the Federal Reserve established the Primary Dealer Credit Facility \n(PDCF) to help stem the financial crisis by pr oviding overnight loans to primary dealers.  \nThe assets that were put up as collateral for the loans were subject to significant \n“haircuts” – that is, the d ealers could only borrow against a fraction of assessed market \nvalue – to protect the Fed and minimize the risk that could stem from a borrower’s \ndefault.  As with the Fed’s so-called Di scount Window lending to commercial banks, \nlending was at the Fed’s primary credit rate a nd the dealer was fully responsible for the \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday Ap ril 17, 2013 at 1:00 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY  * \n 7repayment of the loan, beyond  the collateral pledged (in ot her words, the loans were \nmade with recourse).   \nThe program began in March 2008, in the wa ke of the Bear St earns failure, and \nended in February 2010.4  The PDCF was, in effect, tantamount to the Fed providing a \n“Discount Window” type lending f acility to primary dealers – in  order to ensure adequate \nfunctioning in securities markets that are a key part of the tri-party repo market.5  These \nmarkets are widely-used in short-term financ ing, and importantly are used by the central \nbank to conduct the trades in short-term government securities  that allow it to maintain \nthe federal funds rate at the level dictated by the FOMC.  It is importa nt to point out that \nwhen all was said and done, all the loans made  through the Primary Dealer Credit Facility \nwere paid off in full; and the sizable returns to the Fed generated by the program were remitted to the U.S. Treasury. \nAs Figure 2 highlights, primary dealers used the program extensively during the \ncrisis.  Lending peaked at $156 billion.\n6  And, while foreign-owned primary dealers did \nparticipate in the program, it was much more  extensively utilized by domestic primary \ndealers. \nThe Fed established a second emergenc y program, the Term Securities Lending \nFacility (TSLF), which allowed primary deal ers to lend less-liquid securities to the \nFederal Reserve for one month, for a fee, in exchange for highly liquid Treasury \nsecurities.  This program provided needed liqui dity to the market at  a time when trading \nin a wide variety of securities had become  impaired.  The TSLF was also announced in \nMarch 2008 and ended in February 2010.  As w ith the PDCF, there were no losses on the \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday Ap ril 17, 2013 at 1:00 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY  * \n 8program, and the revenue the Federal Reserve generated in operating the facility was \nreturned to the Treasury. \nFigure 2 also shows that the peak balance of the term securities lending program \nwas $246 billion.7  This program had roughly equal participation by domestic and foreign \nprimary dealers.   \nFigure 3 shows the loans outstanding over time with the PDCF.  The outstanding \nloans peaked in the fall of 2008 as primary dealers found it particularly difficult to fund \ntheir positions.   \nFigure 4 provides the outstanding securiti es lent through the TSLF.  Again the \npeak occurs in the fall of 2008, when liquidity  for securities trading became particularly \nproblematic. \nIn sum, broker-dealers experienced dr amatic difficulties during the 2008 crisis, \nand the Federal Reserve needed  to temporarily backstop broker-dealers with substantial \nlending.  Given that recent hist ory, the assumption that collate ralized lenders like broker-\ndealers are not susceptible to runs has been proven wrong.   \nAt the same time, broker-dealer capital  regulation by the SEC remains largely \nunchanged, despite the lessons of the financia l crisis.  Consequently, broker-dealers \nremain vulnerable to losing the confidence of funders and counterparties should the world \neconomy again experience a signif icant financial crisis.   \nAs I have mentioned in other speeches,8 during stress periods, bank holding \ncompanies with a low concentration in broke r-dealer activities had less stock price \nresponse to the stress periods than institutions  with greater concentration in broker-dealer \nactivities.  We have also examined the data  on credit default swap spreads – a market \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday Ap ril 17, 2013 at 1:00 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY  * \n 9gauge of the cost to insure ag ainst a party’s default – and th e data show materially higher \nspreads during times of financ ial turmoil for major banks wi th higher concentrations of \nbroker-dealer activity. \nMoreover, the current broker-dealer situati on vis-à-vis capital poses the potential \nfor significant moral hazard.   Were a cris is to once again cause serious problems in \nliquidity and in securities-market functioning, it is quite possible that programs such as \nthe PDCF and TSLF would need to be cons idered again (notwithstanding likely public \nopposition to what could be perceived as “bailout s”).  If broker-dealers assume that they \nwill once again have access to such govern ment support should markets be disrupted, \nthey will have little incentive to take the steps necessary to shield themselves from \nfinancing problems during a crisis and thus  minimize their need for a government \nbackstop.    \nBroker-Dealers and Bank Holding Companies \nOne of the fallouts of the financial crisis is that many of the large broker-dealer \noperations are now part of bank holding co mpany structures.  Goldman Sachs and \nMorgan Stanley became bank holding companies during the crisis.  Bear Stearns was acquired by J.P. Morgan Chase, and Merrill Lynch was acquired by Bank of America.  \nWhile these large broker-dealer operations are in bank holding companies, there are \nsignificant regulatory requirements and rest rictions that appl y, including capital \nthresholds and limitations on transactions  between the FDIC-insured depository \nsubsidiaries and the affiliated broker-dealer  subsidiaries.  Despite these restrictions, \nhowever, broker-dealers can still pose a risk to the broader organization by leaning on the \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday Ap ril 17, 2013 at 1:00 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY  * \n 10parent bank holding company for support and, acc ordingly, reducing the availability of \nfunds at the parent company to s upport any FDIC-insured depositary. \nBank holding company capital requiremen ts are applied to the consolidated \nholding company.  Arguably, the appropriate le vel of consolidated capital should depend \non the risks inherent in the holdi ng company’s liability structure, as well as in its assets.  \nFor example, to avoid solvency risk fo r a firm dependent on wholesale funding may \nrequire significantly more capital than a fi rm with all insured deposits, because of the \npossibility for runs and “fire sale” disposal of assets.  Those bank holding companies that \nare primarily funded by insured deposits ar e unlikely (or less likely) to suffer a \nsubstantial run.  However, a bank holding compa ny may find that liabilities of the broker \ndealer may be more susceptible to runs.  In  addition, current regula tions restrict bank \nsubsidiaries from supporting non-depository s ubsidiaries with funds from the insured \ndepository.  This suggests to me that bank holding companies with large broker-dealer \naffiliates should hold more capital to reflect the reduced stability of th eir liabilities during \ntimes of stress.   \nFigure 5 shows the Tier 1 common equity  capital ratio over time, and Figure 6 \nshows the leverage ratio over time.  While  bank holding companies with large broker-\ndealer operations generally have more Tier 1 common equity than bank holding companies with little or no broker-dealer act ivity, this result primarily reflects that \nbroker-dealers hold securities, which have low risk-weights compared to loans.  In \ncontrast, bank holding companies with large br oker-dealer operations tend to have much \nlower leverage ratios than bank holding compan ies with limited broke r-dealer activity.  \nHowever, given the very different risks of runs posed by broker-dealers and their less \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday Ap ril 17, 2013 at 1:00 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY  * \n 11stable liability structure, an argument can be made for higher capital requirements for \nbroker-dealers as well as orga nizations, such as bank holding companies, with significant \nbroker-dealer operations.   \n \nConcluding Observations \nIn summary and conclusion, I would just  reiterate that broker-dealers did not \nperform well during the financial crisis.  Many of the largest broker-dealers failed or \nwere converted to or subsumed into bank hol ding companies.  Despite these structural \nchanges, significant government intervention was required to maintain market functioning and liquidity, in markets key to the stability of the U.S. financial system and \nthe economy that relies on it.   \nUnfortunately, despite this history of fa ilure and substantial government support, \nlittle has changed in the solvency requirem ents of broker-dealers.   The status quo \nrepresents an ongoing and signi ficant financial stability risk.  In my view, then, \nconsideration should be given to whether br oker-dealers should be required to hold \nsignificantly more capital than depository institutions, which have deposit insurance and \npre-ordained access to the central bank’s Discount Window.   \nThank you. \n \n \n \n                                                 \n \n1 Recently the presidents of the 12 Federal Reserve Banks submitted a joint co mment letter responding to \nthe Financial Stability Oversight Council's proposal on money market mutual fund (MMF) reform, \navailable at http://www.bostonfed.org/news/pr ess/2013/pr021213-letter.pdf .  “Money market mutual funds \nhave no explicit capacity to absorb losses in the event of a decrease in the value of  assets held within the \nfund’s portfolio,” said the Reserve Bank presidents in their joint letter.  “This structure gives rise to a risk \nof destabilizing money market mutual fund runs by creating a first mover advantage.”  \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday Ap ril 17, 2013 at 1:00 P.M.

The Act generally defines a \"broker\" broadly as any person engaged in the \nbusiness of effecting transactions in securities for the account of others.  Unlike a broker, who acts as agent, \na dealer acts as principal. The Act generally defines a \"dealer\" as any person engaged in the business of \nbuying and selling securities for his own account, throug h a broker or otherwise. [Source: the SEC’s guide \nto broker-dealer registration, http://www.sec.gov/divisions/ marketreg/bdguide.htm#II ] \n \n3 I would note that Federal Reserve Governor Daniel  Tarullo and New York Fed President William Dudley \nhave raised concerns about broker-deal ers and wholesale funding markets. See \nhttp://www.federal reserve.gov/newsevents/s peech/tarullo20121204a.htm  and \nhttp://www.new yorkfed.org/newsevents/s peeches/2013/dud130201.html .  In the former Governor Tarullo \ndiscusses “three proposals currently being debated in policy circles: (1) breaking up large financial \ninstitutions by reinstating Glass-Seagull restrictions or by imposing other prohibitions on affiliations of \ncommercial banks with certain business lines; (2) placi ng a cap on the non-deposit liabilities of financial \ninstitutions; and (3) requiring fina ncial institutions above a specified size to hold minimum amounts of \nlong-term debt available for conversion to equity to avoid or facilitate an orderly resolution of a troubled \nfirm.”  \n4 The final auctions for the PDCF and TSLF were in May and July of 2009, respectively.  My graphs end in \nMay and Aug 2009, not Feb 2010, because while the program still existed in those latter months, there were no loans outstanding. \n \n5 My colleague William Dudley, president of the New York Fed, discussed access to the discount window \nin a speech entitled “Fixing Wholesale Funding to Build a More Stable Financial System,” available at \nhttp://www.new yorkfed.org/newsevents/s peeches/2013/dud130201.html .  In it he said “The other path \nwould be to expand the range of financial intermediati on activity that is directly backstopped by the central \nbank’s lender of last resort function. […] We have  banking activity — maturity transformation — taking \nplace today outside commercial banks. If we believe these activities provide essential credit intermediation \nservices to the real economy that could not be easily replaced by other forms of intermediation, then the \nsame logic that leads us to backstop commercial banking with a lender of last resort might lead us to \nbackstop the banking activity taking place in the mark ets in a similar way. However, any expansion of \naccess to a lender of last resort woul d require legislation and it would be e ssential to have th e right quid pro \nquo—the commensurate expansion in the scope of prudential oversight. […] Extension of discount \nwindow-type access to a set of nonbank institutions would therefore have to go hand-in-hand with \nprudential regulation of these institutions. Many thorny issues would have to be resolved.” \n \n6 Our PDCF peak ($156 billion) is calculated using daily data and differs from the peak that is calculated \nand often reported using weekly data ($146.6 billion). Similarly our TSLF data is weekly, as of Fridays, \nwhereas it is often published as of Wednesdays.   \n \n7 Figures for the Term Securities Lending Facility reflect expected maturities and may not reflect early \nreturns of loans outstanding.  \n \n8 See http://www.bostonfed.org/news/speeche s/rosengren/2012/062912/index.htm , particularly the \ndiscussion of broker-dealer financing beginning on page 11, and especially Figure 11.",

Rosengren \nPresident & Chief Executive Officer \nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston \n \nThe Global Interde pendence Center  \nCentral Banking Conference \n \nMilan, Italy \nMay 16, 2013 \n \n \n \n \nIt is a great pleasure to be invited to participate in the Global Interdependence Center’s \nconference on central banking.  This continues to be  a period requiring unusua l policy actions – even \nexperimentation – at central banks around the worl d.  So it is important to understand the forces \naffecting policymaking as well as the impact of the policies, both domestically and internationally.   \nI always begin my talks by noting that these rema rks reflect my views, not necessarily those of \nmy colleagues on the Federal Reserve’s Board of G overnors or the Federal Open Market Committee \n(the FOMC).  That is always the case, but I want to emphasize it today given my topic – the \nimplications of fiscal austerity for monetary po licy.  This is a matter of  great debate in most \ndeveloped economies, as governments contend with re latively high debt burdens  – at least by recent \n\n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL Thursday, May 16, 2013 at 7:45 AM U.S. Ea stern Time and 1:45 PM in Milan, Italy – or Upon Delivery \n \n \n \n \n 3historical standards – as well as the after-effects of a deep recession, and a painfully slow recovery.  \nCertainly fiscal matters are the subject of intense debate in the United States. \nOf course, much of the discussion – and many of the headlines – about fiscal austerity \nemanate from Europe.  But, when we total up the cuts in state and local  government spending and \nemployment, the cuts in federal government spending and employment, and recent tax policy, we \nactually see that U.S. fiscal pol icy has been quite contractionary  for several years now – beginning \nwell before the recent payroll tax increase and th e reductions in fiscal spending mandated by the \nfederal sequester. \nUnlike some of its counterparts around the world, the U.S. central bank has a dual mandate, \ncovering both inflation and employ ment.  So it is important when pursuing our mandate and shaping \nour policy to consider all the fact ors that affect the economy.  Fiscal  policy is one such factor.  For \ninstance, contractionary fiscal policy will in the near term place downward pressure on inflation and \nupward pressure on unemployment.   \nCurrently the personal consump tion expenditures or PCE inflation rate, which the Federal \nReserve chose as the measure for its inflation goal a ye ar ago, is about 1.0 percent.  This is well below \nour 2 percent target.  And the une mployment rate is 7.5 percent, which while lower than many other \ncountries remains well above most estimates of U.S. “full employment.”   \nIt is critically important that the United Stat es achieve a balanced and sustainable framework \nfor government spending, but the timing is important .  For example, making cuts too quickly to \nrestore balance to the federal budget  deficit will have a dampening e ffect on near-term growth and the \nrecovery, and as such will push th e economy further from a state that  achieves both elements of the \nFed’s dual mandate.1   \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL Thursday, May 16, 2013 at 7:45 AM U.S. Ea stern Time and 1:45 PM in Milan, Italy – or Upon Delivery \n \n \n \n \n 4As I mentioned a moment ago, fiscal policy is just one of the many f actors that the Federal \nReserve considers in policymaking, but one can see how the central bank – pursuing its dual mandate \n– would be likely to adopt a more accommodative monetary policy stance if government spending were contracting in the midst of an economic recovery.  Agai n, timing is key – long-term budget \nsustainability is vital, but decisions  to front-load or back-load cuts in  spending, or incr eases in taxes, \nhave implications for the curr ent stance of monetary policy. \nOf course, some observers and indeed policym akers have criticized the degree of monetary \naccommodation in the United States as excessive.  Ho wever, when we look at the data on outcomes in \nthe economy to date, I see it differently.  The outco mes could lead one to ar gue that policy has not \nbeen sufficiently  accommodative.  Inflation is below targ et and unemployment is  above target, and \nbased on the summary of economic projections (o r “SEP”) – which is published by the Federal \nReserve and summarizes the economic forecasts of  FOMC members – this condition is likely to \npersist for several more years.    \nAt least part of this “miss” on inflation and employment outcomes can be attributed to the \nemergence of more fiscal restrain t than might have been expected.  You may recall that the federal \nsequester was originally designed to pose such an unpalatable outcome  that all involved would prefer \nto reach an agreement on a more balanced fiscal appr oach.  Unfortunately, that has not been the result.  \nBy definition, the increased fiscal austerity in th e U.S. has weakened the outlook for near-term GDP \ngrowth, since government spending is a component of GDP.  \nTo be sure, the progress of the economic recovery  to date has been frustrating.  And, despite \nthe presence of significant headwind s – fiscal, financial, and otherwis e – some have suggested that the \nslow recovery proves that recent monetary policy actions have been  ineffective. However, contrary to \nwhat these observers claim, I would argue that the “miss” on outcomes is not evidence of monetary \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL Thursday, May 16, 2013 at 7:45 AM U.S. Ea stern Time and 1:45 PM in Milan, Italy – or Upon Delivery \n \n \n \n \n 5policy ineffectiveness.  In fact, in  the sectors of the economy that are likely to be most responsive to \nlower interest rates, like housi ng and consumer durables, recent growth has been quite rapid.  \nContrary to the notion that polic y has not succeeded, I would actually  say that monetary policy has \nbeen quite effective in offsetting the contra ctionary effects of recent fiscal policies. \n \nFiscal Policy and the Recovery \nAs everyone here probably know s, the overall growth rate of  real U.S. GDP during this \nrecovery has been quite slow – averaging roughly 2 pe rcent at an annual rate.  Growth has also been \nslow relative to the growth that occurred during th e most recent economic recoveries in the U.S.  \nHowever, looking at overall GDP growth is only pa rt of the story.  Looking more closely at the \ncomponents of real GDP reveals differences, and provides more perspective on the U.S. economy’s \ntepid recovery. \n Figure 1 shows growth in real final sales to pr ivate domestic purchasers.  Essentially this is \njust the consumption and investment components of GDP (household and firm spending), net of \ninventory accumulation.  It tries to capture the growth in domestic spending not attributed to \ngovernment spending or to the foreign sector.  \nOver the past three years, real final sales to private domestic purchasers have been quite \nstrong, reflecting particular strength in c onsumer durables and residential investment2 – the most \ninterest-sensitive sectors.  With household and fi rm spending relatively strong, other sectors of the \neconomy must account for the slow growth in overall GDP.   Figure 2 adds real final sales to all domestic purchasers to Figure 1, so the difference between \nthe two lines is attributable to government spending.  This measure has only been growing at a rate a \nlittle below 2 percent over the past  three years.  In short, while household and firm spending has been \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL Thursday, May 16, 2013 at 7:45 AM U.S. Ea stern Time and 1:45 PM in Milan, Italy – or Upon Delivery \n \n \n \n \n 6relatively robust, it has been offset by a fiscal headwind – reduced government spending – netting out \nto only tepid overall growth.  Figure 3 shows the growth in government spe nding.  Clearly, over the past three years the \ngrowth rate has been mostly negative, so real government spending has brought down the GDP total.  \nThis is in contrast to the earlier period, duri ng the recession, when government spending was actually \nan offset to the weakness in the private sector.  During that period there was federal stimulus money, \nand federal funding for state and local governments desi gned to help them better “weather the storm.”  \nFigure 4 shows another way to measure the impact of government spending on economic \ngrowth – the percent contribution of government spending to the percent change in real GDP.  \nRecently, the increase in real GDP includes a si zable negative contribution from reductions in \ngovernment spending.   \nFigure 5 splits government spending into the federal component, and the state and local \ncomponent.  State and local spending has been weak over the entire re covery, although as the \neconomy has recovered and state and local governmen ts have seen more tax revenue, it has become \nmuch less of a headwind than earlier in the re covery.  On the other hand, federal spending has \nrecently fallen sharply and is likely to continue to  be a source of weakness in the GDP accounts, given \nthe federal sequester.   Historically speaking, this pa ttern is unusual during economic recoveries.  Figure 6 indexes \ngovernment spending at the trough of the recession  to 100 for the current and previous three \nrecoveries. This recovery has been unusual in th at government spending is not normally a significant \nsource of headwind as the economy recovers – in fact usually the opposite is true.   \nConsider the 1982 recovery – the last time we had a recession where the unemployment rate \nreached 10 percent.  Government spending by this stage of the recovery had increased by 20 percent, \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL Thursday, May 16, 2013 at 7:45 AM U.S. Ea stern Time and 1:45 PM in Milan, Italy – or Upon Delivery \n \n \n \n \n 7one reason that particular recove ry was strong.  By contrast, duri ng this recovery real government \nspending has declined by more than 5 percen t over the 15 quarters of the recovery.   \n Figure 7 shows total payroll employment and private  payroll employment.  The difference \nbetween the two reflects changes in government employment.  During the recession, total payroll \nemployment was less negative than private payroll employment, indicating th e government sector was \nnot shedding jobs at a time when the private se ctor was significantly downsizing.  However, during \nthe recovery period, priv ate sector payroll employment has gr own more rapidly than the total, \nreflecting the loss of government jobs that has persisted over the recovery. \n In sum, fiscal restraint during the recovery has been notable and naturally  has factored into the \nrecovery’s pace.  While the sectors that are sensiti ve to monetary policy have responded to the Fed’s \naccommodative policy actions, the results have not fully  offset the headwinds, fiscal and otherwise, \nthat we have seen.  The overall result has been  economic growth around 2 percent, and only a very \ngradual improvement in labor markets. \n \nFiscal Restraint and Inflation \n   The unemployment rate is about 7.5 percent – at least 2 percentage points above my estimate \nof the U.S. “full employment” rate .  Add to this the recent U.S. inflation  experience and the other \nfactors I have been discussing, and it seems to me that highly accommodative monetary policy is \ncurrently appropriate.   \nDespite concerns expressed by some that increases in the Federal Reserve balance sheet may \nbe inflationary in the near term, the inflation rate remains well below target nearly five years after our \nbalance sheet expanded significantly.  Make no mist ake, in many situations such balance sheet \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL Thursday, May 16, 2013 at 7:45 AM U.S. Ea stern Time and 1:45 PM in Milan, Italy – or Upon Delivery \n \n \n \n \n 8activity would be inflationary, but the fact that it has not been underl ines how challenging the recent \nfinancial crisis, recession, and slow recovery have been.   \nFigure 8 provides total and core PCE inflati on.  Core PCE inflation has remained below 2 \npercent since December 2008 and currently is only 1.1 percen t, close to the low for the last five years.  \nTotal PCE inflation is slightly below 1 percent, at 0.97 percent.   \nIndeed, the level to which the inflation rate ha s fallen would actually be of some concern in \nthe event that the economy was hit by a negative s hock.  Such a situation mi ght echo the historical \nexperience of Japan, where low rate s of inflation were not addresse d and a significant negative shock \ncaused Japan to experience deflation, which has been qui te difficult to reverse.  In the U.S. there is no \nevidence that inflation expectations have falle n, despite the actual experience of persistently \nundershooting the Fed’s 2 percent target.  However, rema ining at such a low rate of inflation rate does \nincrease the risk that a negative shock could alter the stable infla tion expectations that we have \nexperienced. \n Figure 9 shows one reason why this is a concern.  It plots the real  interest rate as the difference \nbetween the 3-month Treasury rate and the year-over-year core PCE in flation rate.  In effect, this \nassumes that inflation expectations  equal the past year’s core PCE inflation rate.  Since the 3-month \nTreasury rate has remained very close to zero for more  than four years, the m ovements in the real rate \nmust primarily reflect changes in th e other part of the equation – the in flation rate.  Importantly, as the \ninflation rate falls, the real interest rate rises .  Higher real interest rate s make it more expensive to \nborrow, after controlling for changes in inflation.   Japan has been an extreme example of this \ndynamic, given that deflation has caused the real interest rate to remain positive despite a weak \neconomy and falling prices.   \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL Thursday, May 16, 2013 at 7:45 AM U.S. Ea stern Time and 1:45 PM in Milan, Italy – or Upon Delivery \n \n \n \n \n 9In sum, the longer we in the U.S. remain so fa r below our 2 percent targ et, the greater the risk \nthat inflation expectations c ould fall and real interest rates rise.  In  part to offset this risk, the Fed has \nconducted large-scale asse t purchases that increa se its balance sheet. \n \nBalance Sheet Implications \n Figure 10 shows central bank assets in the Unite d States, United Kingdom, and the Euro area.   \nEach central bank has expanded its bala nce sheet, with the U.K. and the U. S. being particularly active.   \nThe U.S. Federal Reserve has seen a renewed in crease in the size of it s balance sheet, starting \nin the fall of last year, reflecti ng the new program of open-ended asset purchases.  This latest program \nhas helped keep prevailing interest rates low, so that housing and consumer durables can continue to \nsupport the expansion and so we make further progr ess on both elements of the Fed’s dual mandate \n(inflation and employment).   \nWe have seen a gradual improvement in labor mark ets, in part as a result of these actions.  The \nunemployment rate was 7.8 percent in September wh en we began the program, and is currently 7.5 \npercent. Employment growth aver aged about 150,000 jobs per month in the three months ending in \nSeptember; then for the most recent three mont hs (February through April) employment growth \naveraged over 200,000 jobs per month.  But despite modest increases in employment in recent months, the employment-to-popu lation ratio remains low. \nThis last observation carries the more omi nous implication that, while there has been \nimprovement in labor markets, much of the improvement in the unemployment rate is just a result of \nworkers leaving the labor force.   More signific ant improvement in the employment picture will \nrequire growth in real GDP th at is faster than the 2 percent we have been averaging. \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL Thursday, May 16, 2013 at 7:45 AM U.S. Ea stern Time and 1:45 PM in Milan, Italy – or Upon Delivery \n \n \n \n \n 10 As I noted earlier, restrictive fiscal policy has had an impact on near-term economic growth \nduring the recovery.  As Figure 11 sh ows, cuts in real government sp ending in the United States over \nthe past three years have been quite large.  In fact, the cuts in government spending in the United \nStates have been much larger in percentage terms than in the U.K. or the Euro area, where fiscal \nausterity has received more attentio n.  Fiscal restraint is one of th e headwinds that we factored into \nmonetary policymaking, framed of cour se by our mandates from Congress.   \nWhile Figure 11 considers only government spe nding, Figure 12 presents  a broader measure \nof fiscal austerity, by including th e revenue side and adjusting for the business cycle.  The chart \nshows the impact of changes in taxes as well as government spending, after controlling for economic \ngrowth (removing the impact of the business cycle).   Looking at the change in the general \ngovernment structural budget balance3 relative to potential GDP over the period 2010 to 2013, the \ndegree of fiscal austerity is fairly sim ilar across the U.S., U.K., and Euro area. \nGiven the additional restraint imposed by the fede ral sequester, the United States is likely to \nonce again be a leader in cutting government spending.  The Federal Reserve should, and will, \ncontinue to consider the likely state of fiscal  policy, like many other economic factors, in making \nmonetary policy.  \nConcluding Observations \n The U.S. economy has continue d to gradually improve.   Labo r markets have also slowly \nimproved.  The progress has been in part the re sult of the accommodative monetary policy.  While \nhousehold and firm spending has grown relatively ra pidly, it has been partially offset by headwinds \nincluding cuts in government sp ending – resulting in only modest  overall economic growth.   \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL Thursday, May 16, 2013 at 7:45 AM U.S. Ea stern Time and 1:45 PM in Milan, Italy – or Upon Delivery \n \n \n \n \n 11Let me close by reiterating that a long-term sustai nable solution for fiscal balance is absolutely \nin the country’s interest.  But timing is an issue.  We have suffered a severe  financial crisis, a deep \nrecession, and a painfully slow recovery.  Fiscal polic y is obviously the jurisdiction of the legislative \nand executive branches of governme nt, but given the economic realities I would urge policymakers to \nconsider scenarios where some elements of fiscal  rebalancing take effect only after the economy has \nmore fully improved, and the possibility of a le ss restrictive fiscal stance until that time. \n Thank you.                                                               \n \nNOTES: \n \n1 Some would observe that much of the current federal budget deficit is cyclical, not structural – that simply moving to full \nemployment would eliminate a significant share of the budget deficit.  \n2 Residential investment has grown strongly over the last six quarters; prior to that its performance was more mixed. \n \n3 The structural budget balance refers to the general govern ment cyclically adjusted bala nce adjusted for nonstructural \nelements beyond the economic cycle.

Rosengren  \nPresident & Chief Executive Officer  \nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston  \n \nRemarks at the Economic Club of Minnesota \n \nMinneapolis, Minnesota  \nMay 29, 2013 \n \n \n \n \nI would like to thank the Club for your invitation, and in particular Mark Olson, a \nformer member of the Fed’s Board of Governors.   \nIt is a great pleasure to be back in Minneapolis.  When I was in graduate school at \nthe University of Wisconsin at Madison, my brother was in graduate school at the University of Minnesota – so I have fond memories of visiting the Guthrie Theater, \nenjoying  the lakes, and seeing the passionate way a warm day is welcomed in this city.   \nI am also grateful that you were looking for a speaker in May , and not January.  \nMy comments today will focus on the progress the economy has made since the \nFederal Reserve ado pted an open -ended large -scale asset purchase program last \nSeptember.  I should mention as I always do that my comments reflect my views, not \n\n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 12: 25 PM U.S. Central Time ( 1:25 PM U.S. Eastern Time)  \non Wednesday, May  29, 2013, OR UPON DELIV ERY  \n \n   \n 2 necessarily those of my colleagues on the Fed’s Board of Governors or the Federal Open \nMarket Committee (FOMC).  \nAt last September’s meeting of the FOMC, we took into account the August \nunemployment rate of 8.1 percent, and weighed concerns that without more policy \naccommodation the economy  would make little progress in returning to full employment \nin the near term.   \nSince adopting an asset purchase program focused on mortgage -backed securities \n(MBS) last September,1 and additional longer -term Treasury securities in December,2 \nthere has been some evidence of strengthening labor markets.  The unemployment rate is \ncurren tly 7.5 percent, and payroll employment growth has averaged more than 200,000 \njobs per month over the past several  months.   I expect that the unemployment rate will \nbe down to 7.25 percent or a bit lower by the end of the year.  This has been my forecast since the beginning of the year, but the recent incoming data have bolstered my \nconfidence in that degree of improvement being achieved.  In fact, I see it as a quite positive sign of underlying economic strength that labor markets are improving despite significant fiscal “headwinds” in the form of the payroll tax increase and the federal \nbudget sequester.  \nWhat are the implications of these incremental changes  in the economy for the \nFederal Reserve’s asset -purchase program?  The program was designed to cont inue until \nthere was a substantial improvement in the outlook for the labor market, as long as the \nbenefits of the purchases outweighed the costs.  My personal view is that the benefits of \nthis accommodative monetary policy program still signif ica ntly outw eigh the costs .  \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 12: 25 PM U.S. Central Time ( 1:25 PM U.S. Eastern Time)  \non Wednesday, May  29, 2013, OR UPON DELIV ERY  \n \n   \n 3 While some improve me nt in labor markets  has been achieved , it does not yet constitute \nprogress sufficient to merit halting the asset purchase program.    \nAs for the costs, the Fed is and should be very attuned to unintended \nconsequences – and is intently monitoring an array of asset prices, including stock prices, \nhousing prices, and other widely held assets.  At this point it seems that fundamentals are \nprevailing, and potential costs are well contained.  \nI also believe that the Federal Rese rve should make adjustments to the program \nbased on economic outcomes – that if the economy and the outlook improve, the rate of \npurchases  could be gradually reduced , rather than  sudden ly stopped once we have \nachieved substantia l improve me nt in labor marke ts.  By the way, a reduction is one \npossibility, but of course  adjustments could be down or up – because if the  incoming  \neconomic data do not reflect improve me nts consistent with both elements of our dual \nmandate, I believe the Fed should be willing to inc rease  asset purchases.   \n Progress in the Economic Outlook  \n Figure 1 shows how the Blue -Chip forecast for the unemployment rate at the end \nof 2013, and the Survey of Professional Forecasters\n3 projection for the same, have \nevolved since last September.  As the actual, current unemployment rate has slowly receded , there has been a gradual improvement in the forecast for the unemployment rate \nat the end of this year.   Both forecasts are now proj ecting the unemplo yme nt rate will be \nlower at the end of the year than they had projected last September , although they are still \nnot quite as optimistic as my own forecast . \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 12: 25 PM U.S. Central Time ( 1:25 PM U.S. Eastern Time)  \non Wednesday, May  29, 2013, OR UPON DELIV ERY  \n \n   \n 4  Turning to inflation measures, Figure 2 shows the evolution since last September \nof the Blue Chip forecast for the Consumer Price Index (CPI) at the end of 2013, and the \nSurvey of Professional Forecasters projection for the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) inflation rate at the end of 2013.  Both show  declining forecasts  of infl atio n for \n2013, as  incoming data consistently come in below forecasts – raising the possibility that  \ninfla tio n  will fall  further below  the Federal Reserve’s 2 percent target.  \n Figure 3 shows the growth in the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet.\n4  We have \nbeen purchasing $85 billion in securities  per month.  Were we to decide to lower the \npurchase amount somewhat, our assets would continue to rise but at a more modest rate.   \nThus we would be increasing monetary accommodation, but at a slower pace.   \nOf course , many asset prices are calibrated to the anticipation of our cumulative \npurchases.   Thus the effect  of our purchases  ultimately depends on whether they result in \na larger or smaller balance sheet for the central bank , which in turn depends on when the \npurchase program ends, given the pace of purchases .  If asset purchases at a lower rate \nwere to continue for longer than they would otherwise, the Fed’s balance sheet could \nactually grow larger than it would with more sizable purchases over a shorter period.  So, \nin short, altering the flow of purchases may or may not result in a smaller central bank \nbalance sheet, depending on how long the reduced inflow of assets continued.   \nFigure 4 provides a scatter diagram that attempts to depict the economy’s \nexperienc e with inflatio n and unemployment, the two facets of the Federal Reserve ’s dual \nmandate from Congress.  Of course a variety of factors play a role in these outcomes, not \njust monetary policy – but it is instructive to look at the actual recent experience.  \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 12: 25 PM U.S. Central Time ( 1:25 PM U.S. Eastern Time)  \non Wednesday, May  29, 2013, OR UPON DELIV ERY  \n \n   \n 5 On the horizon tal or x axis I have plotted  the PCE inflatio n rate minus 2 percent – \nso when the inflation rate is at our target, 2 percent, the dot should lie on the vertical or y \naxis.  If inflation is above 2 percent it will be to the right of the vertical axis and if \ninflation rate is undershooting our target it will be to the left of the vertical  axis.  By the \nway, while the FOMC has only had an explicit 2 percent inflation target for the past 16 \nmonths , there is strong empirical evidence suggesting th at the central bank had an \nimplicit  2 percent inflation target over the past two decades.5 \nThe chart’s vertical or y axis focuses on the employment side of our mandate.  It \nplots the deviation of the unemployment rate from the Congressional Budget Office’s \n(CBO’s) estimate of full employment.  When the unemployment rate is above the full employment level, the observation s are above the horizontal or x-axis, and when the \nunemployment rate is below the full employment level the observations are below the  \nhorizontal  axis.   \nIn short, a hypothetical “bull’s eye” outcome reflecting the dual mandate \nframework could show up as  an inflation rate of 2 percent and an unemployment rate at \nthe CBO’s estimate of full employme nt – and such an  observation w ould lie at the \nintersection of the two axes.   Points that are near the intersection of the axes could be \nconsidered close to achievi ng both elements of the mandate.  \nThe three red diamonds represent the most recent three quarters.  They appear in \nthe upper left quadrant, where  unemplo yme nt is well above the full employme nt level \nand inflation is below target.  The red diamonds are well above the cluster of \nobservations representing quarters where performance was closer to mandate (closer to the origin  where the axes cross ) – but at the same time are much closer to the origin than \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 12: 25 PM U.S. Central Time ( 1:25 PM U.S. Eastern Time)  \non Wednesday, May  29, 2013, OR UPON DELIV ERY  \n \n   \n 6 at earlier stages of the recovery, when we experienced  much higher unemployment rates \nthan we see currently . \nFigure 5 provides the same information as Figure 4, but uses the core PCE \nmeasure of inflation rather than the total PCE.  With the core measure, the more volatile \nfood and energy prices that the Federal R eserve cares about but cannot control are \nexcluded .  Clearly this measure of the inflation rate does not show as wide a range of \nobservations, in particular because it does not encompass  the significant swings in oil \nprices that we have seen over the past two decades.   \nThe chart clearly shows a dense set of observations near the origin and a \nsomewhat less dense set of observations above the three red diamonds.  The chart implies \nthat we are transitioning from being well away from full employment, and have been \nmoving clo ser to the horizonta l axis as the economy has recovered.  \nFigure 6 shows total PCE inflation over a longer time period, the past three \ndecades.  The solid horizon tal line reflects the most recent observation of total PCE \ninflation.  While there are three pe riods when total PCE inflation has been lower over the \npast 30 years, the current PCE inflation rate is much lower than it has been over most of that period. \nFigure 7 shows the core PCE inflation over the past three decades, again with the \nmost recent obse rvation reflected in a dark horizont al line.  This shows even more starkly \njust how low the inflation rate is currently.  The current core PCE inflation rate is close to \nthe low point for the past 30 years. \nSwitching from infla tio n to unemplo yme nt, Figure 8 shows the unemployment \nrate over the past three decades with a dark horizon tal line at 7.5 percent unemployment, \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 12: 25 PM U.S. Central Time ( 1:25 PM U.S. Eastern Time)  \non Wednesday, May  29, 2013, OR UPON DELIV ERY  \n \n   \n 7 the current unemployment rate.  While the unemployment rate has fallen significantly \nfrom its peak during this business cycle, it is still qu ite high.  At an unemployment rate of \n7.5 percent, the rate is above the peak level in the  last prior recession  (2001)  and near the \npeak level associated with  the 1990 recession. \nThe charts highlight that while we have seen some improvement in labor market s, \nthe unemployment rate remains well above what can be considered full employment, and the inflation rate remains well below target.  In fact, core inflation remains at the very \nlow end of recent experience , and the unemployment rate is close to the cycli cal peaks of \nthe past two recessions.  And as I mentioned before, potential unintended costs of the \naccommodative policy are not currently evident.  Taken together, t hese facts provide the \nrationale for my own view that, while we have seen some improvement  in labor market \nconditions, significant accommodation remains appropriate at this time.  \n \nDisaggregated Labor Market Data  \nFigure 9 shows the pattern of unemployment by state – with dark green \nrepresenting states that have had a decline in the unemployment  rate of 1.0 percent or \nmore since last September, light green representing states that have  had a decline between \n0.5 and 1.0 percent, yellow representing states that have had a decline ranging from 0.0 to \n0.5 percent, and red representing states that hav e had an increase  in the unemployment \nrate. \n The overall improvement in unemployment rates has been widespread.  Only five \nstates had higher unemployment rates in April 2013 than in September 2012, and one of \nthem is North  Dakota – a state that has a very low unemployment rate of 3.3 percent.  \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 12: 25 PM U.S. Central Time ( 1:25 PM U.S. Eastern Time)  \non Wednesday, May  29, 2013, OR UPON DELIV ERY  \n \n   \n 8 Some of t he states with the biggest declines in the unemployment rate have been among  \nthose with very high rates, such as Nevada,  Rhode Island, California, and Florida.  Also \nnotable is the fact that state s that were particularly troubled by falling real estate values \nand elevated foreclosure – such as California, Florida, and Nevada – are all among the \nstates with the largest declines in the unemployment rate.  \n It is also instructive to examine not just unemployment rates but the state patterns \nin payroll employme nt growth – since in some states the unemployment rate fell in part \nbecause of declines in the labor force, which could be the result of discouraged workers \ngiving up the sear ch for a formal job.  Figure 10 shows payroll employment growth by \nstate.  Dark green states have had positive payroll employment growth  that expand ed \nfaster than the labor force.  Light green states have had increases in payroll employment \nbut no increase  in the labor force.  Yellow states have had positive payroll employment \ngrowth, but the expansion has been slower than growth in the labor force.  And the red \nstates have had declines in payroll employment.   \nIt is encouraging that only three states have experienced  declines in payroll \nemployment.  Also, those states that were hit hardest by declines in real estate values – \nCalifornia, Florida, and Nevada – are all among the states that have experienced growth \nin payroll employment that exceeds growth in t he labor force.  \n Taken together, Figures 9 and 10 indicate that improvements in labor markets \nhave been relatively widespread, and that regions that were particularly impacted by real \nestate problems are among the states that have recovered the most since last September.  \nOverall, this indicates that the economic recovery is beginning to positive ly impact most \nregions of the country.  \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 12: 25 PM U.S. Central Time ( 1:25 PM U.S. Eastern Time)  \non Wednesday, May  29, 2013, OR UPON DELIV ERY  \n \n   \n 9 Concluding Observations  \n In summary and conclusion, s ince last September there has been continued slow \nimprove me nt in labor m arkets.  Most regions of the country now have better labor market \nconditions than they did last September.  Despite the slowly improving labor market \noutlook, the unemployment rate remains at levels close to the peaks of the past two recessions, indicating  that the economy remains far from the full employme nt  level. \n In terms of monetary policy, it would in my view be premature to stop the Fed’s \nlarge-scale asset purchase program at this time.  I believe the Fed should continue the \npurchase program until we  see more sustained improve me nt in labor markets  and have \ngreater confidence that the econom ic recovery  is sufficiently self -sustaining to yield \ncontinued progress in reducing the still very high unemployment rate.   \nHowever, I would also say that it may b e undesirable to abruptly stop purchases, \nso it may make sense to consider a  modest reduction in  the pace of asset purchases if we \nsee a few months more of gradual improve me nt in labor markets  and improve me nt in the \noverall growth rate in the economy – consistent, by the way, with my forecast, which is \nsomewhat more optimistic than that of many private forecasters .   \nI would reiterate that with an open -ended asset purchase program, changing the  \nflow of purchases does not necessarily yield , in the end , a smaller central bank balance \nsheet.  That would depend on having a fixed point for cessation of purchases , combined \nwith a lower flow of purchases.  So, even if we were to adjust the  rate of mont hly \npurchases , the ultimate size of the  Fed’s  balance sheet would depend on the point of \ncessation.  If economic growth proves  sufficient and the purchase program w as not \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 12: 25 PM U.S. Central Time ( 1:25 PM U.S. Eastern Time)  \non Wednesday, May  29, 2013, OR UPON DELIV ERY  \n \n   \n 10 extended over a longer time period, the size of the balance sheet could be smaller th an \notherwise .   \nThe bottom line is that we really need  to see the economy grow, a s I hope and \nexpect , more quickly than at the 2.1 percent growth rate it has averaged over th e \nrecovery .  Faster growth is essential  to attaining infla tio n and employme nt outc omes \nconsistent with the Federal Reserve’s dual mandate from Congress – and more broadly \nfor the economic wellbeing of the many Americans who have struggled through a long \nand slow recovery . \n Thank you.  \n \n \n                                                 \n \n1 See the September 13, 2012 FOMC statement available at \nhttp://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/m onetary/20120913a.htm  \n \n2 After our program  to ex tend the average m aturity of our holdings of Treasury securities was com pleted at \nthe end of 2012.

As \nyou all know, we recently passed the five-yea r anniversary of the failure of Lehman \nBrothers.  This conference is particularly  appropriate because many of the issues \nsurrounding stable funding, so relevant in the crisis, sadly remain with us today.   \n\n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, September 27, 2013 at  8:30 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY * \n \n \n  \n 3Indeed, one of the hallmarks of the 2008 fi nancial crisis was the severity of runs \non financial intermediaries that were not trad itional depository institutions.  During these \nruns, the inability to obtain short-term  funding meant that br oker-dealers could not \nfinance their securities portfolios.  Similarl y, Structured Investment  Vehicles (SIVs) and \nother structured financial en tities could not obtain rollove r financing.  And as you well \nknow, in the wake of the Lehman failure, the Reserve Primary Fund was unable to maintain a fixed net asset value (NAV).  Inve stors who were concerned that other funds \nwith exposure to Lehman might not be able  to maintain their NAVs ran from prime \nmoney market mutual funds (MMMFs).   \nMany of the structural weaknesses that li e beneath these run episodes have yet to \nbe fully addressed by market participants and policymakers.  It is good that they will be \ndiscussed in various sessions  at today’s conference. \n Given that our time is limited, I will focus my remarks on MMMFs and, given the conference themes, the critical role that MMMFs play in short-term credit markets, \nproviding funding to financial intermediaries .  I will first describe how prime MMMFs \ncontributed critically to the financial in stability experienced in the fall of 2008 – \ninstability that necessitate d substantial government intervention, including providing \ninsurance for MMMFs, tailoring an emergency lending facility to provide liquidity for \nMMMFs, and providing a variety of other emerge ncy liquidity facilities – in part as a \nresult of the “collateral damage” throughout the financial infrastructure stemming from \nthe run on MMMFs.  I would stress that thes e actions were taken not to prop up the \nfinancial infrastructure per se, but rather to ensure funding fl ows that are crucial to real \neconomic activity. \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, September 27, 2013 at  8:30 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY * \n \n \n  \n 4Second, I will describe some of the cha llenges posed by the structure of MMMFs, \nwhich necessitated the Securities and Excha nge Commission’s (SEC’s) 2010 reforms to \nRule 2-a7 as well as the Commission’s cu rrent proposal on money market mutual fund \nreform.  In this, I will draw heavily from the joint letter sent by all 12 of the Federal \nReserve Bank presidents in response to the SEC’s request for comment.  I would like, \nhowever, to stress that while many of my comments will draw from that comment letter, my remarks today are my own and do not neces sarily reflect the vi ews of my colleagues \nat the Board of Governors, or the other Re serve Bank presidents who signed the letter.\n1   \nThird, I will discuss what I see as so me needed enhancements to the SEC \nproposal.  I will conclude that the floa ting NAV proposal, properl y implemented, would \nenhance financial stability; but  the proposal to allow discre tionary liquidity fees and \nredemption gates would not enhance financial stability – and would likely be worse than \nthe status quo. \n \nMoney Market Mutual F unds during the Crisis \n Figure 1 shows total MMMF assets unde r management, which currently total \napproximately $2.6 trillion.  These assets are distributed across funds  that buy short-term, \ntax-free municipal securities (approximately $265 billion in assets), funds that buy short-\nterm government and agency securities2 (approximately $890 billion in assets), and funds \nthat purchase short-term cor porate and financial debt instru ments as well as government \nand agency securities.  The latter, the so -called “prime” money market mutual funds, \nrepresent about 56 percent of tota l MMMF assets (about $1.5 trillion).3   \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, September 27, 2013 at  8:30 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY * \n \n \n  \n 5All three types of MMMFs hold short-term securities, as required by rule 2a-7 \nunder the Investment Company Act.  Specifi cally, the Act constrains MMMFs to hold \nsecurities with no more than 397 days to ma turity and to maintain a weighted average \nmaturity of 60 days or less.4  The MMMFs, regulated by the SEC, are to have very \nlimited interest rate risk, a high degree of  liquidity, and – ideally – relatively limited \ncredit risk.   Figure 2 shows the assets under manageme nt for all MMMFs, and separately for \njust the prime money market funds.  As you can see, MMMFs grew rapidly during the \nperiod leading up to the financial crisis, but experienced a significant outflow when the \nfailure of Lehman Brothers led the Reserv e Primary Fund to “break the buck” (becoming \nunable to maintain a fixed $1 pe r share net asset value).   \nAs it became apparent that some prime funds were exposed to non-trivial amounts \nof credit risk, and w ith investors in the Reserve Pr imary Fund unable to access their \nmoney and facing uncertain losses, investor s in other prime MMMFs began to quickly \nredeem their funds.  In the week after the Reserve Primary Fund announcement, more \nthan $300 billion dollars “ran” from prime funds .  At least some of the funds redeemed \nfrom prime MMMFs were reinvested into  government MMMFs, as investors sought \nfunds that did not take credit risk.  Of course, others tr ansferred deposits to insured \ndepository institutions.  \nThe run on prime MMMFs would likely have been much more severe and \ndisruptive had the Treasury not announced  a temporary guarantee program, which \nprovided insurance to money fund investors, and had the Federal Re serve not set up an \nemergency lending facility that provided n eeded liquidity to MMMFs experiencing (or \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, September 27, 2013 at  8:30 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY * \n \n \n  \n 6concerned that they might soon e xperience) significant withdrawals.5  These \nunprecedented government actions were designed to provide confidence to investors to \nstem the outflows from prime funds.  But they  were also intended to  stabilize the short-\nterm funding markets, because the dramatic reduction in money fund assets meant that \nmoney market funds withdrew fr om their role as significant pu rchasers of short-term debt \ninstruments – an activity critical to the func tioning of short-term credit markets and the \nprovision of stable funding w ithin the financial system. \n Figure 3, which shows the current com position of prime money market mutual \nfunds, highlights why these entities are so cr itical to the provision of stable funding.  \nMMMFs continue to provide important liquidity for short-term debt instruments, such as \ncommercial paper, asset-backed commercial pape r, and short-term debt obligations.  As I \nhave suggested, one reason that short-term credit froze up in the wake of Lehman’s \nfailure was that money market funds were not  able to continue purchasing such debt, \nwhich slowed the flow of critical stable funding within the “fin ancial ecosystem.” \nThe result was that the Federal Reserve needed to provide liquidity not only to \nMMMFs directly, but also to markets where MMMFs were usually an important source \nof financing.6  By the way, it is worth noting that both the temporary guarantees provided \nby the Treasury and the type of liquidity facility run by the Federal Reserve are now \nessentially ruled out (by the Emergency Ec onomic Stabilization Act, and by Dodd-Frank \nprovisions).  Thus, if MMMFs were to agai n experience a significant run, short-term \ncredit markets could not rely on the same degree of government s upport, and might find \nthe shock to stable funding to be even more disruptive.   \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, September 27, 2013 at  8:30 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY * \n \n \n  \n 7 So where are we now?  Currently we have  new limitations on public-sector safety \nnets for MMMFs.  We have the still-remain ing risk of a significant disruption to short-\nterm credit markets, were MMMFs to again experience runs.  As a result, there are \nreasons to remain concerned about cr edit risk some MMMFs may be taking.   \nOne possible source of risk is highlighted in Figure 4, which shows the European \nexposure of MMMFs.  Roughly one-third of th e assets held by prime MMMFs are related \nto European firms.  Of course, there are ma ny European firms with low credit risk, but if \nsome MMMFs get more comfortable with ri skier European expos ures, the financial \nsystem becomes more susceptible to a fi nancial shock emanating from Europe.   \n Figure 5 shows the reduction in MMMFs ’ exposure to commercial paper and \nasset-backed commercial paper since the financia l crisis.  The decline, in part, reflects the \nlow-interest-rate environment, which has led many firms to issue longer-term debt.  It \nalso reflects the fact that many markets that relied on asset-backed financing still have not \nrecovered.  However, money markets remain an important source of financing for these \ninstruments.  In summary, I would say that prime MMMFs remain a very important source of financing for short-term debt instruments – and thus any disruption in the MMMF sector \ncould again impede the provision of stable funding to financia l intermediaries.  Many of \nthe tools used to offset the 2008 run by MMMF investors have been ruled out by legislation.  And once again, some MMMFs are be ginning to take riskier positions.  Thus, \nthe financial stability concerns surrounding MMMFs remain real, five years after the \nfinancial crisis.    \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, September 27, 2013 at  8:30 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY * \n \n \n  \n 8Money Market Mutual Fund Reform \n Reform remains critical because MMMFs im plicitly promise to return a fixed net \nasset value, even as they take credit risks against which they hold no capital.  A failure to \nkeep this implicit promise during a future period of financial turmoil could risk once \nagain freezing short-term credit markets.  The Financial Stability Oversight Council \n(FSOC) has proposed th ree potential reforms,7 with the one requiring MMMFs to hold \ncapital quite similar to proposals curr ently being considered in Europe.8  However, at this \ntime the SEC has advanced only two proposals,  only one of which was included in the \nFSOC proposals. \nThe first SEC proposal, which was s uggested by the FSOC, would treat \ninstitutional prime MMMFs like other mutual f unds and allow the value of a share of the \nfund to float with the value of its underlying assets.  Bu t unlike the FSOC’s proposal, the \nSEC’s proposal limits this reform option to institutional prime MMMFs (funds serving \ninstitutional investors).   \nThe incentive to run on a MMMF stems from the concern that a fund could suffer \ncredit or other losses and woul d be unable to redeem shares at  its “fixed” net asset value.  \nIn that case, the first investors to ask for their funds back will get them, while later \ninvestors may not. \nThe floating NAV, which removes the implicit promise to redeem shares at a \nfixed net asset value, short-circuits this dynamic.  Investors recognize that the market \nvalue of the fund’s assets can fluctuate mode stly, even though they are of high quality \nand short maturity.  As a consequence, the va lue of their shares in the fund will fluctuate \n– as they do with most other mutual funds  – and what they receive upon redemption will \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, September 27, 2013 at  8:30 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY * \n \n \n  \n 9depend on the market prices of the fund’s asse ts at the time of redemption. Thus, with a \nfloating NAV, if the assets properly reflect ma rket values, the incentiv e to run that stems \nfrom the possibility of “break ing the buck” under the current rules should be significantly \nreduced.      The second SEC proposal, which was not suggested by the FSOC, would require \nthe fund’s directors to impose a fee of not more than 2 per cent on all redemptions in the \nevent that the fund’s weekly liq uid assets fell below a speci fied threshold.  The proposal, \nhowever, gives the fund’s direct ors discretion to impose a lo wer fee or no fee if they \ndetermine that such action is not in the best inte rest of the fund.\n9  This liquidity fee is \nintended to discourage investors from red eeming funds at a time when the MMMF is \nexperiencing significant withdrawals.  Additionally, under the proposal the fund’s \ndirectors could, at their disc retion, impose temporary “gates” to prevent redemptions for a \ntime.  These temporary redemption gates woul d, the proposal envisions, prevent investors \nfrom redeeming funds – thus ending an investor run.   \n Allow me to address the two proposals in reverse order.  The reason for my strong \nopposition to the second proposal is that liqui dity fees and gates fundamentally change \nthe investor’s decision-making process dur ing a financial crisis in a way that increases \nthe potential for financial inst ability, and could be worse than no reform at all.  The \nliquidity fee imposes a haircut on investors w ho are redeeming funds – a haircut that may \nnot be associated with the underlying value of the assets.  Since MMMFs are often used \nas transaction accounts, this haircut would impose significan t fees on investors that had \nviewed the account as a means of payi ng for transactions (and most MMMFs are \ncurrently paying less than 5 basis points a year to investors).  \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, September 27, 2013 at  8:30 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY * \n \n \n  \n 10In addition, the temporary redemption gate s would restrict investors’ access to \ntheir funds.  During a crisis, investors may find that they temporarily have no access to \ntheir funds – and financial cr ises are exactly the time th at many investors most need \naccess to their liquid funds.  And when some entities do not have access (or fear that their counterparty will not have access), it can ha ve domino effects throughout the financial \nsystem.  In short, liquidity fees and redemp tion gates fundamentally change the MMMF \nproduct during a crisis.  As discussed above, these alterations would likely increase  the \nincentive to run from a MMMF.  But in additio n, they increase the risk of “contagious” \nruns.  Assume, for example, that a fund has no credit risk problems, but another fund in \nthe midst of a crisis announces that it is im posing fees and gates.  Now the investor must \nconsider how other co-investors in the same fund will behave: If ot her investors run, the \ninvestor could be faced with gates and fees even though the underlying assets have \nexperienced no change in value.   \nThe probability of a run is increased due to the high degree of concentration at \nmany prime funds.  Of the five largest inst itutional prime MMMFs as of the end of June \n2013, three had at least two shar eholders each with a 5 percent or greater stake in the \nfund.  If redemptions by one or more of thes e large shareholders caused a fund to breach \nthe weekly liquid assets threshol d, other investors in the fund might run for fear that a fee \nor gate may be forthcoming. \n Under this proposal, prime MMMFs would still take credit risk, promise a fixed \nnet asset value, and hold no capital.  What would change is that  the MMMF itself could \nfundamentally change during a crisis, by possibly imposing redemption gates and \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, September 27, 2013 at  8:30 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY * \n \n \n  \n 11liquidity fees.  So this proposed alterna tive might actually incr ease run risk, and pose \ngreater financial st ability concerns th an the status quo.10 \n The other SEC proposal treats prime in stitutional MMMFs like all other mutual \nfunds.  As with other funds, investors red eem funds at the net value of the underlying \nassets at the time of redemption.  With th is reform, MMMFs would be very similar to \nshort-term bond mutual funds, but have more rest rictions on liquidity a nd credit risk than \nthe typical short-term bond mutual fund.   \nSome might worry about continuing to use MMMFs for their current purposes \n(institutional transact ions accounts, short-term savings ) with a floating NAV. But the \nactual movement in the values of the underlying a ssets during most periods is likely to be \nquite modest.   \nI would note that a potentia l problem with this propos al is that the fund must \ndetermine  appropriate values for money market instruments that often see little secondary market trading.  In practice, f unds would continue to employ a variety of \nmodels and “matrix pricing” techniques to va lue their assets, and c ould also hold certain \nsecurities at amortized cost so long as the re sult reflects the securitie s’ fair value.  Any \nmodel problems – or any inappropriate applic ation of amortized cost accounting – would \ndegrade the effectiveness of this proposal.  My preferred response would be for the SEC \nto continue its efforts to increase the transp arency of fixed income markets, to further \nenhance price discovery, and to periodically  examine MMMF assets – especially those \nexperiencing significant credit  risk deterioration – to c onfirm that funds’ valuation \nprocesses are appropriate.   \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, September 27, 2013 at  8:30 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY * \n \n \n  \n 12In short, in my view moving to a floating NAV and treating MMMFs like all \nother mutual funds – if valuat ion is appropriately addresse d – would reduce the financial \nstability concerns around MMMFs.    \n \nAdditional Considerations \n The SEC proposal on a floating NAV only applies to institutional prime funds.  \nThis raises two concerns.  First, Figure 6 shows the support that MMMFs received during \nthe 2007 to 2010 period, by fund t ype.  More than 30 of the retail prime money market \nfunds needed support during the crisis, only somewhat less than th e number of non-retail \nprime funds that needed support.11   \nAlso, more than 40 retail funds took advant age of the emergency liquidity facility \nadministered for the Federal Reserve Syst em by the Boston Reserve Bank to support \nliquidity for MMMFs.  So, while instituti onal prime funds experienced significant \ninvestor runs, in the absence of extensive support and a liquidity facility provided by the \nFederal Reserve, retail  funds may have experienced more  significant investor runs as \nwell.  A second concern is that the retail ex emption applies to funds with a daily \nshareholder redemption limit of $1 million or less.  An instit utional investor may choose \nto spread funds across retail MMMFs so as to get the fixed NAV while still maintaining \nthe ability to quickly redeem.  This would not  only thwart the intent of the exemption, but \nalso result in retail funds be ing much more susceptible to runs in the next crisis. \n While the severe runs occurred at in stitutional prime funds during the last \nfinancial crisis, there is no assurance that the next crisis will avoid retail funds.  With no \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, September 27, 2013 at  8:30 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY * \n \n \n  \n 13government support and with some institutional i nvestors in retail funds, retail funds may \nbe much more prone to runs than the SEC proposal presumes. \n Another concern is that government funds are exempt from the floating NAV \nrequirement as long as at least 80 percent of their total assets are in cash or government-\nrelated securities.  As Figure 7 shows, the largest government funds hold nearly 100 \npercent of their asset in cash or government-related securities.12  Government funds \nshould be government funds.  Using an 80 pe rcent threshold allows funds to create a \nprime/government fund hybrid that  would receive fixed NAV treatment.  In my view, it \nshould be clear that investors are investi ng in government funds, and I would recommend \nsetting a much higher threshold – consistent w ith current practices at many of the largest \nfunds.  \nConcluding Observations \n In summary and conclusion, I would stre ss that MMMF reform is overdue.  \nHowever, it is important that the reforms actua lly reduce the financial stability issues that \nremain under the current structure.  Promis ing a fixed NAV with no capital while taking \ncredit risk is not sustainable – especially in poten tial future crises where the response of \nthe public sector will be s ubstantially limited, compared to 2008.  MMMF runs should \nnot be allowed to once again impede the fl ow of stable funding within our financial \nsystem. \n The SEC proposal to allow funds to im pose liquidity fees and redemption gates \nshould be dropped.  This particul ar proposal is, in my view, wo rse than the status quo.  It \nwould only increase the risk of  financial instability.   \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, September 27, 2013 at  8:30 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY * \n \n \n  \n 14However, I strongly suppor t requiring a floating NAV for all prime funds, both \ninstitutional and retail, which would treat thes e funds like other mutual funds.  Investors \nwho want a fixed NAV can keep their funds  in government-only funds – and those \nshould have the vast majority of their por tfolios invested in cash and government \nsecurities.    Thank you for inviting me to sp eak with you on this key topic. \n  \n \n                                                 \n \n1 The letter from all 12 Reserve Bank Presidents was sent on September 12 and can be found on the Federal \nReserve Bank of Boston web site ( http://www.bostonfed.org/news/press/2013/pr091213.htm ) or on the \nSEC web site.  \n \n2 Including repurchase agreements co llateralized by such instruments. \n \n3 These are iMoneyNet figures – we ekly, as of September 3, 2013. \n  \n4 This reflects the 2010 amendment to Rule 2a-7 that tightened the weighted average maturity limits and \nenacted liquidity requirements.  See “Money Mark et Reform Final Rules”, Investment Company Act \nRelease No. IC-29132, May 2010.  \n5 The Asset-Backed Commercial Paper Money Mark et Mutual Fund Liquidity Facility (AMLF) was \ndesigned to provide a market for asset-backed commercial paper to be sold by MMMFs.  This facility was administered by the Federal Reserve Ba nk of Boston.  For a full description and analysis of the program see \nBurcu Duygan-Bump, Patrick Parkinson, Eric Roseng ren, Gustavo A. Suarez, and Paul Willen, 2013, \n\"How Effective Were the Federal Reserve Emergency Liquidity Fac ilities? Evidence from the Asset-\nBacked Commercial Paper Money Market Mutual Fund Liquidity Facility \" in the Journal of Finance , vol. \n68(2), pages 715-737.  The Temporary Guarant ee Program (TGP) directly benefitted MMMFs by \nextending insurance provided by the U.S. Department of Treasury.  For details, see U.S. Department of Treasury, “Treasury Announces Temporary Guarant ees Program for Money Market Funds,” September \n2008. \n \n6 For example, the Commercial Paper Funding Facility (CPFF) was needed because of the inability of firms \nto roll over their commercial paper.  The desire of MMMFs to shrink their assets was one reason why this \nprogram was needed. \n \n7 The FSOC proposed three reform alternatives: a fl oating NAV proposal, a risk-based capital buffer of 3 \npercent, and a 1 percent minimum balance-at-risk proposal.  See FSOC, “Proposed Recommendations \nRegarding Money Market Mutual Fund Reform,” November 2012. \n \n8 On September 4, 2013, the European Commission released a proposed rule that would impose a 3 percent \nbuffer on money market funds that are fixed NAV funds.   \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, September 27, 2013 at  8:30 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY * \n \n \n  \n 15                                                                                                                                                 \n \n9 Two percent is referred to as the “default option.”  However, the proposal notes that fund directors might \nchoose a lower fee if it is in the interest of the fund. \n \n10 Others have expressed concerns with fees and gates.  For examples, see SEC comment letters from \nGoldman Sachs, T. Rowe Price, and Thrivent Financial. \n \n11 Steffanie Brady, Ken Anadu, and Nathaniel Cooper provide a working paper that documents how \nextensive sponsor support for prime funds was during the crisis.  See “The Stability of Prime Money \nMarket Mutual Funds Sponsor Support from 2007 to 2011,” Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, August 2012. \n \n12 Under the SEC’s Investment Company Names rule, an MMMF may classify itself as a “government” \nfund if no less than 80 percent of its assets ar e in cash or government-related securities, including \nrepurchase agreements collateralized by such secur ities.

Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY* \n \n \n \n \n 3 first and foremost, the disappointing incoming economic data, which had \nreduced my own and most participants’ forecasts fo r gross domestic product \n(GDP) this year and next; \n the possibility of disruptions in the natio n’s fiscal policies th at might provide a \nfurther potential slowdown in econom ic activity, going forward; and  \n long-term market rates that had alre ady risen more than I thought was \nconsistent with interest-sensitive se ctors providing needed support to the \neconomy’s continued recovery.  \nAsset purchases, like all monetary policy actions of the central bank, should be \nrooted in and dependent on incoming data.  Fo recasts are of course imperfect – and have \ntended to be overly optimistic over the previous four years.  As a result, I believe we need \nto see data that compellingly suggest that over the next three year s we are indeed on a \npath to reach full employment and 2 percent infl ation.  Today, I would like to review with \nyou some of the data that, to my thinking, i ndicated that conditions were not yet strong \nenough to assume the economy is on that positiv e and appropriate path – the data that led \nme to believe it would have been premature to begin reducing the rate of Fed asset purchases. \nIt is also important to emphasize that a policy that is data dependent cannot \nalways be “signaled” clearly, in advance.  The FOMC forecasts can be wrong – reality \ndoesn’t always live up to our forecasts.  Had U. S. fiscal matters not been so problematic, \nand incoming data on real GDP and employ ment stronger, it may well have been \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, October 2, 2013 at 12:40 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY* \n \n \n \n \n 4appropriate to take some action in September.   Unfortunately, those were not the facts we \nfaced, before the meeting.   \nI would add that interpreting  the data is an important and nuanced matter.  The \nFOMC is a committee, and different partic ipants can and often do have different \nperspectives on the strength of the incoming da ta.  Some of the indicators the committee \nmust weigh in preparation for policy meeti ngs include data that provide only partial \ninformation on an aspect of the economy – so  that their import only becomes clear once \nwe have the fuller context provided by other,  related data.  Also, importantly, assembling \na coherent picture of the overall economy is  challenging even with complete data, and \ninvolves “art” as we ll as science.  \nThat points to the value of the committee me mbers gathering together to arrive at \npolicy decisions.  I will say that listening to  the way in which other members, with \ndifferent perspectives, interpret the same da ta helps me form a more robust sense of \nwhere the economy is going.  A ll this means that our fundame ntal reliance on data in \npolicymaking may result at times in less si gnaling, before FOMC meetings, about small \nchanges in the purchase program.   \nI would hope it goes without saying, but let me take a moment to stress the \nfollowing.  As Chairman Bernanke suggested in his press conference,1 Fed actions are \nnot determined by Wall Street’s expectations of what we mi ght or should do.  Rather, our \npolicies need to be consistent with achiev ing key goals like su pporting Main Street’s \nmore rapid return to full employment – and k eeping away the extremely low inflation that \ncharacterized troubled economies like Japan’ s in its “Lost Decade” and moving toward \nthe Fed’s two percent inflation objective. \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, October 2, 2013 at 12:40 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY* \n \n \n \n \n 5I do not mean to imply that the communica tions and signaling issues of the last \nfew months have not been difficult, for many.  Without question, there are difficulties \ninherent in communicating a da ta-contingent policy – but a da ta-contingent policy is far \npreferable to the alternatives.  The Federal Reserve will continue to refine its policy-related communications, but I would just point out that predictive certainty will never be the case when policy is rooted in actual incoming data, which may or may not follow forecasts. \n \nRecent Economic Data  \n With that as introduction, let me now tu rn to the recent economic data that helped \ninform decisions at the September FOMC meeting.  Figure 1 shows the path of the \nunemployment rate over the past five years.  From the beginning of 2008, when the unemployment rate was 5 percent,  the rate kept climbing – past  the end of the recession.  \nIndeed, it peaked at 10 percent in Oc tober of 2009.  One year ago, the August \nunemployment rate was 8.1 percent,  and as of August of this year the rate had fallen to \n7.3 percent.  Clearly the unemp loyment rate has been declin ing since its peak – albeit \nslowly – and there has been slow but steady progress in reducing the rate over the past \nyear.  However, other employment indicators have not been so positive.  Figure 2 provides the labor force participation rate – the percent of the population 16 years of age \nand over that is either working or actively s earching for work – over the past five years.  \nIt has declined gradua lly over this period, wh ich may mean the unemployment rate in the \nprevious chart underestimates reality.    \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, October 2, 2013 at 12:40 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY* \n \n \n \n \n 6Let me explain why.  The decline in the la bor force participati on rate reflects two \nfactors.  The first is long er-term trends in demogra phics, like baby-boomers reaching \nnormal retirement age and leaving the labor fo rce.  But most estimates suggest that \ndemographics alone cannot accoun t for all the change we ha ve observed in labor-force \nparticipation.  Unfortunately, the second f actor reflects current weakness in the demand \nfor workers, apart from demographic and othe r factors.  Some workers who were looking \nfor work have become discouraged by the shor tage of job offers – a shortage that has \nbeen persisting over an ex tended period of time.   \nWere the economy to strengthen, some of these workers would likely return to the \nlabor force as demand for labor  increased.  If the demand for labor were strong enough \n— if the number of new job openings matche d the number of worker s returning to the \nlabor force — we could see increases in payr oll employment with little change in the \nunemployment rate.   \nUnfortunately, what sounds like a tem porary decline in the labor force \nparticipation rate could turn into a perman ent one.  A significant concern is that the \nlonger we have such an elevated unemployment rate, the more likely it is that some of \nthose who have left the labor force due to the lack of jobs will simply never return.  In this way the decline in labor force particip ation could become permanent, implying an \nongoing loss of employment and income for those workers – a very serious matter for our \nfellow citizens and for our economy. \n Figure 3 shows payroll employment growth  over the past five years.  Over the \npast year, payroll employment has grown by an average of 184,000 jobs per month – and \nfor a few months we were averaging over 200,00 0 jobs a month.  Unfortunately, that pace \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, October 2, 2013 at 12:40 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY* \n \n \n \n \n 7of job growth has recently slowed down.  Over the past three months, payroll \nemployment has averaged only 148,000 jobs per month, which coupled with only 2 \npercent growth in real GDP suggests the econo my is in a “holding pattern” – just treading \nwater rather than gearing up to make signifi cant improvement in the still very elevated \nunemployment rate.  Real GDP has grown by just over 2 percen t on average since the beginning of the \nrecovery more than four years ago.  Unfo rtunately, growth this year has shown no \nimprovement over that pace, with real GDP a dvancing a little less than 2 percent in the \nfirst half of this year.  Most private forecaste rs are projecting that growth in real GDP in \nthe third quarter will be r oughly 2 percent once again.   \nThe bright spot in real GDP through much of the recovery has been the interest-\nsensitive sectors.  Figure 4 shows that reside ntial investment has been strong – in fact it \nhas averaged just over 15 percent growth ove r the last four quarters.  This strength \ncomes, in part, in response to the Federa l Reserve’s asset-purchase program, which was \ndesigned to lower market rates and boost inte rest-sensitive economi c activity.  Similarly, \nauto sales have been quite strong – helped by unusually low auto-loan rates, which reflect \ncompetitive forces among auto lenders (including community banks) as well as the Fed’s asset-purchase program.  In short, the most in terest-sensitive sector s have been growing \nstrongly, in part because of highl y accommodative monetary policy. \n Despite the resilience of the interest-s ensitive sectors, the overall economy has \ngrown much more slowly than is the norm for economic recoveri es.  Obviously, it is very \nimportant to understand what accounts for this persistently slow growth.  Figure 5 shows that for the first half of this year some s ectors, like exports, have  grown faster than 2 \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, October 2, 2013 at 12:40 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY* \n \n \n \n \n 8percent despite weakness  among many foreign trading partners.  This is partially due, \nagain, to low interest rates – low rates mean a lower value for the dollar in relation to other currencies, which makes U.S. exports relatively more affordable overseas.   \nBut the figure highlights that the main  drag on the economy has come from \ndeclines in government spending at the stat e and federal level, coupled with the tax \nincreases that depressed consum er spending earlier this year.\n2  However you feel about \nthe political economy of fiscal matters, gove rnment spending is a component of GDP, \nand tax policy obviously affects consumer sp ending.  I would note that historically \nspeaking, significant fiscal austerity such as we  have recently seen is quite unusual at a \ntime when the economy is trying to recover fr om a severe recession.  Figure 6 shows the \ncontribution of government spending to the pe rcent change in real GDP – historically \npositive, on average, but usually negative in the current recovery.   \nI would echo Chairman Bernanke and others  who urge a return to long-run fiscal \nsustainability, while observing that excessive  austerity in the near-term subdues an \nalready tepid recovery.  I woul d note that fiscal headwinds can – and have – come in the \nform of lower spending as well as higher ta xes.  To underline the end result, Figure 7 \nshows just how restrained employment growth  has been in the current recovery versus \nprevious ones.   \nMost private forecasts had assumed that in  the second half of this year the less \ninterest-sensitive components of consumer  spending would pick up, and the headwinds \ncreated by fiscal austerity would begin to e bb.  However, Figure 8 shows that, to date, \nconsumer spending has not picked up as hoped.  And while some of the effects of fiscal \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, October 2, 2013 at 12:40 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY* \n \n \n \n \n 9austerity will eventually ebb, to date fiscal  austerity is one reason we have yet to see \ngrowth much faster than 2 percent.   \nUnfortunately, this remains an area of significant uncertainty, given debates in \nCongress on continuing resolutions and potenti ally allowing the country to default on its \ndebt.  The uncertainties, not to mention th e outcomes themselves, threaten to have a \ncollateral impact on the rest of the economy. \nFigure 9 shows the central tendency (whi ch excludes the three highest and three \nlowest projections) for the FOMC’s  Summary of Economic Projections.3  Comparing the \nleft and right bars in each chart, the figure makes clear that FOMC participants reduced \ntheir estimates of growth in real GDP betw een the June and September FOMC meetings.  \nWhile earlier the expectation was for real GDP to grow 2.3 to 2.6 percent in 2013, the \ncentral tendency is now 2.0 to 2.3 percent for 2013.  Similarly, projections for 2014 are \nfor an improvement over 2013, but are now lo wer than was anticipated at the June \nmeeting.   \nIn short, the data arriving since June have not ratified the earlier expectation that \nthe increase in real GDP would occur this ye ar, and many of the FO MC participants are \nnow expecting that pick-up to occur in stead in 2014, although by a more modest \nmagnitude.  That pattern of e xpected strength eventually di sappointed by tepid reality has \npersisted for several years now. \nAt the same time that the economy seems to have slowed, the inflation rate \nremains quite low, as shown in Figure 10.  The core Personal Consumption Expenditures \n(PCE) inflation rate has been low for the en tire recovery, and is  currently at only 1.2 \npercent over the past year.  Similarly, total PCE inflation has been running consistently \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, October 2, 2013 at 12:40 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY* \n \n \n \n \n 10below our 2 percent target – only breaching 2 percent tempor arily, in response to higher \noil prices earlier in the recovery.  Total PC E inflation over the past year has averaged \nonly 1.2 percent, and oil prices have recently  been declining as the possibility of a \nmilitary strike on Syria subsided. \nReturning to the Committee’s forecasts, Figure 11 provides the midpoint of the \ncentral tendency of participants’ forecasts for PCE inflation and core PCE inflation.  \nThese forecasts show only a very gradual incr ease in inflation for both the total and core \nmeasures.  My own forecast is quite simila r, with both total and core measures of \ninflation over the next several years falling below the Federal Reserve’s 2 percent target. \nUnfortunately, most of the risks to the outlook remain on the downside.  Concerns \nover untimely fiscal austerity here and abroad, and the possibility of problems once again emerging in parts of Europe, could cause the Federal Reserve to miss on both elements of its dual mandate – employment and inflation – through 2016.   \nIn my view, the asset-purchase prog ram should remain dependent on incoming \neconomic data, and we should seek to ge t the economy on a path to achieve both \nelements of the Fed’s dual mandate – employ ment and inflation – as soon as possible, \nhopefully by 2016.  Should the economy speed up more rapidly than is sustainable, we \ncan remove accommodation more quickly.  Should the economy unexpectedly slow down, we can and should provide more accommod ation than is currently anticipated.  If \nthe economy evolves as expected, policy should  in my view include  only a very slow \nremoval of accommodation over the next severa l years – and that should only occur when \nthe data ratify our forecast for an im provement in real GDP and employment. \n \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, October 2, 2013 at 12:40 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY* \n \n \n \n \n 11Concluding Observations \nThe last FOMC monetary policy statement made clear that we are not following a \npredetermined path for monetary policy.  Un fortunately, the incoming data do not show \nthe economic improvement that we had hoped fo r in June, and still ultimately expect.   \nIt is likely that for such improvement we  will need to see the fiscal headwinds \nsubside, and also see consumers become more confident.  This would be consistent with \nmost private-sector forecasts that still anticipate an improving economy.   \nHowever, in my view if the economy is not improving as expected, we should not \nreduce the monetary policy a ccommodation.  Doing so risks slowing the sectors of the \neconomy that have shown the greatest strength – the interest-sensitive  sectors that have \nbeen most responsive to policy actions.  That, in turn, will prolong th is period of elevated \nunemployment and slow job growth, turning what has been a long – but we hope still \ntemporary – economic disruption into one  with very long-lasting undesirable \nconsequences for U.S. households and businesses.     \nThank you again for inviting me to speak with you today.   \n                                                 \n \n1 See http://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomcpresconf20130918.htm  \n \n2 Obviously business investment is also a weak spot.

It is a pleasure to be invited to speak at the Council on Foreign \nRelations.  Since my introductory remarks will focus on central bank communications, it \nis certainly appropriate that your format a llows for plenty of time for questions and \ndiscussion.  I would like to begin with a few opening comments, and summarize the two \nfigures you will find in your handout. \n\n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, October 11, 2013 at 1: 05 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY  * \n \n \n  \n 2Of course, I would like to note that the views I express today are my own, not \nnecessarily those of my colleagues on the Board of Governors or the Federal Open \nMarket Committee (the FOMC). \n The past several months have highlig hted the communication challenges faced by \ncentral banks when short-term interest rates are close to zero – what we call the zero \nlower bound – and policy “tools” include comm unication about the sequence and nature \nof future actions.  It is important to note that with any monetary policy action, the \nultimate impact is highly dependent on the reactions and expectations of a range of economic actors – from financial market i nvestors to firms making capital spending \ndecisions to households consid ering new purchases.  Their de cisions can either amplify \nor reduce the intended impact of policy.  Give n this dynamic, the ability to communicate \nclearly is crucial.   \nUnfortunately, the communication challenges  are not at all trivial.  Combined \nwith the lack of historical  precedent for many of the Fed’s recent monetary policy \nactions, these challenges make us realistic and humble about our ability to gauge the \nlikely impact of our communi cations at the zero lower bound. \n   Figure 1  in your handout charts the movement of the 10- year Treasury bond since \nthe beginning of May, with the largest one-day movements shown in the table.  The data \nover this roughly six-month period highlight th at 10-year Treasury rates have been quite \nvolatile, and have tended to respond noticeabl y to monetary policy announcements and \nnew economic data – particularly data rela ted to the monthly report on the employment \nsituation.  That reflects, in part, prior communication about the Committee’s focus on the \nlabor market.   \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, October 11, 2013 at 1: 05 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY  * \n \n \n  \n 3While long-term rates declined after th e last FOMC announcement, they still \nremain about 100 basis points higher than th ey were at the beginning of May.  Certainly \ncontributing to the rapid rise in long-t erm rates were announcements, speeches, and \ntestimony by Fed officials that indicated that  if the economy were to improve as they \nexpected at that time, it might be appropr iate to reduce the central bank’s monthly \npurchases of Treasury and mortgage-backed securities sometime in the fall.  The reaction to the discussion of a possi ble reduction in Fed purchases appears to \nhave had an outsized impact on long-term rate s.  The recent market reactions provide a \nchallenge to the view, argued by some, that th e purchase program has no impact – since \nasset prices seem so sensitive to announcements  of even a potential, modest reduction in \npurchases sometime in the future.   \nOf course, a monetary policy that aff ected only financial markets would have \nlittle chance of achieving the Fed’s Congressionally-mandated goals.  In normal times, \nmonetary policy is transmitted largely through interest rates.  Although we have used \nunusual policy tools, our efforts to lower inte rest rates are evident in consumer spending \nin the most interest-sensitive sectors, such as  residential investment and auto sales.   \nSo it would appear that recent monetary policy actions can have – and have had – \na meaningful impact on the economy.  And the fact that the possibility of small future \nchanges in policy could elicit such large move ments in market interest rates and asset \nprices emphasizes that while  central bank communication ca n be a powerful tool, it has \nalso proven an imprecise and unpredictable in strument in terms of its impact on long-\nterm rates. \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, October 11, 2013 at 1: 05 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY  * \n \n \n  \n 4 How should we think about using this pow erful but hard-to-control tool?  For me, \nthe primary objective of any communication sh ould be to clarify how potential current \nand future actions are consistent with achie ving the Federal Reserve’s dual mandate goals \nof maximum employment and pric e stability within an acceptable  period of time.  In the \ncurrent situation, the national unemployment rate is at 7.3 percent (well above most \nestimates of full employment), and the pers onal consumption expenditures inflation rate \nis at 1.2 percent (well below the Fed’s target of 2 percent).  As a result, forward-looking \npolicy needs to be focused on how we use the po licy tools at our dis posal to achieve the \ndual mandate in an acceptable time frame.  \nThe economy is affected by a wide variet y of events outside the control of \nmonetary authorities.  The fiscal disruption over the past week or so is but one example \nof an event that was unlikely to have been fu lly incorporated in most forecasters’ baseline \noutlook – but nonetheless has the potential to affect how quick ly we return to a path \nconsistent with the Fed’s dual mandate.  As a result, the appropriate path for m onetary policy needs to be flexible enough \nto respond to unexpected shocks, and alert to the evidence of their emergence in \nincoming data.  Monetary policy should alwa ys be data-driven, and should respond if the \nlatest information suggests that the economy is likely to significantly diverge from the appropriate path. \nImportantly, though, no one data series is li kely to fully capture the information \nthat policymakers need in order to make that  determination.  There are a large number of \nhigh-frequency macroeconomic data series on inflation, employment, and GDP, all of \nwhich provide nuanced signals about the dire ction of the economy.  This means that \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, October 11, 2013 at 1: 05 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY  * \n \n \n  \n 5policymakers cannot focus solely on any one data series or data element, but instead need \nto base policy decisions on a fuller set of data.   \nUnfortunately, this also generates a communication problem.  Saying that we will \nrely on all available data series, and that we will respond to news in the data that suggests \nwe are off the desired path for the econom y, probably provides less clarity and guidance \nthan much of our audience desires.  The resu lting, inevitable uncertainty in this data-\ndriven, multi-pronged approach may increase vari ability in financial markets, as different \nmarket participants sift through and interpret both the data and the public pronouncements by officials of the central bank. \n At the other extreme would be a very transparent and clear communication stating \nthat we will change our polic y on a particular calendar date.  But a problem with dates is \nthat if the economy’s path diverges significantly from wh at is anticipated, a calendar-\nbound policy may be inconsistent with achieving  our goals in an appropriate timeframe.  \nHaving very clear communication that “locks” policy into an  inappropriate move would \nclearly be undesirable.   An intermediate case could tie comm unication about policy to an important \neconomic variable.  As long as that va riable is a good proxy for overall economic \nconditions, it has the benefit of being tr ansparent and observable, and thus easily \ncommunicated.  The potential downside emerges if the variable stops serving as an \naccurate proxy for overall economic conditions, in which case it could lead to a poor policy decision in much the same way as a rigid calendar date.   \nFor example, the unemployment rate is a widely-used summary measure of labor \nmarket conditions.  But despit e its popularity, the unemploymen t rate is not always the \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, October 11, 2013 at 1: 05 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY  * \n \n \n  \n 6best summary indicator.  A decline in the unemployment rate resulting from firms hiring \nmore workers would certainly be welcome at  this time.  However, a decline in the \nunemployment rate resulting from discouraged workers leaving the la bor force would be \nunwelcome and would provide a quite different signal about the state of the economy.  So \ntying policy to a particular outcome for one  economic variable may be observable and \ntransparent, and reduce the un certainty around monetary poli cy action – but could also \nprovide the wrong signal and coul d lead to policies that actually move the economy in a \ndirection inconsistent with the choice a polic ymaker would make with more flexibility. \n This problem is compounded by the fact that most investors seem to focus on \ncalendar dates, not economic outcomes.  As a result, investors will naturally translate guidance tied to economic outcomes into cale ndar dates, and that means caveats about \nconditionality, data-driven policy, and respons iveness to incoming data are likely to \nreceive far less attention than the translated calendar dates. \n Figure 2  shows results from a survey of pr imary dealers conducted before the \nSeptember FOMC meeting.\n1  Many market participants thought that there was a \nreasonably high probability of a reduction in Fed asset purc hases in September, but many \nalso saw a relatively high probability that  the FOMC might wait until a later date to \nadjust policy.  Whatever the de cision, a significant number of participants in the survey \nwere positioned to be disappointed.  This lack of unanimity was likely to generate \nconsternation among those caught in an unfa vorable financial position once the decision \nwas announced.  No calendar date was specified, and it was clearly communicated that the \neconomy needed to progress as expected for policy to be modified – but again, those \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, October 11, 2013 at 1: 05 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY  * \n \n \n  \n 7caveats tended to get much less attention.  We saw weaker economic data emerge \nbetween the June and September FOMC meetings , and a higher than anticipated jump in \nmarket interest rates, along with the ri sk in September of possible fiscal-policy \ndisruptions.  Given those data  and risks, in my view continuing the asset-purchase \nprogram was warranted, and fully consistent w ith seeking to return to full employment \nand 2 percent inflation within a reasonable timeframe. \nHowever, the experience of the past se veral months makes it clear that a data-\ndriven policy that also considers the ri sks to our forecasts can be difficult to \ncommunicate, because the policy will necessarily  change as we update our forecasts and \nrisk assessments in the face of new econom ic data.  This was emphasized in the \nSeptember FOMC statement, which made clear  that asset purchase s are not on a preset \ncourse.  We have more learning to do on how best to communicate monetary policy \nduring uncertain and unprecedented times.  Howe ver, the most important thing we at the \nFed can, and should, communicate is that the po licies we are setting are consistent with \nour goals – our mandate – for maximum empl oyment and price stability.   Getting the \nappropriate balance between flexibly im plementing those policies and trying to \ncommunicate clearly and transparently to the pub lic and to financial markets is likely to \nremain a work in progress.  Thank you again for the opportunity to be here today and to offer these opening \nremarks.  Now I would be happy to respond to questions. \n  \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, October 11, 2013 at 1: 05 P.M.

I \nwould like to thank Dean Ira Jackson and th e McCormack Graduate School of Policy and \nGlobal Studies for hosting me today.   \nIt has been quite a celebratory weekend in Boston, with both the World Series \nvictory parade on Saturday and the Patriots ’ points-filled win on Sunday.  Unfortunately, \nmy message today will be that while the ec onomy has been gradually improving, it is not \nyet time to celebrate our economic performance. \n\n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Monday, November 4, 2013 at  4:25 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY  * \n \n \n  \n \n 2As always, the views I express today are my own, not necessarily those of my \ncolleagues on the Board of Governors or the Federal Open Market Committee (the \nFOMC). \nSince the beginning of this year, the Federal Reserve has been purchasing \nTreasury and mortgage-backed securities (M BS) totaling $85 bill ion per month.  In \naddition, we have indicated our intention to keep short-term inte rest rates at their \nexceptionally low levels at least as long as  the unemployment rate remains above 6.5 \npercent and inflation and inflation expectati ons are well anchored.  These two monetary \npolicy tools – asset purchases to  push long-term rates lower, and guidance related to rates \nremaining low – have provided an accommoda tive monetary policy stance designed to \noffset some of the “headwinds” that have impeded a more rapid economic recovery.   \nSince the beginning of this year the unemp loyment rate has d eclined from 7.9 to \n7.2 percent, interest-sensitive sectors such  as housing and autos have continued to \nimprove, and inflation has stabilized at rates well below the Fed’s 2 percent target.  This \nhas all occurred in the context of an ec onomy wherein fiscal po licy has been quite \nrestrictive, with higher income  taxes as well as substantial reductions in real government \nspending.  However you feel about the politic al economy of fiscal matters, government \nspending is a component of GDP, and tax policy obviously affects consumer spending. \nFrom a historical perspective, si gnificant fiscal austerity such as we have seen recently is \nquite unusual at a time when the economy is tr ying to recover from a severe recession. \nWhile there have been some areas of improved economic performance, \nunfortunately the economy remains challe nged.  Unemployment is well above what \nanyone would consider a “full employment” ra te, and inflation remains well below our 2 \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Monday, November 4, 2013 at  4:25 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY  * \n \n \n  \n \n 3percent target.  We should al l be mindful that inflation ca n be too low – too close to \ndeflation.  For example, deflation characte rized troubled economies like Japan’s during \nits “Lost Decade.”  \nOur hope is that the improvement in real  GDP growth that many forecasters had \nexpected to be in progress by now will soon begin, and that the economy will grow fast \nenough to provide sustained improvement in labor markets along with inflation moving \ntowards the 2 percent inflation target.   \nMonetary policy should, of course, respond to the actual state of the economy and \nincoming indicators, as well as the progress made  to date – in other words, it should be \ndata dependent.  But policy should also be  forward-looking, taking into consideration \nhow long  it is expected to take to return to full employment within a context of price \nstability. \nThat brings me to our current asset purchase program.  As we see more \ncompelling evidence of a sustainable recove ry making satisfactory progress toward full \nemployment, it may be appropriate for the Fede ral Reserve to gradually reduce the size of \nour large-scale asset purchase program.  I would emphasize that when the Fed chooses to \ndo so, we will not be restraining  the economy – in fact, we will still be adding stimulus  to \nthe economy but in smaller increments than before. \nBy way of overview, today I will briefly review recent developments related to \nthe Federal Reserve’s monetary policies.  I will highlight some areas of the economy \nwhere there has been progress, and other areas where we need to make more progress.  I \nwill provide some sense of the likely time fr ame for returning to full employment, and \nprovide a few concluding observations. \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Monday, November 4, 2013 at  4:25 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY  * \n \n \n  \n \n 4Recent Monetary Policy Developments \nFigure 1  shows the Treasury yield curves (t he market yields for an array of \nTreasury securities of various maturities) as of three dates this year.  The first date is May \n1, before widespread discussion emerged about  the Fed potentially reducing its purchases \nof long-term securities.  As a benchmark, th e 10-year rate at that  time was 1.66 percent – \na quite low 10-year rate, by hist orical standards.  Over the course of the summer, as the \nmarkets began to anticipate a higher probability  of the Fed reducing the large-scale asset \npurchase program, the yield curve steepened significantly.  Before the September FOMC meeting, the 10-year rate was just below 3 pe rcent – more than a 100 basis-point increase \nsince the beginning of May.   \nThe steepness of the yield curve prior to the Fed’s September meeting was \nsomewhat surprising.  Long-term rates rose quite appreciably – mo re than could be \nexplained by the heightened probability of a modest reduction in asset purchases, and \nmore than was desirable given the still-fragile economic recovery.   \nAlso, since the Fed’s 6.5 percent unemplo yment “threshold” for maintaining very \nlow short-term rates had not changed, it was somewhat surprising how much the shorter  \nterm rates moved in the marketplace.  After a ll, reductions in the monthly rate of central \nbank purchases of long-term securities would not necessa rily affect the length of time \nthat we would maintain very low short-term rates.   \nThe third yield curve in Figure 1 is as of the end of October.  The Fed had \nmaintained the pace of purchases at both th e September and October FOMC meetings.  \nAnd market participants had developed concer ns over economic disruptions related to the \ndebt-ceiling debate and the pa rtial shutdown of the federal government.  The result, in \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Monday, November 4, 2013 at  4:25 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY  * \n \n \n  \n \n 5sum, was some reduction of yields – with  the 10-year rate now approximately 2.6 \npercent.   \nFigure 2  illustrates just how much market  expectations changed around the \nSeptember FOMC meeting.  Before the mee ting, primary dealers participating in the \nsurvey placed an over 50 percent probability  on the Fed reducing th e scale of purchases \nof long-term Treasury and MBS securities  at the September FOMC meeting, and a \ngreater than 90 percent probability on the firs t reduction in securities purchases occurring \nby the December FOMC meeting.   \nWhen the survey was updated after  the September FOMC meeting, but before the \ngovernment shut-down, there was a significant ch ange.  Now the probability of the first \nreduction in long-term securities purchase s occurring at the December meeting was \nplaced at over 40 percent, with over a 40 pe rcent probability placed on the first reduction \nnot occurring until next year. \nFinancial markets have been very focuse d on the timing of any reduction in asset \npurchases.  Figure 3  shows the difference in the size of  the central bank’s balance sheet \nunder two hypothetical approaches – reduc ing purchases beginning in December or \nbeginning in April.  While the actual reduc tion decision (both the timing and speed of \nreductions) will need to consider the econom ic conditions prevailing at the time, and \nweigh the potential costs and benefits of differe nt programs, the point of the figure is that \nstart dates differing by a quarter or two woul d generate only relatively small changes in \nthe overall size of the Fed’s balance sheet.  Th at is certainly one r eason for being patient \n– waiting until evidence of a more sustainable recovery is more clear-cut – before beginning any reduction in the size of the purchase program. \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Monday, November 4, 2013 at  4:25 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY  * \n \n \n  \n \n 6Current Economic Conditions \n Figure 4  shows the improvement in employment  during this recovery relative to \nthe previous three.  In the th ree earlier recoveries, employme nt returned to its previous \npeak within two years. While the two mildest recessions had relatively slower recoveries, \nthe deeper recession in 1981 had a steeper r ecovery.  Unfortunately, the most recent \nrecession was deeper than the previous thr ee, yet the recovery in employment has not \nbeen as rapid as in 1981.  Despite the si gnificant lapse of time since the trough of the \nrecession, we still have not reached the pre-r ecession peak in employment.  The severity \nof the employment loss, and the significan t headwinds facing the economy after the \nsevere financial crisis, are both important reasons why monetary policy has needed to \nremain quite accommodative. \n While there have been a variety of head winds at play, one of the unusual features \nof this recovery has been the significant fiscal retrenchment.  I am not here to comment \non fiscal policy, but to underl ine its effect on the economic situation that the Fed must \nrespond to.  The CBO estimates that fiscal  austerity measures have reduced 2013 GDP \ngrowth by 1.5 percentage points1 – a very significant headwind.  Had the economy grown \nby 3.5 percent rather than 2 percent over the pa st year, job growth would almost surely \nhave been stronger, unemployment lower, and inflation closer to th e two percent goal.  \nAs a result, with the Federal Reserve focusi ng on achieving its mandates, absent some of \nthe fiscal headwinds there would be much le ss need for the current degree (and extended \nlength) of monetary policy accommodation. \nEven the direct  effects of government employme nt reductions have been quite \nsubstantial.  Figure 5  shows that, not including the empl oyment peak resulting from the \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Monday, November 4, 2013 at  4:25 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY  *\n7hiring of temporary census work ers, governm\nent employment peaked at the end of the \nrecession and has been falling ever since – a cumulative loss of three-quarters of a \nmillion workers.  This reflects very significan t declines in employment by state and local \ngovernments, as well as in the federal government.   \nFigure 6  shows that this is not the typical experi ence during an economic \nrecovery.  All three of the previous recoveries were s upported by additional government \nhiring, not by reductions in employees.  In f act, the sharp recovery in total employment \nduring the 1982 recovery incl uded a significant boost in government employment.  As I \nmentioned earlier, there are obviously differing views on th e politics of government \nspending and employment, but as  a practical matter, fiscal austerity subtracts from \nemployment and from GDP.  As the Federal Reserve pursues its Congressionally-\nassigned “dual mandate” for price stability and maximum sustainable employment, the \nsubstantial contractionary eff ects of fiscal retrenchment have to be taken into account – \njust as any other headwind has to be taken into account.   \nIn particular, the tools of forward guida nce and large-scale asset purchases have \nbeen quite successful in keeping short- and long-term interest rates low, encouraging a \nrecovery in those sectors of th e economy that are sensitive to interest rates.  For example, \nFigure 7 and Figure 8  show that residential investme nt and auto sales have been \nrecovering – and explain why, despite significant fiscal retrenchment, the economy has \nstill been able to average 2.2 percent growth since the start of the recovery in 2009.  \nHowever, with short-term interest rates at  the zero lower bound, monetary policy has not \nbeen able to fully offset the headwinds create d by the financial crisis, fiscal retrenchment, \nand unusually weak economies am ong many trading partners.   \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Monday, November 4, 2013 at  4:25 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY  * \n \n \n  \n \n 8Figure 9  illustrates the combined effect of the weak and strong sectors on overall \nGDP during the recession and recovery.  Wh ile the decline in real GDP was unusually \nlarge in this recession, real GDP has already exceeded its pre-recession peak (in contrast \nto the experience of employment).   \nFigure 10  shows that this recovery has been slow, but slow growth appears to be \ncharacteristic of the last three recoveries as  well.  What has been more striking is that \nfiscal policy has become more restrictive, even though we have not seen the improvement \nthat one normally sees, over the past two years of the recovery. \n \nReturning to Full Employment \n Figure 11  illustrates the relationship betw een growth in the economy and how \nlong it is likely to take to return to fu ll employment.  My own estimate of the “full \nemployment level of unemployment” is a ra te of 5.25 percent, a lthough I would note that \nmy estimate is lower than some of my cen tral bank colleagues, as illustrated by the \nSummary of Economic Projections (SEP), wh ich has a range for unemployment over the \nlonger run (in other words, unemployment levels consistent with optimal policy \noutcomes) of 5.2 to 6.0 percent.2   \nThe relationship between GDP growth and the unemployment rate can be \nanalyzed using a modified Okun’s Law, which is an approximation of how much \nunemployment falls when the economy grows faster than its potential.  While this \nrelationship is only an appr oximation of what might happe n with a given GDP growth \nrate, it does provide some contex t for how long it would take to get to my estimate of full \nemployment, assuming different hypot hetical rates of GDP growth.   \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Monday, November 4, 2013 at  4:25 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY  * \n \n \n  \n \n 9The left-side bars provide th e annual growth rate needed  to reach my estimate of \nfull employment by the end of the indicated y ear.  For example, if this relationship is \nabout right, to get to 5.25 percent unemployment by the end of 2016 would require an \naverage growth rate of 3.3 percent.  With an assumed potential GDP growth rate of 2.1 \npercent, we should recognize that a realized growth rate below 3 percent will result in a \nlong wait to reach my estimate of full employme nt.  At a growth rate of 2.8 percent, we \ndo not attain 5.25 percent unemployment until the end of 2018 .  The right bars show that \ngrowth over the most recent recovery falls far short of the growth during the previous \nthree recoveries, and also well short of the growth needed to  return to full employment \neven over the next five years. \nFigure 12  replaces the historical growth rates of real GDP during earlier \nrecoveries with the midpoint estimates of  growth from the September Summary of \nEconomic Projections of the FOMC members.   The SEP midpoint estimate of real GDP \ngrowth over the next three years is a l ittle over 3 percent.  Assuming the economy \nbehaves as estimated in the modified Okun’s Law, this would imply that we do not reach \nmy gauge of full employment until 2017.   \nCertainly there are a number of impo rtant assumptions made in doing this \nanalysis, but it illustrates th at unless the economy grows much  faster than the 2.2 percent \nwe have experienced to date during the recove ry, it will take quite some time to reach full \nemployment – and exact a heavy human toll. \n \n  \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Monday, November 4, 2013 at  4:25 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY  * \n \n \n  \n \n 10Concluding Observations \n Monetary policy has been highly accommodative in order to mitigate the \nrestraining effects emanating from  the financial crisis, fiscal re straint, and slow growth of \ntrading partners.  Monetary policy has been able to partly but not fully offset these \nheadwinds, resulting in only a tepid recovery to date.  Most private forecasts, and the SEP \nforecasts, expect growth to accelerate – but onl y modestly, to 3 percent as the effects of \nthese headwinds diminish.  However, it is important to note that most of these forecasts see us attaining these results  only under the assumption of significant continued stimulus \nfrom monetary policy.  \nLooking forward, on the plus side, firm  and household balance sheets have \nimproved, recovery in stock and house prices  have provided more capacity to resume \nconsumption patterns, the fiscal headwinds ar e expected to diminish somewhat, and some \nof our trading partners are s howing signs of recovery.  But a good portion of the gains in \nasset prices and in spending derive from the help that stimulative monetary policy has \nprovided.  As a consequence, monetary policy is likely to need to remain accommodative \nfor some time so that we can achieve full employment within a reasonable forecast \nhorizon.   \nEven when the Fed eventually removes some of its accommodation, such as \nlarge-scale asset purchases, we will in my view need to leave short-term interest rates at \ntheir very low levels until there is much more progress reaching full employment and the \n2 percent inflation target.  Furthermore, the pa ce at which the Fed raises rates, when that \nbecomes appropriate, should be, in my view, quite gradual, unless the economy picks up \nmuch faster than is currently expected.  Over all, monetary policy need s to continue to be \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Monday, November 4, 2013 at  4:25 P.M.

I would also like to commend \nJosef Tosovsky and the staff of the Financial Stability  Institute for facilitati ng these global discussions \non very important bank-supervision and bank-re gulation issues.  Comparing implementation \nchallenges and sharing best practices in supervis ion and regulation are increasingly important in a \nglobal financial system, so gatherings like this ar e welcome.  Indeed, we have been reminded in \n\n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Monday, November 18, 2013 at 1:00 AM U.S. Ea stern Time and 10:00 AM in Abu Dhabi – or Upon Delivery * \n \n \n \n \n 3recent years that significant ba nking and financial problems in one country can have serious \nramifications that are far removed from  the source of the original problem.  \n As always, my remarks reflect my own views, not necessarily those of my colleagues at the \nBoard of Governors or on the Fe deral Open Market Committee.   \nToday I will focus my comments on bank capital requirements, an area where we have made \nsubstantial progress – but also an area that has be come increasingly complex.  A particular challenge \nwith this added complexity is the difficulty in providing a transparent picture of the banking \norganization’s financial health when many of the calculations involve very granular, firm-specific \ninformation.   \nThis complexity poses difficulties not only for the management of banking organizations and \ntheir supervisory agencies, but also for investor s and, importantly, the public.  When the regulatory \nenvironment becomes more difficult for investors to  understand, the efficacy of market discipline can \nerode.  Market discipline requires at very least that investors and the public can clearly understand the \nfinancial condition of firms.  As a result,  too much complexity may be costly.   \nTransparent financial disclosures that promote effective monitoring of financial condition are \nvital.  In a supervisory context, market signals can be an important tool for bank supervisors.  Indeed, \nduring the financial crisis, market signals provided  timely and useful information about the condition \nof financial institutions.  Like ot hers, I carefully examined stock pr ice movements, subordinated debt \nspreads, availability of  wholesale funding, and credit default sw ap spreads to better understand how \nmarkets were assessing the financial condition of in stitutions – and whether the market assessment \nwas at variance with what could be  observed in supervisory reports. \nThe complexity of capital regula tion is readily apparent in the annual reports and financial \nstatements of the largest U.S. banking organizations .  The regulatory and capital sections often extend \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Monday, November 18, 2013 at 1:00 AM U.S. Ea stern Time and 10:00 AM in Abu Dhabi – or Upon Delivery * \n \n \n \n \n 4for more than 20 pages, consisting of dense discussi ons of capital regulation and measurement.  While \nsome of this necessarily reflects the complicated nature of the busin ess of global bank ing, I think it \nwould be beneficial to look for ways to streamlin e discussions in order to focus investors and the \npublic on those factors most relevant to the financial solvency of the firm.  \nAllow me to preview some of the main points I will discuss today: \n I will argue that the increased attention on sufficient high-quality capital for banking \norganizations is extremely important, and re presents an important “lesson learned and \napplied” coming out of the financial crisis.  In the United States, this increased attention \nhas resulted in a significant increase in the qua ntity and quality of cap ital that most U.S. \nbanking organizations have on hand to w ithstand possible future shocks.   \n I will suggest that at least some of the complexity could, and probably should, be reduced \nif the so-called “Pillar 3” goals of increased transparency and market discipline are to be \nachieved.   \n I will argue that, because of the variety of banking models and their associated risks, both \nrisk-based capital requiremen ts and leverage-based capital  requirements are likely to \ncontinue to be needed.  Consid er the fact that the capital ratios of the largest banking \norganizations are comparable to those of the wider group of bank holding companies with \nmore than $50 billion in assets when using risk-based capital – but are low relative to \nthose banking organizations when using the leverage ratio . \n I will note that a number of the largest global banking organizations have significant \nbroker-dealer operations and ar e highly dependent on whol esale funding.  This funding \nstructure makes them inherently more suscepti ble to runs, suggesting that their relatively \nlow leverage-ratio capital may not be appropr iate.  I would note that Federal Reserve \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Monday, November 18, 2013 at 1:00 AM U.S. Ea stern Time and 10:00 AM in Abu Dhabi – or Upon Delivery * \n \n \n \n \n 5Governor Dan Tarullo has focused on the de pendence on wholesale financing in several \nspeeches, and on the need for higher capital charge s for institutions that are heavily reliant \non this less stable funding model.1 \n \nThe Financial Crisis and Capital Regulation    \nOne of the positive things to emerge from the financial crisis of 2008 was a renewed emphasis \non increasing the quantity and quality of the capital  cushion in the banking system. Enhancements to \ncapital requirements played an important role in forcing firms to increase capital.  New supervisory \ntools have been critically important as well.  In  particular, the stress te sts that require banking \norganizations to consider whether they have su fficient capital under stress scenarios designed by bank \nsupervisors have, in many cases, provided signif icant impetus to improve capital positions.   \nAs is shown in Figure 1, since the financial crisis the Tier 1 common equity capital ratio has \nincreased significantly for bank holding companies of all sizes.2   This improvement in a relatively \nnarrowly defined capital measure has led to the presence of si gnificantly more loss-absorption \ncapabilities than U.S. banks  had, prior to the crisis. \nWhile the increased attention to improving the size and quality of capital positions of banking \norganizations should reduce insolvency risks at many institutions and enha nce the ability of the \neconomy to sustain negative shocks, th is attention has also generated a much more complicated set of \ncapital regulations.  An examination of the 2012 a nnual reports of the larges t banking organizations \nhighlights just how complicated cap ital regulations have become.  It is not unusual for the largest \nbanks to devote considerable space in their annual reports, or separa te papers, to discuss at length the \nregulatory environment and their implementation of  capital regulations.  This complexity makes \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Monday, November 18, 2013 at 1:00 AM U.S. Ea stern Time and 10:00 AM in Abu Dhabi – or Upon Delivery * \n \n \n \n \n 6evaluations of banks’ financia l conditions challenging and makes it more difficult to make \ncomparisons across banking organizations.   \nThe complexity stems from several factors.  Fi rst, many firms report on their positions relative \nto Basel I, Basel II, and Basel III capital requirements.  This reflects the fact th at Basel I is the current \ncapital regulation in the United St ates, but some of the largest fi rms are discussing Basel II capital \nrequirements that they are running in parallel, and most large ba nking organizations are now also \nreporting what they expect their capita l position will be unde r Basel III.   \nThis is primarily a transition problem, but the transition to full implementation of Basel III is \nnot scheduled to be completed inte rnationally for another five year s.  A possible simplification over \ntime might be that once large bankin g organizations are fully compliant  with Basel III, they no longer \nalso report capital under earlier frameworks.  That said, once Ba sel III has been fully adopted, \nsignificant complexity will still remain.3   \nA second form of complexity results from th e variety of measures of capital.  Figure 2 \nhighlights the variety of capital being used.  Tier 1 common equ ity is generally the narrowest \ndefinition of capital reported, focusing on those elements  of capital best able to  absorb losses.  Tier 1 \ncapital is less narrow.  Total risk-based  capital has an even broader definition.4  The leverage ratio \nuses Tier 1 capital but is relative to a measure close to average total assets, rather than risk-weighted \nassets. \nU.S. Basel III implementation will include a supple mentary leverage ratio – the ratio of Tier 1 \ncapital to total leverage exposure – of at least 3 percent for large globa l banks.  This ratio broadens the \ndenominator from average total assets to total leve rage exposure.  Also under consideration for the \nlargest global banks is an additi onal Tier 1 capital leverage buffer of at least 2 percent above the \nminimum supplementary leverage ratio, for a total of 5 percent.5 \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Monday, November 18, 2013 at 1:00 AM U.S. Ea stern Time and 10:00 AM in Abu Dhabi – or Upon Delivery * \n \n \n \n \n 7One potential simplification would be to focus only on the narrower definition of capital, Tier \n1 common equity.  During the financial crisis, inve stors and regulators focuse d on narrow definitions \nof capital, given the urgency around loss absorption capabilities.  Potentially de-emphasizing the \nreporting of the broader measures of capital woul d simplify financial statements, and would create \nmore focus on the capital base with the best lo ss-absorption capability – where investors and \nregulators should likel y concentrate.   \nA third form of complexity emerges from the complications involved in  risk-weighting assets \nfor risk-based capital calculations .  Making capital ratios more ri sk sensitive has the benefit of \ndiscouraging shifts to riskier assets as a means to  maximize near-term profitabi lity at the expense of \nfuture viability.  However, the n eed to rely on models and judgment  gives rise to complexity and \nperpetuates the challenges of compar ability across firms that may use very different risk models – and \nsome of those models may be in different stages of development.  In fact, a recently published paper \nassociated with the Basel process has sparked disc ussion of whether greater simplification would be \ndesirable.6 \nA fourth form of complexity stems from the us e of both risk-based capita l ratios and leverage \nratios.  But the need for both capit al ratios reflects in part the complexity of banking organizations’ \nactivities.  In other words if a ll banking organizations had simila r business models, it might not be \nnecessary to use both ratios.   \nFor a banking organization that primarily ta kes deposits and makes loans, its reliance on \nwholesale funding is low, the risk of runs is limited by deposit insurance, and much of the risk to the \ninstitution derives from the riskiness of its loan portfolio.  However, many global banking \norganizations have concentrated th eir operations in less traditional ba nking activities.  For example, \nmany global banking organizations have large broker-dea ler operations.  In this  case they are heavily \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Monday, November 18, 2013 at 1:00 AM U.S. Ea stern Time and 10:00 AM in Abu Dhabi – or Upon Delivery * \n \n \n \n \n 8reliant on wholesale funding, they have few deposits covered by deposit insuranc e, and their greatest \nrisk is that the wholesale financing they need in  order to fund (i.e., to keep rolling over) their \nsecurities portfolio during a cris is will not be available, causing  a severe liquidity problem.   \nAs shown in Figure 3, the liabilities of bank hol ding companies with brok er-dealer operations \ncan be quite different from thos e of bank holding companies without broker-dealer operations, given \nthe former’s dependence on wholesale funding rather  than deposits.  This makes the likelihood of \nliability runs dependent on a firm’s business m odel, with those firms re liant on wholesale funding \nmuch more likely to experience a liability run duri ng a crisis.   New liquidity measures will reduce \nsome of the mismatch, but given the importance of  financing long-term securities with short-term \nfinancing as part of the business model, the new li quidity measures may not be sufficient.  Larger \ncapital positions for firms with a business model reliant on wholesale funding will help to further \nreduce the likelihood of a liability run.   \nI would now like to delve furt her into this difference fo r large banking organizations. \n \nLeverage and Risk-based  Capital Requirements \n Broker-dealers tend to hold large securities po rtfolios, many of which carry low risk weights \nbecause the risk weighting is based on credit risk – that is, default risk.  Less capital is required for \nassets with a lower risk weighting.  Because of th e low risk weighting on their primary assets, broker-\ndealers tend to have high ri sk-based capital ratios.   \nHowever, for these organizations the riskiness of their assets is significantly compounded by \nthe riskiness of their funding model – that is, the risk that their short-te rm financing, accomplished \nthrough repurchase agreements and other wholes ale funding arrangements, might dry up with a \nfinancial shock and not be available to finance thei r longer-term securities por tfolio.  Should investors \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Monday, November 18, 2013 at 1:00 AM U.S. Ea stern Time and 10:00 AM in Abu Dhabi – or Upon Delivery * \n \n \n \n \n 9lose confidence in these firms, br oker-dealers can be forced to sell securities at fire-sale prices, \ncausing solvency and liquidity concerns.   \nThese concerns are far from theoretical, in th at many difficulties in the fall of 2008 stemmed \nfrom runs on institutions that were reliant on w holesale funding – and many of  those firms failed or \nwere acquired.  I would add that some of the largest U.S. global banking organizations have \nsignificant broker-dealer operations , some of which were acquire d during the financial crisis. \n Figure 4 shows the Tier 1 common equity cap ital position of U.S. bank holding companies by \nasset size.  Bank holding companies with greater than $50 billion in assets  appear relatively well \ncapitalized relative to smaller bank holding companies.  Most of  the large bank holding companies \nhave more than 10 percent Tier 1 common equity cap ital relative to risk-wei ghted assets.  Figure 5 \nshows that this is true for even the largest bank ho lding companies.  Nine of the ten largest U.S. bank \nholding companies have Tier 1 common e quity capital ratios over 10 percent.7 \n Figure 6 shows the leverage ratio of U.S. ba nk holding companies, by asset size.  The largest \nbank holding companies do not appear as well cap italized when using the le verage ratio, which does \nnot use risk-weighted assets as a denominator.  More of the bank hol ding companies with greater than \n$50 billion in assets have less than 8 percent le verage ratio capital comp ared with smaller bank \nholding companies.   \nFigure 7 shows that the 10 largest bank holdi ng companies have among the lowest leverage \nratios of the largest bank holding co mpanies.  Six of the ten have le verage ratios below 8 percent.  \nThis is not reflected in other la rge bank holding companies with more than $50 billion in assets; most \nof these banks have leverage ratios above 8 percent.  Figures 8 and 9 illustrate one of the reasons for this difference.  The 10 largest US domestically owned bank holding companies are categorized by th e relative importance of their \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Monday, November 18, 2013 at 1:00 AM U.S. Ea stern Time and 10:00 AM in Abu Dhabi – or Upon Delivery * \n \n \n \n \n 10broker-dealer operations.  Those with  very large broker-dealer operations  tend to be high on the Tier 1 \ncommon equity ratio, but low on the leverage ratio.  Given the risks that br oker-dealer funding models \npose, and the failure of many of the large broker-d ealers during the crisis, it would seem appropriate \nthat these organizations should be holding more capital.  Certainly one  way to achieve this would be \nto impose capital charges for bank holding comp anies highly reliant on wholesale funding. \n These differences in business lines highlight why a risk-based capital requirement alone is not sufficient.  Many of the largest ba nking organizations are less reli ant on deposits and more reliant on \nwholesale funding as a result of their large broker- dealer operations.  For these organizations, the \nprimary risk issue is the riskine ss of their funding model.  As a result, using only credit-risk-based \nmeasures of capital may not capture the “t rue riskiness” of th ese organizations.   \nGiven all this, I would argue that the leverage ratio is an important supplement to risk-based \ncapital requirements. While the leve rage ratio is not designed to e xplicitly capture wholesale funding \nrisk, it in effect serves this pur pose because of the higher weight it gi ves to low-risk assets – which are \nthe very assets that wholesal e funding typically supports.  \nIn sum, the business models of some bank holding companies span diverse activities, \nparticularly among the largest organizations.  Broker-dealer operations carry high risk-weighted \ncapital ratios because they hold low-risk asse ts – but they are still highly leveraged.   \n \nConcluding Observations  \n Bank holding companies have responded to more regulatory and supervisory scrutiny of \ncapital by raising their capital ra tios.  This should position banking or ganizations to have greater loss \nabsorption capacity, should it be necessary.   \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Monday, November 18, 2013 at 1:00 AM U.S. Ea stern Time and 10:00 AM in Abu Dhabi – or Upon Delivery * \n \n \n \n \n 11However, along with the increased focus on cap ital regulation has come significantly more \ncomplexity.  To the extent that this complexity ma kes it more difficult for i nvestors and depositors to \ndistinguish the financial conditi on of bank holding companies, th ere is the potential that the \ncomplexity could weaken the third pillar of Base l III market discipline.  Now that many of the \nregulations are being implemented, there shoul d be thoughtful consideration as to whether \nstreamlining the rules could maintain the same level of capital adequacy assura nce with lower cost to \nbanking organizations, regul ators, and investors. \n Some of the complexity in bank capital regulation is unavoi dable. Global banking \norganizations are in a variety of business activitie s, some of which take sophisticated modeling to \nassess the risk of the activity.  Ho wever, potential ways to streamlin e capital regulation would be to \nplace greater emphasis on narrow capital definiti on, such as Tier 1 common equity – and to \naccelerated emphasis on Basel III. \nIn contrast, the complexity of business models may make it difficult to rely on only risk-based \ncapital requirements.  The range of risks in busine ss models – on both the asset side and the liability \nside of balance sheets – may make the f unding model more risky than is captured by only using risk- \nbased capital requirements.  The leve rage ratio is a particularly impor tant supplemental tool for global \nbanking organizations that are heavily reliant on wholesale funding.  For many of these firms, the \nbusiness model is less traditional than for smaller banks – and more at risk  of experiencing funding \nproblems potentially requiring fire sales of assets.   \nLarge broker-dealers in many large bank holding companies exemplify this risk.  By funding \nsecurities portfolios with shorte r term wholesale funding, their risk s are not fully cap tured by relying \nonly on risk-based capital ratios.  Large global banking organizations  with large broker-dealers are \norganizations where leverage ratios and capital  charges on wholesale funding are particularly \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Monday, November 18, 2013 at 1:00 AM U.S. Ea stern Time and 10:00 AM in Abu Dhabi – or Upon Delivery * \n \n \n \n \n 12appropriate.  Currently, many of thes e very large organizations have lo wer leverage capital ratios than \nare observed at more traditional large bank lenders.   \nLet me leave you with this view: global banks with significant investment banking and broker-\ndealer activities pose significant po tential risk to the fi nancial system and should be among the best \ncapitalized large banking organizations. \nThank you.   \n                                                 \n \nNotes: \n \n1  See Tarullo, D.

See also Tarullo, D. (2013, September), \nMacroprudential Regulation . Speech presented at the Yale Law School Conference on Challenges in Global Financial \nServices, New Haven, Connecticut. Both speeches can be found at http://www.federalreserve.gov . \n \n2  The analysis for this talk includes bank holding companies that are Y-9C filers.    \n \n3  The Basel III rule augments both the general risk-based capital requirements (Basel 1) as well as the “advanced \napproaches” risk-based capital requirements (Basel 2), but both the general an d advanced risk-based capital requirements \nremain in effect for advanced-approaches firms.  As a result of the dual compliance requirement (i.e., the Collins \namendment), the more binding of the two regulatory capital requ irements at any given point in  time is the effective risk-\nbased capital requirement.   \n \n4  Tier 1 common equity is generally the most narrow definition of capital reported, and focuses on those elements of \ncapital best able to absorb losses.  Tier 1 equity capital is less narrow and allows banks to include qualifying perpetual \npreferred stock, qualifying minority intere sts, and qualifying trust preferred secur ities.  Total risk-based capital is an even  \nbroader definition and includes qualifying subordinated debt, a portion of the loan loss allowance, and other Tier 2 capital elements. \n \n5  The final rule implementing the Basel III regulatory capital reforms in the U.S., approved on July 2, 2013, includes a \nminimum leverage ratio of 4% for all banking organizations.  For banking organizations using advanced approaches, there \nis an additional requirement, a supplementary leverage ratio – the ratio of tier 1 capital to total leverage exposure – of at \nleast 3%.  On July 9, 2013, the Federal Reserve Board, th e Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Office of the \nComptroller of the Currency adopted the Supplementary Le verage Ratio Notice of Proposed Rulemaking.  Under this \nproposed rule,  bank holding companies with more than $700 billion in assets or $10 trillion in assets under custody \n(covered BHCs) would also be required to maintain a tier 1 capital leverage buffer of at least 2 percent above the \nminimum supplementary leverage ratio requirement of 3%, for a total of 5%.  In addition, depository institutions of \ncovered BHCs would be required to meet a 6% supplementary le verage ratio to be considered  “well capitalized.”  See the \nJuly 2, 2013 Final Rule – BOG press release and The Federal Register, October 11, 2103,  Vol. 78 ,No 198, p 62018, CFR \nParts 208, 217 and 225.

It strikes me th at the timing of this gathering is particularly appropriate, in \nthat discussions of the economy – at least ove r the last few years – have not fueled any \nholiday cheer, but have been relevant  to hopeful New Year’s resolutions.   \nWhen I joined you at this event two years ago, I reviewed some of the patterns we \nsee in labor markets, and in particular indus tries, during early stag es of recoveries.  I \nnoted the forces making it likely that gain s in employment would be slow in this \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, January 6, 2012 at 10: 30 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY  \n 2recovery.  I wish I could say I was too pe ssimistic that day, but as we all know the \nrecovery has been painfully slow. \nToday, after a brief overview of some recent economic  trends I would like to \nfocus on some key financial  data.  In particular, I want to highlight a distin ctive feature of \nthe recent recession and the anem ic recovery – the fact that  financial-market problems \nhad a disproportionate effect on the length and severity of the recession and have been a complicating factor in the lack of strength in the recovery.   \nI would like to walk you thr ough a number of charts that lay out the situation – \nparticularly as it relates to small busine ss financing.  My “punch line” is that as \nchallenging as the financial headwinds to recovery have been, there are still policy options to consider and explor e that could make a differen ce, and I will mention a few \npossibilities. \nOf course I would add that the views I express today are my own, not necessarily \nthose of my colleagues on the Board of Governors or the Federal Open Market \nCommittee (the FOMC). \nFirst, I’ll touch on the economic trends.  I would say the economic data have been \nimproving somewhat, relative to what we we re seeing in the summer.  Various supply \nshocks that buffeted the world economy in th e first half of 2011 are receding, as are the \nincreases in a variety of commodity prices.  In part, these reversals reflect expected \neconomic weakness in other parts of the world.   \nAs Figure 1  shows, a number of prices that we re increasing in th e first half of \n2011 (in blue) have moderated more recently (i n red) – particularly  energy prices and \nothers closely tied to energy, like airline fare s, and also food and beverage prices.  In \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, January 6, 2012 at 10: 30 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY  \n 3addition to these data, I see no evidence of significant acceleration in labor costs – as a \nresult of weakness in labor markets – and al so see reversals in a number of important \ncommodity price increases.  As a result, I person ally expect that inflation is likely to be \nbelow 2 percent not only in 2012 but al so over the next several years. \nWhile the difficult conditions in labor mark ets are a reason inflation has been well \ncontained, the very weak job growth the count ry has experienced is of course itself a \ncritical problem.  Figure 2  highlights the fact that many people are working part-time but \nwould prefer to work full time.  The percen t rose quickly during th e recession (the shaded \nportion of the chart) and has stayed high.  While these workers are currently employed, \nthis chart suggests that dema nd in the economy is not sufficiently strong for firms to \nemploy more workers full time.  Labor demand simply remains too weak. \nWith inflation expected to remain below 2 percent, and unemployment and \nunderemployment so high, I believe it is importa nt for the Federal Reserve to continue \nconsidering ways to promote stronger growth  and hasten what is a painfully long, slow \nrecovery and adjustment time in the economy.  \nAs a case in point, Figure 3  shows that households are now spending a lower \npercentage of their disposable income on debt -service payments, compared to just before \nthe onset of the recession when the ratio peaked  at about 14 percent.  While some of this \ndecline reflects unfortunate trends, such as de faults on mortgages, it also reflects the very \nlow interest-rate environment – which gives households an opportuni ty to improve their \nrelative financial condition1 (the net of their assets and lia bilities) as less money is spent \non interest payments for mortgages and credit cards.   \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, January 6, 2012 at 10: 30 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY  \n 4As an aside, I have emphasized in other talks that I think more can be done to \nfacilitate this process of adjustment – including tweaks to Government Sponsored \nEnterprise (GSE) mortgage programs and, potentially, expanding the purchase of \nmortgages by the Federal Reserve to keep mortgage rates low during a time of great \ndifficulty in housing markets.   \nIn sum, I would say that the monetary policy actions already taken by the Federal \nReserve are allowing firms and households to speed up the adjustment process, and as \nsuch are laying the foundati on for a stronger economy.  \n \nEmployment Patterns \nNow I’d like to share some additiona l perspectives, informed by data.  Figure 4  \nshows the path of employment from its peak pr ior to the last four recessions.  You see \nthat in the most recent recession and rec overy, the decline from peak employment was \nmore severe and more lasting than in the pr evious three.  Although we have experienced \nsome modest improvement in employment recen tly, we are nowhere near a return to the \npeak level of employment, which had occurred in the prior three recoveries by this point \nin time.  The current recovery’s slow em ployment growth is, it goes without saying, \nworth examining in more detail. \nFigure 5  shows the net change in  private sector employ ment, in thousands of \njobs, taking into account the size of the firm  where the job gains or  losses occurred.  A \nclose look makes apparent that  there are some significant differences over time.  In the \n2001 recession the biggest employment declines were at the largest firms (shown in the \ngreen sections of each bar).  During the rec overy from the 2001 recession, firms with less \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, January 6, 2012 at 10: 30 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY  \n 5than 50 employees bounced back relatively quickly  (the blue sections of each bar).  But \nthe 2001 experience contrasts sharply with th e recent recession, when the net decline was \nmuch more severe across all th ree firm-size categories.   \nParticularly striking, however,  is how much of a declin e occurred for the smallest \nfirms employing less than 50 employees.  Not only was the recession particularly severe \nfor small-firm employment, but employment gr owth during the recovery been slow at \nsmall firms.   \nIn short, the experience of small firms is  an important factor in the decline in \noverall employment during the most recent recession – and in the tepid employment \ngrowth in the recovery. \nFigure 6  highlights that in any dynamic rec overy an economy experiences large \nflows of job gains and losses – but in this recovery the sma llest and largest firms (on the \nextreme left and right of the chart) account fo r the most significant net job decline.  The \nonly significant net gain (thos e slivers of green above th e zero bound) is found in the \nmid-sized firm categories – those with mo re than 50 but less than 1,000 employees.   \nThis pattern is quite different from th e recovery that occurred after the 2001 \nrecession, as shown in Figure 7  (the red bars).  During that recovery, small firms (on the \nleft side of the chart) were an important sour ce of net job gains, while larger firms (in the \ncenter and to the right) continued to be major sources of net job losses – consistent with \nthe overall slow improvement in employment dur ing that recovery.  In contrast, during \nthis recovery (the blue bars) the smallest firms have produced net job losses .  The largest \nfirms have also accounted for job losses, but to a lesser degree compared to the prior \nrecovery.  \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, January 6, 2012 at 10: 30 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY  \n 6One of the distinctive features of this r ecession has been the substantial decline in \nhousehold net worth, particularly resulting from the decline in real estate values.  During \nrecessions that include sizable job losses, so me people use difficult labor markets as their \nimpetus to start a small business.  Such e fforts have often been financed through home \nequity loans, which tend to be the lowest-cos t type of financing available, especially \ncompared to the much more expensive use of credit cards.   \nHowever, the ability to start a small bus iness in this way has been severely \nhampered by the decline in house values and th e tightening of credit standards.  These \nfactors have made the traditional sources of entrepreneurial financing much less readily available.   \nIn addition, some of the states that saw th e most dramatic declin es in real estate \nvalues have also seen particular ly high unemployment rates.  As Figure 8  shows, the so-\ncalled “sand states” such as California, Ne vada, and Florida have unemployment rates \nmuch higher than the U.S. average, and ha ve also experienced sharp declines in \nresidential real estate values – declines much larger than th e U.S. average.  As a result, \nunemployed workers in these states are unl ikely to have home equity available for \nfinancing a startup small business that  could provide alternate employment. \nIn sum, these data suggest a very concer ning dynamic.  My sense is that in areas \nwhere high levels of unemployment might othe rwise lead individuals to use home-equity \nfinancing or credit cards to start a busi ness, today many find access to such forms of \ncredit impeded by impaired credit scores a nd the disappearance of home equity, given \ndepressed home values. \n \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, January 6, 2012 at 10: 30 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY  \n 7Patterns in Bank Financing \nFigure 9  shows how the composition of business loans (at commercial and \nsavings banks) has changed over the past decade .  There has been a significant increase in \nlarge commercial real estate loans, while  small commercial and industrial (C&I) loans \nand small commercial real estate loans are now accounting for a lower share of the total.  Relative to ten years ago, small-business loans account for a smaller pe rcentage of overall \nbusiness loans. \nOver the past year we have seen only moderate growth in gross domestic product \n(GDP), and some hiring from the larger mid-sized firms.  Figure 10  shows that lending  \ndata are consistent with this  pattern.  Large C&I loans have  recently been increasing, and \nlarge commercial real estate loans have remained relatively flat, but small C&I and small \ncommercial real estate loans have declined. \nTo me, the pattern is even more stri king when you break up the composition of \nloans by the size of the bank, as shown in Figure 11 .  While small-business lending (in \nblue) has decreased across all bank sizes, the de cline has been particul arly striking at the \nlarger banks, shown on the left, where you s ee a substantial declin e in small business \nloans.  Banks of all sizes ha ve increased their lending for large business loans (in red), \nwith the biggest percentage increase occurring at  the smallest banks.  In part this reflects \nthe fact that many of the smaller banks rema in very well capitalized, and some mid-sized \nfirms have decided to shift their banking relationships from large banks to more \ncommunity-based banks (as more community-b ased banks compete for that business). \nFigure 12  shows the creation of new estab lishments.  Given what I have \ndescribed so far, it is unfor tunate but not surprising th at the “birth rate” of new \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, January 6, 2012 at 10: 30 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY  \n 8establishments declined sharply and remains below historical levels.  Starting businesses \nwith financing from home equity or credit cards has become more difficult, and getting \nsmall business loans without some form of collateral remains quite challenging.  While \ndemand for small business credit from qualified seekers surely plays a role, my sense is \nthat at least one reason for slow  job creation in this tepid r ecovery may be that obtaining \nfinancing for new firms has become more di fficult.  And this suggests one reason why \nrecoveries after financial cr ises are particularly slow. \n \nImpact on the Outlook and Policymaking \nRecently the economic data has been somewhat more positive concerning the \nfourth quarter, but most forecasters do not, unf ortunately, expect that momentum to carry \nthrough 2012.  Most forecasters expect that economic growth in 2012 will be between 2 \nto 3 percent, with the outlook gradually improving over the course of the year.  \nUnfortunately, my own forecast is quite simila r, which is consistent with only a very \ngradual improvement in labor markets.   \nAllow me to briefly summarize my thinking. Recessions accompanied by significant financ ial problems tend to be more severe \ndownturns, followed by relatively slow recoveries.  One reason for a slow recovery is that \nthe financial condition of hous eholds and firms – their “b alance sheets,” given their \nliabilities and assets – take time to recove r, and credit for borrowers with financial \nimpairments becomes more difficult to obtai n.  This is currently reflected in both \nlingering problems with residential real estate and with the difficulties related to small business creation that I’ ve described today. \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, January 6, 2012 at 10: 30 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY  \n 9Let me touch briefly on residential real esta te.  It continues to be impacted by high \nforeclosures, falling housing prices in some ar eas, and tightened credit standards.  I have \nnoted in prior talks that residential real estate  tends to grow rapidly in the early stages of \na recovery, but not this time.  Policymakers ha ve pursued a variety of fiscal and monetary \napproaches to help with a housing recover y, and there have been recent suggestions \naround what more can be done.2   \nIn terms of monetary policy, actions the Fed has taken to reduce long-term \ninterest rates are supportive of housing, a nd the Fed’s purchases of mortgage-backed \nsecurities provided an even more targeted approach to stimulating housing.  Further \npurchases of mortgage-backed securities woul d in my view help provide a more rapid \nrecovery in housing, by reducing the costs of refinancing or purchasing new homes.  Of \ncourse, these Fed actions would be even more  effective if accompanied by fiscal policies \ndesigned to speed the re covery in housing.   \nAs I have highlighted today, some of th e slow employment growth we see is \nassociated with a less robust small business s ector.  The charts I shared show that loan \noriginations to small businesses have been quite weak, and that smaller firms have not \npushed the improvement in employment that we saw after the last  recession.  (I would \nnote that these points are amplified and more  formally addressed in a Federal Reserve \nBank of Boston working paper by Duyga n-Bump, Levkov, and Montoriol-Garriga.3).   \nThis is a very serious challenge to the recovery and to the economy.  As such, \npolicymakers must in my opinion explore all possible remedies, and weigh the costs and \nbenefits of each.   \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, January 6, 2012 at 10: 30 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY  \n 10While many of the problems in this sect or reflect impaired financials for many \nsmall businesses, and inadequate demand for products, I would add that credit availability \nfor creating or expanding small businesses can  be quite a challenge.  Again, monetary \npolicies that push down longer-term rates can be helpful, and that would be particularly \ntrue if there could be a targ eted approach to improve sma ll business financing.  As with \nhousing, such monetary policies would be most  effective if pursued in conjunction with \nfiscal policies targeted to impr oving conditions for small business. \nActions taken to date highli ght that these problems are not  easy to resolve.  This, \nto my thinking, only underlines the need to l ook for creative policy solutions targeted to \nboth housing and small business. \nIn addition to these tangible problems, there remain of course significant \ndownside risks that are likely to make hous eholds and businesses cautious.  Problems \nwith a slowing European economy, and sovere ign and banking issues in Europe, remain \ndownside risks.  Excessive fiscal austerity here  or abroad also has the potential for near \nterm downside risk.  Finally, recent uncertainty  in the Middle East highlights the ever-\npresent risk of potential oil s hocks.  Of course monetary po licy has no direct influence on \nany of these risks.  But they  highlight the importance of finding ways to hasten the pace \nof economic growth and job crea tion at this point in time.  \n \nConcluding Observations \nIn summary and conclusion, I know I don’t n eed to tell you that we continue to \nhave a slow recovery.  We all know, as well, that issues of some concern exist in Europe \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, January 6, 2012 at 10: 30 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY  \n 11and elsewhere.  I would reiterate that one r eason for the tepid pace of  recovery is that \nfinancial problems and restraints continue  to have lingering effects on the economy.   \nToday I have focused on one of those lingering problems, the impairment of \nhousehold financial condition that has made new business formation particularly difficult.  \nGiven the low inflation rate and weak labor markets that are both likely to persist this year, I believe the Federal Reserve should c ontinue to explore ways to promote more \nrapid recovery through stronger growth.   \nThe Federal Reserve has a variety of tools to  consider as we try to promote faster \neconomic growth – including communicating in different ways the likely future path of \nthe economy and the implications for intere st-rate policy (as was mentioned in FOMC \nminutes released this week), and consideri ng additional large-scale asset purchases.   \nIn addition, I believe that policymakers can  and should continue  to look at ways \nto better target fiscal a nd monetary policy to address the housing and small business \nfinancing problems we are seeing in this recovery.  I believe that the continuing \ndifficulties compel us to think creatively and proactively about ways to return the economy to full employment. I hope today I ha ve stimulated some thinking about the \npossible policy remedies.   \nThank you for having me join you today, a nd despite these challenging economic \ntimes let me extend my best wishes for the coming year to each of you and to every New \nEnglander.   \nThank you. \n                                                \n \n \nNOTES: \n \n1 i.e., the household “balance sheet.” \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, January 6, 2012 at 10: 30 A.M.

I would like to thank the Nationa l Institute of Economic and Social Research \nfor hosting this event.  Given the economic and financial shocks that have buffeted the global \neconomy in recent years, I think it is  particularly important to share perspectives across the Atlantic – \non the economic outlook, but also on the risks to both the outlook and financial stability. \nI am honored to be sharing the stage with Adam Posen.  I have long admired Adam’s \nacademic work and policy perspectives, and I am l ooking forward to discussions with Adam and his \ncolleagues at the Bank of Engla nd over the next several days. \n\n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Tuesday, March 27, 2012 at 12:35 p.m. U.S. Eastern Time and 5:35 p.m. in London, England – or Upon Delivery *  \n \n \n \n 2Of course, I would like to note that the views I express today are my own, not necessarily \nthose of my colleagues on the Federal Reserve’s Board of Governors or the Federal Open Market \nCommittee (the FOMC).  Today I would like to begin with a discussi on of emerging economic trends in the United \nStates, and then move into a discussion about op portunities to bolster stab ility in our financial \ninfrastructure.  My theme throughout is the need to avoid complacency. \nRecently released statistics ar e consistent with improved fi nancial market conditions and \ncontinued – albeit painfully slow – progress in labor markets.  At the same time, the spending  data \nhave been very weak.  How shoul d we reconcile these differences? \nFocusing only on financial and labor market cond itions, one might conclude that the recovery \nis undeniably gaining traction – and that spending will improve as higher personal income and wealth \ncontribute to a reinforcing cycle th at propels us toward full employm ent in the U.S.  Alternatively, \nfocusing only on the weak spending data might lead one to conclude that the improvements in labor \nmarkets and financial conditions are going to prov e temporary, because the recent improvements are \nprobably unsustainable if the U.S. economy continues to gr ow at only a 2 percent rate. \nIt may take several quarters befo re we know which of these two pe rspectives is actually better \nreflective of the U.S. economy today.  Beyond discussing the economic outlook in the Un ited States, I would like to make a few \nobservations on financial markets.  I’ll state my firm view that the actions taken by central banks \naround the world – for example, engaging in forei gn exchange swap line agreements and using less \ntraditional monetary policy tools – have been both appropriate and necessary. \nHowever, many of these actions were ultimately necessary because supervisory and regulatory \nframeworks were not sufficiently macro-prudential.  By macro-prudential I am referring to a focus on \nrisks, vulnerabilities, or dependenc ies that potentially could affect the financial system as a whole – \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Tuesday, March 27, 2012 at 12:35 p.m. U.S. Eastern Time and 5:35 p.m. in London, England – or Upon Delivery *  \n \n \n \n 3versus just the safety and soundne ss of individual instituti ons.  Ideally, central banks should not need \nto take actions to support continued financial inte rmediation, because financial institutions should be \nsufficiently resilient to ensure that even unusual financial-market stress would not impair effective \nintermediation.  Recent events have  highlighted that we remain far from achieving that goal. \n \nThe U.S. Economic Outlook \n With that preview, let me begin with some thoughts on the U.S. economic outlook. \nThere have been positive trends in some r ecent economic data.  U.S. financial market \nconditions are clearly improving.  Some of the recent improvements reflect the moderation or removal \nof some significant, imminent, downs ide “tail” risks.  At least for now, Europe seems to have avoided \nthe risk of a so-called “Lehman moment” – a ri sk that had seriously concerned investors. \nThe S&P 500 has risen roughly 9 percent since the beginning of the year, as shown in Figure \n1.  Risk gauges, such as spreads on bonds and credit default swaps (CDSs), have improved.  Bond \nissuance has been strong.  U.S. financial markets have gathered steam and reflect increased optimism \nabout likely economic outcomes. \nHowever, my enthusiasm is tempered by the challenges st ill facing Europe. \n Forward-looking financial markets seem to be pricing in improved economic outcomes, and \nthere are some brightening signs, to be sure.  Figure 1 shows that auto  sales in the United States have \nrebounded nicely, and consumer sentiment has improved significantly since last August.  In addition, payroll employment in the U.S. has been growing at  a rate of 245,000 jobs a month over the past three \nmonths.  This should mean more disposable income , which coupled with increasing household wealth \n(fueled by stock market gains), should be c onsistent with an improved outlook for spending. \n However, when we focus solely on the in coming spending data, th e outlook appears less \nrobust.  Since the start of the recovery, what we call real final sales – that  is, domestically produced \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Tuesday, March 27, 2012 at 12:35 p.m. U.S. Eastern Time and 5:35 p.m. in London, England – or Upon Delivery *  \n \n \n \n 4goods and services (net of inventor ies, which can swing significantly from quarter to quarter) – have \nbeen growing at only 1.7 percent, as shown in Figure 2 .  Furthermore, my forecast for the first quarter \nof this year would be for real final sales to grow  at roughly 2 percent, onl y slightly better than the \naverage during the U.S. recovery to date. \nFigure 3  highlights two distinctive f eatures of this recovery – unusually weak residential \ninvestment, despite very low intere st rates; and an extended declin e in state and local government \nspending. \nThe health of the U.S. housing market has b een hampered by significan t declines in housing \nprices, very elevated foreclosures, and a large in ventory of vacant homes.  As a result, residential \ninvestment – which normally grows quite rapidly dur ing a recovery – has not provided its customary \noverall boost to the economic recovery.  While some  tentative signs of an improving housing sector \nhave emerged, for the reasons I just mentioned it is likely to be subdued relative to historical \nexperience. \nAlso, state and local government spending has be en unusually weak during this recovery.  The \nseverity of the recession, combined  with the fall in home values that are the basis for many local \ngovernment tax revenues, have forced substantial cuts  in state and local spending.  It is worth noting \nthat in the U.S., state and local  government spending accounts for a larger share of GDP than does \nfederal government spending: 11.7 percent of GDP, co mpared to 8.0 percent for federal spending.   \nState and local budgets will remain under stre ss as governments face increasing demands on \ntheir resources, such as addressing significant sh ortfalls in certain areas (for example employee \npensions).  At the same time, federal government spending is expected to be cut significantly, making \ngovernment spending as a component of GDP a cha llenging aspect of the economic outlook in the \nUnited States. \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Tuesday, March 27, 2012 at 12:35 p.m. U.S. Eastern Time and 5:35 p.m. in London, England – or Upon Delivery *  \n \n \n \n 5So, despite some good production data and the optimism seen in financial markets, the \nspending data are consistent with real U.S. GDP growth over the course of 2012 of only 2.5 percent – \nwhich unfortunately is only fast enough to make modest headway at reducing the unemployment in \nour labor market. \nGiven the very modest recovery to date, it is  surprising that the unemp loyment rate, depicted \nin the recent downward trend in the line in Figure 4, has shown as much improvement as it has.  The \ncurrent unemployment rate of 8.3 percent represen ts a decline from 9.1 percent over the past six \nmonths, despite only modest  growth in spending.   \nHowever, while the unemployment rate has declin ed, there has not been much improvement in \nthe important ratio of empl oyment to population, shown in Figure 5 .   \nOf course aggregate employment-to-population ratios are impacted by demographic changes – \nfor example the aging of the “baby boom” generation in the U.S.  To explor e the role that recent \ndemographic changes might  have played on the movement of the employment-to-population series, \nFigure 6  shows the same concept for particular age c ohorts that are less li kely to be impacted by \ndemographics over the short term.  The employ ment-to-population ratio in  age groups where the \nattachment to working should not have changed shows a pattern very similar to that of the ratio as a \nwhole.   \nSo part of the decline in the unemployment ra te is resulting from wo rkers leaving the labor \nforce.  Furthermore, only in recent months ha s the employment-to-populati on ratio improved and the \npayroll employment growth clearly exceeded the normal growth rate of the labor force.  So the U.S. \nremains well below the employment levels that would be viewed as  consistent with the maximum \nsustainable employment aspect of the Fe deral Reserve’s so-called dual mandate. \nThe other element of the Federal Rese rve’s dual mandate is inflation.  Figure 7  charts two \nprimary measures of inflation – total personal consumption expenditure inflation, and core personal \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Tuesday, March 27, 2012 at 12:35 p.m. U.S. Eastern Time and 5:35 p.m. in London, England – or Upon Delivery *  \n \n \n \n 6consumption expenditure inflation (which exclud es the volatile food a nd energy categories).  Core  \nPCE inflation – again excluding food  and energy – has remained below the Federal Reserve target of \n2 percent throughout the recovery.  Total  PCE inflation, including food a nd energy, is slightly above 2 \npercent, but has diverged from core prices when commodity pri ces such as oil have spiked up or \ndeclined substantially.  As the figure shows, however , the more volatile total measure tends over time \nto revert to the level of core inflation.   \nWith the recent spike in oil prices, it is likely th at total PCE inflation will rise further, but this \nincrease is likely to be tempor ary, reflecting volatile o il price movements.  For 2013 my own forecast \nis for both total PCE and core PCE inflation to be be low 2 percent, although this forecast assumes that \nMiddle East tensions do not result in another sharp spike in oil prices. \nAnother potential inflationary concern has b een raised by the swelling of the Federal \nReserve’s balance sheet that occurred as we purchas ed assets to advance m onetary policy goals.  But \nFigure 8  shows that commercial real estate lending is still declining – and while commercial and \nindustrial lending has increased, it has yet to return to its level at th e beginning of the recession.  What \nthis means it that by and large, the expansion of  the Fed’s balance sheet has not turned into a \nsignificant increase in the supply of money, because ba nks have not been lending out their holdings of \nexcess reserves.  So the expansion of reserves th at occurred in 2008 as the Fed expanded its balance \nsheet has not been inflationary, given the subdued bank lending environment. \nIndeed, bank lending has been quite modest de spite a relatively rapid improvement in bank \ncapital ratios in the United States.  This should give  some European analysts pause, as the experience \nin the U.S. (as well as the earlier Japanese experi ence) suggests that the constraints on bank lending \ndue to the recent financial problems  in Europe may be more long-la sting than some are expecting. \nIn summary, while recent financial-market a nd labor-market data in the U.S. have been \nencouraging, spending data remain disappointing.  Like many forecasters, I expect higher real GDP \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Tuesday, March 27, 2012 at 12:35 p.m. U.S. Eastern Time and 5:35 p.m. in London, England – or Upon Delivery *  \n \n \n \n 7growth as the year progresses.  But I would caution that I and many ot hers held a similar view at the \nbeginning of 2010 and 2011. \nIf real GDP does not grow more rapidly and unemployment remains at its current \nunacceptably high level, monetary policy may need to be more accommodative.  The U.S. unemployment rate remains well above a level that  could be considered full employment, while we \nare likely to undershoot our inflatio n targets.  Together these factor s provide room for flexibility in \nthe response of monetary policy as we receive ad ditional information on current economic conditions.   \n \nChallenges in Bank Funding \n Despite the improvements we are seeing in th e U.S. economy, a number of significant risks \nand challenges remain.  One involve s geo-political risks, which have already caused oil prices to rise \nmore than most non-energy commodity prices.  A ny further significant increase in energy prices \nwould be an additional impediment to faster gr owth.  Another involves  the unsustainable budget \ndeficits that many countries, includi ng the United States, currently have .  The challenge, I believe, is \nthat greater fiscal responsibility must be impl emented in a way that doe s not threaten tentative \neconomic recoveries.  A third risk is  the continued fragility in our fina ncial infrastructure – a situation \nthat can substantially amplify other economic problems.  It is this third risk that I would like to touch \nupon today.  The economic slowdown that began in the United States several years ago went from being a \nmild event led by housing-related problems to bei ng a much more severe and long-lasting economic \ndownturn.  This was, in part, because of the architecture of the financial sector.\n1  Today I would like \nto highlight one particular potentia l structural flaw in the financia l architecture – the dependence on \nshort-term funding.  \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Tuesday, March 27, 2012 at 12:35 p.m. U.S. Eastern Time and 5:35 p.m. in London, England – or Upon Delivery *  \n \n \n \n 8This past financial crisis was a primer on vulne rabilities to short-term  funding.  Specifically, \nwholesale funding utilized by large global banks drie d up during the financial crisis.  As large banks \nsought to reduce their exposure to  counterparties of concern, th e term of loans made in the \nmarketplace decreased, and the cost  of short-term credit spiked.  \nAnd many of the problems were occurring outside of traditional depositor y institutions.  Bear \nStearns and Lehman Brothers were investment banks, not commercial banks.  As counterparties \ndramatically reduced both unsecured and secured lending to these two entities, funding was no longer \navailable and the firms failed.   \nSimilarly, money market mutual funds with e xposures to investment banks in many cases \nrequired support from parent or sponsoring entities.  And one f und without parental support – the \nReserve Primary Fund – sustained a credit loss that would ultimately lead to its liquidation.  This led \nto a run on prime funds, which in turn furthe r impaired short-term credit markets.   \nAs Figure 9  shows, the money market mutual fund industry held $3.5 trillion in assets under \nmanagement in mid September 2008.  Prime fund s, which hold a mix of Treasury and agency \nsecurities and other short-term debt instruments (including commercial paper and large certificates of \ndeposit), held nearly 60 percent of  industry assets, or $2.1 trillion.   \nWhen the Reserve Primary Fund “broke the buc k,” outflows from prime funds totaled roughly \n$500 billion over a four-week period .  Although much of the outflow went into government money \nmarket mutual funds (which hold only Treasury a nd agency securities, an d repurchase agreements \nbacked by such securities), these inflows did littl e to ease the strains being felt in the corporate \nfunding markets resul ting from the exit from prime funds.2   \n U.S. money market funds are thought of and marketed as highly liquid, low-risk investments \nwith many of the same characterist ics as traditional bank deposits.  As a result, money market fund \ninvestors and money market fund mana gers should be highly sensitive to  changes in underlying risks.  \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Tuesday, March 27, 2012 at 12:35 p.m. U.S. Eastern Time and 5:35 p.m. in London, England – or Upon Delivery *  \n \n \n \n 9The crisis in autumn of 2008 taught us that safegua rding against runs on financial entities like money \nmarket funds – entities that do not have a large, stable, core deposit base and do not have ordinary \naccess to the central bank’s “lender of last resort” function – was and is important, unfinished work if \nwe are to have a more stable financial system. \nA number of significant reforms are being contemplated by the U.S. Securities and Exchange \nCommission (SEC) to reduce the ri sks surrounding money ma rket funds.  But even with significant \nreforms such as these – reforms, by the way, that I am highly supportive of and will say more about at \na conference in Atlanta in two w eeks – money market funds will contin ue to be a potentially unstable \nsource of U.S. dollar funding.  From a financial st ability perspective, we need to recognize the \npossibility of a deterioration in the ability or willingness of the money market funds to keep providing \na dependable source of funds to counterparties (for example, the issuers of co mmercial paper that the \nfunds purchase).  This could occur as  a result of a change in the risk profile of those counterparties.  \nWholesale funding issues also played an important  role in recent European banking problems.  \nSome European banks were too dependent on whol esale funding, particularly funding coming from \nU.S. money market funds.    Figure 10  shows the European exposure of U.S. prim e money market funds over the past year.  \nGiven the changes in the risk profil e of some banks, as a result of increases in sovereign debt risk, \nmoney market funds have sought to reduce what was their large risk exposure to European financial \ninstitutions.  Most money market funds in the beginning of 2011 had alrea dy dramatically reduced \nexposure to peripheral financial inst itutions.  Over the second half of last year there was a very \nsignificant decline in exposure to  euro-zone financial institutions.  (In addition, remaining exposure \nwas shortened in tenor, meaning time to maturity).   Figure 10 highlights the declines across Europe \nand Figure 11  shows the decline over the course of 2011 more specifical ly by certain countries.   \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Tuesday, March 27, 2012 at 12:35 p.m. U.S. Eastern Time and 5:35 p.m. in London, England – or Upon Delivery *  \n \n \n \n 10Because U.S. money market funds had been a significant source of short-term funds for \nEuropean institutions, money funds’ move away from short-term European debt resulted in a significant shortage of dollar funds available to these institutions.  I will show you some market \nindicators of these shortages in a moment.  No money market fund encountered a problem  meeting investor redemptions during the \nEuropean sovereign debt crisis\n3.  But even without such a problem,  money market funds still had an \nimpact on the availability of credit to financial institutions for which the perception of risk had \nchanged. \nProblems with financial stabilit y do not require a failure to cr eate a significant disruption in \nthe flow of credit.  In light of the incentives faci ng money market funds, financ ial institutions that rely \nheavily on them for funding put themselves in a pos ition where a short-term change in perceived risk \ncan create significant funding problems.  And as we ha ve seen repeatedly over the past several years, \nfunding problems at one instituti on can quickly spread to the fi nancial system as a whole. \n Figure 12  highlights that funding challenges for Eu ropean banks were developing as money \nmarket funds reduced their European exposur es.  The rise in th e LIBOR to OIS spread4 indicates that \nfinancial institutions became more concerned about  lending to each other as money market funding \ndeclined.  Similarly, the sharp rise in the rates on the 3-month euro-dollar foreign exchange swap \nindicates the pressure exerted by reduced dollar funding from the money market funds on European \nfinancial institutions’ funding. \nIn short, the rational reaction of money market funds to perceived changes in risk – reducing \nEuropean exposure – led to various funding pressure s.  The issues eventually were addressed by \ncentral bank actions that signifi cantly expanded liquidit y, both through foreign exchange swaps and \nthrough European Central Bank (ECB) term lending to  European institutions.  While these actions \nhave been very important for stabilizing financial ma rkets, I believe we need to get to the point of \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Tuesday, March 27, 2012 at 12:35 p.m. U.S. Eastern Time and 5:35 p.m. in London, England – or Upon Delivery *  \n \n \n \n 11having a more resilient financial infrastructure th at does not require centra l bank interventions during \ntimes of stress. \nFor financial institutions and s upervisors this implies thinking more carefully about stress \nscenarios, and specifically about whether critical fundi ng will evaporate when it is needed most.  \nWhile Basel Capital Accord proposals will help in th is respect, I would strongly suggest that stress-\ntesting scenarios assess how well risk-sensitive sour ces of short-term funding will hold up in an \nenvironment of heightened risk.  This liquid ity-focused assessment would be an important \ncomplement to current stress testing, and a prudent aspect of risk management. \n \nConcluding Observations \n In summary and conclusion, I would re-empha size that financial-market and economic \nconditions have been improving since the start of th e year.  Central banks ha ve played an important \nrole in encouraging more economic growth.  In the United States, accomm odative monetary policy \nhas been essential to improving fina ncial conditions, but growth rema ins disappointingly slow to date, \nand significant downside risks rema in.  Should growth slow down more  than is expected, more policy \naccommodation could be advisable.   \nEven if growth should improve more than expect ed in the U.S., the c ountry will likely remain \nfar from what anyone would consider full employme nt – so in my view policy accommodation should \nonly be removed once it is clear that the Fed’s du al mandate can be achieved within a reasonable \nperiod of time. \nAs with monetary policy, work remains to be done to improve financial stability.  Today I \nhave highlighted one area that deserves more attention – ensuring that we reduce the risk of \ndisruptions to credit flows that result from wholesale s hort-term funding problems, and that require \ncentral bank intervention. \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Tuesday, March 27, 2012 at 12:35 p.m. U.S. Eastern Time and 5:35 p.m. in London, England – or Upon Delivery *  \n \n \n \n 12Thank you again for inviting me to speak with you today. \n  \n \n                                                 \n \n1 For more information see prior speeches including “Global Financial Intermediaries: Lessons and Continuing \nChallenges”, “Towards Greater Financial Stability in Short- Term Credit Markets”, and “Defining Financial Stability, and \nSome Policy Implications of Applying the Definition” [available at: \n \n• http://www.bostonfed.org/news/speeches/ rosengren/2011/101911/index.htm,  \n• http://www.bostonfed.org/news/speeches/ro sengren/2011/092911/index.htm, and  \n• http://www.bostonfed.org/news/speeche s/rosengren/2011/060311/index.htm , respectively]. \n \n2 For more information on this aspect of the financial crisis, see a forthcoming article in The Journal of Finance  entitled \n“How Effective Were the Federal Reserv e Emergency Liquidity Facilities?

Advisory councils like the one Ralph \nchairs provide information and perspectives that  help us at the Fed interpret trends in the \neconomic data.    \n\n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, May 30, 2012 at 4:50 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY  \n 2 I have been in your city a number of times in recent years, but the last time I gave \na speech in Worcester specifically on the economic outlook, like today, it was at the \nWorcester Economic Club in May of 2009.  The na tion was really still in the midst of the \nfinancial crisis then, so it is wonderful to  be speaking with you at a somewhat more \nfavorable time.   \nWe have had 11 consecutive quarters of positive growth in gross domestic \nproduct (GDP) since the economic recovery bega n, and the unemployment rate nationally \nhas declined from a peak of 10 percent to 8.1 percent in April.  However, the economic \nrecovery and the improvement in the unemplo yment rate continue to be frustratingly \nslow.  My outlook, unfortunately, is for gr owth right around its “ potential” rate of \nbetween two and two-and-a-ha lf percent – which implies no significant improvement in \nlabor markets over the course of  this year.  Of course I w ould add that all the views I \nexpress today are my own, not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Board of \nGovernors or the Federal Open Market Committee (the FOMC). \n And even this modest pace of growth is  contingent on some fairly significant \nassumptions – that Europe will be able to muddle through its current problems, and that in the United States the government will be ab le to reach agreements to avoid a so-called \n“fiscal cliff” looming at the end of this year.  Under current law, at the end of 2012 \ncertain factors – including the expiration of  unemployment benefits and the payroll tax \ncut, revisions to the Alternative Minimum Ta x, the expiration of the so-called “Bush tax \ncuts,” and sequestration (automatic spending cuts) associated with the Budget Control \nAct of 2011 – would together restrain gr owth by a significant fraction of GDP.\n1 \n \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, May 30, 2012 at 4:50 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY  \n 3Recent Economic Data \n I would note that there has been some pos itive news contained in recent economic \ndata.  Figure 1  shows the improvements in two compone nts of real GDP that are linked \nto households.  Consumption grew  2.9 percent in the first quarter  of this year , a rate that \nis faster than the previous three quarters a nd faster than the 2.2 percent growth of the \noverall economy.  Similarly, residential invest ment grew 19.1 percent in the first quarter \nof this year, faster than the previous three quarters – and obviously well above the rate of \ngrowth in the overall economy.2   \nThinking optimistically, the improvement in residential investment may finally be \nsignaling that the housing sector will not cont inue to be a source of significant restraint \non economic growth.  However, my enthusiasm  for a housing recovery is still moderated \n– by the evidence of challenges in obtaining housing finance,  by the number of borrowers \nwho owe more than their house is worth, and by the still very elevated level of home \nforeclosures.   \nIndeed, as Figure 2  shows, housing prices across the country are moving \ntogether, and are likely being restrained by similar headwind s, rather than principally \nreflecting regional trends.  I would expect th at as the housing sector improves along with \nthe national economy, regional differences woul d become prevalent and we would see a \nweaker correlation of housing pr ices across different regions of the country than we see \nto the far right in Figure 2.  And while some sectors of the ec onomy are improving, some significant \nheadwinds remain.  Figure 3  shows two of them.  Government spending has been \ndeclining,\n3 which regardless of your political views means, in the short term, less \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, May 30, 2012 at 4:50 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY  \n 4aggregate demand and less growth in th e economy.  And without further action by \nCongress to avoid the “fiscal c liff” that I mentioned earlier, national fiscal policy has the \npotential to be a much bigger headwind to  faster growth in the coming year.  \nBusiness investment has also been slow ing.  While business investment was a \nsource of strength in the early stages of the recovery, compan ies have slowed investment \nspending more recently.  To the extent that concerns over a possible worsening of future \nEuropean economic problems and a possible U.S.  fiscal contraction make U.S. businesses \nmore tentative, these worries about the futu re can impede a more rapid recovery now. \n This is a particularly difficult time to  forecast the economy, given that significant \npolitical decisions can influence economic actions.  To highlight why we should be \nhumble about our forecasting abilities, we need  only look at the size of revisions to the \nGDP numbers shown in Figure 4 .  The chart highlights the significant uncertainty \nassociated with measures of recent economi c growth.  The blue dashed line plots the \nadvance estimates of real GDP growth.  The data are revised in s ubsequent months as \nmore information becomes available, for ex ample additional data on foreign trade and \ninventories.  However, even those estimates  can be significantly re vised – see the red, \ngreen, and blue marks on the chart – once tax data and other information become available to the U.S. Bureau of Economic An alysis.  As the chart shows, it is not \nuncommon for the revised data to differ from the preliminary estimates of GDP by as much as a percentage point.  Given the difficulty in measuring even  the recent past, it should not be too \nsurprising that estimates of the future ar e even more problematic.  For example, \neconomic forecasters need to make assumptions  about the fiscal measures likely to be \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, May 30, 2012 at 4:50 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY  \n 5taken by European countries, some of which ar e facing elections with  quite stark policy \nchoices represented by the candidates on the ballot.  And forecasters need to make \nassumptions about fiscal policy in the Unite d States, even though it goes without saying \nthat political choices made up and down the ball ot by the U.S. electorate in the fall could \nlead to quite diffe rent policies.   \nSince economists have no particular expert ise in forecasting political results, they \nmake estimates based on modeling likely outcomes – which often assume only modest \ndivergence from the recent past.   Despite  the uncertainty inherent in them, these \neconomic forecasts are an important aspect  of how monetary policy is set.   \nAt the Fed, we are now producing and public ly disclosing the estimates of real \nGDP growth, unemployment, and PCE4 inflation rates produced by the FOMC \nparticipants5 in a Summary of Economic Projections.  The central tendency6 of the \nFOMC participants’ estimated forecasts, and my own current forecast, are provided in \nFigure 5.      \nYou can see that my own forecasts are a li ttle more pessimistic than the central \ntendency of the participants at  the April FOMC meeting.  I am expecting growth of only \n2.3 percent for the full year, I’m sorry to sa y; and unfortunately no improvement in the \ncurrent U.S. unemployment rate of 8.1 percent.   As you can see, I also expect both total \nPCE inflation and core PCE inflation to be below 2 percent for 2012.  My forecast of relative weakness in the economy reflects concern that the un certainty about both Europe \nand the U.S. federal “fiscal cliff” will re strain spending by households and businesses – \nbut it also assumes that Europe and our own fiscal situation achieve a “muddling \nthrough.”   \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, May 30, 2012 at 4:50 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY  \n 6I would, however, highlight the uncertainty  and downside risks to my forecast. \nOne downside risk is that European problems could become a much greater restraint on \ngrowth this year.  Another downside risk is that Middle East problem s could cause an oil \nsupply shock that negatively affects economic growth.  And another is that much greater \nfiscal austerity could result from a potent ial failure to reach budget agreements.   \nGiven my expectations of only mode st growth, no improvement in the \nunemployment rate, an inflation forecast belo w 2 percent, and significant downside risks \nto the forecast, I believe monetary policy s hould remain accommodative at this time and \nindeed that we should be looking for ways th at monetary policy can foster more rapid \ngrowth, to bring down the unemployment rate more quickly.  I believe further monetary \npolicy accommodation is both appropriate a nd necessary.  The U.S., like many other \ncountries, needs to facilitate a more rapid re covery, and monetary policy is one important \ntool with the potential still fo r encouraging faster growth.  \n \nLabor Markets \n Now I’d like to focus in on labor markets.   I remain especially concerned about \nthe ongoing weakness there.  While most obser vers are concerned about labor market \nconditions, views differ on why unemployment remains so persistently and painfully \nhigh.  Some believe there are structural reasons  like shortages of specific skills, or labor \nshortages in specific geographic regions.  If  this argument were true, then the more \nstimulative monetary policy I am  proposing might not be wise. \n But I will present some analysis today that argues that most of the problem is in a lack of aggregate demand – in the parlance of economists, it is cyclical more than \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, May 30, 2012 at 4:50 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY  \n 7structural.  This is not to dismiss entirely some structural components of the current high \nunemployment rate.  Certainly th ere are situations where the skills of people who had lost \njobs were not well aligned with the skill sets needed in some sectors that are hiring, such \nas advanced manufacturing and health care.  But I believe the evidence shows the bulk of \nthe problem is cyclical.  Furthe rmore, my desire to stimulate more growth now is partly \nto prevent the structural problem from b ecoming more severe because the economy did \nnot re-employ workers more quickly. \nFigure 6  highlights that all cens us regions experienced a significant decline in \nemployment during the recent recession, and also that there is surprisingly little regional \nvariation during this modest re covery.  The lines move togeth er at the extreme right of \nthe chart, versus the earlier periods depicted on the rest of the chart.  While recessions \ntend to impact all regions of the country si multaneously, recoveries are normally more \nvaried across regions.  Differences in indus trial composition and idiosyncratic variation \ncause regions to diverge as the recovery progresses.   \nOne reason for the current similarity across regions is that two weak sectors, state \nand local government spending and residential investment, remain much weaker than is \nusual for this stage of a recovery, and have  been impacting all regions of the country.  \nThe similarity across regions also highlight s that inadequate demand – rather than \nregional employment shortages in faster growin g areas – is driving employment patterns. \n Figure 7  further illustrates this point.  Nationally, the unemployment rate is 8.1 \npercent, well above the unemployment rate in December 2007 before the onset of the recession.  In fact, all census regions have much higher unemployment rates than they did \nbefore the onset of the recession, and no regi on today has an unemplo yment rate that I \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, May 30, 2012 at 4:50 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY  \n 8would see as consistent with full employment.  Again, the state of affairs we see today is \nnot consistent with serious bottlenecks created by rapid growth in certain regions \npreventing further progress in labor markets.  Figure 8  illustrates in rather stark terms how unusual this recovery has been.  In \nthe previous three recoveries the previous peak in employment was reached within two \nyears of the start of the rec overy.  In the current recove ry, which has already exceeded \ntwo years in length, employment still remains more than 3 percent lower than the peak prior to the recession.  This is  partly because the recovery  has been slow, and partly \nbecause the employment decline was so large.    Figure 9  shows the current recovery and also shows employment when the \nconstruction and government sectors are exclude d (the dashed lines).  These two sectors \nhave been unusually weak in this recovery – but even when these sectors are excluded, \nemployment is nowhere close to its previ ous peak.  This highlights that employment \nweakness is not tied just to problems in specific sectors of the economy. \n Figure 10  shows employment growth across industries.  This recession was \nunusual in how pervasive the decline was acro ss industries, reflecting a very sharp drop \nin overall demand as businesses significantly retrenched, given the severity of the \ndownturn.  Moreover, during the recovery the pattern has been similar across industries – \nwith a modest pickup in employment across industries but no i ndustry standing out as \nhaving comparably rapid growth.  Again th is seems more reflective of inadequate \ndemand rather than structural impediments to growth, such as major industries being \nunable to find sufficient workers. \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, May 30, 2012 at 4:50 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY  \n 9 And if firms were having difficulty hi ring, one would expect to see wages and \nsalaries rising in their industries.  Figure 11  highlights that wages a nd salaries have been \ngrowing only slowly, and in most industries it  is below two percent – consistent with \nweak labor demand in general .  The tight bunching of wage  and salary growth at low \nlevels in the recent period shown to the ri ght of the chart does not  give evidence that \ncertain industries are bidding up wages and sa laries because of difficulty finding workers. \n These employment and wage patterns are c onsistent with a very modest recovery \nin most industries and most regions of th e country.  Growth has been only modest \nnationally, and I believe we need substantiall y more growth if we want to achieve full \nemployment within a reasonable period of time. \n \nConcluding Observations \n The economy continues to recover, albeit at only a modest pace.  I do not expect \ngrowth to pick up significantly, and therein do not expect marked improvement in the \nvery weak labor markets.   \nThe Federal Reserve is charged by Congre ss with what is known as our “dual \nmandate” – using monetary policy to achieve  price stability and maximum sustainable \nemployment over a reasonable horizon.  The unemployment rate is well above what I \nexpect it to be over the long run, and it is expected to remain uncomfortably high for \nwhat I consider far too long.  And PCE inflatio n is likely to be belo w 2 percent this year \nand for some time to come.   \nGiven the poor current conditions and my  forecast for continued weakness – and \nthe evidence that suggests the problem is one  of aggregate demand rather than structural \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, May 30, 2012 at 4:50 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY  \n 10unemployment – I believe monetary policy need s to be more stimulative if we hope to \nmeet both elements of the dual mandate in a reasonable time frame.  And should some of \nthe downside risks that I have emphasized mate rialize, such as a significant disruption \nfrom abroad, more aggressive actio ns would certainly be warranted. \n I thank you again for inviting me to di scuss the economy, and policy, with you.   \n \n                                                 \n \nNOTES: \n \n1 The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office on May 22 released a study on the “Economic Effects of \nReducing the Fiscal Restraint That Is Scheduled to Oc cur in 2013.”  The CBO noted “Under those fiscal \nconditions, which will occur under current law, growth in real (inflation-adjusted) GDP in calendar year \n2013 will be just 0.5 percent, CBO expects—with the economy projected to contract at an annual rate of \n1.3 percent in the first half of the year and expand at an annual rate of 2.3 percent in the second half.

U.S. East ern Time and 1:00 PM in Amsterdam – or Upon Delivery * \n \n \n \n \n 3of research topics.  I am happy for the opportunity to discuss how problems in financial markets and \nat financial intermediaries can spill over into th e real economy, especially at  a central bank that has \nhad a longstanding interest in these issues. \nAs always, I should note that the views I expres s today are my own, not necessarily those of \nmy colleagues on the Federal Reserve’s Board of G overnors or the Federal Open Market Committee \n(the FOMC).  Since the severe financial stre sses of 2008, a variety of actions have been taken to strengthen \nthe financial infrastructure and make banks more re silient in the face of adverse shocks.  While many \nbanks have improved their capital and liquidity pos itions since 2008, we still see in the headlines of \nnewspapers around the world that financial st ability remains very much an issue.   \nIn some ways, central bankers must approach the issue of financial stability much like a \nstructural engineer.  Where are the potential stresses in the system?  Under what circumstances could those stresses be particularly pr oblematic? Most importantly, what re medial actions could reduce the \npossibility of an unstable outcome?   \nToday I want to highlight an area where remedial action is still required.  My goal is to focus \nmore attention on financial struct ures that by design or reality\n1 reduce or avoid capital charges – what \nis often called engaging in “capital arbitrage.”  Such structures are vulnerable to stresses that can have \ndestabilizing effects on financia l markets and the broader econom y.  After some introductory \ncomments about financial structures with inadequa te capital, I will touch on two specific areas that \nmerit consideration – money market mutual f unds sponsored by banking or ganizations, and broker-\ndealer financing.  \n \n \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, June 29, 2012 at 7:00 A.M. U.S. East ern Time and 1:00 PM in Amsterdam – or Upon Delivery * \n \n \n \n \n 4The Social Costs of Financial Stru ctures with Inadequate Capital \nHolding little or no capital fo r risky activities can, during good  times, generate significant \nprofits; even in relatively low-margin businesses.   However, during times of stress, the power of \nleverage works in reverse, amplifying the negati ve impact of risky ac tivities and necessitating \nsubstantial capital and liquidity at a time when both are in short supply. \nThese problems become compounded in episodes when the inadequacy of capital becomes \napparent in the marketplace.  Investors who normally  fund these structures, ve ry often via short-term \nlending, flee – and they also flee financial institu tions that are perceived to stand behind these \nstructures (sponsoring institutions, which I will disc uss in a moment).  In this way, the capital \narbitrage that motivated the risky structures could c ontribute to a liquidity strain on what has come to \nbe known as the shadow banking system, and could stre ss the financial institutions that were integral \nto its creation.  The reason we care about this is that such an epis ode often produces instability in \nimportant channels for funding real economic activity – so these Wall Street c oncerns can have Main \nStreet impacts.2 \nStructured investment vehicles or “SIVs” il lustrated this dynamic very well.  Financial \ninstitutions created SIVs as off-ba lance-sheet structures that were financed with short-term liabilities \nbut frequently invested in longer-term a ssets, such as mortga ge-backed securities.3  The associated \ncredit and interest-rate risk became apparent, as losses from these assets rose.  Investors were no \nlonger willing to purchase the short-term paper i ssued by these structures.  Consequently, many \nfinancial institutions, as a result of implicit or exp licit guarantees, were forced to bring these assets \nonto their balance sheet – where they were often s ubject to more significant capital requirements.  \nThis led to substantial losses, balance sheet expansion, and a shor tage of capital – all of which \nhindered the meeting of funding needs in the real economy.   \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, June 29, 2012 at 7:00 A.M. U.S. East ern Time and 1:00 PM in Amsterdam – or Upon Delivery * \n \n \n \n \n 5Fortunately, the riskiest and most  opaque structures of this sort have largely disappeared from \nthe marketplace.  But problematic structures still remain. \nRuns on complex securitizations, prime money market mutual f unds, and investment banks all \ncontributed to the severity of the 2008 crisis .  Compounding the problem, the investment bank \nstructures were built on an assumption that runs were unlikely as long as lenders held collateral \nagainst their loans.  In the depths  of the crisis, however, lenders re alized that relying on collateral \ncould leave them with secu rities that they did not wish to hold – or in some cases that they were not \neven legally allowed to hold.4  When large losses on subprime mortgage assets and complex products \namplified uncertainty about the value of collateral, investor s ran – even though they held \ncollateralized positions. \nDespite the lessons provided by the crisis, there re main a variety of financial structures that are \n“capital efficient” from the perspective of market  participants, but in my view continue to be \nsusceptible to strains on short-term funding during times of financial market stress or crisis.   \nI will argue today that one way to address these st ructures is to make them the focus of stress \ntests that result in meaningful decisions about ca pital adequacy. Continuing the structural engineer \nanalogy, the stress tests can be helpful much in the wa y that structural engineer s test the resilience of \ndifferent designs against modeled events like ea rthquakes and storms.  Banking organizations that \nsponsor so-called capital-efficien t structures should conduct stre ss tests that include a focus on \nwhether these structures will require  support during periods of severe market or idiosyncratic stress, \nand what the impact would be on the organization at th at time.  This might lead financial institutions \nto be more attentive to these undercapitalized stru ctures, consistent with institutions focusing on the \namount of capital required to survive stressed conditi ons – rather than the capital needed strictly to \nsatisfy regulatory requirements.   \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, June 29, 2012 at 7:00 A.M. U.S. East ern Time and 1:00 PM in Amsterdam – or Upon Delivery * \n \n \n \n \n 6By using stress tests to identify the possibl e capital and liquidity demands from these \nstructures during a crisis, the institution’s manageme nt, board of directors, and regulators can better \ndetermine the appropriateness of th e structures and the associated capital and liquidity  – and whether \nthese structures are likely to be beneficial to the organization at all times, or only during good times.  \n \n \nMoney Market Mutual Funds Spons ored by Banking Organizations \n  \nAs an example, I want to high light money market mutual fund s ponsors in the United States.  \nSpecifically, I will discuss the possibility of using stress tests to illuminate the impact of various \nscenarios on fund sponsors, many of which are banks or financial institutions.   \nMy primary focus will be on prime  money market mutual f unds, with approximately $1.41 \ntrillion in total assets as of May 31.5  Prime funds invest in a variet y of securities that carry more \ncredit risk than traditional U.S. Treasury securities.6  Money market mutual funds allow investors to \npotentially earn a higher return  on short-term investments in pa rt because – unlike banks – money \nmarket mutual funds are not requir ed to hold capital.  As a result, they often pay a competitive rate \nrelative to bank deposits, and they provide investors many features similar to traditional bank deposits \n– for example, immediate availability of funds as we ll as a fixed net asset value that does not fluctuate \nwhen the value of assets held  by the money fund changes.   \nSo money market mutual funds pr ovide investors with an investme nt vehicle with features like \nbank deposits – but the funds do not hold capital.  Th e problem is that a financial intermediary – \nwhich has no capital, but ta kes credit risk, and provi des under normal circumstances7 immediately \navailable funds at a fixed net asset value – may be inviting trouble. Such a fund can be susceptible if \nthe credit risk of the asse ts it invests in were to rise, causing in vestors to become concerned about the \nfund’s ability to sell its assets, meet redemption demands, and maintain a stable net asset value.  \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, June 29, 2012 at 7:00 A.M. U.S. East ern Time and 1:00 PM in Amsterdam – or Upon Delivery * \n \n \n \n \n 7Consequently, the implicit expect ation of a bank-depos it-like investment can unravel, and the \nincentives to redeem could be strong.  As Figure 1  shows, when the Reserve Primary Fund c ould no longer provide a fixed net asset \nvalue to investors in the wake of  the Lehman Brothers failure, i nvestors ran not only from the Reserve \nPrimary Fund, but also from prime money market mutual funds in general.  The top panel shows the \noutflows in the form of the daily changes in prime f und assets.  It is particul arly easy for investors to \nexit prime money market mutual funds, especi ally when they can easily redeem shares\n8 from a prime \nfund and invest the proceeds in a government-securiti es-only fund, even within the same fund family.   \nAs is clear in Figure 1, the large outflow of f unds from prime money market mutual funds was \naccompanied to a notable degree by an inflow of funds to government-only money market mutual \nfunds.  This is shown in the bottom panel on the figure.   \nWhile the funds may remain in the same fund family with this shift, investors who do not exit \nfrom the prime money market mutual fund could be financially impacted,9 and the prime fund might \nneed to engage in a fire sale of assets to m eet investor demands.  Furthermore, firms counting on \nmoney market mutual funds to pr ovide funding (for example by buying their debt – their commercial \npaper) can suddenly find that th e primary purchasers of their pa per are no longer active in the \nmarket.10   \nFacing all this in 2008, as well as the damage to  credit flows and eventually economic activity \nin general, the U.S. Treasury responded to the run on prime money market mutual funds by providing \ninsurance, and the Federal Reserve created a lendi ng facility designed to pr ovide liquidity to money \nmarket mutual funds.11  Questions remain as to whether s upport could or woul d be possible today, \ngiven changes ushered in by the Dodd-Frank Act. \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, June 29, 2012 at 7:00 A.M. U.S. East ern Time and 1:00 PM in Amsterdam – or Upon Delivery * \n \n \n \n \n 8 Our concerns should be amplified by the f act that many prime f unds are sponsored by \ndepository institutions or their affiliates.  Figure 2  shows the breakdown of prime money market \nmutual funds (by percent of assets and by number of funds) by category of sponsor.  Just under half \nthe assets are held in funds sponsored by an asset manager not affiliated with a depository institution.  \nBut domestic (U.S.) bank holding companies, fore ign bank holding companies, and savings and loan \nholding companies (in other words companies affilia ted with depository institutions) combined serve \nas the sponsoring organizations for a bit more than half the prime fund assets, and more than half of \nthe number of funds.  While SEC regulations restrict the credit risk and maturity risk  of prime money market mutual \nfund investments, these funds nonetheless can and do i nvest in risky assets.  An example is provided \nby the number and value of Dexia obligations held by money market mutual funds at the end of 2010, \nless than one year before the Belgian and Fren ch governments needed to bail out the bank.   \nAs Figure 3 shows, a large number of money market mutual funds with various types of \nsponsors held Dexia paper at the beginning of the year in which Dexia failed.  However, funds \nsponsored by banks or bank affiliates were ove r-weighted relative to funds sponsored by asset \nmanagement firms not affiliated with a bank, both in  the number of funds invested in Dexia and the \nvalue of Dexia assets.   \nParticularly notable is the num ber of foreign-bank-sponsored m oney market mutual funds with \nexposure to Dexia.  While money funds unloaded th eir Dexia holdings before the government bailout, \nthere was a noteworthy willingness to hold the obliga tions of a troubled large financial intermediary \nthat had widely known problems – perhaps becaus e many expected it to r eceive government support \nin the event of distress.  This is similar to wh at happened with the Lehman failure – when such \nexpectations turned out to be quite wrong. \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, June 29, 2012 at 7:00 A.M. U.S. East ern Time and 1:00 PM in Amsterdam – or Upon Delivery * \n \n \n \n \n 9 As recent studies have highlighted, it is quite  common for money market mutual funds that \nhave impaired assets to obtain support from their sponsors.12  Whether this is a cash infusion or a \npurchase at face value of an impaired asset,13 this support can repr esent draws on capital14 at times \nwhen the sponsoring organization is  facing other capital pressures. \nFigure 4  shows support-related losses  by fund sponsors, using data provided by Moody’s and \nbroken down by sponsor type.  Moody’s data capture lo sses attributed to money market mutual funds \nthat are disclosed on the sponsori ng company’s financial statements.15  Note that depository \ninstitution sponsors had significan t losses during 2008, a time when many depository institutions were \nalready facing significant capital  and liquidity pressures.   \nWhile most of the losses were during stressful times, even during non-stressful times there are \nsome losses.  Figure 5  sums the losses recognized over th e five-year period of 2007 to 2011.  The \ndegree of sponsor support is substa ntial.  Support has been quite larg e and particularly prevalent for \nprime money market mutual funds which have depository institution or depository institution \naffiliated sponsors.  Over this period, Moody’s repor ts almost $9 billion in losses associated with \nmoney market mutual funds by depository institution or  depository institution a ffiliated sponsors.     \nThe SEC has been working on reform proposals that would provide several measures to \nreduce the risk of stresses during times of financia l market crisis and provide some capital support.16  \nI am very supportive of the current push within the SEC for additional reforms, which have the \npotential of mitigating many of the concerns I am sharing today.  As the primary regulator of money \nfunds, the SEC is in a position to adopt rules that  would address the vulnerabilities of those funds \nmore comprehensively, effectively, a nd efficiently than other approaches .  However, at this time it is \nunclear what the final proposal wi ll be, or whether the SEC’s fi nal proposal will be adopted.  \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, June 29, 2012 at 7:00 A.M. U.S. East ern Time and 1:00 PM in Amsterdam – or Upon Delivery * \n \n \n \n \n 10In the absence of such reforms for all money market mutual funds , an alternative for funds \nwith depository institution or depository instituti on affiliated sponsors would be to include likely \nmoney market mutual fund support in the sponsor’s  stress tests.  Based on th e historical experience of \ntheir money market funds, the hist orical experience of si milar funds, and their money market funds’ \nexposures, sponsors could calculate the likely capital support needed fr om the organization in a stress \nscenario.   \nAgain, this is an admittedly partial approach, in the absence of more comprehensive reforms \nthat I hope will occur.  But this  approach would at least make more banking organizations more \nresilient (it would not be just money market mutu al fund structures that would need capital – any \nfinancial structure that broke dow n during stress would need more cap ital) but it would also make \nclearer to money market mutual f und investors that banks had capital  that could support funds during \nstressful periods.   It would thus make clear that  money market mutual funds with well capitalized \nsponsors are likely to be less risky than thos e that do not have we ll capitalized sponsors. \nSimilarly, other financial products that circumvent standard cap ital requirements – such as non \n2a-7 “money market like” funds, stable value wr ap products, and asset-backed commercial paper – \ncould lead investors to expect th at the sponsor holds cap ital for the support that  these products could \nneed in times of stress.  While some firms are lik ely to argue they would not provide support for so-\ncalled capital efficient products, the high frequency of support of money market mutual funds and \nother off-balance-sheet items during the crisis makes such claims dubious.   \nIn fact, this support might be encouraged  by regulators during a cr isis, in order to avoid \nbroader problems of financial instab ility.  U.S. banking regulators have17 tacitly acknowledged that \nbank holding companies may provide such supp ort, subject to limitations identified in Figure 6 .18   \n \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, June 29, 2012 at 7:00 A.M.

What we call broker-dealer \nfinancing became particularly problem atic during the financial crisis.  With the failure of Bear Stearns \nand Lehman, it became apparent th at broker-dealers, like traditional de pository institutions, could be \nvulnerable to stresses du ring times of crisis.   \nFor depository institutions , of course, concerns over the potential for runs  have led to \nsignificant regulations to reduce th eir likelihood. During the Great De pression, runs on banks created \nbanking panics that resulted in la rge losses for depositors and a signi ficant reduction in credit – and \nthose difficult episodes led to a vari ety of regulations to make runs  on banks less likely.  The creation \nof deposit insurance reduced the incentive for insu red depositors to run during periods of financial \nstress, and mitigated the sharp reduction in credit av ailability that accompanies large deposit outflows \nfrom banks.  In addition, in the U.S. (and some othe r countries) depository institutions have access to \nthe central bank’s “lender of last resort” cred it facilities, which are intended to provide liquidity  but \nnot protection from insolvency . Deposit insurance and the lender of la st resort function assist banks in \nproviding one of their fundamental services – tr ansforming short-term deposits into longer-term \nassets, since the risk of a sudden need to liquidate  assets to meet unexpected outflows of deposits is \ngreatly diminished. \nBroker-dealers in the United States  have not had the benefit of similar regulatory protections.  \nThey do not typically have access to  central bank lending, and they do not have insurance that reduces \nthe risk of unexpected outflows.  Instead, broker -dealers rely on collatera lized arrangements that \nallow them to be market makers, under the assump tion that wholesale creditors will be comfortable \nproviding funds as long as there is sufficient collateral backing them.  In addition, banks that are part \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, June 29, 2012 at 7:00 A.M. U.S. East ern Time and 1:00 PM in Amsterdam – or Upon Delivery * \n \n \n \n \n 12of larger bank holding companies are subject to Se ction 23 A and B restrictions designed to protect \nthe deposit insurance fund from providing support to non-bank affiliates, including broker-dealers. \nFigure 7  details the direct access that broker-dealer s have to central ba nk credit in various \njurisdictions as well as constraint s to indirect access through affiliate d banks.  It shows the differences \nacross countries in providing liquidity to broker-dealer s from the central bank or from bank affiliates.  \nIn both Switzerland and Japan, broker-dea lers do have access to liquidity f acilities at the central bank.  \nHowever, it is not unusual to place limitations on the ability of bank affiliates to provide liquidity to \ntheir broker dealer affiliates as countries seek to avoid or limit having deposit insurance funds \nexposed to non-bank affiliate activities. \nFigure 8  summarizes the average composition of the balance sheets of large bank holding \ncompanies with high and low concentrations of br oker-dealer activities.  The figure highlights the \nvery different asset-liability mix, on average, of bank holding companies that have sizeable broker-dealer operations compared to those that do not.   A traditional depos itory institution has loans as the \nprimary asset class, and core deposits as the pr imary liability category.  The loans and certain \nsecurities held can serve as collateral for potential disc ount window borrowings, and deposit \ninsurance limits the incentive for insured depositors to run.   \nIn contrast, bank holding companies with a relatively high concentr ation of broker-dealer \nactivity tend to hold more assets th at are liquid and invest in highly marketable securities that can be \nrefinanced through repurchase agreements – si nce broker-dealer operations cannot be funded by \ninsured deposits.  In short, you see greater use of  short-term, non-deposit f unding sources at the bank \nholding companies with high concentr ations of broke r-dealer activity. \nDuring the financial crisis in 2008, the difficu lty in maintaining co llateralized funding \nprompted the introduction of a primary dealer credit facility at the Federal Re serve.  This facility \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, June 29, 2012 at 7:00 A.M. U.S. East ern Time and 1:00 PM in Amsterdam – or Upon Delivery * \n \n \n \n \n 13provided a way for broker-dealers to obtain short-term  funding for their market able securities because \nthey otherwise did not have direct access to the Fed’s discount window.   \nGiven the potential liquidity challenges to broker-dealer financing during periods of great \nstress, many broker-dealers have bo lstered their regulatory capital and adjusted the composition of \ntheir balance sheet.  Figure 9  shows that bank holding companies with large broker-dealer affiliates \nhave been increasing their Tier 1 common equity capital ratios and holding more Tier 1 common \nequity capital than bank holding companies with le ss of a concentration in broker-dealer activities \n(although they have also been increasing th eir Tier 1 common equity capital).  Figure 10  shows that \nthe improvement in capital is less dramatic when usi ng a leverage ratio measur e of capital that does \nnot reflect a shift to lower risk-weighted assets.   \nMarkets are sensitive to the differe nces in these risk profiles.  Figure 11  shows how stock \nprices of bank holding companies were impacted dur ing three elevated stress periods – the fall of \n2008, the fall of 2011, and the first part of this year .  The chart shows that during stress periods, bank \nholding companies with a low concentration in broke r-dealer activities had le ss stock price response \nto the stress periods than instit utions with greater concentratio ns in broker-dealer activities. \nOne way to assess the increased market sensit ivity of bank holding companies might be to \nmodel in stress tests how a sudden shortage of li quidity might impact broker-dealer operations, and \ndetermine the capital implications.  Potentially, broker-dealer s could be structured in such a way that \nliquidity facilities would not be necessary for broker-dealers duri ng times of financial stress.   \nHowever, if a stress test highlights the benefits to those firms of having additional capital or \nmore liquid assets, it should also take into account the costs involve d.  Firms might be less willing to \nmake markets in less liquid assets or might shri nk their balance sheets to meet higher capital \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, June 29, 2012 at 7:00 A.M.

This \narrangement would recognize that, like more traditiona l depositories, broker-dealers are subject to \nilliquidity in markets, and their reaction to that illiquidity can exacerbate the problem.   \nFrom a public policy perspective, the rationale  for promoting market functioning during times \nof stress is that liquidity strain s and other stresses at market ma kers, like the matter of runs on \ndepositories, can have a broader im pact on the overall economy.  However, more analytical work \nneeds to be done to better understand broker-dealer activities during times of stress, as well as the \npotential costs and benefits of alternatives for a ddressing the potential for st resses at broker-dealers.19  \nAt a minimum, stress tests that focus on the behavi or of broker-dealers and their counterparties during \ntimes of stress should be undertaken and their implications well understood. \n \nConcluding Observations \nIn conclusion, I would note that a major innovation that resulted from the financial crisis was \nincreased attention to stress tests.  The stress tests provide an opportunity  for banking organization \nmanagement teams, boards of directors, investors,  and regulators to better understand the impact of \nstressful financial conditions.  Increasing the fo cus of stress tests beyond safety and soundness of \nindividual institutions to more systemic concer ns and implications — such as how markets and \ninstitutions behave during periods  of stress — is an under-research ed area that deserves more \nattention.  These are the relatively early stages of understanding how best to conduct stress tests, and \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, June 29, 2012 at 7:00 A.M. U.S. East ern Time and 1:00 PM in Amsterdam – or Upon Delivery * \n \n \n \n \n 15what the implications of those tests should be for fi nancial institutions.  This is, and will continue to \nbe, an iterative process.   \nI have highlighted two areas where more work need s to be done.  The first is to provide more \nfocus on financial structures that were designed to be  “capital efficient.”  Such structures can be major \nstress points in the financial infrastructure.  Using st ress tests to better unde rstand the implications of \nundercapitalized financial structures will take time, but  needs to be better integrated into frameworks \nfor managing and supervising institutions.  Money ma rket mutual funds with bank or bank affiliated \nsponsors provide one example, especially because  there has been a pattern of support for money \nmarket mutual funds without an e xplicit recognition that such f unds can be a capital drain during \ntimes of stress. \nA second area that deserves more attention is  the behavior and resi lience of broker-dealer \narrangements during times of financial stress.  While the role of depositories a nd their susceptibility to \nruns has received much attention, I believe more  work needs to be done on the implications of \npotential crisis-related stresses at  broker-dealers that do not have access to liquidity facilities.  \nUtilizing stress tests to better unders tand vulnerabilities should help inform us about ways to enhance \nfinancial stability. \nThank you again for inviting me to speak with you today.  I look forward to our continued \nprogress on these important issues of  financial stability – which, as we have learned, can impact the \nreal economy and all its participants.  \n                                                \n \n \nNOTES: \n \n1 In the case of money market mutual funds, the initial mo tivation of the design was to provide investors a way \nto avoid Regulation Q restrictions.

Rosengren \nPresident & Chief Executive Officer \nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston \n  \nAt the Sasin Bangkok Forum \non “Asia in Transformation” \n \n \nJuly 9, 2012 \nBangkok, Thailand \n \n \n \n \n \n \n It is a great pleasure to have been invited to participate in this session on financial crises and \nthe future of global and Asian banking.  I am partic ularly honored to be sh aring the podium with \nProfessor Takatoshi Ito, whose rese arch interests have pa ralleled my own in studying the impact of \nbanking problems in Japan; and Dr. Prasarn Traira tvorakul, Governor of the Bank of Thailand and \nthus a colleague in  central banking.   \nAs always, I should note that the views I expres s today are my own, not necessarily those of \nmy colleagues on the Federal Reserve’s Board of G overnors or the Federal Open Market Committee \n(the FOMC). \n\n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 9:30 p.m. U.S. Eastern Time on Sunday, July 8, 2012 \nand 8:30 a.m. in Bangkok, Thailand on Monday, July 9, 2012 – or Upon Delivery \n \n \n \n 2The important role that financial instituti ons play in macroeconomic stability – or instability –  \nhas been reaffirmed in recent years.  Large gl obal banks amplified economic problems in 2007 and \n2008, and contributed to the pervasiveness and se verity of the recessi on experienced around the \nworld.  Since that time, many banks have taken th e opportunity to improve their capital ratios and \nreduce their risk, and regulators have been focused on achieving a mo re stable financial system, not \njust on supervision of individual institutions.1   \nIndeed, global banks can provide some significant benefits because they are less susceptible to \nlocal economic problems, can introd uce state-of-the-art technology a nd risk management tools, and \nprovide highly competitive rates for firms to finan ce global trade.  Despite enhanced risk-management \nstrategies and the atten tion many global banks have given to improving their financial resilience, \nthese banks still have the potential to adversely impact2 global financial stability and economic \noutcomes – through their capacity to rapidly amplify and transmit significant fi nancial shocks across \nsovereign and continental borders .  So the banks are certainly worthy of the additional study and \nattention they ar e now receiving. \n Today I plan to briefly cover th ree related topics.  First, I w ould like to discuss the economic \noutlook, with particular attention to recent econo mic trends in the United States.  Second, I will \nexamine the interconnectedness of global financial institutions.  Third, I will briefly review how \nintertwined banking markets showed themselves to be in 2007-2008 – with an eye to what we might \nexpect should we experience a significant financ ial shock emanating, for example, from Europe.  \n \nThe Economic Outlook \nBefore talking about these banking issues, I th ink it is important to provide some economic \ncontext to our discussion.  In the U.S., the 2007-2009 recession led to significant excess capacity, \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 9:30 p.m. U.S. Eastern Time on Sunday, July 8, 2012 \nand 8:30 a.m. in Bangkok, Thailand on Monday, July 9, 2012 – or Upon Delivery \n \n \n \n 3particularly in the labor market.  Although the unem ployment rate has declined since it reached its \npeak in October of 2009, significan t excess capacity remains.   \nRecent data from both the United States and China are consistent with a slowdown in \neconomic growth, and it looks like Europe is in  a recession – with some European countries \nexperiencing sharply negative growth.  Based on recent incoming data, many economists have been downgrading their forecasts for the United States.  C onsistent with this trend, members of the Federal \nOpen Market Committee – which sets monetary policy in the United States – recently released (in \nJune) forecasts for the U.S. economy which show deterioration from the April economic forecast.  \nThe projections shown in Figure 1  represent the central tendency of the forecasts provided by \nthe Fed Governors and the Federal Reserve Bank pr esidents.  The three highest and three lowest \nforecasts are dropped to provide th e central tendency.  As the figur e indicates, the central tendency \nhas shifted, and now reflects an e xpectation that economic growth will be positive but quite weak.  \nConsistent with that forecast, the FOMC partic ipants now expect little improvement over the \nremainder of the year in the unemployment rate from  its current level of 8.2 percent.  In terms of \ninflation, the expectation is that personal consumption expenditure (PCE) inflation will be well below \nour target of 2 percent – with lower oil and commodity prices, a stronger dollar, and very subdued \nlabor costs all contributing to the lower inflation estimate. \nDespite this rather gloomy collective forecast, I actually have been more pessimistic than my \ncolleagues.  My forecast for GDP is below the central tendency, my forecast for unemployment is \nabove the central tendency, and my forecast for infla tion is at the bottom of the range of the central \ntendency.  My pessimism is rooted in an expect ation of weakness in investment, net exports, and \ngovernment spending.  That weakness is driven in  part by concerns about economic and financial \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 9:30 p.m. U.S. Eastern Time on Sunday, July 8, 2012 \nand 8:30 a.m. in Bangkok, Thailand on Monday, July 9, 2012 – or Upon Delivery \n \n \n \n 4conditions in Europe, combined with restrained st ate and federal government spending as the U.S. \n(like many other countries) grapples  with large budget deficits.   \nIn particular, my discussions with bankers, e xporters, and business managers indicate more \nrestraint by firms in investing in capital, and in hiring employees, as  the firms wait for some of the \neconomic uncertainty to be resolved.  However, a quick resolution for European sovereign debt \nconcerns and banking problems may remain elusive,3 and the same for the large deficit problems in \nmany countries.  This suggests that slow growth  is likely to continue for quite some time. \nFigure 2  shows business fixed investment in the Un ited States during the most recent four \nquarters.  As you can see, with concerns over Eur ope heating up in the last two quarters, business \nfixed investment has slowed.  Firms have become mo re tentative, which I e xpect will, unfortunately, \ncontinue.  One reason for my pessimism is the recent weakness in orders  for capital goods, for \nexample aircraft. \nIndicating just how weak  employment has been, Figure 3  compares the monthly change in \nU.S. employment during the most re cent and past three recoveries.  As you can see, compared to the \naverage of the last three recoveri es, employment data have come in  quite weak.  Employment growth \nis slower now – in the third year of recovery – than it has been at the sa me point in any of the \nprevious three recoveries.  In fact , just in the past three months em ployment growth in the U.S. has \nslowed fairly noticeably.  Admittedly, the rate of gr owth is just one facet of the employment situation \n– employment-level comparisons are important, and curre ntly sobering.  I will turn  to that a bit later, \nbut for now will just observe that these growth ra te indicators are not a positive sign.  Apparently, \nfirms have become more tenta tive in the face of growing glob al economic uncertainties.  The \nslowdown in employment growth no t only hinders our ability to get to full employment, but also \nweakens the consumer side of the economy even mo re, going forward.  This suggests a self-fulfilling \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 9:30 p.m. U.S. Eastern Time on Sunday, July 8, 2012 \nand 8:30 a.m. in Bangkok, Thailand on Monday, July 9, 2012 – or Upon Delivery \n \n \n \n 5dynamic at work as concern over a potentially si gnificant slowdown in the future reduces current \ngrowth, as firms invest less capital  and hire fewer workers than they  would in the absence of these \nuncertainties. \n \nBanking Interconnectedness \n Given my concerns that economic growth will disappoint, what are the implications for global \nbanking?  I would highlight firs t the high degree of interconn ectedness between and among global \nbanks, particularly among U.S. and European banks.   In New England, where I reside, three of the \nfive largest banks active in the regi on are foreign – from the U.K., Canada, and Spain.  This is not just \na New England feature, as foreign and in particular European banks are very active in both retail and \nwholesale markets throughout the United States.  Figure 4  lists the ten largest foreign banking organi zations in the United States by total U.S. \nassets.  Five are European banks, three are Canadi an, and two are Japanese.  Several of the largest \nbanking organizations have subsidiaries  that have substantial retail franchises in the United States.  In \naddition, the total assets of bran ches and agencies of three of  the banks exceed $100 billion, likely \nindicating very significant “wholes ale” operations, since most branches  and agencies have virtually \nno retail deposit accounts in the United States  because they cannot be FDIC insured.   \nWhile several Japanese banks have  had a significant presence in the United States, their role \nhas diminished over the past 15 years.  And no other Asian banks are among the largest banks \noperating in the U.S.  Figure 5  presents the assets of the ten largest U.S. broker-dealers owned by foreign banking \norganizations.  The chart shows that  European firms have a very significant presence in the United \nStates.  The six largest foreign- owned broker-dealers are all Europ ean, and all have assets over $100 \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 9:30 p.m. U.S. Eastern Time on Sunday, July 8, 2012 \nand 8:30 a.m. in Bangkok, Thailand on Monday, July 9, 2012 – or Upon Delivery \n \n \n \n 6billion.  These foreign-owned br oker-dealers provide a variety of  market-making and underwriting \nactivity.  This means that many European banks ar e highly interconnected w ith the U.S. financial \nsystem.  Again, with the exception of one Japanese bank, the Asian ba nk presence in the U.S. is not \nnearly as significant as the European presence.  Figure 6  plots some broad stock indices for the U. S., Europe, China, and Japan.  The indices \nfor the U.S. and Europe move ve ry closely together throughout th e crisis period – and while they \ncontinue to move closely together , more recently the European index has drifted lower.  In contrast, \nwhile all the stock indices experienced sharp declin es in the fall of 2008, over time the Asian indices \nare generally not as tightly connected with those of the U.S. and Europe. \n Figure 7  plots the 26-week trailing correlation of U. S. and European stock index returns over \nthe last six years.  The chart s hows a very high and consistent co rrelation between the stock indices, \nindicating a very close link between  U.S. and European markets.  Figure 8  plots the 26-week trailing \ncorrelation of the returns of U.S.  and European bank stocks.  They too show a high degree of \ncorrelation, which has remained relatively stable.  Gi ven the close trade and financial ties between the \nU.S. and Europe, this ma y not be surprising.   \nEuropean stocks were badly impacted by the fi nancial shock from the U.S. during the last \nfinancial crisis.  Were there to be a serious fina ncial shock from Europe, th ese correlations suggest it \nis quite likely that it would have a large impact on financial stocks a nd the broader stock market in the \nUnited States.  Such stock price d eclines could impact households a nd businesses on both sides of the \nAtlantic, and problems in Europe  could potentially cause a more  significant retrenchment by \nEuropean financial institutions operating in the United States.\n4 \n \n \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 9:30 p.m. U.S. Eastern Time on Sunday, July 8, 2012 \nand 8:30 a.m. in Bangkok, Thailand on Monday, July 9, 2012 – or Upon Delivery \n \n \n \n 7What about Asia? \n As I mentioned earlier, historic ally Asian banks have not been as integrated with the United \nStates as European banks.  While Asian banks ha ve certainly been impact ed by the global slowdown \nand reduction in international trad e, their lesser degree of interconnectedness compared to European \nbanks means one might not expect to see as tight a link to financial problems emanating from the \nUnited States for Asian banks.    Figures 9 and 10  show the correlations between U.S. large (global) bank stock returns and \nthose of Japan and China.  During the early stages of the financial crisis in 2007, there was a very low \ncorrelation between bank stock returns in the United States and Asia.  Howeve r, that correlation has \nrisen over time, although it still remains below the correlation between U.S.  and European global \nbanks.  Figures 11 and 12  show the correlations between Eur opean bank stock retu rns and those of \nglobal banks in Japan and China.  They also have been rising over time.  Th ese rising stock return \ncorrelations may in part reflect a rising degr ee of interconnectedness between Asian financial \ninstitutions and their U.S. and European  counterparts over the last six years. \n The Bank for International Settlements provides data that highlight w hy the correlations may \nbe increasing.  Figure 13  shows that U.S. and U.K. banks have been increasing their presence in Asia \nand that other European banks ha ve significant exposures as well.\n5,6 \n Turning to exposures to Europe, Figure 14  shows that U.S. banks have increased their claims7 \nin Europe.  This raises the possi bility that the correlation between returns in the U.S. and Europe \ncould be nearly as tight in the event of a European  disruption as they proved to be during the U.S. \nfinancial crisis.  Only Japan and Taiwan currently provide data on foreign clai ms in Europe, but they \nalso are at relatively high levels .  It should be noted that both in  this graph and the previous, the \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 9:30 p.m. U.S. Eastern Time on Sunday, July 8, 2012 \nand 8:30 a.m. in Bangkok, Thailand on Monday, July 9, 2012 – or Upon Delivery \n \n \n \n 8conversion of two investment banks into bank hold ing companies causes a si gnificant break in the \nU.S. series in the first quarter of 2009 – most not iceable on Figure 14 where there is a sharp increase \nin that period.  Nonetheless, ev en after accounting for that break, th e trend is the same, and the level \nof exposure is quite high.  In sum, while Asian banks did not have a hi gh correlation with U.S. and European bank stock \nreturns during 2007 and early 2008, Asian banks are likely to be more impacted now should a \nsignificant shock occur in Europe.  European bank presence in Asia has been rising, and Japan and \nTaiwan have relatively large claims in Europe.\n8  In short, I would say that as interconnectedness \nincreases globally, it will be difficu lt for any one region to insulate itself from financial strains or \ncrises elsewhere in the world.  \nConcluding Observations \n In summary and conclusion, I would note that recent data have been consistent with a \nslowdown in economic activity in ma ny parts of the world.  This likel y reflects a widespread concern \nthat global trade may be disrupted if there is an international fina ncial shock, and that businesses are \npostponing hiring and investment  decisions until the global outlook is more certain. \n While a large financial shoc k would impact the global economy, global banks have the \npotential to amplify that shock.  While Asian glob al banks’ stock returns were not highly correlated \nwith those of U.S. and European global banks in th e last crisis, the correlation has been on the rise \nover the past six years.  Beyond the obvious trade impact if problems were to get worse in Europe, the \nconcern is increased due to fi nancial markets and global banks becoming more interconnected. \n Figure 15  compares employment from its pre-recessi on peak in the U.S., Europe, and Japan.  \nWhile U.S. employment has been gradually increas ing during the recovery, it remains well below the \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 9:30 p.m. U.S. Eastern Time on Sunday, July 8, 2012 \nand 8:30 a.m. in Bangkok, Thailand on Monday, July 9, 2012 – or Upon Delivery \n \n \n \n 9pre-recession peak.  While the declines in Europe a nd Japan were not as dramatic, there has been little \nimprovement overall in the employment situation dur ing the recovery.  Give n global employment and \nfiscal challenges, the global economy remains quite vu lnerable to financial shocks.  This vulnerability \nhighlights why it is particularly important at this  time to reduce the probability, and mitigate the \nseverity, of any potential financial shock.  Thank you again for inviting me to speak with you today.  \n                                                \n \n \nNOTES: \n \n1 That is, macroprudential in addition to just microprudential supervision. \n \n2 And, of course, be impacted by. \n \n3 Encouraging signs did emerge in the last ten days.  As The New York Times  reported, “This week ’s economic summit \namong European leaders has exceeded expe ctations. New ground has been broken  in an agreement that would allow \nEurope’s joint rescue funds to be used to recapitalize struggling banks in European Union member states and that would \nestablish a single bank supervisory mechanism under the European Central Bank.”  June 29, 2012: http://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/30/business/glob al/daily-euro-zone-watch.html?_r=1&ref=world\n \n \n4 Of course, the patterns of exposure in European versus U.S. banks would have an impact on how such a retrenchment \nplayed out.  European banks clearly held mortgage-related assets  and other assets that were sensitive to U.S. disruption.  \nThe degree and manner in which U.S. banks hold assets that  would be sensitive to Europ ean disruption could differ.  \nHowever, later in this talk I discuss correlation and with Figure 14 I note that U.S. claims on  European assets have risen. \n \n5 It also highlights that European banks have larger overall claims in Asia than U.S. banks. \n \n6 Among European countries, the U.K. has been increasing its presence in Asia , while other European countries have \nreduced their presence.  Among European co untries, the U.K. presence is slightly hi gher than that of the rest of Europe \ncombined. \n \n7 Claims include loans, securities holdings, and equity holdi ngs, and reflect the bank’s forei gn exposure to that country.  \nClaims include exposures held in the home  country bank, as well as those held in branches or subsidiaries in the host \ncountry. \n \n8 One major transmission mechanism for a European financial shock would be through contagion associated with the \nassessment of risk in general.  A significant rise in the risk spreads in the U.S. need not be a bank phenomenon (it could \njust be rising common exposures – everyone at risk is increasingly at risk from a global downturn), but it could have large real effects.",

Such outcomes could include  higher unemployment, with  the potential result \nthat high unemployment could become entrenched as a more permanent feature of the \neconomic landscape.1   \nWhat I am highlighting is the importance and appropriateness of taking the  policy \nactions that are necessary to improve economic conditions much more quickly  – so the \nperiod of very slow recovery that we have been experiencing of lat e does not persist and \nbecome a Great Stagnation or in fact a “Great” anything.  \nUnfortunately, the global economy is experiencing a slowdown, and that \nslowdown is one of the significant impediments to faster growth in the domestic economy.  Failure to rea ct to this slowdown would risk a situation where difficult \nconditions prevail for long enough to become “Great” in the economist’s sense.  This \ncould occur if policymakers of all sorts – monetary, fiscal, economic, and financial – were to adopt a stance of only reacting to large negative shocks, while accepting (and \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Thursday, September 20, 2012  at 8:15 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY  * \n \n \n \n 3 declining to act against) a status quo of substantial underutilization of res ources, for an \nextended period of time.   \nThis sort of scenario would be particularly tragic in the job market, and I would \nnote that over the course of this year there has been no meaningful improvement in the \nunacceptably high level of the U.S. unemploym ent rate.  Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke \nhas called this a “grave concern” and I fully agree with him.   \n  Last week the group charged with monetary policymaking in the U.S., the \nFOMC, took additional monetary policy actions  to promote faster economic growth.  I \nfully support the policy actions.  Let me say a bit about them.  First, the FOMC noted that it anticipates that low short- term rates are likely to be warranted at least  through mid-\n2015.  This guidance makes clear that monetary policy will remain accomm odative for a \nconsiderable time , likely even after labor markets improve from their current subdued \nstate, in order to promote a robust and sustainable recovery.   \nSecond, given the desire to increase policy accommodation even while the \ntraditional policy instrument (the federal funds rate) is at the zero lower bound, the FOMC announced plans to buy $40 billion worth of mortgage -backed securities a month \n– until such time as there is substantial ongoing improvement in labor markets.  The more open- ended nat ure of the action – i ntending to c ontinue such purchases until labor \nmarkets have improved  – is an important change.  Of course , the Fed will do so in the \ncontext of price stability (which is the other half of the Fed’s “dual mandate,” along with maximum s ustainable employment)  – and hand in hand with a careful  ongoing \nassessment of the program’s costs and efficacy .   \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Thursday, September 20, 2012  at 8:15 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY  * \n \n \n \n 4 Of course policy actions such as these are unconventional, and do entail risks.  \nHowever, in my view the risks involved in pursuing these pol icies are considerably \nsmaller and more manageable than the risk of allowing the economy to stagnate for \nanother year  or more .   \nThe U.S. has seen a series of “false starts” during this recovery.  After earlier \nperiods of policy accommodation the economy h as improved, but that improvement has \nnot been sustained.  These false starts have been interrupted by both natural and man-made disasters, here and abroad.  As a consequence of these interruptions, the recovery has been painfully slow by historical standa rds – resulting in our current highly -elevated \nunemployment rate and  an inflation rate  below our objective .   \nAbsent further policy action, most economists expect several more years of weak \nlabor markets and low inflation.  As a consequence, it was time for the Fed to announce  \nstimulus that will continue until the U.S. achieves both faster economic growth and lower unemployment, no matter the unanticipated interruptions.   \nToday I would like to walk through my analysis of the economic situation in more \ndetail.   In doing so I hope it will become clear why I have strongly supported the kind of \nforceful  action that the FOMC took last week.  In my view, these policies are essential to \nachieving a strong sustainable recovery that is resilient , despite the inevita ble disruptions.  \nLet me add that I am  only discussing monetary policy, not fiscal policy , since fiscal \npolicy, though powerful , is not  in the Fed’s jurisdiction. \n \n  \n \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Thursday, September 20, 2012  at 8:15 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY  * \n \n \n \n 5 Avoiding a Stagnation  \nFigure 1 provides a powerful real -world example of the potential for a Great \nStagnation – the experience of Japan after their financial crisis, which began in 1990.  \nWhile this period is sometimes called the “Lost Decade,” that is actually a misnomer – since the period of stagnant growth has lasted over two  decades.   \nThere are many factors contributing to a Great Stagnation in Japan, including a \nvery slow realization of the need to recapitalize banks, and a population whose average age is rapidly rising (w hich changes the composition of economic activity in a country) , \nand a substantial slowdown in population growth.  Still, it is striking that there was a dramatic change in the growth of real  GDP  in Japan  coinciding with the start of their \nfinancial crisis .\n2  The muted policy response to the slower growth that began during the \nfinancial crisis is partly responsible for the fact that Japanese growth never returned to its pre-crisis rate, or to where output would have been had the crisis not occurred (the pat h \nillustrated by the trend line, based on growth over the 1980- 1990 period).  \nFigure 2 shows the level of U.S. GDP since 1980.  Note that we too have a \nnoticeable break in the growth rate of GDP at the advent of the recent financial crisis.  However, unlike  the Japanese, it appears that we have resumed the pre -crisis growth rate.  \nBut we have not returned the economy back to its original growth path, the only time w e \nhave failed to do so in all ten of our other post -war recessions – including the severe \nrecession in 1982.   \nFailing to return quickly to the original trend line is much more serious than a \ngraph can convey.  It implies a significant cumulative loss in goods and services that should have been produced (measured as the sum of the difference betwee n those two \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Thursday, September 20, 2012  at 8:15 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY  * \n \n \n \n 6 lines), which in turn implies a significant shortfall in employment relative to full \nemployment.   \nAs a result, the goal of monetary and fiscal policy should be to return the \neconomy back to the original trend line.  This means getting faster t han normal growth \nuntil resources are once again fully utilized.  A risk in not doing so is that we permanently reduce our trend growth rate, which is what appears to have happened in Japan.  \n \nCauses of Slow Growth in the United States  \nExploring in detail the many possible causes  of slow growth in the current \neconomy is beyond the scope of this talk.  But let me just highlight some important \nfactors .  Figure 3 shows, and compares, the growth rates of real GDP and real GDP \nexcluding resid ential investment (housing) and government spending.  As the chart \nshows, there is a notable difference in the growth rates.  While real GDP has grown only by 2.21 percent, real GDP excluding housing and government spending grew by 2.45 percent.  Had the e conomy not had the headwinds from government and housing \ndragging growth lower – had it grown just by that higher rate of 2.45 percent over the \nthree years of the recovery – outcomes would be somewhat  better .  However, normally a \nsector like housing would be expected to grow much more quickly than other sectors of the economy in the early stages of a recovery – given housing's interest -rate sensitivity – \nand thus we would expect it to provide more impetus to ove rall economic growth. \n To consider the role of housing a bit more, Figure 4 shows housing starts from \n2000 onward.  The decline in housing starts is striking, and unlike in most other \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Thursday, September 20, 2012  at 8:15 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY  * \n \n \n \n 7 recoveries the housing sector did not participate in the initial stages of the current \nrecovery – although there has been some improvement recently.   \nHowever , I think there are some reasons to believe the recent  nascent signs of a \nhousing recovery  might be durable .  Since the onset of the housing bust the population \nhas grown and per capita income has grown, while interest rates are very low and prices are more affordable.  These are all positives when it comes to having potential buyers \nready to purchase homes.   \nThese circumstances make it an important time for policymakers to consider \nadditional stimulus to the housing market to finally induce progress.  Consider the market psychology: if home buyers feel that house prices are on the rise (as many indicators suggest), and that mortgage rates will only remain this low tempora rily, we could see new \nhome buyers come off the sidelines and commit to purchase new homes before rates rise and before  house prices rise further  than they have . \nAlso, Figure 5 shows growth in state and local government spending since 2000 \nand highlights t hat it has been unusually weak in this recovery.   This is, in large part, a \nresult of state and local governments pulling back in response to greatly diminished revenues – a direct consequence of the depth of the recession and the weakness of the \nrecovery .  Many states were prepared for a revenue shortfall, having  accumulated “rainy \nday” funds, but the long downturn sapped those funds.  Since nationally, the sum of state and local government spending is larger than federal spending\n3, the net impact has bee n \nthat government -sector spending has been a significant drag on growth during the \nrecovery.  \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Thursday, September 20, 2012  at 8:15 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY  * \n \n \n \n 8 Figure 6 highlights another force dragging on the U.S. recovery, the global \neconomic slowdown.  Many advanced economies experienced a deeper recession (as \nmeasured  by output) than did the United States, and countries such as the U.K., France, \nand Japan have real GDP levels indexed below where they were at the end of 2007, an even weaker rebound than in the United States.  Furthermore, in the last several quarters several of the advanced economies in Europe have actually been in decline as they have \nslashed their government spending.  \n \nCosts of a Slow Recovery \nA slow recovery can have significant costs.  Allow me to show you some charts \nthat are compelling – acknowledg ing, of course, that charts cannot convey the human toll \nof the situation they depict.  \nFigure 7 shows the ratio of employment to population, which has remained very \nflat during the recovery.  This is consistent with the growth in GDP being only about 2 percent – which is enough to keep up with the growth in productivity and the labor force \nbut not leading to the employment of a larger percent of the population.  By the way, while there have been some demographic shifts within the workforce  that might explain \nsome decline in the employment -to-population ratio, they do not  explain the trend  in \nFigure 7 ; indeed, a very similar pattern emerges when looking at the employment -to-\npopulation ratio for particular age groups.  \nFigure 8 shows one of th e painful and unusual features of this recession and \nrecovery, the very elevated percentage of the unemployed who  have been out of work for \nmore than six months.  Unlike the deep recession in 1982, in which there was a quick \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Thursday, September 20, 2012  at 8:15 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY  * \n \n \n \n 9 recovery and as a result a relatively small and short -lived increase in long -duration \nunemployment, the last recession and long, weak recovery  have resulted in substantially \nmore people suffering long spells of unemployment.  Long periods of unemployment \nfrequently deplete the savings of the unemployed, make re -employ ment harde r (as \nemployers may be tentative about hiring those who have been unemployed for long periods of time), and may lead to skills becoming less than current.  These problems highlight why it is important to generate f aster growth to avoid what some call labor \nmarket “scarring” – where long -duration unemployment becomes ingrained into our labor \nmarket.  \n \nWhat Should Monetary Policy makers  Do?  \nThe Great Stagnation in Japan did lead to a monetary policy response from the \nJapanese central bank.  The Bank of Japan eased rates until they hit the zero lower bound, \nand then as Figure 9 shows, began to gradually expand the assets of the central bank.    \nHowever, there were key differences from the policy actions we have taken at t he \nFederal Reserve.  The Bank of Japan only gradually expanded the assets on its balance sheet, and only after a delay of a number of years.  Many of its purchases were of short -\nterm securities, which had little impact on already -low short -term rates.  Thi s is in \ncontrast to the impact that the U.S. Federal Reserve’s purchases of longer -duration assets \nhave had on longer -term rates, which remain well above zero and thus have room to \ndecline.   \nFinally, the Japanese central bank may in my view have premature ly stopped the \ngrowth in their balance sheet, considering the weakness in the Japanese economy at the \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Thursday, September 20, 2012  at 8:15 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY  * \n \n \n \n 10 time.  As a result, the Japanese economy has remained stagnant and despite having an \nexpanded balance sheet for an extended period, the Japanese continue to struggle with a deflation problem rather than an inflation problem, as the bottom chart on Figure 9 shows. \nTurning to the U.S., the differences in policy are quite striking.  There was a rapid \nexpansion of the Fed’s balance sheet (see Figure 10) , as wel l as a fiscal stimulus.  This \nmay be why we have not experienced a significant decline in the trend  growth rate in the \neconomy, seen in an earlier chart.  There has also been a focus on bringing long- term \ninterest rates down, and more recently on utilizing  monetary policy communication \nstrategies to convey that rates will likely remain low until the recovery and labor markets show a more sustained improvement.   \nTo reiterate, a key difference is that we didn’t hesitate (by years) to take \nsignificant actions  in the U.S.  And when we took actions, they were forceful .  And going \nforward, we also don’t want to make the mistake of retreating  at the first, early signs of \nimprovement.  Japan’s experience suggests one must continue until improvement is sustainable and will persist.  \nHowever, despite these differences there is an important similarity between our \nsituation and Japan’s, as well.  Just as Japan has not experienced inflation despite a rapid expansion of their balance sheet, our measure of inflation (the pe rsonal consumption \nexpenditure deflator) is currently only 1.3 percent through July despite our balance sheet \nexpanding significantly four years ago (see the bottom chart on Figure 10 ).   \n  \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Thursday, September 20, 2012  at 8:15 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY  * \n \n \n \n 11 Recent Actions  \n Last Thursday the FOMC announced several new policies, summarized in the \nnext two slides.  The Fed announced a number of important policy changes.   \nFirst, in addition to exchanging  (as previously announced) $45 billion of short -\nterm Treasury securities for an equal amount of  long -term Treasury  bonds through the \nmaturity extension program running through December, the Fed will purchase $40 billion \na month in agency mortgage backed securities (MBS).  These purchases of MB S should \nplace downward pressure on U.S. mortgage rates, which should support the housing \nmarket by lowering borrowing costs and providing additional support for house -prices to \nappreciat e from depressed levels.  The housing market should be stronger than if these \nactions were not taken.  \nSecond, the purchases of agency MBS will likely affect the yields on other, \nsimilar long -term assets, such as Treasury bonds and corporate bonds.  Bonds of similar \nmaturity, duration and risk characteristics are viewed as s ubstitutes for MBS by many \ninvestors.  Removing some of the MBS from private circulation will create a scarcity of long-maturity, lower -risk securities.  This shortage will lower both MBS and other long-\nterm interest rates in the marketplace, with effects that are qualitatively similar to the effects we have when we lower the federal funds rate (something we cannot do now, as it is at the zero lower bound).  As a consequence, our policy will have effects on a broad array of economic activity beyond the dire ct effects on residential investment.  \n Third, I would note that the plan to purchase MBS securities is open- ended.  As \nthe FOMC indicated in its statement last week, the MBS purchases and potentially the use of other tools will continue until there has bee n improvement in labor markets.  This \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Thursday, September 20, 2012  at 8:15 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY  * \n \n \n \n 12 means the policy actions are being conditioned on an economic outcome  rather than a set \ntimeframe .  This should provide market participants confidence that the Federal Reserve \nwill do what it takes to improve economic outcomes.  \n Fourth, highly accommodative policy will continue for a considerable time after \nthe economic recovery strengthens.  This means that we will ensure the economy is truly \nstrengthening before raising interest rates.   Highly accommodative policy  is currently \nlikely to be warranted at least through mid -2015.   \n \nThe Initial Impact of P olicy  Actions  \nThe table shown in Figure 11 provides some estimates of the financial impacts of \nthe Fed’s recent policy announcement.  Such impacts are difficult to measur e with any \nprecision, given anticipation about our possible actions built into markets, and the reality \nthat other events can occur coincident with the action.   \nStill, for reference the first column provides the financial market response when \nthe FOMC ann ouncement was made.  The second column extends the period to Thursday \nand Friday as financial market participants had more time to analyze the policy change and Chairman Bernanke’s press conference explaining the announcement.  The third column begins the financial response at the Chairman’s August speech at the Jackson \nHole conference, which was widely viewed as increasing the likelihood of a more forceful  easing, though the specifics were not known.  The final column dates the event \nfrom the prior FOMC me eting, when most observers interpreted the statement as making \nfurther forceful  action more likely.  \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Thursday, September 20, 2012  at 8:15 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY  * \n \n \n \n 13 While this table shows a range of impacts, I would say in sum that regardless of \nthe event window chosen, stock prices are up substantially, mortgage rates are lower, and \nexchange rates are lower.  On the latter I would point out that our efforts to lower long \nrates are focused on stimulating domestic demand, but at the same time lower long -term \nrates affect demand for U.S. assets , resulting in a modest chang e in the exchange rate – \nand this is likely to provide some support for export -oriented industries.   \nAll of these impacts are  very consistent with what we would expect of the \nmonetary transmission “channels” of purchasing mortgage backed securities and providing additional forward guidance on policy.  In fact, they are  also quite consistent \nwith the transmission channel that we expect when conducting “normal”  – i.e. federal \nfunds rate  – monetary policy when we are not constrained by the zero lower bound. \n  \nConcluding Observations  \n In sum , the actions taken by the Federal Reserve last week provide significant \nadditional support to the economic recovery.  They should result in stronger economic growth, and return us to full employment more quickly than would be the case absent the policies.  \n   However, monetary policy is not a panacea.  Appropriate fiscal policies \ndomestically , and improvement in the global economy could both provide significant \npositive effects, and shorten the time needed for unconventional monetary policy actions like those we have announced.  In addition, it is important to note that significant fiscal policy mistakes, such as an unlikely failure to address the looming “fiscal cliff” in the \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Thursday, September 20, 2012  at 8:15 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY  * \n \n \n \n 14 U.S., would have effects on economic growth that w ould be difficult to fully offset with \nmonetary policy.   \nIt is my firm belief that the monetary policy actions taken last week should \ncontribute to a faster economic recovery and a more rapid improvement in labor markets \nthan we would have seen in the ir absence.  However, I want to be careful not to appear to \npromise too much, as there are limits to the effects of monetary policy.  Even with these actions, and assuming no additional negative shocks domestically or internationally, it will still be several years before we are likely to return to full employment.   \nWhile that is not an especially upbeat sentiment on which to end my remarks, I \nthink it underlines the importance of our taking action.  A very challenging economic climate confronts us all, but I am very pleased that monetary policymakers in the U.S. are proving willing to take difficult actions like these rather than accept the possibility of a long, slow recovery turning into a stagnation that someday earns the dubious title of “Great .”  Japan’s experience is a sobering real -world reminder of why forceful  and timely \naction is appropriate.   \nThank you.  \n \n                                                 \n \n1 Recent examples of a Great Stagnation include Japan, as I will discuss in this talk, and the dynamic in \nsome European countries that experience high rates of unemployment and lagging job creation even during \nperiods of growth –  a dynamic that some associate with unaffordable social benefit policies and that in \nsome corners is given the moniker “Eurosclerosis.”  \n \n2 I would note that demog raphic changes occurring in Japan include a gradually shrinking domestic \nworkforce.  But I see this as a gradual change that would not explain the abrupt change in the growth- path \nline shown in the chart around the time of Japan’s financial crisis.  \n \n3 State and local government accounted for 63  percent  of government spending on average over the period \n2000- 2011.",

Rosengren  \nPresident & Chief Executive Officer  \nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston  \n  \nThe Community Development Advisory Council’s 2012 \nRegional Convening  \n  \nLawrence, Massachusetts  \nSeptember 24 , 2012 \n \n \n \n \nGood morning and thank you for being part of this conference focused on New \nEngland’s mid -sized cities.  The issues and opportunities facing these cities have \nprobably not received enough attention from the full spectrum of policymakers.  Today’s conference highlights some topics on which the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston plans to focus over the next several years.   \nToday I would like to summarize just why it is so important that there be \nincreased attention to mid -sized cities.  Allow me to give you a short preview and then \ncover these points in a bit more detail, and with a close look at some key data. \n\n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Monday, September 24, 2012  at 10:20 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY * \n 2 As always,  I would add that the views I express today are my own, not necessarily \nthose of my colleagues on the Board of Governors or the Federal Open Market \nCommittee (the FOMC).  \nI first want to describe the importance of these cities.   New England’s mid -sized \ncities – with populations between 75,000 and 200,000 people  – taken together have a \npopulation roughly similar to that of G reater Boston ,1 which represent s New England’s \nlargest and most economically vibrant urban area .   \nHowever, the mid- sized cities differ in important ways from Boston .  They have \nnot seen the same degree of economic vibrancy as residents in G reater Boston , but they \ndo encompass an important source of future growth, in a couple of ways.  One, they \nfrequently serve as an entry point for new immigrants, and two, they have on average a younger population than the rest of New England. \nSecond, I want to highlight today the recent economic trends in these cities.  \nCertainly these cities have struggled over the past several decades .  Their manufacturing \nbase has shrunk, and many have yet to replace lost jobs with new and innovative sectors.  \nAs more middle -class families have moved away, these ci ties face greater challenges in \nhelping their residents acquire the skills and job market opportunities they need to escape from poverty.  While all of these mid -sized cities have struggled and continue to struggle \nto overcome serious obstacles, the economic data indicate that some have done better than others in turning around their economies.  It is this revitalization – relative \nresurgence (using indicators such as median family income, poverty rates, and population growth) – that we all want to see replicated in those cities that are having difficulties \nreengineering themselves.  \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Monday, September 24, 2012  at 10:20 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY * \n 3 Finally I want to emphasize that  I think these cities can ind eed become resurgent \ncities.  The Boston Federal Reserve Bank staff has done some thoughtful research in this \narea, and has been actively engaged with people like you, in this room, to consider how \nto generate more revitalization  in cities in New England.  This conference and our future \nwork in this area will, we hope, be of assistance.  At the Bank we will continue to look at \nways that we can help – through quantitative and qualitative research, outreach, \ninformation gathering and dissemination, and our ability to convene stakeholders.  I hope that together with people like you, gathered here today , we can see more concentrated \nfocus on New England’s mid- sized cities, and more achievement.  \n \nThe Importance of Mid -Sized Cities  \nLet me say a bit more about the importance of mid- sized cities.  Figure 1 tells us \nabout the aggregate population of the New England’s mid- sized cities compared to the \nregion as a whole and to Greater Boston .  The cities between 75,000 and 200,000 people\n2 \nhave, taken together,  an aggregate population of 2.2 million people – just a little smaller  \nthan the 2.3 million people living in the greater Boston area.  So, taken together, roughly a third of all New Englanders  (about 4.5 million people) live in either the G reater Boston \nmetropolitan area or in one of New England’s mid- sized cities.  \nIn Massachusetts, legislation defined “ gateway cities ” as those between 35,000 \nand 250,000 people that also fall below the statewide average for income and education .\n3  \nThese 24 cities as a group account for 1.7 million people.  Together, the population in the Greater Boston metropolitan area plus the gateway cities account for  almost two -thirds of \nthe population of Massachusetts. \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Monday, September 24, 2012  at 10:20 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY * \n 4 Figure 2 shows that for New England and Massachusetts, the mid-sized cities are \na major entry point for foreign-born residents.  While only about 13 percent of the U.S. \npopulation is foreign-born, New England as a whole has an even lower share of  foreign-\nborn residents (only about 12 percent).  However, when looking at New England mid-sized cities  and the Massachusetts gateway cities, much greater shares of residents are \nforeign-born – about 21 percent, or more than one in five residents.  In a region of the \ncountry experiencing relat ively slow population growth, immigrants are an important \npotential source of growth in the supply of labor.   \n   Figure 3 shows that these cities have populations that are on net younger than the \nstate and region.  The figure shows the shares of the population below 15 years of age and 65 years of age and older.  For Massachusetts and New England around 18 percent of the population is below 15 years of age , but New England’s mid- sized cities and \nMassachusetts  gateway cities have a bit larger share of their  population under 15 years of \nage.  The mid-sized cities also have a somewhat lower percent age of their  population \nover 65 years of age relative to New England  as a whole, and the same is true for the \ngateway cities relative to  Massachusetts . \nThe younger overall population and the influx of foreign-born residents into our \nregion’s mid -sized cities can be an important source of potential economic growth.  \nHowever, there are some significant impediments to these resources being fully utilized, and that will i mpact whether these mid -sized cities prosper and become sources of \nstrength in the regional economy.  For example, F igure 4 shows differences in poverty rates.  New England’s mid-\nsized cities have a much higher percentage of the population in poverty compa red to New \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Monday, September 24, 2012  at 10:20 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY * \n 5 England more generally.   The picture is similar in Massachusetts: the gateway cities have \nmuch higher rates of poverty than the state as a whole.   These higher poverty rates are a \nserious impediment if they reflect, or perpetuate, residents of m id-sized cities being less \nlikely to obtain the skills necessary to be gainfully employed in today’s economy. \n To that end, Figure 5 shows that educational attainment varies greatly across the region.  While New England and Massachusetts have much higher educational attainment \nthan the rest of the country, that educational attainment is uneven across the region.  While 46 percent of the population in Greater Boston\n4 has a bachelor’s degree or above, \nthe mid-sized cities in New England have a much lower 24.5 percent of their population \nwith a bachelor’s degree or above. The figure is even lower for the Massachusetts gateway cities , which have only 22.7 percent of the population with a bachelor’s degree \nor above – less than half the rate of the Greater Boston  area. \n If mid-sized cities are to serve as a potential source of growth for New England’s \neconomy, it is important that the work force be able to acquire the skills and opportunities necessary to succeed.  Work force development efforts, and initiatives that provide strong educational opportunities for all residents of our mid -sized cities  – including new \nimmigrants  and their children – are likely to be a key necessity if these cities are to \nflourish.  \nResurgent cities  \n In recent research  covering not only New England, but also the mid-Atlantic, \nMidwest, and upper South, my Boston Fed colleagues Yolanda Kodrzycki and Ana \nPatricia Mu ñoz have worked to identify key factors that set cities apart – i n particular, \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Monday, September 24, 2012  at 10:20 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY * \n 6 what factors make some cities relatively resurgent while other cities do not make similar  \nimprovements. \n Their research shows that even the relatively resurgent cities (those cities that \noutperformed their peers) have had difficulty improving at the same rate as the country as a whole.  Figure 6  reflects median family income in the resurgent cities and in other \ncities,\n5 as a share of U.S. median family income, over  the last 50 years or so.  While the \nmedian family income in cities that were not considered resurgent was only a little above \n60 percent of the median family income of the nation – and declining – the median family \nincome in the relatively  resurgent cities was a little above 80 percent of the median \nfamily income of the nation, and  still declinin g although at a lower rate.  This highlights \nsome of the challenges facing even the cities that are making progress.  \n Figure 7 shows that educational attainment does seem to be a key factor.  Educational attainment was significantly better in the resurgent cities than in those cities \nthat were not considered resurgent.\n6 \n Separately, I would note that many of New England’s mid- sized cities are along \ncoasts.  This provides certain opportunities to the extent that they have port facilities, but \nalso provides opportunities to attract tourists and new residents.  Both Providence and \nNew Haven show stronger growth in median household income relative to the U.S. than \nother mid -sized cities  since 2000, as Figure 8 shows.   \nProvidence, New Haven, and Worcester  were the three New England cities \nclassified as resurgent by Kodrzycki and Muñ oz.  These three cities all have a strong \nacademic presence in the ir cities, as well as serving as major medical centers . \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Monday, September 24, 2012  at 10:20 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY * \n 7 Indeed, I would note that many of these mid -sized citie s, including many that are \nnot yet resurgent, are at the crossroads of transportation hubs, or have become regional \nmedical centers, or have educational institutions as “anchor tenants” in their cities.  Many \nmid-sized cities have not yet fully leveraged  these potential attributes to attract industries \nand promote growth.  Increasingly, medical centers and universities have been shown to \nbe potential development hubs.  Worcester has benefited from its focus on the life sciences.  Cities with colleges and universities that find ways to use those resources to \nfoster development are likely to be among the cities that better succeed over time.  \n \nThe “Soft er Side ” of Development  \nOne of the interesting findings in the work of I mentioned by Yolanda Kodrzycki \nand Ana Patricia Muñoz is that one of the main characteristics of  the resurgent cities is \nthe presence of  collaborative civic leadership.  Whether catalyzed by leaders in the \nprivate sector, public sector, or non- profit sector, it seems that the resurgent citi es have \ndeveloped a vision for progress that has the shared support of the entire community and a \nvariety of leaders . \nFrequently the cities that have lost important sectors of employment – for \nexample the loss of manufacturing jobs in many New England citi es – also lose some of \nthe cohesion in their communities.  C haritable and civic organizations benefit from \ncompanies contributing to leadership in the community, so t he loss of major firms when a \nsector declines is anything but positive.  Civic  cohesion  and collaboration across political \nlines can also be impacted.  And c hanging demographics in cities can make it more \nchallenging  – but no less important – to achieve effective collaboration.   \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Monday, September 24, 2012  at 10:20 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY * \n 8 Clearly, a collaborative vision for a community cannot be imposed from the \noutside.  It requires residents to engage and find ways to leverage the city’s positive \nattributes for the benefit of all citizens.   \nWe hope that this conference serves as a basis  for more positive work in this area.  \nLet me bring up Figure 9 , which lists the cities I have been speaking about this morning.  \nWe expect that the mid-sized city issues I’ve touched on will be a focus of our \ncommunity outreach over the next several years, with a particular attention on \ncollaborative civic leadership .  I look forward to hearing the ideas of participants, and the \nsuggestions you have on how the Boston Fed can help.   \nTogether and with a lot of thoughtful, persistent work I am certain we can build \non the strengths and resources in our region’s mid -sized cities, to see their more rapid \ndevelopment. \nThank you.  \n   \n                                                 \n \n1 Greater Boston is defined as the group of 75 cities and towns identified by the University of \nMassachusetts’ Donahue Institute along and inside the I -495 corridor and cited as the “Greater Boston \nKnowledge Core” in the MassInc/Brookings Institute study “Reconnecting Massachusetts Gateway Cities:  \nLessons Learned and an Agenda for Renewal.”  To calculate the population shares, six cities categorized among the 24 Gateway cities as def ined by the Massachusetts State Legislature (Chelsea, Everett, Lynn, \nMalden, Quincy and Revere), were excluded from the group.  \n \n2 Different parties use different definitions for smaller cities, gateway cities, and mid -sized cities.  We \ndefine mid -sized cities in New England as those with a population ranging from 75,000 to 250,000, \nexcluding “suburb cities” of Boston – specifically, Bridgeport, CT; Danbury, CT; Hartford, CT; New \nHaven, CT; Norwalk, CT; Stamford, CT; Waterbury, CT; Brockton, MA; Fall River, MA; Lawrence, MA; \nLowell, MA; Lynn, MA; New Bedford, MA; Springfield, MA; Worcester, MA; Manchester, NH; Nashua, NH; Cranston, RI; Providence, RI; and Warwick, RI.  \n \n3The 24 gateway cities include Barnstable, Brockton, Chelsea, Chicopee, Everett, Fall River , Fitchburg, \nHaverhill, Holyoke, Lawrence, Leominster, Lowell, Lynn, Malden, Methuen, New Bedford, Pittsfield, Quincy, Revere, Salem, Springfield,  Taunton, Westfield, and Worcester.   Median income measures and \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Monday, September 24, 2012  at 10:20 A.M.

Specifically a g ateway municipality is defined as “ a municipality with a population \ngreater than 35,000 and less than 250,000, a median household income below the C ommonwealth’s \naverage and a rate of educational attainment of a bachelor’s degree or above that is below the \nCommonwealth’s average.” \n \n4 This calculation is based on data for Greater Boston cities and towns with population of 20,000 or more as \nthree-year American Community  Survey estimates are only available for cities and towns with population \nof 20,000 or more.  \n  \n5 The resurgent cities include Evansville, IN; Fort Wayne, IN; Grand Rapids, MI; Greensboro, NC; Jersey \nCity, NJ; New Haven, CT; Peoria, IL; Providence, RI; Winston -Salem, NC; and Worcester, MA.  The other \ncities include Akron, OH; Allentown, PA; Bridgeport, CT; Dayton, OH; Erie, PA; Flint, MI;  Gary, IN; \nHartford, CT; Paterson, NJ; Rochester, NY; Rockford, IL; South Bend, IN; Springfield, MA; Syracuse, NY; Waterbury, CT; and Youngstown, OH.  \n \n6 While some of the college attainment may have to do with attracting new college educated residents, the \nhigh school attainment figure in particular demonstrates consistent local improvement in education.",

Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *  \n 1 \n \n \n“The Economic Outlook and \nUnconventional Monetary Policy”  \n \n \nEric S. Rosengren \nPresident & Chief Executive Officer \nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston \n \n \nBabson College’s \nStephen D. Cutler Center  \nfor Investments and Finance \n \n \nWellesley, Massachusetts  \nNovember 1, 2012 \n \n \n \n \n I’m very pleased to be with you today at Babson, a school known for doing a great job of preparing gra duates to face the challenges of the economic landscape.  \nRegardless of your area of concentration at Babson, the outlook for the economy is \nrelevant to your studies and, of course , your pursuit of future employment.   \n This year and last, we all experienced  real-life frights around Halloween, thanks \nto severe and unusual storms.  I’m happy that  Hurricane Sandy did not prevent us from \ngetting together today at Ba bson, but I know our thoughts are with those in our region \n\n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Thursday, November 1, 2012 at 5: 10 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *  \n 2and down the Eastern Seaboard who were so significantly affected by the storm – and \nwho continue the clean-up and recovery process. \n Today I plan to highlight three main points about the economic outlook.  I always \nlike to emphasize that my remarks represen t my views, not nece ssarily those of my \ncolleagues on the Federal Open Market Co mmittee or at the Board of Governors. \n A first point is this: while it is still ea rly to gauge the full impact of the Federal \nReserve’s September monetary policy co mmittee decision to begin an open-ended \nmortgage-backed security purchase program,1 the program has so far worked as expected.  \nThe initial response in financial markets was la rger than many expected.   Given that our \nconventional monetary tool, the fed funds ra te, has hit its lower bound of zero, we have \nturned to unconventional monetary policy.  By that I mean policy that attempts to affect \nlong-term interest rates directly, via asset purchases,2 rather than indir ectly by setting the \nshort -term interest rate, as in  conventional policy.   \nUnconventional policy has affected fina ncial markets much like movements of \nconventional policy would have.  Our use of unconventional policy tools has led to lower \nlonger-term interest rates; hi gher equity prices; an d, in a peripheral by-product of lower \nU.S. rates, exchange-rate effects.  \nBy further easing financial conditions, th e Fed’s actions appear to be providing \nadditional stimulus to the household sector – as witnessed recently by higher consumer \nconfidence, and increases in purchases of in terest-sensitive items such as new homes and \ncars.  Certainly, concerns about such issues as  the looming “fiscal cliff” in the U.S. and \nslow growth in many developed countries do appear to be depressing business spending.  \nStill, our actions are likely to spur faster economic grow th than we would have had \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Thursday, November 1, 2012 at 5: 10 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *  \n 3without this additional stimulus – and, as you know, economic growth has been painfully \nslow.  My second point is that th e increased quantity of bank re serves that resulted from \nthese unconventional monetary po licy actions have not resulted  in inflation  above our 2 \npercent target.  If you look over a longer period such as from 2000 to the present, total \nPCE\n3 inflation has averaged 2.2 percent and core PCE inflation4 has averaged 1.9 percent \n– in either case very close to the 2 percent ta rget announced at the beginning of this year.  \nThe fact that we continue to undershoot our  inflation target while unemployment remains \nhigh is, in my view, a very strong rationa le for maintaining a highly accommodative \nstance for monetary policy.  My third point is that in addition to st able prices, the Federal Reserve is charged \nwith attaining maximum sustainabl e employment – what we call our dual mandate, and \nthis has implications for asset-purchase polic ies (and when to stop them).  The statement \nissued after our last policy meeting highlight ed that we expect to continue the asset \npurchase program until the economy experien ces significant improvement in labor \nmarket conditions.  How forcefully and how long to pursue asset purchases is \ncomplicated – by the uncertainty surrounding th e effects of unconventional policies; by \nthe usual difficulty in assessing progress towa rd our dual mandate (given the sometimes \nnoisy signals of both inflationary pressure  and labor market c onditions); and by the \nreality that the amount of stimulus provided by our asset purchases depends in part on \nmarket participants’ assessment of the likely size of the asset purchase program.\n5   \nThe last complication is the result of the open-ended asset purchase program, \nsince it does not entail a fixed am ount or duration of purchases; in this respect it is more \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Thursday, November 1, 2012 at 5: 10 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *  \n 4like conventional policy in the pa st.  In fact, the decision of  when to stop easing during a \nrecovery is a complicated matter even in more normal times, when pursuing conventional \nmonetary policy through changes in the fede ral funds rate.  Impor tantly, the economic \nconditions associated with th e last easing action during a r ecovery are highly dependent \non the extent of inflationary pressures at the time.   \nGiven that the current inflation rate is qu ite low and is expected to stay low for \nseveral years, we have the flexibility to pus h for more improvement in labor markets than \nif inflation were not so subdued.  My own pers onal assessment is that as long as inflation \nand inflation expectations are expected to remain well-behaved in the medium term, we \nshould continue to forcefully pursue a sset purchases at least until the national \nunemployment rate falls below 7.25 percen t and then assess the situation.   \nI think of this number as a threshold, not  as a trigger – and the distinction is \nimportant.  I think of a trigger as a set of conditions that necessarily imply a change in \npolicy.  A threshold, unlike a tr igger, does not necessarily prec ipitate a change in policy.  \nInstead, I think of my propos ed threshold as follows.  Once the unemployment rate \ndeclines to this level, we would undertake a full assessment of labor market conditions \nand inflationary pressures to determine whet her further asset purchases are consistent \nwith the desired trajectory for reaching our  inflation and unemployment mandates in the \nmedium term.  Thus, a threshold precipitates a discussion and a more thorough assessment of appropriate policy, versus a trigge r which starts a change in policy.  As an \nexample, suppose we reach one’s threshold unemployment rate but at that time the \neconomy is slowing, and no further improvement in the unemployment rate is expected in \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Thursday, November 1, 2012 at 5: 10 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *  \n 5the short to medium term.  This hypothetical  situation would not necessarily imply a \nchange in policy stance, especially if infl ation was projected to remain below target. \nLet me say also that an unemployment rate of 7.25 sounds high, but achieving an \nunemployment rate of 7.25 per cent would require real GDP growth of roughly 3 percent \nfor a year.  That would be grow th that is a full percentage point faster than the economy’s \nso-called “potential” rate of growth, making this a challenge to achieve.   \nAnd as I noted, this is a threshold, not a trigger – at the 7.25 percent threshold the \nassessment of continued asset purchases woul d commence.  It is worth noting that a \nvariety of factors outside the realm of monetary policy (for example demographics) affect \nhow low unemployment can get without igniting inflationary pressures.6  But my own \npersonal view is that if infla tionary pressures remain muted,  then labor market conditions \nwould need to be more like 6.5 percent unemployment to warrant the federal funds rate being lifted off the zero bound.   \n  \nThe Economic Outlook \nWith that preview, let me say a bit a bout the economic context and outlook.  We \nare in the third year of the recovery, and the economy has averaged close to 2 percent \ngrowth over that time, which is faster than  many other advanced economies but too slow \nto return the nation to anything li ke full employment anytime soon.   \nTo promote faster growth, with the h ope of speeding up improvement in labor \nmarkets, the Federal Reserve announced additional monetary accommodation at our September 2012 policy meeting.\n7  Three key aspects of the announcement were the \ncontinuation of our approach to exchanging s hort-term securities for long-term securities \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Thursday, November 1, 2012 at 5: 10 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *  \n 6through December (the maturity extension pr ogram), the plan to purchase $40 billion in \nmortgage-backed securities each month until si gnificant improvement in labor markets is \nachieved, and the indication that short-term rates are expected to remain exceptionally \nlow through mid-2015.  Now I would like to say a bit more a bout each of my three main points – the \neffect of unconventional policy, the infla tion outlook, and the dual mandate and its \nimplications for asse t purchase policies. \n  \nPoint #1: The Effect of Unconventional Policy \nGiven both the July statement of the po licy committee, and Chairman Bernanke’s \nAugust speech at the annual Jackson Hole  economic symposium, there was a good deal \nof anticipation in financial markets that more forceful policy action would be taken.\n8  \nBoth were interpreted as indicati ng a likelihood of fu rther action.   \nAs Figure 1  shows, many financial markets began moving well before the \nSeptember announcement – and by the time of the actual announcement stock prices had \nrisen, mortgage rates had fallen, corporate bond rates had fallen, and exchange rates had \ndeclined modestly (a peripheral by-product of  lower U.S. rates).  Such movements in \nfinancial markets are quite consistent with the normal reaction to conventional monetary \npolicy announcements.   \nThe effect of policy on longer-term rates seems in turn to be having a positive \nimpact on the economy.  To affect growth in the economy, financial market movements \nneed to encourage firms and households to ad just their behavior.  Of course, while it \nremains too early to fully assess the effect of our September action, households appear to \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Thursday, November 1, 2012 at 5: 10 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *  \n 7be reacting to the easing in financial conditions.  Figure 2  shows the four-week moving \naverage of mortgage loan applications.  On e line reflects the refinance index, which has \nclearly been trending up recently.  Even more  encouraging has been the increase in the \npurchase index.  The drop in mortgage rate s at this time has the potential to be \nparticularly effective given that housing pr ices in some regions of the country are \nbeginning to rise.  That, coupl ed with the risk that rate s will rise once the purchase \nprogram is over, provides incentives not to defer purchase decisions.   \nFigure 3  shows that this increased activity is beginning to generate new home \nconstruction, as housing starts have been trendi ng up recently.  This is consistent with the \nmore qualitative anecdotes I hear from ba nkers around New England – that they are \nseeing, and are willing to lend to, strong construction firms that are selling new homes \nonce they are built. \nThere are, of course, other channels that  transmit the Fed’s action to the economy.  \nUnconventional monetary policy actions have produced strength in several interest-rate-\nsensitive sectors since they began in earnest – building on the earlier moves to quickly \nmake policy accommodative as the financial crisis and recession unfolded, and to keep policy accommodative in light of a very tepid recovery.  Figure 4  shows that auto loan \nrates at commercial banks also have been d eclining.  The low cost of financing cars, \nalong with positive wealth effects from increas es in housing prices and stock prices, have \nhelped to stimulate more robust auto sales – as you can see in Figure 5 . \nFigure 6  shows that consumer durables have be en stronger in this recovery than \nduring the previous two recove ries.  This is despite a ve ry weak housing market which \npresumably limited many durable goods pur chases commonly associated with home \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Thursday, November 1, 2012 at 5: 10 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *  \n 8buying.  Despite this significan t “headwind,” I think we can  say that the accommodative \nstance of monetary policy and indeed the use of unconventional monetary policy have \nhelped make interest-sensitive consumer durable purchases more affordable. \nWhile the household sector has been responding to monetary policy actions, the \nresponse by businesses has been more muted.  Firms appear to be deferring decisions \nuntil they have better clarity on the U.S. fi scal situation and on the likely path of \ninternational economic conditions.  However,  a continued household sector rebound is \nlikely to improve demand and business c onditions, encouraging more business \ninvestment – particularly once some of these downside risks and uncertainties are \nresolved. \n \nPoint #2: The Inflation Outlook \n One of the concerns voiced about unc onventional monetary policy is that \nexpanding the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet – injecting large quantities of reserves into \nthe banking system – could be inflationary.  Let’ s look to the data to assess this concern.  \nFigure 7  provides a measure of inflation – changes in the total personal \nconsumption expenditure price index for th e period since 2000.  The average of year-\nover-year changes in the PCE price index has been 2.2 percent, quite close to our 2 \npercent target.  However, it has been quite variable over the period, with PCE inflation \nsignificantly exceeding 3 percent during some periods and actually turning negative in the midst of the Great Recession.  This volatility is partly at tributed to periods of food \nand energy shocks, where price movements ha ve tended to be sharp but temporary.   \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Thursday, November 1, 2012 at 5: 10 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *  \n 9 Figure 8  provides the changes in the pers onal consumption expenditure price \nindex removing these volatile food and ener gy components. To be sure, the Fed is \nconcerned about inflation includ ing these components, as food and energy constitute an \nimportant share of essential household e xpenditures for people.  But temporary \nmovements in these components can obscure th e underlying trend in overall inflation, so \nit can be useful to look at the inflation rate  taking out food and energy.  Over this period, \nthe core PCE inflation rate has averaged 1.9 percent, which is slightly below our 2 \npercent target for total PCE inflation.  A nd you can see that the core inflation measure \nhas been far less volatile, remaining in  a range between 1 and 3 percent. \n Figure 9  shows both PCE and Core PCE infla tion expressed as quarterly changes \nat annual rates.  Over the past 12 years ther e have been a large nu mber of quarters in \nwhich inflation has exceeded 2 percent – thus  2 percent has never been a “ceiling” for \ninflation.  The distribution of quarterly core PCE inflation shows many fewer extreme \nobservations, but nonetheless has exhibited a fa irly broad range of outcomes.  So while \nrecent history has seen an underlying rate of inflation that is relatively stable around our \ntarget, I would suggest that attempting to hol d actual inflation in lockstep with our 2 \npercent target over short timefra mes is probably not realistic. \n Beyond the U.S. situation, I would also point to Japan’s experience as instructive.  \nAs I have pointed out many times, despite having an expanded balance sheet for an \nextended period, the Japanese con tinue to struggle with a defla tion problem rather than an \ninflation problem. 9 \n \n \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Thursday, November 1, 2012 at 5: 10 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *  \n 10Point #3: The Implications for Asset Purchase Policies \n The Fed’s recently announced, unconventi onal asset purchase po licies do seem to \nbe having the desired effects, and the inflati on rate remains below our  2 percent target.  \nHowever, this policy action included the announc ement that asset purch ases will continue \nuntil the outlook for the labor market improves substantially.  In other words, the policy \naction is open-ended versus time-bound.  Shoul d the economy experience another shock \n– say from a U.S. “fiscal cliff” situation or a shock from abroad, then we could lengthen \nthe period of purchases or increase the amount s (or both).  Similarly, favorable shocks \nwould mean that we would purchase fewer securities.   \nThe open-ended approach is particularly useful to convey that monetary policy \nwill serve as an “automatic stabilizer” should shocks occur – one hopes at least mitigating \npossible shocks that could buffet the economy.  I say “mitigating” because monetary policy would not necessarily be able to fu lly and immediately offset large shocks.  \n As with conventional monetary policy, decisions about the ideal timing for ending \nunconventional monetary stimulus require ba lancing a variety of considerations.  Figure \n10 shows the economic conditions at the end of the easing cycle for the last three \nrecessions.  The end of the easing cycle in 1992 started despite weak labor markets, in \npart because of the high inflation rate at the time.  The end of the easing cycle in 2001 \noccurred when the unemployment rate had falle n to 6.1 percent, in part because inflation \nwas only 1.9 percent at the time.   \nThe figure highlights that ending a cycle of easing during a recovery is highly \ndependent on a variety of economic factors.  With lower inflation rates, it is possible to \nmaintain the easing until the labor market shows more significant improvement.  This \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Thursday, November 1, 2012 at 5: 10 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *  \n 11would be consistent with a balanced appr oach to both elements of the Fed’s dual \nmandate.  The variables actually considered by po licymakers are much broader than the \nvariables reflected in Figure 10.  No single variable perfectly captures the underlying rate \nof inflation, as the sharp differences between  core and total PCE indicate.  Similarly, no \nsingle variable perfectly cap tures conditions in the labor market – for example, \nunemployment rates can fall because workers become discouraged and leave the labor force, or because of a ra pid expansion in hiring.   \nEven if there were single variables that  fully captured labor market conditions and \ninflationary pressures, the future path of those variables would de pend on a wide range of \nfactors.  Most importantly, and consistent with the definition of a threshold discussed \nearlier, an unemployment rate  of 7.25 percent when growth is expected to be below 2 \npercent is very different from the same rate when growth is expected  to be 4 percent or \nhigher. In the first case, one mi ght expect labor market conditi ons to deteriorate in future \nquarters.  In the second, one would norma lly expect to see further significant \nimprovement in labor market conditions.   \nFurthermore, because we are far from our  normal policies, we must acknowledge \nthe uncertainty surrounding the efficacy of thes e policies, as well as our ability to execute \na graceful exit from unconventiona l policy (that is, to return to conventional federal funds \nrate policy, and to reduce our large balan ce sheet to a size more consistent with a \nnormally-functioning economy).  Given the lack of  historical experience in exiting such a \nlarge balance sheet, the possibi lity of unintended consequenc es should not be dismissed.  \nWe are very attuned to these concer ns and are working to address them. \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Thursday, November 1, 2012 at 5: 10 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *  \n 12Despite the challenge to communicating in simple terms the likely exit strategy, I \nwill say that my own preference would be to continue asset purchases until we had at \nleast reached an unemployment rate of 7.25 per cent, given the low rates of inflation we \nhave been experiencing and are likely to be experienci ng over the medium term – \nhowever, I will say again that th is is a threshold, not a trigge r.  Assuming that inflation \nand inflation expectations remain well-behaved, at that point the disc ussion should center \non whether overall  labor market conditions are consistent with “substantial \nimprovement” – for example, whether the lowe r unemployment rate reflects job creation \nrather than reductions in the labor force as discouraged workers stop seeking jobs; \nwhether we are seeing sustained, robust payr oll employment growth; and whether we \nenvision continued substantial improvement in  labor markets for some quarters to come. \nUnder those conditions, I w ould stop asset purchases. \n \nConcluding Observations \n In summary and conclusion, let me reitera te that household sp ending patterns are \nconsistent with some improvement in the economy, and appear to be responding (as desired) to monetary policy accommodation.  Nonetheless, abrupt fiscal austerity or \nadverse shocks from abroad could still overwhelm the nascent positives.

Rosengren \nPresident & Chief Executive Officer \nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston \n \n \nKeynote remarks at \n“The Spread between Primary and Secondary \nMortgage Rates: Recent Trends and Prospects” \nsponsored by the Federal Reserve Banks \nof Boston and New York  \n \n \nNew York, New York  \nDecember 3, 2012 \n \n \n \n \n \n \nIt is a pleasure to be in New York to be  part of this important discussion of recent \ndevelopments in the residential mortgage market.  I would like to offer special thanks to \nthe staff at the New York Federal Reserve Ba nk, many of whom are st ill dealing with the \nconsequences of Hurricane Sandy.  My brother lives in Northern New Jersey and like so \nmany others he experienced significant struct ural damage to his house.  I know many at \n\n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Monday, December 3, 2012 at 12:45 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *  \n 2this Bank and across the region have similar a nd, unfortunately, even more tragic stories \nresulting from the storm.   \nAs awful as the storm was, it brought out th e remarkable resilience of the Greater \nNew York area.  Much progress has been ma de, though there certainly remains much to \nbe done for homeowners and bus inesses in affected areas. \n This conference is focused on the spr ead between longer-te rm interest rates \nprevailing in the marketplace and the rates c onsumers pay on mortgages.  This is an \nimportant topic, given that one of the more  important monetary policy initiatives since \nshort-term interest rates reached the zero lower bound has been the purchase of longer-\nterm assets, including mortgage-backed securi ties (MBS).  These policies seem to be \nhaving the desired effect as the Federal Re serve’s two announcements of asset-purchase \nprograms focused on MBS immediately generate d significant declines in the yields on \nsuch securities (on MBS).  \nOf course I want to begin as I do all my  talks with the reminder that the views I \nexpress today are my own, not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Board of \nGovernors or the Federal Open Market Committee (the FOMC). \nJust how these asset purchase programs actually influence the rates paid by \nhomeowners is complicated by a variety of institutional factors.  These include the \nmarket structure of mortgage lenders, the cyc lical nature of refinance activity, changes in \nthe credit profile of borrowers, changes in the role of government-sponsored enterprises \n(GSEs) in the mortgage market, and expectati ons of future interest  rate changes that \nimpact the likelihood of refinancing activity.  The pass-through of Federal Reserve asset-\npurchase programs can be influenced by change s in any of these factors, and at times \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Monday, December 3, 2012 at 12:45 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *  \n 3changes in these factors can provide headwinds  or tailwinds impacting the efficacy of the \npolicies.   \nAs a result, this is a particularly fruitful time for research in this area, with an eye \nto policy – as research presented today suggests.1  And I hope the development of further \nresearch agendas around these issues w ill be one result of this conference. \n Still, while we have much to learn a bout mortgage market developments, and how \nlarge-scale central bank asset purchases pass through to mortga ge lending, I want to state \nvery plainly that I believe the monetary pol icies designed to lower mortgage rates and \nstimulate more activity in interest-sensitive sectors have been effective, and are an important reason why the U.S. economy ha s performed better than many of our \ndeveloped-country peers.  Work being done at both the Boston and New York Reserve \nbanks has shown that the pass- through of these Fed actions to consumers, appropriately \nmeasured, has been quite large.  This type of empirical work is important as both an \nacademic inquiry and a policy-relevant finding.   \nConsider that many businesses have re ported putting their plans on hold given \nuncertainties around fiscal policy here and in Europe, yet household  spending  has \ncontinued and housing-related activity has picked  up – despite the uncertain environment.   \nGiven the tepid economic recovery, high unemployment, and subdued inflation – \nand the uncertainty around fiscal policy – I believe an accommodative monetary policy is \nquite appropriate.  We want to see continue d improvement in labor markets in the near \nterm, and monetary policy s hould encourage faster economic growth to achieve that \nobjective. \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Monday, December 3, 2012 at 12:45 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *  \n 4So in my view, a strong case can be made for the Federal Reserve continuing to \npurchase the current $85 billion in longer-ter m securities a month – even after our so-\ncalled “Operation Twist” ma turity-extension program2 (a portion of those purchases) is \ncompleted at the end of 2012.  This is a topi c we will be discussing at the next FOMC \nmeeting.3   \n \nChanges in the Composition of th e Federal Reserve’s Balance Sheet \n As a result of reaching the zero lower bound for short-term interest rates during \nthe financial crisis, the Federal Reserve has engaged in more forward guidance for \nmonetary policy, as well as undertaking large-sc ale asset purchases.  Both are designed to \nflatten the yield curve, w ith the intention of encour aging additional longer-term \nborrowing – and indeed auto loan rates and mo rtgage rates are well below their averages \nthrough the business cycle.  Today I will discu ss the large-scale asset- purchase program.   \nMany have focused on the size of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet, but it is \nequally important to consider the changes in the composition  of the balance sheet.  \nParticularly notable is the movement to longer-duration Treasury  securities and to \nmortgage-backed securities.  Keep in mind, ho wever, that this change in the composition \nof assets has not increased the credit risk taken by the Federal Reserve, as open market \noperations are limited to asse ts with government guarantees. \n Figure 1  shows the assets held  by the Federal Reserve in December 2007 and \nthen at the end of November 2012.  The bala nce sheet changed from under $1 trillion at \nthe end of 2007 to close to $3 trillion in 2012.  Equally striking has been the change in \nthe composition of Federal Reserve assets.  At  the end of 2007, nearly  two-thirds of the \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Monday, December 3, 2012 at 12:45 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *  \n 5assets were shorter-term (maturing in 5 years or less) Treasury securi ties and almost one-\nhalf of the securities had a maturity of le ss than one year.  By 2012, the composition had \nchanged.  As a result of Operation Twist, the balance sheet has become more heavily weighted toward long-duration Treasury secu rities.  In addition, the balance sheet now \nalso includes approximately $880 billion in mo rtgage-backed securities maturing in more \nthan 10 years. \nFigure 2  provides the same information, but shows how the asset mix has \nchanged over time.   The initial expansion of the balance sheet was the result of our \ncrisis-related emergency lending programs.  As those emergency programs were wound \ndown, asset purchases resulted in a significan t expansion of long- duration Treasury and \nmortgage-backed securities.  More recently, Operation Twist has resulted in our selling \nthe shorter-term Treasury securities so that most of the securities on the balance sheet are \nmortgage-backed securities or Treasury securiti es with more than five years to maturity. \n \nConsidering a Reserves-Focused Monetary Policy \n Some observers have advocated for maintaining a short-duration Treasury \nportfolio – arguing that moneta ry policy would be sufficiently expansionary by adding \nbank reserves, and thus there was no need to ex tend the duration of assets.  In this view, \nsince policy primarily works through bank re serves, purchasing assets that minimized \nrisks – including interest-rate risk – to th e Federal Reserve would be preferred.  Short-\nterm Treasury securities have no credit risk and also would carry minimal interest rate \nrisk.  Furthermore, in this view another be nefit is that the bala nce sheet could quickly \nshrink by not replacing the short-term securities as they mature.   \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Monday, December 3, 2012 at 12:45 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *  \n 6 But in my view a reserves-focused moneta ry policy poses several problems.  First, \nthere is little impact on market interest rate s, since exchanging Treasury bills that carry a \nlow interest rate for bank reserves that carry a low interest rate will have little in the way \nof interest rate effects.  Furthermore, th e banking sector would be forced to hold more \nlow-interest reserves at a time when capit al is scarce and many banks are seeking to \nshrink rather than expand thei r own balance sheet.  Thus, when  interest rates are already \nat the zero lower bound, a short-maturity rese rves-focused policy will not have much \nimpact on inflation or employment.   \nIn fact, Figure 3 shows that a rapid increase in ex cess reserves in both the United \nStates and Japan appears to ha ve had little effect on inflation in both countries.  While \ninflation in the United States has been close to 2 percent, Japan has continued to have a \nproblem with deflation,  despite significant increase s in excess reserves.   \nFurthermore, the increase in bank reserves  has not caused a la rge increase in bank \nlending, as shown in Figure 4 .  In Japan, real bank loans ar e still below where they were \ntwo decades ago.  In the United States, desp ite some growth recently, real bank lending \nremains below levels attained prior to the re cession.  It is noteworthy that in Japan, policy \nhas generally leaned toward a significant amount of shorter-d uration securities – although \nmore recently there have been greate r purchases of longe r-duration assets. \n \nSpread-Focused Monetary Policy \n In contrast to reserves-focused moneta ry policy, spread-focused monetary policy \nseeks to lower the cost of funds to hous eholds and firms by pu rchasing longer-duration \nassets.   This policy, like th e purchase of short-term Tr easury securities, increases \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Monday, December 3, 2012 at 12:45 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *  \n 7reserves.  However, the transmission mechan ism is not primarily through excess reserves, \nbut rather focuses on al tering the cost of longer-term borrowing.    \nCentral bank purchases of long-term Tr easury securities flatten the yield curve \nand cause other medium- and long-term rate s, including those on autos and houses, to \ndecline.  Similarly, the purchas e of mortgage-backed securitie s causes rates to decline for \nMBS but also for other longer-duration assets.  By reducing the borrowing cost of these \npurchases, demand for cars and houses should be stimulated.  By altering interest rates \nfaced by firms and households, as well as expanding the amount of reserves, the transmission of monetary policy is likely to be much more effective given that the \neconomy has already reached the lower bound for short-term interest rates. \nAdmittedly, spread-focused monetary policy carries some risk for a country’s \nmonetary authority.  Because the duration of a ssets is much longer, the balance sheet will \nnot automatically shrink as rapidly when purch ases are discontinued.  Furthermore, if the \nplan is fully effective and quickly restor es the economy to more normal financial \nconditions – including higher market interest ra tes – then the market value of the central \nbank’s portfolio of low-yielding secu rities will inevitably decrease.   \n \nPotential Advantages of Large-Scale MBS Purchases \nBoth long-term Treasury securities and mo rtgage rates have continued to fall as \nthe Federal Reserve has purchased longer-term securities,\n4 as Figure 5  highlights.   \n A common way of describing the mech anism through which the central bank’s \npurchase of longer-term Treasury securities  and mortgage-backed securities affects \ninterest rates is that such purchases “remove  duration” from the ma rketplace – driving up \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Monday, December 3, 2012 at 12:45 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *  \n 8prices for assets with longer duration a nd thus pushing down yields, and resulting in a \nreduction in longer-term rates generally.  Th is view takes MBS and Treasuries to be \nfairly close substitutes, and assumes that dur ation is the most important attribute that \ninvestors seek in choosing among investment alternatives.  Since the mortgage-backed \nsecurities purchased have government guarant ees, both Treasury securities and mortgage-\nbacked securities do not have default risk.   \nDespite these similarities, however, ther e may be several re asons for a central \nbank to prefer large-scale pur chases of mortgage-backed securities.  Some of these \nreasons involve loosening the assumption that assets are close substitutes and that \nduration is the key channe l through which central bank purchases have effects. \nFirst, mortgage rates may be more responsive to a purchase of MBS than \npurchases of similar amounts of Treasury s ecurities if mortgages are less-than-perfect \nsubstitutes for Treasuries, in part because investors have quite specific preferences for \nmortgage securities – what financial econom ists call “market segmentation.”  Under \nmarket segmentation – which is consistent with the fact that the spread between Treasury and MBS securities varies over time rather th an remaining constant – purchases of MBS \nmay have a larger impact on mortgage rates than purchases of Treasury securities.  \nParticularly at a time when housing prices are beginning to rise in many markets, making \nmortgage rates attractive may encourage potential home buyers to not delay their \npurchase decision. \nSecond, the ability to refinance mortgages with no prepayment penalty makes the \nsecurities quite different from Treasury securities in several respects – perhaps one of the \nkey reasons that investors see them as imperf ect substitutes.  From the perspective of a \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Monday, December 3, 2012 at 12:45 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *  \n 9central bank purchasing the securities, ma ny mortgages will be repaid early (before \nmaturity) even if interest rates rise.  Indivi duals move for a variet y of reasons including \nchanges in employment, a need to purchase a larger home, or a desire to downsize once \nchildren leave the home.  As a result, while many people may take on a 30-year mortgage, most people will retire the mortgage  well before its 30-year maturity.     \nTo that end, Figure 6  provides the percent of homeowners that have been in their \nhomes for at least 10 or 20 years, in 2000 a nd in 2010.  Over both horizons, roughly half \nthe homeowners had been in their homes for at least 10 years, and roughly one-quarter \nhad been in their homes for at least 20 year s.  Thus, even if rates were to rise, a \nsignificant percentage of mo rtgages would likely retire , providing a much shorter \nduration than for longer-term Treasury securities of a similar maturity.\n5, 6   \nHowever, the downside of being able to retire the mortgage without prepayment \npenalty is that the pass-through of lower mo rtgage costs from the investor to the \nhomeowner can be less than one-for-one.  Cha nges in the propensity to retire mortgages \nwill influence the price of mortgages, and the extent to which a lower wholesale mortgage rate will be passed through to borro wers.  This may be particularly true for \nhigh-rate mortgages that reflect the desire to avoid paying points or cl osing costs, or that \nreflect the credit worthiness of the borrower – since both may reflect  a higher propensity \nto retire the mortgage sh ould circumstances change. \nThird, Treasury markets are highly liquid, so that the liquidity premium is still \nrelatively small for seasoned issues.  As a re sult, Treasury securities  are often preferred \nduring times of crises because investors can easily exit their positions should they need to raise funds.   The mortgage-backed securitie s market is less liquid, particularly for \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Monday, December 3, 2012 at 12:45 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *  \n 10seasoned issues.   Thus during times of stre ss, the functioning of the mortgage market \nmay be impaired, providing an opportunity for a central bank purchase program to \nimprove market functioning as well as ch ange the relative price of securities by \nintroducing a new large-scale buyer.  The crisis events of 2008 provide an example. \nFinally, there may be capacity constraint s in only buying MBS securities or only \nbuying Treasury securities.  Because of potentia l capacity constraints and the fact that the \ndegree of substitutability may be situationa l, a strong case can be made for purchasing \nboth MBS and Treasury securities – w ith the proportions depending on the \ncircumstances. \nThus if the purpose is to improve mark et functioning, or to provide focused \nstimulus to an interest-sensitive sector in order to stimulate aggregate demand, it may be \nthat MBS purchases are preferable  to Treasury security purchases.7   \nAlso, even though the impact on mortgage ma rkets may be particularly favorable \nat certain times, MBS purcha ses are likely to have an impact beyond the mortgage \nmarket.  Figure 7  shows that mortgage rates have  fallen during large asset purchase \nprograms, but Figure 8  shows that corporate rate s also have declined, and Figure 9  \nshows that prices on assets such as stocks have generally risen dur ing this time period, \ndespite significant economic uncertainty.   \nHence, given the effectiveness of this policy and the relatively high \nunemployment rate and inflation8 that is running below our  2 percent target, I fully \nsupport the policy decisions to provide stimulus through asset purchases – and I believe \nthat including MBS purchases in the firs t and third asset-purchase programs have \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Monday, December 3, 2012 at 12:45 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *  \n 11contributed to a stronger economic outcome than  we would have seen in the absence of \nthese approaches.  \nWhile asset prices do seem to have been  affected by the purchase programs, the \nultimate goal is to stimulate further economic gr owth.  Thus it is heartening that despite \nthe economic uncertainties, house holds seem more confident in the economic future and \nare again purchasing long-term assets such as houses.  As Figure 10  shows, housing \nstarts have been increasing, as have housi ng prices in many markets.  Accommodative \nmonetary policy has provided an important s upport to an economy still suffering from the \nimpact of the financial crisis and the con tinued fiscal uncertain ty here and abroad. \n \nConcluding Observations \nIn summary and conclusion, I would note that many factors influence the pass-\nthrough of monetary policy to interest rates and output.  Th is conference is highlighting \nmany of the challenges to obtaining a full pa ss through to the mortgage rates faced by \nhouseholds.  Nonetheless, long-term rates – incl uding mortgage rates – do appear to have \nreacted to actions undertaken by the Fed.   \nI hope that as a result of the work of thos e at this conference, we can achieve an \neven better appreciation for additional steps th at could be taken so that more households \ncan benefit from stimulative monetary po licy designed to encourage faster economic \ngrowth.   \nThank you. \n \n \n \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Monday, December 3, 2012 at 12:45 P.M.

In the absence of those \npurchases, the amount of long-duration securities th at the Fed would be buying each month would decline \nto $40 billion. \n \n4 Of course, some of this decline is b ecause the economy continued to disappoint. \n \n5 In addition, the mortgages backing an MBS amortize,  shortening the duration of  MBS’s relative to same \nmaturity Treasuries. So MBS’s should be expected to roll off the Fed's balance sheet faster than Treasuries, \nboth due to amortization and due to prepayments.  Still, prepayments from refinancing activity would \ndecline in a rising interest rate environment, thus increasing the MBS's duration other things equal.  Such an effect partially offsets the benefits of holding MBS’s deriving from amortization and from prepayments \nnot related to refinancing activity. \n \n6 Homeowners with low interest rates can rent out their homes if they are forced to move by a job change or \nother life event.  Obviously, only a small fraction of ow ners are likely to do this, because of the challenges \nof managing a property after a move to a new area. But there are companies that will manage properties for \nabsentee owners, and rising interest rates may dissu ade some owners from moving in the first place. \n \n7 A counterargument some may make is that Treasury purchases may have broader impacts on many \nsomewhat similar securities — including mortgages. \n \n8 Personal Consumption Expenditure or PCE.",

Rosengren \nPresident & Chief Executive Officer \nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston \n \n \nJanuary 14, 2011 \n \n \nRemarks at the New England Mortgage Expo, \nhosted by the Connec ticut Mortgage Bankers \nAssociation and The Warren Group \n \n \n \n \n \nI’d like to thank the conference organizers fo r inviting me to speak with you today.  The \nbeginning of a new year is a good time to discuss the outlook for the economy.  I will also try to \nanswer a couple of the key questions that most everyone seems to be asking about, in relation to \nthis recovery.* \nAs I’m sure you know, over the past several we eks we have been getting economic data \nconsistent with a somewhat happier new year.  A r ecovery that has been an emic for the past year \n                                                             \n \n* Of course, the views I express today are my own, not  necessarily those of my colleagues on the Board of \nGovernors or the Federal Open Market Committee (the FOMC). \n\n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, January 14, 2011 at 1:15 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY * \n \n2 \n and a half looks to be increasingly supported by private spending as 2011 begins.  The Blue Chip \nforecast for 2011 has increased 4 tenths over the previous month, to 3.3 percent.   \nAnd I am slightly more optimistic than the Bl ue Chip; my own forecast is for growth of \n3.5 to 4.0 percent over 2011.  This is certainly an improvement, but – soberingly – would still \nleave the unemployment rate close to 9 percent at the end of this  year, a rate far above anyone’s \nestimate of full employment.   \nGiven the evidence of substantial excess capacity  and a quite low core inflation rate, it is \nabsolutely appropriate that monetary policy – and indeed fiscal policy – ha ve been deployed in a \nway that encourages a more robust recovery.  Go ing forward, it is my view that monetary policy \nmust continue to focus on addressing both elemen ts of the Fed’s mandate – price stability, and \ngrowth supporting a retu rn to full employment in the medium term.  \nToday I am going to focus on two questions that  seem to be at the forefront of most \ndiscussions of the recovery.   \nThe first question is, what role will housing play in the recovery ?  As the most interest-\nsensitive component of gross domestic product (GDP), housing has traditionally been an \nimportant sector of the economy for generating r ecovery.  I will be highl ighting the fact that, \ndespite some improvement in factors fundamental  to a housing recovery, I expect housing will \nnot provide as much support to th is recovery as it has in prev ious ones.  My sense is that \nresidential investment, consumer durables, and services related to hous ing will be less robust \nthan is usual in many recoveries, thus playing a role in what I think will be only a gradual \nimprovement in the economy and employment.   \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, January 14, 2011 at 1:15 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY * \n \n3 \n To put it plainly, these housing-related headwi nds are part of why I do not expect growth \ngreater than 4 percent this year.  And while 4 percen t is not terrible, at that rate it will still take a \nvery long time to get back to full employment.  \nThe second key question is, how concerned should we all be about a flare-up in inflation \n– and aren’t the measures the Fed has taken inflationary ?  Many have expressed concern that \nFederal Reserve policy actions that expanded our ba lance sheet dramatically  will cause inflation.  \nI firmly believe that in the short run inflation is likely to remain quite low – and that in the longer \nterm we have the tools, and the steadfast comm itment, to address inflationary pressures.   \nIndeed, while monetary policy works with lags , I would note that it has been more than \ntwo years since the Fed’s balance sheet expanded dramatically.  Si nce that time, core inflation \nhas fallen  and core inflation measures using the CP I or PCE indexes are at something like 50 \nyear lows.   \nToday I will briefly address the role of the low inflation rate for the economy and \npolicymaking.  In doing so, I will discuss why inflat ion concerns have not materialized to date, \nand why I expect core inflation to remain be low 2 percent over the next several years.   \n \nQuestion 1: Housing and the Economic Recovery \nThe economic recovery officially began in  the third quarter of 2009, according to the \norganization responsible for dati ng our recessions – the National Bureau of Economic Research \n(NBER).  Despite being a year and a half into the official recover y, the recovery period has been \nso tepid that there has been ve ry little improvement in the pe rcentage of the population employed \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, January 14, 2011 at 1:15 P.M.

The percent of the population empl oyed in December was 58.3, close to the low \nof this cycle and below the 59.3 percent employed in July of 2009, when the recovery officially \nstarted.  For context, the numb er was around 63 percent when the recession began.  The recent \nstability of the employment-to-popul ation ratio reflects the poor la bor market performance of the \ncurrent recovery. We are simply not gene rating enough jobs to reduce the number of \nunemployed persons.  Nor are we, by the way, providing job opportunities for the so-called \n“discouraged workers” who have given up looking for work. \nWhat we call final sales – growth in GDP excluding inventory replenishment – has grown \nquite slowly over the past year and a half.  Figure 2  shows that the growth to date has been \nsubstantially slower than duri ng the 1982 recovery, and is trac king quite closely to the weak \nrecovery experienced in the early 2000s.  As many economists anticipated, the recovery has been \ntepid given the fact that it comes in the wake  of a collapse in a hous ing bubble with resulting \nfinancial market turmoil and disruption. \nThe largest GDP component is consumpti on, and consumption has not grown very \nquickly.  As Figure 3  shows, in the current recovery, gr owth in consumption has been much \nslower than in the 1982 recovery and has, unfortunately, tracked th e anemic initial recovery from \nthe 2001 recession.  While the 2001 recession damaged many a household’s finances, through an abrupt decline in stock-market wealth, the cu rrent recovery has been hampered by households \ntrying to rebuild their finan ces given sharply diminished housing  wealth in addition to declines in \nthe value of their ot her investments.  \nWhile there have been concerns about business fixed investment, Figure 4  shows that \nthis component of GDP has grown quite well relative to the last tw o recoveries – although \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, January 14, 2011 at 1:15 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY * \n \n5 \n somewhat slower than the 1982 recovery.  Despit e the concern over economi c uncertainty voiced \nby many businesses, investment has been growing.   \nThe real laggard in this recovery has been  housing.  While housing is a relatively small \ncomponent of GDP, it can be quite volatile – and often grows rapidly during an economic \nrecovery.  In addition, purchase s of appliances, home furnishi ngs, and housing-related services \nare impacted by slowed housing activity.  Given th e problems that flow from the bursting of the \nhousing bubble, Figure 5  shows that residential fixed invest ment is roughly where it was at the \ntrough of the recession – and thus not providing its more usual contribution to growth in the \nearly stages of a recovery.   \nJust how moribund the housing market has been is shown in Figure 6 .  Both housing \nstarts and building permits have leveled off, but  are showing no signs of a significant recovery \nyet.   \nInterest rates are quite low by historical standards, while  the equity component of \nhousehold net worth is improving, as shown in Figure 7 .  And we have seen some positive \nimprovement in real disposable  income.  Given all that, one would normally anticipate that \nhousing would be improving.   \nHowever, lower interest rates are only  helpful if credit is available.  Figure 8 shows that \nthe number of purchase loans to prime borrowers has been declining, while  the subprime market \nis dormant.1  The left side of Figure 9 shows the distribution of all home-purchase loans by \ncredit score in 2006 (before th e financial crisis) and in 2010.2  It is striking how the distribution \nof purchase mortgages has change d.  Credit standards have tighten ed, as evidenced by a shift to \nborrowers with higher credit scores.  Give n what has happened to housing prices, and \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, January 14, 2011 at 1:15 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY * \n \n6 \n unemployment, lenders are presum ably more cautious in lending.  Far fewer loans are going to \nborrowers with credit scores below 625, and ma ny more purchase loans are going to borrowers \nwith credit scores above 750.  In  2006, about 15 percent of the purch ase loans were to borrowers \nwith credit scores below 625, but by 2010, this fraction had fallen to only 3.5 percent.   \nThe decline in loans to borrowers with sub- 625 scores has not comple tely resulted from \nthe decline in subprime lending.  The right side of the fi gure shows the credit-score distributions \namong prime  loans, and a similar rightward shift in the distribution is apparent.  From 2006 to \n2010, the share of prime purchase lo ans going to borrowers with sub- 625 credit scores fell from \n8.5 to 3.5 percent.  At the same time, the share of prime purchase loans go ing to borrowers with \nscores above 750 rose from about 35 percent to about 41 percent. \nWhile I am certainly not advocating going b ack to the loose lending standards of, say, \n2006, I think we should be aware of how changes in  the distribution have implications for the \nhousing recovery.  In particular, I would sugge st that current lending standards are another \nreason the housing secto r’s role in the recovery is likel y to be weaker than usual.   \nIn addition to the challenge of availability of credit to borrowers with low credit ratings, \nhousing has another issue.  Both the homeowne r and rental vacancy rates are quite high, as \nshown in Figure 10 –  although there has been recent improvement in these rates, and hopefully \nthe trend is now downward.  High vacancy rate s, of course, place downward pressure on home \nprices and rental rates, and serve as another headwind to a housing recovery. \n So again, all in all and despite some impr ovement in factors fundamental to a housing \nrecovery, I expect that housing wi ll not provide as much  support to this recovery as it has in \nprevious ones.   \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, January 14, 2011 at 1:15 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY * \n \n7 \n But now I’d like to turn to the second que stion, and perhaps leave you feeling a bit less \ndiscouraged when we’re through. \n \nQuestion 2: Inflation, Policy, and the Economic Recovery \nA second key question involves the concerns about Fed actions stoki ng inflation.  This \nquestion is not a distinct and sepa rate issue from the one we just  discussed – the strength of the \nrecovery.  In fact they are crucially related.  If housing-related growth is not going to boost the \nrecovery this time around, we may need policy – particularly monetary policy – to continue \nplaying a stimulative role.   \nBut it is important to look at possible costs of  stimulative policy, as we ll as benefits.  If \ninflation were to become a problem that would cert ainly fall in the costs co lumn.  But if analysis \nsuggests that inflation is not likel y to be a problem, then we can more comfortably align policy to \ncontinue supporting the recovery. \nSome observers and analysts have voiced  great concern that the nascent economic \nrecovery, combined with the acti ons of the Federal Reserve that have expanded its balance sheet, \nwill lead to significant inflation.  However, Figure 11  provides a variety of different measures of \ncore inflation; core CPI, core PCE, trimmed core CPI and trimmed core PCE.  It is striking how \nmuch all four series have declined.  In fact many of these series are at th eir historical lows.   \nFigure 12  shows the different measures of core in flation in the top panel, and the Federal \nReserve’s balance sheet in the bottom panel.  In  the fall of 2008, the Federal Reserve’s balance \nsheet expanded significantly – but that period al so corresponds to the em ergence of disinflation \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, January 14, 2011 at 1:15 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY * \n \n8 \n (a reduction in the inflation rate) in the U.S.  While monetary policy wo rks with lags, why has \nthe unprecedented increase in the Federal Rese rve’s balance sheet corre sponded with continued \nsignificant disinflation?  The answer is that  both have been reacting to an unprecedented \nfinancial shock, which resulted in signi ficant excess capacity in the economy.   \nWhen the Federal Reserve purchases assets and expands its balance sheet, it necessarily \ninjects more reserves into the banking system . The key question is what banks do with those \nreserves. Reserves held by the ba nking system that are not used to provide credit to businesses \nwill have little bearing on either real  spending or inflation.  The 2009 line in Figure 13  shows \nthat the expansion of bank reserves has not generated increases in lending.  As with the 1991 \nrecovery, where a credit crunch impeded expans ion of bank lending, there has not been an \nexpansion of lending during this re covery.  This is particularly noticeable if we look at business \nlending, in Figure 14 .  Commercial and industr ial loans are substantia lly lower than at the \nrecession trough.   \nOf course, those who worry about the inflati onary consequences of our balance sheet may \nbe looking to the future.  As the economy impr oves, banks may use their reserves to rapidly \nexpand business lending – increasing economic activity and putting upward pressure on inflation.  But as Chairman Bernanke has emphasi zed, the Federal Reserve has at its disposal a \nvariety of tools that will allo w it to remove reserves from  the banking system once economic \nconditions get closer to normal. Thus the fear that our large balance sheet and the large stock of \nreserves in the banking system will cause inflation – either now or down the road – seems misplaced to me. \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, January 14, 2011 at 1:15 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY * \n \n9 \n While we have been experiencing disinflation ge nerally, it is not the case for all prices.  \nAs Figure 15  shows, some prices have risen rapidly.  Energy prices in pa rticular have been \nrising, in response to robust growth in emerging markets.  But outside of energy prices, most \nprices have shown little increase, and in fact a number of the major categories in the CPI index \nhave experienced declines in prices.  \nTo be clear, the Fed certainl y cares about increases in en ergy prices, for two reasons.  \nFirst, higher energy prices could potentially br ing about long-lasting in creases in the overall \ninflation rate. The Fed therefore monitors ener gy prices closely, given our mandate to keep \noverall inflation low and stable. Second, rising energy prices act as a tax on households and \nbusinesses, who often find it difficult to reduce their consumption of energy in the short run.3   \nWith regard to the first concern, our research suggests that the lasting effect of energy \nprices on overall inflation has been surprisingly sma ll in recent years.  For evidence, consider the \nenormous surges in oil prices in mid-2008, which were followed by significant declines  in core \ninflation, as I mentioned earlier.  \nThe second concern remains, however.  In su m, my primary concern about rising energy \nprices is not so much that they will lead to higher inflation, but that they will subtract from \nhousehold income and thus weaken the economy. \nFinancial markets are also not expecting sharply higher rates of inflation.  The difference \nbetween the 10 year Treasury rate and the 10 year inflation-protected Trea sury security (TIPS) \nrate provides a measure of the expected average in flation rate over the next decade.  As shown in \nFigure 16 , the average expected inflation rate by th is measure is still below what the markets \nexpected prior to the recession and the necessary expansion of the Fed’s balance sheet. \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, January 14, 2011 at 1:15 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY * \n \n10 \n Concluding Observations        \nThankfully, we are seeing signs that the ec onomy is experiencing a more self-sustaining \nrecovery.  However, it is important not to lose si ght of how much excess capacity remains.  It is \nlikely to take at least four years to return to full employment from the current unemployment rate \nof 9.4 percent.  It is also likely that measures of core inflation will remain well below 2 percent \nover the same period.  This suggests that the signs  of improvement we have seen so far are not \nworrisome, but are most welcome.  A sustaine d period of the economy growing well above its \npotential – not just for a few quarter s – is exactly what we need.   \nThe current level of accommodation from mone tary and fiscal policy is appropriate.  \nHowever, once the economy has significantly imp roved, both fiscal and monetary policy will \nneed to be much less accommodative.  Getting this  balance right will be one of the main policy \nchallenges over the next several years.  I am confident that the Fed’s Federal Open Market \nCommittee (FOMC) will meet the challenge. \nFinally, I’d like to note that even with some early signs of economic improvement, a \nnumber of risks remain.  As I have highlighted  today, the housing market remains fragile and is \nnot likely to contribute to economic recovery in its traditional way – and this is part of why I do \nnot expect growth to exceed 4 percent in 2011.  Furthermore, in many areas of the country the \nimpaired balance sheets of borrowers, high fo reclosures, and high vaca ncy rates imply a long \ntime before local housing markets normalize.  St ate and local governments remain significantly \nchallenged by the aftershocks of the financial crisis and recession.  And many state and local \ngovernments continue to have both short- run and long-run fiscal challenges.   \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, January 14, 2011 at 1:15 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY * \n \n11 \n Finally, the large fiscal deficits of many governments accrued during the recession will \nneed to be addressed.  And as Figure 17  shows, financial markets are concerned that many \ncountries will be forced to make very painfu l fiscal choices – in economies with already \nsignificant challenges – or risk default. \nYet while risks like these remain, the economy is  in a much better place than it was one \nor two years ago.  Fiscal and monetary po licy responded aggressive ly, and in my view \nappropriately, to avoid what would have been a much more severe outcome, absent action.   \nThere will be a time when these aggressive actions need to be reversed, but first we need \nto get the economy on a much more solid footing.   Even with a relativel y robust recovery, it will \ntake several years before we attain full employ ment and an inflation ra te close to a long-run \nexpectation of 2 percent.  Ta ken together there has been cl ear room for – and indeed an \nimperative for – policy actions like those the Federal Reserve has been pursuing.4  Going \nforward our focus must be on policies that re turn the economy to a place that meets both \nelements of the Fed’s mandate. \nThank you. \n \n                                                             \n \nNOTES: \n \n1 Figures 8 and 9 are based on data from McDash Analytics LLC, a subsidiary of Lender Processing Services, Inc.  \nThe McDash data contain loan-level data from mortgage servicers, and cover more than half of all outstanding \nmortgages in the United States.

I’d like to thank Boston Univ ersity and all the conference organizers, \nparticularly Larry Kotlikoff, for the opportunity to  be here to discuss lessons learned from the \nglobal financial meltdown.* \n Everyone knows that the past three years have been a part icularly difficult period for \nglobal financial market stability and for the globa l economy.  The financial crisis clearly showed \n                                                             \n \n* Of course, the views I express today are my own, not  necessarily those of my colleagues on the Board of \nGovernors or the Federal Open Market Committee (the FOMC). \n\n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Monday, February 28, 2011 at 8:50 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY * \n \n2 \n the dramatic impact that financial problems can have on the real economy.  And in spite of a fair \namount of focus on financial stabil ity prior to the crisis, events highlighted that the private and \npublic sectors both here and abroad  were not fully prepared for th e kinds of financial shocks we \nexperienced. \n Today I’d like to discuss the role of what I call “financial myths” in creating financial \ncrises.  By financial myths I mean the belief s, held by most market participants and by \nregulators, that certain outcomes  are so unlikely to occur that they can basically be ignored – \nessentially that low probability events, based on historical  experience, can be reclassified as zero \nprobability events.  When these sorts of widespread assumptions – these financial myths – turn out to be wrong, most financial-market particip ants find themselves poorly positioned for the \nresulting shocks.  The result is insolvency of  groups of firms and substantial uncertainty – \nuncertainty about the exposure of many firms to di rect losses, or to indirect losses created by \ntheir counterparty exposure to other firms that suffer direct losses. \n These so-called financial myths are not unique to this time period, or  to this country.  I \nwould like to briefly mention two among the numer ous examples from recent history – examples \nwhere financial myths were important in helping to create a potential crisis.  The first example involves the assumption of many in Japan that real estate prices could not fall in the late 1980s.  \nThe second involves the assumption, in the late 1 990s, that the Internet had completely changed \nhow we should think about  company valuation. \n I will then briefly mention four financial my ths that played critical roles in the recent \nfinancial crisis.  These incl ude the following assumptions:  \n• that a diversified portfolio of US real esta te had little risk of  falling in value;  \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Monday, February 28, 2011 at 8:50 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY * \n \n3 \n • that Triple-A rated securi ties based on mortgages were  so well protected by the \nstructure of the securitization that they posed  little risk even if real estate prices did \nfall;  \n• that the evolution of many financial institutio ns to an “originate to distribute” model \nof lending and securitization meant there wa s little risk exposure to declining real \nestate prices; and,   \n• that there was little risk of a “run” on or ganizations like investme nt banks that relied \non short-term, collateralized borrowing. \n Then to conclude I’d like to briefly menti on what we can and must do to reduce the risks \nresulting from these sorts of financial myths, going forward.  I believe that financial stability will, in the future, be better served as we im plement some of the protections afforded by the \nDodd-Frank Act; but I also suspect that doing better at protecting against various financial myths \nultimately requires a cultural change.  As a discip line, risk management has been too willing to \naccept that historical stat istical relationships will be stable.  Ideally, risk management practices \nwould lead us to ask things lik e “What will happen if the hist orical relationship breaks down?” \nand “What assumptions would need to change for them to break down?”  \nAlso, I will touch on the fact that challenging assumptions and understanding the risk \ninherent in relying solely on hist orical experience should not be the responsibility of the risk \nmanager alone.  These things also need to be be tter ingrained in CEOs, members of boards of \ndirectors, and regulators.  I believe we need to do a much better job of us ing so-called stress tests \nto challenge commonly held views, so that boa rds of directors and re gulators of firms better \nunderstand the fundamental drivers of risks in organizations and in the financial system. \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Monday, February 28, 2011 at 8:50 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY * \n \n4 \n Financial Myths in Recent History \n Let me look back to the time period before th e most recent crisis and share two examples \nof financial myths – and, unfortunately, their me ssy demise.  And I would emphasize that these \nare just two of many examples of the phenomenon. \nFirst, I’ll note that du ring the late 1980s, New England began to experience substantial \ndeclines in residential and commercial real estate prices.  My research at that time at the Boston \nFed was focused on how problems at financial institutions could disrupt credit availability.  Interestingly, in 1989 I was visited by a variety of  Japanese academics and government officials.  \nThey wanted to understand how we had missed the si gns of an overheating r eal estate market.   \nAs Figure 1  indicates, it was shall we say an inte resting time for researchers from Japan \nto ask such a question.  However, when I inquired about the rapid increase in real estate prices in \ntheir country, I always received the same answer – Japan is an island nation and had limited \nbuildable lots, and that prevented real estate pric es from declining.  This view was very widely \nheld.  However, as you can see in Figure 2 , that widely held financia l myth was soon shattered.  \nUnfortunately, the result of this be lief was eventually the crippling of some of the world’s largest \nfinancial institutions, a long period of subpar economic growth in Japan, and eventually a \nproblematic deflation that Japan struggles with to this day. \n A second example is provided by the growth of the Internet, and in pa rticular the growth \nin “dot-com” stock valuati ons, in the late 1990s.  As Figure 3  shows, there was a substantial run-\nup in stock valuations during this period.  At the time I had conversati ons with a variety of \nfinancial professionals in Boston who made the argument that traditional valuation measures no \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Monday, February 28, 2011 at 8:50 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY * \n \n5 \n longer applied.  The view assumed by many was that valuation of firms should be based on \nclicks of a computer mouse rather than earnings, either current or expected in the future.   \nAs Figure 4  shows, such enthusiasm for a new way of valuing companies was short-\nlived.  But importantly, the substantial decline in Internet-related stocks di d not create a financial \ncrisis.  Many of the positions were equity fi nanced – so, while significant wealth was lost, \nfinancial institutions and financial markets did not suffer severe repercussions.  That loss in \nwealth helped ignite the 2001 recession, but it was a much more mild downturn than the one we \nhave experienced of late.  With the financial in frastructure not significan tly damaged, the impact \nwas much less severe than if individuals a nd firms had taken highly leveraged positions. \n \nFinancial Myths in the Recent Crisis \n Now I’d like to describe, and present some char ts that illustrate, four financial myths that \nplayed a role in the recent crisis. \n \nMyth 1 – Diversification eliminated  the risk of declines in residential real estate holdings \n Despite the experience of Japan’s real estate in the 1990s, and substant ial declines in real \nestate prices in many regions of the United States throughout history, many  commentators argued \nthat a significant, widespread housin g-price decline in a country as large and varied as the United \nStates had not happened historically and was very unlikely to occur.   \nThat logic was based on what you see in Figure 5,  which highlights that there had been \nsignificant declines in some regions  of the country – but the dec lines were coincident with \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Monday, February 28, 2011 at 8:50 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY * \n \n6 \n increases elsewhere.  As Figure 6  shows, there had not been recent, sustained declines in \nnational  real estate prices.  This observation, combin ed with the increased securitization of real \nestate into diversified national portfolios, gave buyers – and t hose rating the securitizations – \nconfidence that the “real estate cycle risk” was substantially mitigated through diversification.   \nBut, as Figure 7  shows, the assumption that a geographi cally diversified por tfolio of real \nestate assets would avoid pr ice declines proved wrong.  While prices nationally had not \nexperienced a substantial decline in the past, for three years the U.S. has experienced substantial \nand sustained declines in prices.  \nSome of my colleagues point out, probably appropriately, that  given the historical data \nthe failure to anticipate nationw ide house prices falling is la rgely understandable.  It was \ncertainly very widespread.  What may be more surprising is that in the 2005 timeframe, when \nmany were expecting house prices  to slow down or flatten, ther e was not much by way of risk \nmitigation undertaken. \n \nMyth 2 – Triple-A mortgage secu rities carried little risk  \n The securitization market – that is, the mark et for securities based on various slices of \npooled mortgages – grew dramatically over the pa st decade.  One reason for the growth in \nsecuritization was investor interest  in, and demand for, securities with little credit risk but returns \nabove those of Treasuries.   \nMany buyers of such securities felt sure of tw o things.  First, that  national real estate \nprices were quite unlikely to fall – in other words, our Myth 1.  Second, that even in the highly \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Monday, February 28, 2011 at 8:50 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY * \n \n7 \n unlikely event that the price of a national portfolio did fall, they would be protected by the \nstructure of the securitization.  S ecuritizations were stru ctured so that any losses were first borne \nby lower-rated securities built from the pool of underlying mortgages.  Given the structure, the \nassumption was that lower-valued securities woul d take all potential losses if borrowers \ndefaulted.  Many – but not all, of course1 -- assumed that home-price declines and related \ndefaults would have to be very extreme before  the highest rated, Trip le-A securities were \nimpacted.  Under this assumption these securities  fully deserved the Triple-A rating given by the \nrating agencies.   \nI should note that making this assumption about Triple-A rated mortgage backed \nsecurities (MBSs) proved less problematic than  making this assumption about the recombined \nlower tranches of mortgage-backed  securities that were billed as Triple-A rated collateralized \ndebt obligations (CDOs). 2 But many investors focused not  on the security’s underlying \ncomponents, merely on the ratings. \n Figure 8  shows that Triple-A securities remained at par values as the securitization boom \ngathered steam.  However, Figure 9  shows that when the severity of the decline in house prices \nmanifested itself, even the Triple-A rated mo rtgage securities collapsed in value.  The \ncombination of illiquidity, growing concerns with the real estate market, and ebbing confidence \nin the ratings resulted in dramatic declines in th e pricing of Triple-A securities as the financial \ncrisis worsened.3 \n \n \n \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Monday, February 28, 2011 at 8:50 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY * \n \n8 \n Myth 3 - The “originate to distribute” mode l limited the balance- sheet risk of banks \n Over the decade preceding the crisis, large commercial and investment banks had become \nincreasingly involved in securiti zing mortgage assets.  They ar gued that this provided a steady \nstream of fee income but generated little risk fo r the bank.  While they packaged mortgages, they \nwere not retaining the risk in their own portfo lio – instead, the risk was taken by those that \npurchased the mortgage securities, particular ly the lower-rated mort gage securities.   \n What was frequently ignored by many was the rapid growth of Triple-A mortgage \nsecurities holdings elsewhere with in the banks, as well as in off balance sheet structures.  While \nthese off balance sheet structures were consid ered separate entities , banks found the potential \nreputational risk of not supporting their sponsored off balance sheet risk sufficiently great that \nmany ended up supporting these off balance sheet struct ures. In a sense, “ori ginate to distribute” \nwas, in practice, something more like “origina te to hold, loosely, some what off to the side.4” \nIn addition, risk managers, bank management, and regulators were su fficiently lulled by \nMyths 1 and 2 to develop their faith in Myth 3.  The unfortunate result was that these banks were \nnot as protected from falling hous ing prices as many had assumed, and this contributed to the \nsubstantial decline in stock pr ices and the need for government  support for many of these large \nfinancial intermediaries. \n \n \n \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Monday, February 28, 2011 at 8:50 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY * \n \n9 \n Myth 4 – Investment banks were not subject to runs, because their liabilities were \ncollateralized \n There has long been an unde rstanding, and indeed a regulatory presumption, that banks \ncould be subject to “runs,” resulting in a need  for both deposit insurance and a heavily regulated \nenvironment to reduce that risk.  At the same tim e, it had largely been presumed that investment \nbanks were better protected agains t such runs.  While the balance sheets of investment banks had \nsubstantial short-term lia bilities, many of them were collateralized.  I nvestment banks would buy \nlonger-term securities  but finance them with short- term borrowing (using repurchase \nagreements).  It was assumed that because ther e was collateral backing up the loans, borrowers \nwere protected and would not run. \n Financing securities with short-term borrowi ng allowed investment banks to substantially \nexpand their balance sheets, as shown in Figure 10 .  However, the lenders in this market were \nother banks, money-market funds, and hedge f unds.  As questions about the value of the \ncollateral became more prominent, and the solven cy and liquidity of investment banks became a \ngreater concern, many short-term lenders abandoned the market.  Figure 11  shows the dramatic \nchange that occurred.  The inability to finan ce large securities holdings  made the traditional \nmodel of investment banking unsustainable, and th is contributed to the failure of investment \nbanks and the merger under duress, or convers ion to bank holding companies, of others. \n \nWhat Can We Do about Financial Myths, Going Forward? \n We plumb this history to help us understa nd what we can do about financial myths, going \nforward, and how we can avoid their damaging impact.   \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Monday, February 28, 2011 at 8:50 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY * \n \n10 \n As the previous slides have shown, taking too much confidence in  historical data \nrepeating in the future can be dangerous – to the financial health of instit utions and the financial \nsystem.  That said, we are probably not likel y to see a sea-change  in the tendency for \noverconfidence in and reliance on recen t statistical regularities.   \nHowever, there are a variety of market par ticipants that could better protect their own \ninterests – and the financial syst em – if they spend more time understanding the key assumptions \nbeing made in financial modeling, and have a clearer understanding of what could happen if \nthose assumptions were invalid.  Properly done, stress testing should provide valuable \ninformation to organizations on key risk drivers.  This needs to be more than feeding a handful of \nmacroeconomic assumptions into a model.  It requi res an understanding of the events that could \nlead to that macroeconomic outcome , and what other indire ct effects might be likely to occur.   \n Who should be responsible for regular, thoughtful stress testing?  Risk managers, CEOs, \nand boards of directors should all understand key risk drivers – and should consider whether a \nstress scenario is sufficiently severe, and whethe r the direct and indirect  effects are reasonably \ncaptured.  Rating agencies and stock analysts sh ould be increasingly demanding better quality \nstress tests, and that the results be made available to them.  Finall y, regulators should be able to \ncompare and contrast the quality of stress te sts across organizations and hold accountable those \norganizations that are not keep ing up with their peers.  \nAs I mentioned at the outset, challenging assu mptions and understanding risks should not \nonly be the responsibility of the risk manager.  Th ese things also need to be better ingrained in \nCEOs, members of boards of di rectors, and regulators.   \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Monday, February 28, 2011 at 8:50 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY * \n \n11 \n Operationalizing this point is not going to be easy, but it is critical.  At a fundamental \nlevel, debunking a myth requires individuals to go  against strongly and widely held beliefs, to \nconvince decision-makers, and to build consensus. For this to happen we may need significant \nchanges in the governance of risk management at ba nks and other parties in the financial system.  \nPut more plainly, we need to think about an e nvironment where those in  the position of most \ninfluence have the incentive to “poke holes” in  myths via robust stress tests, and not the \nincentives to override their risk managers when th e stress-test implications  are not to their liking, \nor risk a near-term loss of clients or market share. \n \nConcluding Observations \n New financial myths are regularly created.  In closing, I will just speculate on where \nsome may exist that interested pa rties should be exploring, now.   \n \n• Potential Myth 1 – Sovereign debt problems will not be disruptive to the world \neconomy.  Not long ago, the sovereign debt prob lems were viewed as manageable \nand confined to one country.  However, as interest rate spread s have widened – as \nshown in Figure 12  – investors are highlighting that problems in many countries have \nyet to be resolved.   While I believe the most likely outcome is that there are no \nserious disruptions, interested parties shoul d diligently consider scenarios that could \nbe disruptive, involvi ng various countries. \n \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Monday, February 28, 2011 at 8:50 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY * \n \n12 \n • Potential Myth 2 – State and local financing problems will not be disruptive to the national \neconomy.   While much attention has been give n to problems in state and local \nfinances, it is generally assumed that the capacity exists to resolve these problems.  \nWhile I expect these issues will be resolved without widespread or cascading \nproblems, we should consider what scenarios could emerge if political impasses result \nin more disruptive outcomes. \n These are just two of many pot ential scenarios that are wo rth exploring.  However, I \nwould add that the recent financ ial crisis highlighted that unlikely  events can happen, and when \nthey do, the outcomes can be quite costly for ever yone.  So the need for better risk management \nis clear.  Fortunately, the oppor tunity is there as well. \nThank you. \n \n                                                             \n \nNOTES: \n \n1 Boston Fed researchers note some examples of contrary analysis of Subprime ABS structures written in \n2005 suggesting vulnerability to even a 5 percent fall in house prices.

Rosengren \nPresident & Chief Executive Officer \nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston \n \n \nRemarks to the Massachusetts Chapter of  \nNAIOP, the Commercial Real Estate  \nDevelopment Association \n \n \nMay 4, 2011  \n \n  \n  \nI would like to thank David Begelfer and his colleagues at NAIOP Massachusetts for \ninviting me to join you today to discu ss the economy and mo netary policy.   \nI am happy that financial markets and the economy have made significant progress since \nthe depths of the financial crisis, but I am far le ss happy that the recovery  to date has been so \nundesirably slow and anemic.  In my reading of economic history this is , unfortunately, typical \nof economic downturns that are accompanied by severe financial disruptions. \n\n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, Ma y 4, 2011 at 8:05 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY * \n \n2 \n The debate I’d like to focus on today is the on e over the likely impact of recent increases \nin the prices of food and energy, a nd how monetary policy should respond.*  The Fed’s policy \nstance, as you know, is currently very accommoda tive – a stance that I believe is appropriate \ngiven the tentative reco very and still-high unemployment.  But with food and energy prices \nrising, some observers think the Fed should sh ift its stance to less accommodation – slowing \neconomic growth now to ensure we don’t have un desirably high inflation in the future – even \nthough current measures of core inflation (tha t is, inflation omitting volatile food and energy \nprices) remain low by hist orical standards.    \nAs the recovery continues – albeit slowly – several events have occurred that further \ncomplicate the outlook for inflation and real economi c activity.   Political upheaval in the Middle \nEast has contributed to sharply higher oil prices.  Severe weat her has reduced harvests from \nRussia to Australia, causing higher prices for many agricultural pr oducts.  And Japan’s tragic \nearthquake and tsunami caused not on ly terrible loss of life, but also  disruption to a supply chain \nthat is increasingly global. \nSo today I would like to discuss how moneta ry policy should react when the economy is \nbuffeted by a series of these so-cal led “supply shocks.”  I’d like to  just highlight my major points \nbefore getting into the data and anal ysis that underpin my perspective. \nFirst, I want to explain that while I will be making distinctions in this talk between so-\ncalled “core” and overall or total measures of inflation, we at the Federal Reserve look at all \nprices, including food and energy prices, when developing U.S. monetary policy.  While we \n                                                             \n \n* Of course, the views I express today are my own, not  necessarily those of my colleagues on the Board of \nGovernors or the Federal Open Market Committee (the FOMC). \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, Ma y 4, 2011 at 8:05 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY * \n \n3 \n often use core measures as a gui de to where overall inflation is most likely to go, our goal is to \nstabilize overall inflation. \nAllow me to preview one of my conclusions.  Because my analysis suggests that recent \nfood and oil price increases have their roots in concerns  about wheat harvests in Russia and oil \nproduction in Libya and the like, I do not believe that monetary po licy is the appropriate tool to \nrespond to these disruptions.  While many observe rs see food and energy prices rising and \nassume the Fed should tighten polic y – raise the cost of money and credit – to head off inflation, \nI would suggest taking a step back and recogni zing that tighter U.S. monetary policy will do \nnothing to stabilize Libyan oil pr oduction, reduce uncertain ty about political st ability in the rest \nof the Middle East, or increase th e wheat harvest in Russia.   \nIn fact, tightening monetary policy solely in  response to contractionary supply shocks \nwould likely make the impact of the shocks worse  for households and businesses. To see why \nthis is so, it is important to keep in  mind how supply shocks affect the economy.1   \nFirst, supply shocks can lead  to increases in food and ener gy prices that slow economic \ngrowth.  For example, because a person’s need to drive may not be very flexible, spending on gas consumes a bigger portion of their budget.  So an oil shock tends to force consumers to \nreduce their spending on other goods and serv ices as they absorb higher oil costs.\n2     \nSecond, while the prices of goods directly a ffected by the supply disruption increase, \nother prices in the marketplace may be unaffect ed – at least initiall y.  If the supply shock \ninvolves food or energy, this dynamic causes measures of total inflation to rise, but does not \nhave a large impact on what economists call core inflation – which excludes the volatile food \nand energy sectors.  But in the longer-run, the impact of the supply shock on the prices of other  \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, Ma y 4, 2011 at 8:05 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY * \n \n4 \n goods will depend importantly on how inflation expectations  respond to the shock.  If people \nexpect that food and energy prices will stabilize – in other words, that the price shock will be \ntemporary – and do not believe that the central bank will allow any long-run effect on inflation, \nthen the disruption to total inflation will likely  be temporary and the total inflation rate will \neventually converge with the lowe r core inflation rate.  Since 1986, this has largely been what \nhappened when we experienced these types of supply shocks – as I’ll illustrate in a moment with some charts.   \nAlternatively, if expectations of inflation do rise in res ponse to the supply shock, then \n(nominal) wages and salaries across the economy w ill be pressured to increase over time to keep \npace.  If that happens, the supply shock could affect prices throughout the economy – not just \nthose that that were part of the initial supply shock.  In this case , the core rate of inflation rises to \nconverge with the higher measure of total inflat ion.  This was the U.S.  experience in the 1970s, \nfor reasons I’ll discuss in a moment. \nWe at the Fed need to very closely monitor th e data to make sure that inflation remains \ncontained.  And we will.  But as I believe I will  demonstrate this morning, the most likely result \nis that these supply shocks cause slower growth  in the near term while having only a modest \neffect on longer-term inflation rates – which has been the U.S. experience since 1986.   \nUnemployment remains quite elevated, at 8.8 pe rcent, and I anticipate a slower return to \nfull employment than we would have experience d absent these supply shocks.  With the core \ninflation rate over the prior year at a little above 1 percent, I antic ipate only a gradual return of \ncore and total inflation rates to something like our consensus “stable” ra te of about 2 percent, \nover the medium term.   \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, Ma y 4, 2011 at 8:05 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY * \n \n5 \n If the economic data continue to support this outlook then the current, accommodative \nstance of monetary policy is appropriate, and can remain in place and continue to support \neconomic growth – so that we continue to make  progress toward our goal s of returning to full \nemployment and a sustainable long -run inflation rate – the two elements of the Federal Reserve’s \ndual mandate from Congress. \n \nThe Impact of Recent Supply Shocks \nNow that you know my basic take on this ke y – and current – econom ic debate, allow me \nto flesh out my perspective with the supporting data  and analysis. The full impact of the recent \nshocks to supply that I mentioned at the outset will likely emerge over time.  But clearly there \nhave been significant increases in a va riety of food and energy prices.  As Figure 1  illustrates, \nthe recent turmoil in the Middle East has contribute d to a significant increase in oil prices, which \nhave risen to over $100 a barrel.  This is we ll above the average of nearly $80 a barrel \nexperienced over 2010, but at the same time stil l well below the peak of $146 a barrel that \noccurred in mid July, 2008.    \nThe recent volatility in oil prices, as the ch art shows, is quite striking.  Sharp increases \nhave been followed by sharp decreases.  This is one reason we may not want to overreact to price \nchanges – they could be transitory.   \nFigure 2  shows the movements in oil prices – their percent change from a year earlier, in \nthe top line – relative to the cha nge in compensation (the lower li ne), since 2000.  Oil prices have \nrisen recently, but based on the history captured in this chart, one would not expect much of a \nresponse in wages and salaries.  This, of course, is one reason why consumers feel worse off \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, Ma y 4, 2011 at 8:05 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY * \n \n6 \n after an oil supply shock.  Prices at gas st ations in Massachusetts  are now around $4.00 a gallon, \nyet most people’s need to drive cars has not chan ged much if at all.  So income available for \nbuying other goods and services has been s queezed by the increas e in oil prices.3 \nSome softness in measures of consumer c onfidence suggests that consumers tend to be \nless confident about the future when oil prices ri se.  If consumers pull back spending as a result \nof a supply shock, it has the potential to be a dr ag on the economy.  The Boston Fed’s statistical \nmodeling suggests that a $20 increase in the price of a barrel of oil will shave roughly four-tenths \nof a percentage point off the rate of ec onomic growth over two years, and cause the \nunemployment rate to be roughly two-tenths of a pe rcentage point higher th an it would be absent \nthe oil shock.  While this is cer tainly not enough to completely st op the recovery, it does imply a \nslowing down of its pace. \nOil is not the only commodity to experience price increases  of late.  A variety of \nagricultural prices have also increased.  For example, Figure 3  shows the movement of wheat \nprices over the last decade.  Droughts in Russia,  flooding in Australia, and increased demand in \nemerging markets have all placed upwa rd pressure on wheat prices.   \nAs with oil prices, higher food prices app ear to be responding to supply and demand \nfeatures of this market – and th ese types of price cha nges cannot be offset by monetary policy.  It \ngoes without saying that monetary  policy cannot alter the supply of  oil from volatile parts of the \nworld, nor weather conditions in countries that are major exporte rs of agricultural products.   \nMonetary policy can have a role in insuring that relativ e price changes do not alter inflation \nexpectations.  Rising inflation expectations could make it diffi cult to achieve a moderate and \nacceptable inflation rate over the medium term. \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, Ma y 4, 2011 at 8:05 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY * \n \n7 \n Historical Experience with Supply Shocks \n Supply shocks are not unique to this pe riod.  However, the evidence shows that the \neconomic impact of supply shocks on infla tion has changed over time – actually quite \ndramatically.  Figure 4  shows the inflation rate  (total inflation and co re, which again excludes \nfood and energy) since 1970.  What is striking is the way the behavior of the two series differed \nin the 1970 to 1985 period versus the period from 1986 to the present.  The interplay of core and \ntotal inflation is very, very different in the mo re recent period than it was in the former.   \nI realize that delving into topics like total a nd core inflation can seem a bit abstract.  So \nlet me bring in something a bit straight forward – energy prices and inflation.  Figure 5  shows the \nprofound effect that energy prices had in the 197 0s on core inflation.  In the 1970s the lines \nmove up and down together as co re inflation increased with en ergy prices.  That is why my \nearlier chart shows core and to tal inflation moving so closely in that era.  But since 1986, \ndramatic movements in energy prices have not affected core prices.   \nMy next two figures look at each period separately.  Figure 6  shows that for much of that \nearlier period, inflation rates were much higher than they are currently.  From 1970 to 1985, \ninflation was quite volatile – with total inflation (measured by the all-items Consumer Price Index or CPI) peaking at almost 15 percent, in 1980.  The key observation is that during this \nperiod, increases in core inflati on tended to follow increases in total inflation (which includes \nfood and energy).  The oil and food pri ce increases “pulled”  core inflation. \n In contrast, Figure 7  shows the total and core inflat ion rates since 1986.  During this \nperiod, inflation has been lower a nd less volatile.  And unlike in th e earlier period, core inflation \ndoes not follow or gravitate to the level of total inflation.  To tal inflation jumps up and down as \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, Ma y 4, 2011 at 8:05 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY * \n \n8 \n food and energy prices live up to their repu tation for volatility.  The spikes are tough on \nhouseholds, to be sure.  But importa ntly, total inflation ev entually gravitates to the core measure \nthat excludes food and energy.  Co re inflation stays “moored.” \nFigure 8  represents another way to use the availabl e data to explore th is relationship.  It \ntoo shows that the increases in to tal inflation in recent years have  generally been temporary.  For \neach quarter from 1998 to 2010, the figure plots the difference between total inflation and core \ninflation at the time, and the total inflation rate tw o years later.  What it shows is that when there \nis a supply shock such that total inflation ( including  food and energy) exceeds core inflation, two \nyears later total inflation tends to be lower – when  supply shocks such as oil prices drive up total \ninflation relative to core, the total tends to co me back down toward the core inflation rate. \nFigure 9 performs similar analysis but focuses on the future core inflation rate, instead of \nthe total.  It shows no strong rela tionship.  When total and core in flation diverge, core inflation \ntends to stay put.  In other words, in recent year s, when something like an oil shock causes total \ninflation to diverge from core, there was no consis tent implication for the future core inflation \nrate. The shock to total inflation did not become embedded in core inflation. \n Why is all this important?  If supply shocks tend to have a transito ry impact on headline \ninflation, and do not pass through to  any meaningful extent into core inflation, then monetary \npolicy need not respond to the pr ice increases caused by the supply shock.  Currently, we have \nexperienced sharply higher food and energy prices.  If the relationship we document over the last \n13 years continues, we should expect the impact on inflation to be transitory – and that total \ninflation will converge back to core infla tion, which remains well below 2 percent.   \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, Ma y 4, 2011 at 8:05 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY * \n \n9 \n To digress, it is likely the case that supply shocks have become transitory because of the \nway in which monetary policy has tended to re spond.  So, as long as monetary policy behaves \nabout as it has in recent years, then there is no reason to expect supply sh ocks to have lasting \neffects.   \nSo is Fed policy behaving as it has sin ce the mid 1980s?  Interestingly, although Fed \npolicy is perceived as exceptionally accommodati ve, because of hitting the zero lower bound the \nfederal funds rate is actually higher – has come down less – than would be expected if the Fed \nbehaved as it has over the last 25 years.  The current level of the funds rate suggest that we have \nbeen less accommodative in recent years given that in terest-rate reductions (policy easing) ran \ninto at the zero lower bound.4 \n \nWhy the Different Reaction to Supply Shocks Over Time? \nBut how confident should we be that the rela tionship we have experienced over the past \n25 years – little response in medium term infla tion rates to supply shocks – will continue?  The \nanswer is rooted in why we are seeing different  reactions to supply shoc ks – in other words a \ndifferent interplay of total and core inflation – now versus in the past. \nThere are a variety of reasons why medium -term inflation has not  been significantly \ninfluenced by short-run supply shocks in recent  years.  In my view the reasons include the \nincreased role of services in the economy, the im portance of labor costs in  such an economy, the \nreduced share of oil consump tion relative to GDP, and as I mentioned earlier the improved \nconduct of monetary policy versus the 1960s and 1970s.5   \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, Ma y 4, 2011 at 8:05 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY * \n \n10 \n Figure 10  shows that the service sector has grow n from a little over 60 percent of private \nsector employment in 1970 to a little over 80 percent in 2010.  As th e economy has come to \nemphasize services versus manufacturing, it ma y be that commodities (and thus their prices) \nhave become somewhat less important to the production of goods and services.  And goods \nprices are more volatile than services prices, and more likely to be pr iced like commodities. \n Figure 11  shows the per capita consumption of o il declining in the United States.   \nConservation measures by consumers and busine sses have made the economy less dependent on \noil than in the 1970s.  While oil remains a very  important commodity, th e trend towards reducing \ndependence on oil provides greater insu lation from oil-induced supply shocks. \n Figure 12 shows the U.S. share of world oil cons umption (in blue) ticking down, but also \nclearly shows (in red) the steady climb in the sh are consumed by three of the so-called emerging-\nmarket economies – China, India, and Brazil.  Figure 13 shows the growth in oil consumption in \nthose three countries, in the upper three lines.  Both charts depict  quite strikingly the heightened \ndemand for oil emanating from emerging markets.  \nReturning to the U.S. and inflation concerns, Figure 14  shows that the growth rate of \nemployee compensation has generally been d eclining over the past two decades.  With \ncompensation slowing and productivi ty increasing, many firms have been profitable and able to \nwithstand increases in commodity prices without passing su ch costs on to final prices.  This fits \nwith the observation that higher food and energy pr ices have not tended to  have much of an \nimpact on prices in situations where food and energy are not direct costs of doing business. \n Figure 15  shows two measures of inflation expectations, plotted alongside oil price \nmovements.  The red line shows what professiona l forecasters expected inflation to average over \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, Ma y 4, 2011 at 8:05 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY * \n \n11 \n the next 10 years, at various points in time.  Th eir expectations have declined somewhat over the \npast 20 years, but what is striking is the relative  stability of their inflation expectations.  In \naddition, there was no significant reaction to the oil price shock that we experienced in 2008.  \nThe chart also shows a second measure of inflati on expectations – the Un iversity of Michigan \nSurvey (the green line), which asks respondents about their expectations for inflation over the \nnext 5 to 10 years6.  Again these expectations are not very  responsive to movements in oil prices, \nand have remained quite stable over the past two decades. \nIt is worth noting that countries can be aff ected quite differently by supply shocks.  As \nFigure 16  shows, the importance of food in the “b asket” of goods purchased by consumers can \nvary greatly by country.  In le ss developed countries, food is a very significant component of \noverall purchases by consumers.  In a developed country such as the United States, food is a \nmuch smaller share of overall purchases.  Thus the impact of  a food-supply shock on the overall \ninflation rate and on other important economic va riables such as wages and total imports can \nvary widely by country.  Given th e different impacts of supply s hocks, it is not surprising that \nmonetary policy is likely to react differently to a supply shock such as food, depending on the \nunique characteristics of the particular country. \nFigure 17  shows that in the Unite d States, the importance of  food as a component of \ninflation measures has been declining over time.  And, despite improvements in energy \nconservation that have lowered the per capita c onsumption of oil, high er energy prices have \ncontributed to recent increases in the importance of  energy in the consumer price index.  The fact \nthat food and energy prices have been quite volat ile recently, but remain a relatively small part of \nthe entire basket of goods, helps to explain why core in flation rates have not  been particularly \nresponsive to food and energy shocks. \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, Ma y 4, 2011 at 8:05 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY * \n \n12 \n Concluding Observations \n In conclusion, I recognize that recent supply shocks have caused pressures on many \nhousehold budgets, and have led some analysts  and observers to become concerned about \npotential long-term inflationary im pacts.  However, I think the evid ence shows that over the past \n25 years most supply shocks have been transi tory – and have had no long-lasting imprint on \nlonger term inflation, or on inflation expectations.   \nNonetheless, recent historical trends do not al ways continue, so it is important to monitor \ninflation dynamics very closely to make sure that this pattern is continuing  in the incoming data.  \nIn particular, I will look intently  at whether there is any evid ence that the expectations of \nunderlying inflation have change d.  To date, expectations se em quite stable and show no \nevidence of diverging from the recent past.  I am committed to responding decisively, and as \nforcefully as necessary, to ensure  that long-term inflation expect ations remain stable and that \nfood and energy price increases are not passing through to other prices.7  \n Given the important role of labor costs in a developed, services-focused economy such as \nthe United States, it is important to closely mon itor trends in labor markets.  Currently, wages \nand salaries are reflecting he ightened unemployment, and show no evidence that potential \ninflation concerns are pl acing upward pressure on wages and salaries.   \n Core inflation rates tend to be a reasonable predictor of inflation in the intermediate term.  \nCore inflation remains well below my long-run target  for inflation.  This gi ves us flexibility to \nfocus on accommodative monetary policy doing what it can to promote more rapid growth in the \neconomy.  As Figure 18 illustrates, the percent of the adult population that is employed now is \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, Ma y 4, 2011 at 8:05 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY * \n \n13 \n quite low in relation to recent hi story, and has shown only a slight improvement over the course \nof the recovery.   \nSo with significant slack in labor markets, st able inflation expectati ons, and core inflation \nwell below our longer run target, there is currently no reason to  slow the economy down with \ntighter monetary policy.  Until we make more progress on both elements of the Federal \nReserve’s mandate – employment and inflation – the current, accommodative stance of monetary \npolicy is appropriate. \n Thank you.  \n \n                                                             \n \nNOTES: \n \n1 My colleague Geoffrey Tootell, Direct or of Research at the Boston Fed, ha s prepared an illuminating public policy \nbrief that investigates whether commodity price spikes cause  long-term inflation.  The brief, which will be available \nat http://www.bostonfed.org/eco nomic/ppb/2011/ppb111.htm , examines the relationship between trend inflation and \ncommodity price increases and finds that  evidence from recent decades sup ports the notion that commodity price \nchanges do not affect the lo ng-run inflation rate.  Evidence from earlier decades suggests that effects on inflation \nexpectations and wages played a key role in whether commodity price movements altered trend inflation.   \n \n2 Readers may be interested in “Oil and the Macroecono my in a Changing World,” the proceedings of a 2010 \nsymposium held at the Boston Fed to explore the interac tions between energy prices, growth, and inflation – the \ndeterminants of oil prices and about the effect that o il prices have on the world economy.  The proceedings are \navailable at http://www.bostonfed.org/economic/conf/oil2010/index.htm  \n3 Even future purchases can be affect ed, if saving for them is squeezed. \n \n4 The Fed’s Large-Scale Asset Purchases have partly, but not completely, substituted for the constraint imposed by \nthe zero lower bound on policy easing.  With all the excess capacity — a reflection of our inability to be as \naccommodative as we might have liked, given the zero bound — it seems unlikely that supp ly shocks will turn into \nincreased inflation expectations that will a ffect wages and non-oil, non-food prices.  \n \n5 Vice Chair Yellen notes that “a key lesson from the experi ence of the late 1960s and 1970s is that the stability of \nlonger-run inflation expectations cannot be taken for granted. At that time, the Federal Reserve's monetary policy \nframework was opaque, its measures of resource utilization were flawed, and its policy actions generally followed a \nstop-start pattern that undermined public confidence in the Federal Reserve's commitment to keep inflation under \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, Ma y 4, 2011 at 8:05 A.M.

Consequently, longer-term inflation expectations became unmoored, and nominal wages and prices spiraled \nupward as workers sought compensation for past price increases and as firm s responded to accelerating labor costs \nwith further increases in prices. That wage-price spiral  was eventually arrested by the Federal Reserve under \nChairman Paul Volcker, but only at the cost of a severe recession in the early 1980s. Since then the Federal Reserve \nhas remained determined to avoid these mistak es and to keep inflation low and stable.” \n[http://www.federalreserv e.gov/newsevents/speech /yellen20110411a.htm]  \n \n6 The average annual expected price change they expect over the next 5 to 10 years \n \n7 See for example the comments on commodity price pressures and monetary policy by my colleague William \nDudley, president of the New York Fe deral Reserve Bank and Vice Chair of the Federal Open Market Committee:  \n“Inflation expectations are well-anchored today and we intend to keep it that way. A sustained rise in medium-term \ninflation expectations would represent a threat to our price stability mandate and would not be tolerated.” \n[http://www.newyorkfed.org/newseven ts/speeches/2011/dud110228.html]   \n\nHow Should Monetary Policy \nRespond to Price Increases \nDriven by Supply Shocks?\nEric S.

EASTERN TIME OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nThe Debate…\nWhat’s the likely impact of increasing food \nand energy prices?\nHow should monetary policy respond?\nAccommodative monetary policy appropriate \ngiven anemic recovery, high unemployment\nGiven food and energy prices, some say policy \nshould be less accommodative\n2\n\nNew Supply Shocks\nPolitical upheaval in the Middle East:\n…higher oil prices\nSevere weather affecting global harvests: \n…higher prices for agricultural products\nJapan’s tragedy: \n…disruption in global supply chain\n3\n\nAn Important Distinction\nThe Fed looks at allprices, including food \nand energy, when developing policy\nCore measures of inflation take out \nvolatile food and energy\nOften we use core as a guide to where \noverall inflation is likely to go\nBut our goal is to stabilize overall inflation\n4\n\nEffects of a Supply Shock:\nNear Term\nA supply shock can slow economic growth \n(reduces spending on other things)\nOther prices may be initially unaffected –\ntotal inflation rises, but not core inflation\nMonetary tightening would likely worsen the\nshock’s impact for households and businesses\n5\n\nEffects of a Supply Shock:\nLonger Term\nLonger -run impact on other prices depends \non how inflation expectations respond…\nIf people expect it’s temporary and the central bank \nwill act, then the rise in total inflation will be temporary:\ntotal will converge with core ( …the experience since 1986 )\nIf inflation expectations do rise, then wages and \nsalaries will be pressured to increase in time to keep \npace:\nother prices will be affected and core will converge with \ntotal ( …the experience in the 1970s and early 1980s )\n6\n\nMy Outlook\nThe Fed will ensure that inflation remains  \ncontained over time\nSupply shocks will bring slower growth near term; \nonly modest effects on longer -term inflation\nUnemployment is high (8.8%); shocks mean a \nsomewhat slower return to full employment\nCore inflation is low (a bit above 1% in prior year)\nThus the current accommodative stance of monetary \npolicy is appropriate, and can continue to support\ngrowth and both elements of

I would like to thank Josef Tos ovsky and the Financial St ability Institute for \ninviting me to speak today on financial stability a nd on regulatory and supervis ory priorities in the \nUnited States.  I would also like to thank Serg ey Ignatiev and the Central Bank of the Russian \nFederation for hosting this  very important event.\n1   \nI think it is crucial that we continue to share perspectives on financial stability and related \nissues.*   Clearly the events of the past four years have heightened our awareness of how \ninterconnected our economies, our financial institu tions, and our financial markets have become.  \nWhen large global financial intermediari es become troubled, it impacts not just home  country \n                                                 \n* Of course, the views I express today are my own, not necessarily those of my colleagues on the \nFederal Reserve’s Board of Governors or the Federal Open Market Committee (the FOMC). \n\n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Tuesday, May 24, 2011, at 2:00 a.m. U.S. Eastern Ti me and 10:00 a.m. in St. Petersb urg, Russia – or Upon Delive ry * \n \n \n \n 2borrowers and, potentially, taxpayers; but increa singly can also have collateral impacts on host \ncountries and their financial markets.  Much has been learned in the United States over the past four y ears about gaps in our \nregulatory and supervisory framework.  One response to  the gaps revealed duri ng the financial crisis \nwas the adoption of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act.  It ushered in \nsignificant changes and also requir ed numerous studies to be undert aken, and new regulations to be \nconsidered and promulgated.  Much of this work is still in process.   \nSome of the most significant as pects of the Dodd-Frank legisl ation involve seeking greater \nclarity in the resolution procedures for comple x financial holding companies that experience \ndifficulties; creating a Financial Stability Oversight Council; esta blishing a Consumer Financial \nProtection Bureau intended to addr ess gaps in consumer protection;  and increasing regulatory powers \nover, and focus on, systemically im portant financial institutions. \n A second major change resulting from the fina ncial crisis has been a reappraisa l of the \nquantity and quality of capital needed to avoid a reo ccurrence.  This matter is clearly critical to the \nBasel III discussions taking place he re over the next two days; but, I would note, has already been the \nfocus of two supervisory exercises conducted in the United States.   \nAs I will describe in more detail in a moment, during a financial crisis investors focus on how \nmuch “core” or “pure” capital exists in an orga nization to absorb immediate and near-term losses.\n2  \nSome of the broader definitions of capital include elements that are not actually readily available to \nabsorb losses.  Capital meeting the broader defi nitions was largely ignore d by investors during the \nintense phases of the crisis, leading to significant financial runs and liquidity problems at institutions whose capital, using the broader definitions, actually  satisfied existing regulatory standards.  As \nconditions deteriorated, ma rket focus shifted from the relative strength implied by regulatory capital \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Tuesday, May 24, 2011, at 2:00 a.m. U.S. Eastern Ti me and 10:00 a.m. in St. Petersb urg, Russia – or Upon Delive ry * \n \n \n \n 3ratios to the vulnerabilities asso ciated with deteriorating measures  of “pure” capital.  This led to \ngreater uncertainty and ultimately to liquidity stresses. \nThe experience in the United States  during the crisis is instructiv e as we think about where we \nshould focus our attention in terms of bank capital, as well as in terms of supervision.  On the latter, I \nwould note that stress testing has prov ed to be an important supervisor y tool in the United States for \njudging the quality and quantity of capital. \n Before delving into the details, I’d like to give you a preview of my main points: \n \n• First, I would like to discuss capital and th e financial crisis, and will suggest that many \nU.S. financial institutions did not have the quality or quantity of capital needed to \nwithstand the shocks we recently experience d.  The focus in Basel III on improving the \nquantity and quality of capital at financial inst itutions – particularly systemically important \nfinancial institutions – is critically important. \n \n• Second, I will suggest that we should be part icularly focused on narrow definitions of \ncapital, which are what investors fo cused on during the financial crisis. \n \n• Third, I will suggest that stress tests are an important supervis ory tool that should be used \nfor prudential and macroprudential3 supervision as well as fo r management’s own capital \nplanning efforts.  The rapid re capitalization of many financia l institutions in the United \nStates greatly benefitted from the attention during supervisory exercises (including stress \ntests) on the quantity and quality of capital.   I will also discuss the evaluation of \ndiscretionary capital distributions (such as  increasing dividends,  and stock buybacks). \n \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Tuesday, May 24, 2011, at 2:00 a.m. U.S. Eastern Ti me and 10:00 a.m. in St. Petersb urg, Russia – or Upon Delive ry * \n \n \n \n 4Capital and the Financial Crisis \nI think it is instructiv e to look at the capital ratios of two of the very large banking \norganizations that encountered problems and we re acquired during the financial crisis.   \nWachovia was one of the four largest banking or ganizations in the Unite d States, with total \nassets in 2008 exceeding $700 billion.  As a result of  large exposure to subprime mortgages, partially \nas a result of an acquisition of a large Califor nia thrift, investors became concerned about the \nsolvency of Wachovia.  A loss of confidence in Wachovia led depositors, funders, and investors –  \nthose on the liability side of the bank’s balance sheet – to  withdraw, pressuring th e institution to sell \nitself.  After a short bidding war between Wells  Fargo and Citigroup, Wells Fargo prevailed and \nacquired Wachovia at the end of 2008. \nWashington Mutual or “WaMu” was the larges t savings and loan holding company in the \nUnited States, with assets over $300 billion.  WaMu  had grown rapidly, with a large exposure to \nresidential real estate and a larg e concentration of both variable ra te and subprime mortgages.  Large \ndepositors became concerned about the solvency of WaMu in September 2008 and began rapidly withdrawing funds.  The instituti on failed later that month (on Sept ember 25) and was acquired by JP \nMorgan Chase. \nFigure 1  provides the capital ratios reported in the last fina ncial filing for both Wachovia and \nWashington Mutual.  The most  narrow definition of capital,\n4 tangible common equity, is a measure of \ncapital widely used by investors (and increasingly so during the crisis) because it focuses on the \n“core” capital readily available to cushion the bank against losses.  The tangible capital measure – \nspecifically the ratio of tangible common equity to tangible assets – was a bit above 2 percent for \nWachovia and about 3 percent for WaMu,5 providing only a small cushion against the losses \naccumulating from their subprime exposures.   \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Tuesday, May 24, 2011, at 2:00 a.m. U.S. Eastern Ti me and 10:00 a.m. in St. Petersb urg, Russia – or Upon Delive ry * \n \n \n \n 5The regulatory capital ratios use broader definitions of capital, re lative to risk-weighted assets.  \nTo be considered adequately  capitalized, a bank needs to have at  least 4 percent Tier 1 risk-based \ncapital to risk-weighted assets, and at least 8 percent total risk-based capital to risk-weighted assets.  \nTo be well capitalized a bank needs to have at least 6 percent Tier 1 risk-b ased capital to risk-\nweighted assets and at least 10 percent total risk-based capi tal to risk-weighted assets.6  Figure 1 \nshows that under these definitions both banks were well capitalized in their final quarter – despite the fact that more narrow definitions of capita l indicated only a very small capital buffer. \nFigure 2  plots the capital ratios for the period leading up to the “run” on Wachovia.  The \nbroader definitions of capital – Tier 1 a nd total risk-based capital – were actually rising  in the period \nwhen holders of Wachovia’s liabili ties were becoming concerned, and thus the broader definitions of \ncapital were not particularly informative.  The more narrow definitions of capital – Tier 1 common \nand tangible common equity – were both declining fairly substantially.   \nIn retrospect, the quality and quantity of capita l was not sufficient for the kind of financial \nshocks experienced in the United States in the cr isis.  Under the Basel I II proposals there is much \nmore attention being given to the quality and quantity of capital.  My own view is that this heightened \nfocus is appropriate, and that the pa rticular capital that truly serves as a cushion against losses during \nperiods of stress should be regulators’ primary focus. \nFigure 3  highlights that since the worst phase  of the crisis, 15 large U.S. banking \norganizations that have reported continuously through the crisis have made significant progress in \nimproving both the quality and quantity of their cap ital.  The most narrow capital definition on the \nchart – the ratio of tangible common equity to tangi ble assets – has risen from a little over 2 percent to \nalmost 6 percent.  This reflects bo th significant raising of external cap ital as well as dramatic declines \nin dividends and stock buybacks dur ing the crisis and the early peri od of recovery.  Both of these \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Tuesday, May 24, 2011, at 2:00 a.m. U.S. Eastern Ti me and 10:00 a.m. in St. Petersb urg, Russia – or Upon Delive ry * \n \n \n \n 6dynamics have had a significant positive impact on the institutions’ ability to withstand potential \nfuture stresses. \nFigure 4  illustrates the amount and composition of  capital – the numerators of the various \ncapital ratios – at the 15 large ba nking organizations over a four-year period.  You can see that there \nhas been an appreciable amount of common equ ity raised by this group of large banks.   \nThe improvement in the quality and quantity of capital is quite striking.  An important aspect \nof this recapitalization has been the supervisory use of stress tests to determine the adequacy of capital, and also in evaluating disc retionary capital distributions (suc h as increased dividend payouts).  \nThe supervisory use of the stress test s is relatively new.  It is worth noting and discussing the fact that \nit is not just capital regulation , but also supervision , that has been a driver  of the recapitalization \nprocess. \n \nStress Tests and Improving the Qu antity and Quality of Capital \nNow I would like to delve a bit deeper into th e role that stress testing has played in \nencouraging more rapid recapitalizati on of U.S. banks, during the financial crisis and the early stages \nof the economic recovery.  The U.S. stress test exercise was conducted from February to April of \n2009 – a period of significant financial turmoil, wh en many private-sector analysts and academic \nobservers had raised concerns about the financ ial condition of the U.S. banking industry.  The \nSupervisory Capital Assessment Program (“SCAP”) was designed to provide a rigorous assessment \nand, in doing so, to ensure that banks had suffici ent capital to sustain additional losses and still \ncontinue providing critical cr edit intermediation should economic conditions deteriorate further. \nThe SCAP exercise was conducted with the 19 largest U.S. domiciled bank holding \ncompanies.  Each bank holding company was prov ided a baseline economic scenario and a more \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Tuesday, May 24, 2011, at 2:00 a.m. U.S. Eastern Ti me and 10:00 a.m. in St. Petersb urg, Russia – or Upon Delive ry * \n \n \n \n 7stressful scenario.  The scenarios were based on p ublicly available private forecasts and provided the \nassumed path for real GDP, unemployment, and house prices over the next two years.  Using these assumptions, the banks were asked to  provide detailed portfolio inform ation so that projections could \nbe made on losses in a variety of loan and security  categories, potential trading losses for firms with \nlarge trading operations, pre-provis ion net revenue, and the allowance for loan losses – allowing for \nestimates of capital posit ions under each scenario. \nThe stress tests were interactive, and were qui te resource intensive for both the banks and the \nsupervisors.  The banks’ submissions were compar ed to a detailed portfoli o analysis done by bank \nsupervisors, and to statistical mode ls intended to capture how key vari ables were likely to be affected \nby stressful conditions.   \nWhile individual business-lin e stress tests had been done by bank supervisors, a \ncomprehensive stress test of all th e largest banks at the same time using the same scenarios was new.  \nWhile conducting the tests simultaneously for all 19 banks was challenging and resource intensive, \nthe exercise provided supervisors the ability to ma ke comparisons across institutions using the same \nunderlying assumptions, and allowed the same core s upervisory staff to be involved in assessments \nacross institutions.  Where banks were outliers re lative to peers, supervisors could ask for more \ndetailed information to determine if these differen ces were justified, based on analysis of comparable \ndata.  In addition, the stress test s were forward looking, so that th e evolution of performance and \nresults over the next two years coul d be compared across institutions.   This provided a rigorous, data-\ndriven assessment.  It also highlighted where institutions needed to do additional work relative to peers to improve their ri sk management practices. \nThe banks were evaluated on whether, over the two-year period under stress assumptions, they \nwere likely to be able to maintain a Tier 1 capita l ratio of 6 percent and a Tier 1 common capital ratio \nof 4 percent.  It is worth noting that for most banks it was the Tier 1 common capital ratio that was \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Tuesday, May 24, 2011, at 2:00 a.m. U.S. Eastern Ti me and 10:00 a.m. in St. Petersb urg, Russia – or Upon Delive ry * \n \n \n \n 8most binding, and was the capital defi nition that best reflected the abil ity to absorb losses.  Of the 19 \nbanks, nine were sufficiently capitalized to meet  the minimum capital ratios under stress conditions, \nwhile ten had a combined capit al shortfall of $75 billion. \nThe banks with a capital shortfall were expected  to provide detailed cap ital plans that included \nraising additional capital – by measur es such as restricting payouts, ra ising new equity, selling assets, \nor utilizing capital available from the U.S. Tr easury.  Banks both with and without shortfalls \naggressively sold assets and raised additional capita l, resulting in a very si gnificant recapitalization of \nthe 19 banks over a relatively short period of time – as is apparent in the figures shown earlier. \n \nStress Testing and Discretionary Capital Distributions \nNow I would like to mention the role of othe r stress testing in decisions to pursue, and \napprove, the resumption of discreti onary capital distributi ons.  The SCAP was designed to estimate \nhow banks would perform under stress conditions.  However, the economic assumptions and the \nimpact of those economic assumptions on financial institutions were by definition educated estimates \nof potential outcomes.  By the end of 2010, many banks were noting that they had substantially \nrecapitalized and in some cases were now well above  regulatory minimums – and thus would like to \nresume or increase stock buybacks or dividend payments. \nTo evaluate the requests by banks to increa se dividend payments, U.S. bank supervisors \npursued an exercise known as the Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Re view (CCAR), and stress \ntesting was one component of that broader exercise.  While the stress testing element was only part of \nthe CCAR review, it was an important input into ev aluating banks’ capital pl anning.  The assessment \nwas conducted between November 2010 and March 2011.  Once again the larges t 19 U.S. domiciled \nbank holding companies were asked to participat e, using a baseline scenario, their own stress \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Tuesday, May 24, 2011, at 2:00 a.m. U.S. Eastern Ti me and 10:00 a.m. in St. Petersb urg, Russia – or Upon Delive ry * \n \n \n \n 9scenario, and a supervisor-provided stress scenario (a set of macroeconomic assumptions consistent \nwith an economic downturn).   \nA critical benchmark was whether banks could meet a 5 percent Tier 1 common capital ratio \nunder stress conditions over the next two years, assuming they paid di vidends or carried out the stock \nbuybacks as they proposed.  Additional capital measur es were examined, including the ability to \nsatisfy over time the new Basel III capital ratios and changes in capital required by the Dodd-Frank \nlegislation.  Bank holding companie s were required to provide info rmation on their capital adequacy \nprocesses and capital distribution polic ies, and supervisors assessed them. \nConducting the analysis for all of these inst itutions simultaneously gave supervisors a good \nbenchmark as to how the financial institutions were performing relative to a stress scenario.  In addition to providing a method fo r evaluating capital a ssessments, the stress test that was one \ncomponent of the broader CCAR provided an opportuni ty to determine how financial institutions had \nrefined their ability to conduct stre ss tests and incorporated lessons le arned from the SCAP.  In that \nvein, these types of capital assessm ents are likely to be an important  tool in understanding the capital \nplanning process in the future. \n \nConcluding Observations \nIn conclusion I would note that the financial cr isis highlighted that financial institutions did \nnot have the quality or quantity of  capital they needed.  In particul ar, the broader measures of capital \nwere largely ignored during the crisis by many inve stors as they worried about the “core” capital \nimmediately available to absorb losses.  Thus th e emphasis in Basel III on improving the quality and \nquantity of capital is an important re gulatory response to the financial cr isis.  Clearly we need to focus \non the narrow definitions of capital – that which can readily absorb losses. \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Tuesday, May 24, 2011, at 2:00 a.m. U.S. Eastern Ti me and 10:00 a.m. in St. Petersb urg, Russia – or Upon Delive ry * \n \n \n \n 10The United States has also improved its supe rvision framework based on lessons learned \nduring the crisis.  One of the major additions to the supervisory “toolk it” was the use of stress tests –  \nin the SCAP and then as an important co mponent of the broade r CCAR exercise.   \nThe supervisory and regulatory responses ha ve provided strong encouragement for U.S. \nfinancial institutions to improve their capital ratios,  particularly those ratios most appropriate for \nabsorbing losses during stressful ec onomic periods.  Through retenti on of earnings, asset sales, and \nnew equity issuances, U.S. banks have substantiall y improved their capital ratios since the crisis \nperiod. \nThe severe disruptions and economic dislocations  that occurred during the financial crisis – \naffecting not just institutions, but  individuals throughout the nationa l and global economy – highlight \nthe critical need to maintain a well-capitalized and resilient financial se ctor.  Bank regulation and \nbank supervision – not to mention management practices within financial institutions – all need to continue to evolve to ensure th at during periods of economic or financial distress, organizations \nremain well capitalized so their role in credit intermediation is not disrupted.   \nI hope the analysis and observations  I have shared today can assi st with a process of learning, \nevolving, and improving that will prevent future disruptions. \nThank you. \n                                                   \n \n \n1  These remarks were prepared for delivery at a gatherin g focused on “The New Framework to Strengthen Financial \nStability and Regulatory Priorities”, jointly organized by the Fi nancial Stability Institute and the banking supervisors from \nCentral and Eastern Europe, and hosted by the Central Bank of the Russian Federation.    \n2  Beyond concern over immediate losses, investors may also  focus on the possibility of future losses and the capital \nreadily available to offset them.  \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Tuesday, May 24, 2011, at 2:00 a.m. U.S. Eastern Ti me and 10:00 a.m. in St. Petersb urg, Russia – or Upon Delive ry * \n \n \n \n 11                                                                                                                                                                     \n \n3  Given time constraints, my remarks do not delve into the role of stress tests in macroprudential supervision.  In my \nview, stress tests benefit macroprudential supervision in that (a) they embed an explicit link to macroeconomic scenarios and (b) they focus on the ability of the financial system as a whole to provide intermediation services to the real economy \nrather than just on the solvency of individual institutions.  \n \n4  Four measures of capital are referenced in this speech, tota l risk-based capital, Tier 1 risk -based capital, Tier 1 common \ncapital, and tangible common equity:   \n Total risk-based capital  includes core capital elements (Tier 1 capita l) plus supplementary capital elements (Tier 2 \ncapital).   \n Tier 1 risk-based capital  is defined in the Capital Adequacy Guidelines for Bank Holding Companies:  Risk-Based \nMeasures (12 CFR part 225, Appendix A) as the sum of co re capital elements less any amounts of goodwill, other \nintangible assets, interest-only strips recei vables, deferred tax assets, nonfinancial equity investments, and other items that  \nare required to be deducted in accordance with section II.B. of this appendix.  Ti er 1 capital must represent at least 50 \npercent of qualifying total capital.” The sp ecific elements included in Tier 1 capita l and their various limits, restrictions, \nand deductions are discussed in detail in 12 CFR part 225, Appendix A.   \n Tier 2 capital includes supplementary items  such as qualifying subordinated debt and a portion of the allowance for loan \nand lease losses.  See 12 CFR part 225, Appendix A for a full discussion of the items included in Tier 2 capital and the \nassociated limits, restrictions and deductions.   \n Tier 1 common capital  as defined for the Supervisory Capital Assessment Program is the portion of Tier 1 capital that is \ncommon equity, or Tier 1 capital less perpetual preferred stoc k, minority interests and trust preferred securities that \nqualified as Tier 1 capital.   \n Tangible common equity  is defined as total equity capital less perpetua l preferred stock and related surplus (net of \nrelated treasury stock), goodwill an d other intangible assets.   \n Four capital ratios are also calculated.  The denominator for three ratios -- the Ti er 1 risk-based capital ratio, the total \nrisk-based capital ratio and the Tier 1 common capital ratio -- is risk-weighted assets.  The denominator for the tangible \ncommon equity ratio is tangible assets, defined as to tal assets less goodwill and other intangible assets. \n \n5  It had been under 2 percent. \n \n6  These guidelines apply to the individual bank subsidiaries within a bank holding company. \n\nA U.S. Perspective on \nStrengthening Financial Stability\nEric S.

Rosengren \nPresident & Chief Executive Officer \nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston \n \nKeynote Remarks at the Stanford Finance Forum \nGraduate School of Business \nStanford University \n \nJune 3, 2011 \n \n \n \nIt is a pleasure to be here with you today.  I would especially  like to thank Darrell Duffie for \ninviting me to Stanford to talk about financial stability.  I am glad to be  here to take part in this very \nconstructive forum. \nOf course, the views I express today are my ow n, not necessarily those of my colleagues on \nthe Federal Reserve’s Board of Governors or th e Federal Open Market Committee (the FOMC). \n The topic of financial stability is receivi ng increased attention in both academic and non-\nacademic settings, as we all try to incorporate less ons from the financial crisis.  The challenge of \nincorporating the lessons of the crisis is made mo re difficult, in part, beca use there is no one clear \ndefinition of financial stab ility (and instability).   \nInterestingly, while the Dodd-Frank Act focuse s on financial stability, the term is never \nactually defined in the legi slation.  Perhaps the absence of a defi nition in the legislation reflects the \n\n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL 12:30 PM Pacific time and 3:30 PM Eastern time, or upon delivery * \n \n \n \n 2reality that the concept is define d quite differently by different pe ople.  I should note that the new \nFinancial Services Oversight Committee (FSOC) created by the Dodd-Frank legislation has been \nexploring defining the term.1   \nThe Dodd-Frank legislation seems primarily focused on addressing the failure of large \nfinancial institutions and payments systems, whic h was certainly a gap that  warrants attention.  \nHowever, a large interconnected fa ilure is only one of several ways that a systemic problem can \nemerge.  I believe the examples I will discuss today highlight the importance of focusing on systemic issues and not just the potential for large bank failures being disruptive.  \nOthers – including some academics, politicians, a nd financial analysts – have argued that the \npursuit of financial stability should address a variety of things such as volatility in financial markets, \nclustered failures of financial institutions, or asset bubbl es (while at the ea rly stages of their \ndevelopment).  So it is important  to clarify the definition.   \nThe reason this is so important is that clar ity of definition will he lp us frame the policy \nresponse – and identify what problems we will seek  to solve and, equally importantly, what problems \nwe will not.  Knowing these parameters is in turn critical to identifying the needed supervisory and \nregulatory tools. \nSo, for the purposes of this talk I will provide  my own definition of financial stability – one \nthat I suspect can be helpful to the policy disc ussion – and then discuss how I would apply this \ndefinition, with some examples. \nFinancial stability\n reflects the ability of the financial system to consistently \nsupply the credit intermediation and payme nt services that are needed in the \nreal economy if it is to co ntinue on its growth path. \n Financial instability\n occurs when problems (or concerns about potential \nproblems) within institutions, markets,  payments systems, or the financial \nsystem in general significantly impai r the supply of credit intermediation \nservices – so as to substantially impa ct the expected path of real economic \nactivity. \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL 12:30 PM Pacific time and 3:30 PM Eastern time, or upon delivery * \n \n \n \n 3 \nTo summarize and perhaps simplify a bit further,  my definition of financial instability has \nthree key elements: problems in the financial system , impairment of intermed iation (or the supply of \nit), and a substantial im pact on the real economy. \nClearly the central theme is financial or cr edit intermediation servic es (and their supporting \nthe real economy).  So allow me to briefly define th e critical role of financial institutions in such \nintermediation – a topic that has be en central to much macroeconomic research over the course of the \nlast 25 years, my own included.2   \n \nFinancial intermediation’s critical role in stability  \n \nFinancial intermediaries like ba nks provide a critical function in the economy in that they \nessentially match borrowers and lenders – taking funds provided by deposito rs or investors, and \nlending those funds to in dividuals and firms that run busine sses and employ people in the real \neconomy, and thus have opportunities fo r higher potential returns.   \nDepositors generally need frequent access to th eir funds, while the individuals and firms who \nborrow often want to use the funds for significant peri ods of time.  So there is a so-called “maturity \ntransformation” at work, from short maturity for depositors to longer maturity for borrowers.  Also, \nwhile depositors want a nearly  risk-free repository for thei r funds, borrowers’ investment \nopportunities almost always entail cred it risk. In this way financial inte rmediaries also perform a “risk \ntransformation” – where firms w ith opportunities for higher potenti al returns obtain funds from \ninvestors and depositors looking for s horter-term, safer investments.  \nThe financial intermediary must have exper tise in identifying creditworthy investment \nopportunities, monitoring the investments, and obtai ning the benefits of di versification. In normal \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL 12:30 PM Pacific time and 3:30 PM Eastern time, or upon delivery * \n \n \n \n 4times, the financial intermediary can provide depositors  or investors access to their funds with little or \nno notice, because the intermediary draws its funds from a diversified set of  depositors (with varied \nfinancial needs) who are unlikely – again, in normal  economic times – to all demand their funds at the \nsame time. \nSo financial intermediation is a vital servic e for a well-functioning economy, allowing the \nfunds from many depositors to be pooled and channe led to riskier and longe r-term investment projects \nthat support real economic activity.   \nThe opposite is also true – disruption of inte rmediation can have significant macroeconomic \nconsequences.  In their widely read book This Time Is Different: Eight Centuries of Financial Folly , \nCarmen Reinhart and Ken Rogoff highlight that  recoveries from crises  in which financial \nintermediation has been badly disr upted can take much longer, and be more uneven, than recoveries \nfrom crises in which intermed iation has not been impacted.   \nImplicit in the definitions I have suggested is th e notion that if individual financial institutions \n– or even groups of institutions – fail, but interm ediation services are not si gnificantly impaired, then \nfinancial stability is not compromised.  This could happen, for example, if intermediation services \nwere highly substitutable so that borrowers could switch to  alternate intermediaries at little cost.   \nAlso important is what is not included in my definition.  For instance, there is no mention of \nasset bubbles.  While asset bubbles likely were invol ved in the recent crisis, we should recognize that \nnot all asset bubbles resu lt in a disruption of financial inte rmediation.  Asset bubbles would only \nimpact financial stability as I’m defining it if key intermediaries us e significant leve rage to purchase \nthe asset that’s experien cing a bubble, and as a result are seri ously compromised if the bubble bursts.3  \nIn such a situation they might face balance sheet  constraints that could significantly impair the \navailability of intermediation services a nd thus the future path of the economy. \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL 12:30 PM Pacific time and 3:30 PM Eastern time, or upon delivery * \n \n \n \n 5 So, not all asset bubbles reflect financial instability, but some do – if they affect institutions \ninvolved in vital financial intermed iation for the real economy.  In th is way the topic of asset bubbles \nhelps to illustrate how the definiti on of financial instability is impor tant as we seek to understand the \nproblems we are trying to mitigate, and the tools th at are most appropriate for doing so.  And another \nway the definition matters is that holding regulato rs and supervisors accountable only makes sense if \nthere is a clear understanding of their responsibilities.     \nThe rest of my remarks today provide some examples of how my definition of financial \nstability (and of instability) coul d be applied – and the implications. \n  \nSome significant events may not yield financial instability  \n \nI would first like to share a few examples that  would not meet my definition for affecting \nfinancial stability or creati ng financial instability.   \nMy first example involves silver prices.  As I’m  sure you know, the recent movement of silver \nprices has been quite dramatic.  Figure 1  shows silver prices and is characterized by two dramatic \nmovements.  The first reflects an attempt to corner the silver market some ye ars ago, when prices rose \nto nearly $45 per troy ounce before the popping of the bubble – followed by a nearly 75 percent \ndecline.  The second dramatic m ove is the rapid increase in silv er prices from $17.65 per troy ounce \nin July of last year to $44.90 in late April of this year.  Figure 2  focuses in on just this recent phase.  \nSince hitting that peak, silver pric es fell by just over 25 percent to  $33.42 on May 17.  As of last week \nsilver was trading up slightly, at $36.14 an ounce. \nWhile this dramatic movement in silver’s price highlights the risk and volatility to investing in \ncommodities, it does not meet my definition of financia l instability.  Price volatility is very different \nthan financial instability.  Silver is a relatively small market, and leveraged financial intermediaries do \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL 12:30 PM Pacific time and 3:30 PM Eastern time, or upon delivery * \n \n \n \n 6not have an especially significant ex posure to silver.  So despite the dramatic price decline, there has \nbeen no trace of impairment in fina ncial intermediation.  So I would not  view this as an instance of \nfinancial instability, as I define  it, and would see no need to a lter policy to respond to the price \nmovements. \nMy second example involves the large numbers of  failures of savings and loan institutions \nfrom the early 1980s to the early 1990s, as shown in Figure 3 .  A combination of poor supervision \nand poor management led savings and loans to be caught  first in an adverse in terest rate environment \n– they were borrowing short and lend ing long at a time of rapidly rising interest rates.  As a result \ntheir capital became depleted, and many savings and loans increased their risk by taking on \ncommercial real estate activities – resulting in widesp read failures, and in some cases, quite dramatic \nlosses.  These losses were a significant problem for the depos it insurance fund.   \nBut while this was a costly situation, did it constitute financial instability? \nUsing my definition, it did not.  Savings and loan  institutions were not the sole providers of \ncredit to housing market participants.  Many comm ercial banks were willing and able to lend to \npotential home buyers.  In additi on, securitization of  mortgages had made it easier for borrowers to \nget financing regardless of the intermediary  initiating the loan.  I would point to Figure 4 , which \nshows the spread between 10 year Treasury securities and 30 year mo rtgages with savings and loans \nfailures in the background.  There is  no sharp break in credit pricing dur ing that period, nor were there \nwidespread complaints at the tim e of inability to obtain home mo rtgages.  So, despite the large \nnumber of financial institutions that failed, there was not a severe disruption in the intermediation of \nmortgage credit, at least in the aggregate.   \nMy third example involves the dr amatic increase in “dot com” stock prices during the late \n1990s, as shown in Figure 5 .  Stock prices rose ra pidly for companies associated with the emerging \ncommercialization of the internet.  As you know, ma ny of the companies had no clearly established \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL 12:30 PM Pacific time and 3:30 PM Eastern time, or upon delivery * \n \n \n \n 7revenue stream, leading many analysts to become concerned about a bubble.  And in fact, the stock \nprices of many of those companies did fall dramatically. \nWhile the rapid decline of dot-com stock pri ces did result in a drop in wealth for those \ninvested in the stocks, it did not  have a significant impact on fi nancial intermediation services – \nbecause generally speaking, banks and other key sour ces of intermediation were not directly exposed \nto dot-com stocks in a significant way.  A shock to wealth can have a macroeconomic impact, but that \ncan be addressed with traditional monetary policy.   While there was a macroeconomic impact from \nthe decline in the stock prices, the episode would not meet my de finition of financial instability \nbecause it did not impair intermedia tion – in other words, it did not a ffect the ability of the financial \nsystem to provide credit. \n \nExamples of financial inst ability (and possible causes)  \n \nI have been arguing here that th ere are examples of serious fina ncial problems and dislocations \nthat I would not consider examples of financial instability, as I define it.  But th ere are, unfortunately, \nexamples of financial instability that occurred recently, during th e financial crisis and recession.   \nAs I mentioned in my introduction, the Dodd-Fr ank legislation seems primarily focused on \naddressing the failure of large financial institution s and payments systems – which certainly warrants \nattention.  But a large interconnected  failure is only one of several wa ys that a systemic problem can \nemerge.  The first example I would offer involve s the experience of money market mutual funds \n(MMMFs) during the financial crisis, and it demonstrat es that even a small financial intermediary can \ncreate financial instability.   \nAs of August 2008 MMMFs had $3.5 trillion of a ssets, and funds had been flowing into \nMMMFs, as a result of problems at a vari ety of banks and other factors.  But Figure 6 shows the daily \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL 12:30 PM Pacific time and 3:30 PM Eastern time, or upon delivery * \n \n \n \n 8change in money market fund assets in prime fu nds in the latter portion of 2008, and notes some of \nthe key events of that era.   \nIn the wake of the failure of Lehman Brot hers, a relatively small MMMF called the Reserve \nPrimary Fund experienced very substantial outflows due  to investor concerns about its credit exposure \nto Lehman.  While money market funds are highly  regulated by the SEC and are supposed to hold \nhigh-quality liquid assets, investors were concerned th at losses from Lehman would cause the Reserve \nFund to “break the buck” (t hat is, redeem shares for less than one dollar).   \nThe problems at the Reserve Fund not only caused funds to flow out of that fund, but also \ntriggered large withdrawals from other money market  mutual funds as well, as shown in the figure .  \nOver the course of the week, over $300 billion was withdrawn from  prime MMMFs, forcing the funds \nto try to quickly sell assets to  meet redemption requests.   \nNote that there are three major types of money market funds, as shown in Figure 7  – funds \nthat invest in tax-exempt securi ties, funds that invest in gover nment securities, and prime money \nmarket funds that purchase a wide variety of debt instruments.  It  was the prime money market funds \nthat posed the most severe problem during the crisis – and which still pose a problem today (as I will discuss in a moment).  While some of the assets in the prime funds, su ch as Treasury securities, could \nbe readily sold, others such as asset-backed commercial paper (ABCP ) were not easily sold given the \nprevailing harsh market conditions.   \nThe rapid withdrawal of funds fr om prime money market funds not  only represented a crisis of \nconfidence, but also began se riously disrupting credit market s where MMMFs were the major \nbuyers.\n4  Interest spreads on asset-backed commer cial paper, shown in the top panel of Figure 8 , rose \ndramatically.  The bottom panel shows that asset-b acked commercial paper coul d only be issued in \nvery short maturities.  The percen t of issued paper maturing in one  to four days leapt from roughly \nhalf to over 90 percent. \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL 12:30 PM Pacific time and 3:30 PM Eastern time, or upon delivery * \n \n \n \n 9In response to these short-term credit disrupt ions, the U.S. Treasury announced a plan to \ninsure MMMF shares,5 and the Federal Reserve System announ ced an asset-backed commercial paper \nMMMF liquidity facility.  The facility, operated for the System by the Boston Fed, allowed money \nmarket funds to sell asset-backed commercial paper to banks – the MMMFs could use the sale \nproceeds to meet redemption requests – and the a sset-backed commercial paper was pledged by the \nbanks to the Fed as part of a loan from the Fed, which was ultimately paid back with interest.  In \naddition, over time other facilities were created to address disruptions  in short-term credit markets. \nThe money market problems that disrupted short-te rm credit markets highlighted that financial \ninstability could be created by ev en a small money market fund if its problems created doubts about \nother funds’ ability to redeem invest ors’ funds at stable net asset valu e.  In a situati on like this, we \nshould note, the weakest link in the financial stability chain might be small , rather than large, \nfinancial intermediaries.  This problem with promis ing stable asset values despite some credit risk \nwas what in this example impaired financial inte rmediaries (the MMMFs), seriously disrupted short-\nterm credit markets, and had a large impact on th e ability of firms to acquire short-term debt \nfinancing.   \nThe Securities and Exchange Commission ha s tightened requirements on money market \nfunds.6  While this represents an important step forw ard, I will digress for a moment on this issue as it \nrelates to our topic today, financ ial stability.  Despite the regulato ry changes that have occurred, \nMMMFs still remain vulnerable to an unexpected cred it shock that could cause investors to doubt the \nability to redeem at a stable net asset value.  I am certainly not predicti ng such an outcome, but I \nbelieve we all do well to recognize and address this vulnerability.   \nI do think it would be particularly prudent to ad dress this issue now, as  money market mutual \nfunds have the potential to be impacted should th ere be unexpected interna tional financial problems \nemanating from Europe.  Consider that many (but  not all) MMMF’s have sizeable exposures to \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL 12:30 PM Pacific time and 3:30 PM Eastern time, or upon delivery * \n \n \n \n 10European banks, by virtue of hol ding the banks’ short-term debt.  This means some MMMFs are \npotentially sensitive to a disrupt ion in the European banking system , should one arise from the fiscal \nand sovereign-debt problems we are s eeing in some European countries.   \nConversely, I would note that European banks are reliant on the MMMFs – which are a major \nsource of their dollar-f unding needs.  This latter poi nt is worth noting as we carefully and responsibly \nexamine this set of issues – because it means, for instance, that a regulatory change that reduced the \ndebt holdings of European banks by prime money ma rket funds could (as an unintended consequence) \nnecessitate corresponding ch anges in European dolla r-funding strategies.   \nWhile there have been various proposals to addr ess this issue – for instance allowing the asset \nvalues of the funds to float, or requiring capital be  set aside in the event of  a credit shock, or requiring \na source of strength from a parent company or an in surance contract – no one so lution has been settled \non that would cure the type of problem that occurred with the Reserve Primary Fund in the last \nfinancial crisis.   \nSo in my view, any solution needs to address th e potential impact of unexpected credit losses, \nthe risk that investors might ra pidly withdraw their funds to a void any loss, and the operational \nconvenience that MMMFs provide as  a transactions account vehicle.7  Despite these challenges, the \nset of issues surrounding MMMFs is in  sum a vulnerability that needs to be addressed.  Forums like \nthis one serve an important role in allowing us to  underline issues like this that need focused and \nconstructive attention.   \n \nFinancial instability may occur without the failure  of a financial intermediary  \n \nReturning to my examples I would say that a nother vulnerability is the risk that common, \nwidely-held exposures could cause intermediation se rvices to be cut simulta neously, even without a \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL 12:30 PM Pacific time and 3:30 PM Eastern time, or upon delivery * \n \n \n \n 11failure of any large intermediary.  For example,  if banks experience a common shock to collateral \nvalues or experience similar credit losses, banks th at are capital-constrained may shrink their lending \nin an effort to satisfy binding capital-to-assets ratios. (As a reminder, loans are assets on a bank’s \nbalance sheet).   \nThis type of problem is illust rated by the difference in the lending behavior during the recent \ncrisis and downturn of banks w ith strong supervisory ratings, and those with weak supervisory \nratings.   Figure 9  shows that commercial and savings banks  with weak supervisory ratings shrank \nlending during the first year  of the recession.  Banks experiencing large losses are of ten reluctant to \nraise additional capital – either because it could si gnal financial problems or be perceived as an \nattempt to avoid diluting existing shareholders.  Instead, firms that  choose not to raise additional \ncapital often satisfy capital-to-assets requirements by shrinking their assets, and more importantly for \nthe real economy, reducing th eir willingness to lend.   \nIf this behavior is widesprea d, it can significantly reduce credit  intermediation.  Earlier in my \ncareer I studied this dyna mic with my colleague Joe Peek, an d our research found such behavior \nduring the credit crunch period in the United States during the 1990 recession8 and during the \nJapanese banking crisis.9  This dynamic forms one explanation for why recessions that are \naccompanied by problems at financial intermediaries tend to be deeper recessions, followed by slower \nrecoveries (again, the point that  Reinehart and Rogoff discuss).  \nIndeed, a look at the last thr ee recessions suggests significant  tightening of credit and slow \nrecoveries.  While I mentioned earlier that the mort gages issued by savings and loan institutions were \neasily substitutable, the same cannot  be said of commercial lending.  Figure 10  shows the declines in \ncommercial loans in relation to the last three r ecessions.  The headwinds in monetary policy that \nbecame a concern in the 1990s primarily reflecte d reduced business lending, as commercial banks \nbecame capital constrained as a result of large commercial real estate losses.

Higher capital requirement s (higher ratios of \ncapital to assets) can reduce the pr obability of an instit ution’s failure – but a lower risk of banks’ \ninsolvency does not necessari ly prevent a credit crunch.   \nA potential solution, being advocated in Basel III proposals, could be requiring banks to hold a \nbuffer above the minimum capital requirements, wh ich can be drawn down during times of credit \ncrunches – but with the expectati on that the capital would not be re built by shrinking the institution’s \nloan portfolio.  However, for credit crunches to be a voided this source of capit al needs to be set apart \nas something of a “shock absorber,” and not be view ed as just a higher capital ratio that incents \nreduced financial intermediation when the buffer is breached. \n \nFinancial instability when a large,  interconnected intermediary fails  \n \nMy third example of instability involves the fa ilure of Lehman Brothers, which in my view \nhighlighted the importance of understanding th e interconnection of financial firms.  \nInterconnectedness occurs in  a variety of ways:   \n• The most direct way involves those who have  an immediate credit exposure to the firm.  \nAs an example, the failure of a large financia l firm could create a credit loss that could \ngenerate runs on money market funds br oadly – a linkage that was probably not \nsufficiently appreciated prior to the financial crisis.    \n• A second form of interconnectedness involves the opaqueness of financial firms, which \nmakes it difficult to determine counterparty e xposure or whether simila r exposures exist at \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL 12:30 PM Pacific time and 3:30 PM Eastern time, or upon delivery * \n \n \n \n 13other financial firms.  During the crisis, inve stors started retreating from financial firms \ngenerally , as shown in the substantial wi dening of the LIBOR/OIS spread (Figure 12)  as \nbanks became suspicious of counterparty e xposure to even some of the largest global \nfinancial intermediaries.    \n• A third manifestation of interconnectedness i nvolves the criticality of firms that are \nsignificant market makers, because when they  experience troubles br oader intermediation \nservices can be impacted.    \n• A fourth form of interco nnectedness involves the increa sing global nature of large \nfinancial intermediaries, which greatly compli cates resolutions of such firms should they \nfail.  The incentive for host countries to “r ing fence” liquidity and capital, and the legal \nuncertainty surrounding global failures, together  provide incentives that might not be \ncompatible with orderly resolutions. \n \nWhile the role of interconnectedness is much bette r appreciated now than pr ior to the crisis, it \nis still very difficult to get good “measures” of it.  Academics and regulators need to spend more time \nunderstanding what data might be  useful, and how it can be read ily ascertained and updated.   \nAssuming interconnectedness can be measured, it is important to understand how that \ninformation will be used.  For example, should highly interconnected firms have higher capital requirements, to reduce the probability that they become insolvent?  Should banks be required to \ndisclose measures of interconnectedness to bank supe rvisors – or in public stat ements?  And what role \ncan stress tests play in unders tanding how a failure of a larg e firm impacts other firms? \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL 12:30 PM Pacific time and 3:30 PM Eastern time, or upon delivery * \n \n \n \n 14Concluding observations  \n \nIn conclusion I would just emphasize that financ ial stability was not clearly identified as the \nresponsibility of any particular re gulatory authority prio r to the financial crisis.  Under the Dodd-\nFrank legislation a group of regulat ors, the Financial Stability Oversi ght Council, is now tasked with \nproviding financial stability oversight.  However, as I noted at the outset, financial stability was never \ndefined in the legislation.  This  leaves some ambiguity on how broa dly or narrowly financial stability \nshould be defined.  \nIn this talk I have tried to provide a relatively simple defi nition of financia l stability and \ninstability, and have provided some examples of  how the definition could be used in various \ncircumstances.  The examples of potential financia l instability emanating fr om money market mutual \nfunds and commercial banks highlight, in my view, that  much work remains to be done if we want to \nsignificantly reduce the likelihood of impairment of critical financia l intermediation services – the \nsort of impairment that could subs tantially impact ec onomic activity.   \nI know we all want to work to make progress in  this area, and I hope my remarks today help \nadvance the cause.   \nThank you. \n                                                 \n \n \n1 Through an Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, FSOC asked the public whether it should define the term \n“financial stability” as well as “material financial distress. ''  In a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking the FSOC indicated that \nthere was a broad consensus from th e comments received that the FSOC should  define those two terms.  The FSOC is in \nthe process related to regulation writing on the \"Authority to Require Supervision and Regulation of Certain Nonbank \nFinancial Companies\" pursuant to Section 113 of DFA. (The Notice of Proposed Rulemaking actually explains that their \nproposed rule \"describes the criteria that will inform, and th e processes and procedures esta blished under the DFA for, the \nCouncil's designation of nonbank financial companies under the DFA.\") \n \n2 See for example “The Impact of Financial Institutions and Financial Markets on the Real Economy: Implications of a \n'Liquidity Lock'” – my talk at the University of Wisconsin – Madison in October 2008 (available at \nhttp://www.bostonfed.org/news/sp eeches/rosengren/2008/100908.htm ). \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL 12:30 PM Pacific time and 3:30 PM Eastern time, or upon delivery * \n \n \n \n 15                                                                                                                                                                     \n \n3 Financial institutions can use leverage to purchase assets (e .g. residential mortgage backed securities)  or can provide \nleverage to borrowers wishing to purchase  the asset.  Either way a bubble bursting impacts the financial intermediary’s \nbalance sheet. \n \n4 Since a major theme in my talk is that financial stability is not compromised if intermediation services are sustainable \nthrough alternative intermediaries, I would note that here th ere are no similar substitutes. Even product substitutes (like \nunregistered funds) have investors that behave in the same fashion. \n \n5 The U.S. Treasury Department on September 19, 2008 announced “the establishment of a temporary guaranty program \nfor the U.S. money market mutual fund industry. For the ne xt year, the U.S. Treasury will insure the holdings of any \npublicly offered eligible money market mutual fund – both re tail and institutional – that pays a fee to participate in the \nprogram.” Information on the program can be found in announ cements posted by the Treasury in late September and early \nNovember, archived at http://www.treas.gov/press/releases/archives/200809.html  \n \n6 As Chairman Bernanke said on May 5, “the stability of m oney market mutual funds – which suffered dramatic runs that \nworsened funding conditions at the height of the crisis – is cl early a systemic issue, not just an industry issue. The SEC, \nwhich has already issued rules to increase the stability of money market mutual funds, is appropriately taking the lead in \ninvestigating whether further steps are necessary. Under the aegis of the council, however, the SEC has consulted with \nother agencies, including the Federal Reserve, which have provided their own analyses and perspectives. In particular, interagency consultation has helped clarify the potential systemic implications of instability in the money market mutual \nfund industry. The Federal Reserve will be among the agenci es participating in a roundtable on money fund regulation \nsponsored by the SEC later this month.”  \n7 That is, in eliminating the need for extensive tracking of capital gains and losses. \n \n8 For a description of credit crunch problems in the early 1990s see Peek and Rosengren, “The Capital Crunch: Neither a \nBorrower nor a Lender Be,\" Journal of Money, Credit and Banking, vol. 27, no. 3 (August 1995): 625-638. \nAlso see the article I wrote with Joe Peek, “Bank Regula tion and the Credit Crunch,” in the Journal of Banking \n& Finance, Volume 19, Issues 3-4, June 1995, pages 679-692. \n \n9 See for example the following articles I wrote with Joe Peek : \"The International Transmission of Financial Shocks: The \nCase of Japan\" in the American Economic Review  vol. 87, no. 4 (September 1997), pages 495-505; \"Collateral Damage: \nEffects of the Japanese Bank Crisis on Real Activity in the United States\" in the American Economic Review , vol. 90, no. \n1 (March 2000), pages 30-45; and \"Unnatural Selection: Perver se Incentives and the Misallocation of Credit in Japan\" in \nthe American Economic Review , vol. 95(4), September 2005, pages 1144-1166. \n\nDefining Financial Stability, \nand Some Policy Implications \nof Applying the Definition\nEric S.

Rosengren \nPresident & Chief Executive Officer \nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston \n \nClark University \nWorcester, Massachusetts \n \nJuly 13, 2011 \n \n \n \n It is a pleasure to be with you today in Worcester as we discuss the opportunities and \nchallenges facing New England’s smaller industrial cities.\n1  At the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, \nwe are very pleased to be collaborating with  our co-sponsors in organizing this forum – \nthe Mosakowski Institute for Public Enterprise, MassINC, and the Rappapor t Institute for Greater \nBoston. \nI would like to briefly frame the economic context that prevails as  we gather today.  I think the \neconomic backdrop only underscores the importance of  a practical and constructive forum like this \none, and the need for collaboration and leadership – wh ich are themes of particular focus at this event. \n\n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL 9:10 AM Eastern time on Wednesday, July 13, 2011, or upon delivery * \n \n \n \n 2I should note, of course, that the views I expr ess today are my own, and not necessarily those \nof my colleagues on the Federal Reserve’s Boar d of Governors or the Federal Open Market \nCommittee (the FOMC). \nThe deep recession and slow recovery have had a significant impact on New England’s cities.  \nAt the same time, we should note that our experien ce of late in New England has been less severe \nthan that of the nation.  The unemployment rate fo r New England in May, the latest month we have a \nregional number for, was 7.9 percent – high, but we ll below the 9.1 percent ra te for the nation as a \nwhole in May (a number that climbed to 9.2 percent in  June).  Many of our citi es, particularly in the \nnorthern half of New England, ha ve unemployment rates well belo w the national average.  Also, \nmany cities in New England did not experience the extremes of boom and bust in residential real estate that plagued some cities  elsewhere in the country.   \n As the economy continues its slow recover y, there are significant opportunities but also \ndaunting challenges facing our cities.  But before discussing those opportunities and challenges, I \nwould like to briefly describe  the national economic outlook. \n  \nThe National Economic Outlook  \n As we consider the national outlook, I would note th at some have referred to the first half of \nthis year as a “slow patch” in th e recovery.  I am not sure that phrase is quite right, however – the \nnotion of a slow patch suggests strong growth that has been temporarily inte rrupted by some sort of \nheadwind or shock, like natural disa sters or extreme weather that cr imps economic activity.  I would \ninstead describe the past two years as a consis tently weak recovery, in terrupted by a period of \nstronger growth.  Let me add that a weak recovery  like we have seen is, unfortunately, typical of \nrecoveries after a financial crisis.\n2   \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL 9:10 AM Eastern time on Wednesday, July 13, 2011, or upon delivery * \n \n \n \n 3Figure 1  shows growth in what we call real fi nal sales, which represents the goods and \nservices produced in the economy, not including inve ntories.  If one assumes that the economy needs \nto grow faster than 2.5 percent – an estimate of what economists call its po tential – to yield much \nimprovement in the unemployment rate, you see that  we have had only one strong quarter in this \nrecovery (the fourth quarter of 2010).      Also, Figure 2  shows that consumers have been partic ularly tentative du ring the recovery.  \nThe only quarter in which we saw consumption grow th in excess of 2.5 percen t during this recovery \nwas that same fourth quarter of 2010.   \nIn short, the only quarter of st rong economic growth so far in this recovery has been the one \ncontaining the holiday season at th e end of last year.  With housi ng activity and government spending \nlikely to continue to be unusually weak for a recovery, we need to see consumer and business \nconfidence improve so that consumption and invest ment can offset the weaker growth in other \ncomponents of gross domestic product (GDP).   \nThe first half of this year saw the economic r ecovery impacted by the tragic destruction in \nJapan, which disrupted manufacturi ng supply chains, as well as weathe r issues ranging from severe \nwinter conditions to damaging floods.  The result is that growth in the fi rst half of this year is likely to \nbe roughly 2 percent.   \nAs the effects of these problems fade, we do expect a rebound in purchases of consumer \ndurables to yield stronger growth in the third quarter.  I expect economic growth over the second half \nof this year to average somewher e in the range of 3.0 to 3.5 percen t.  While this represents an \nimprovement from the first half, it is still quite slow given the amount of slack in the economy, and \nslower than I had expected at  the beginning of this year. \nWhile we are seeing some positive economic signs such as equipment and software spending, \nand growth in exports, the employment report is sued last Friday was dismal.  The national \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL 9:10 AM Eastern time on Wednesday, July 13, 2011, or upon delivery * \n \n \n \n 4unemployment rate rose sli ghtly (a tenth of a percent) to 9.2 per cent in June.  And net job growth was \nvery weak over the last two months – job grow th averaged only 21,500 over the two-month period of \nMay and June.3  The employment-to-population ratio fell to 58.2 percent, matching the 28 year low \nthat we have hit a few times in this recovery.4   \nNot surprisingly, with so much painful slack in the labor market we are not seeing any \nsignificant wage pressure – average hourly earnings fell slig htly this month and have increased only \n1.9 percent over the past year – whic h is consistent with a continued low inflation rate in the medium \nterm.  As Figures 3 highlights, wages are not likely to place mu ch upward pressure on inflation since \ncompensation is growing only slowly, give n weak job markets.  In addition, Figure 4  shows that \nmany commodity prices have stabiliz ed or retreated from their rece nt highs.  These factors give \nmonetary policy the leeway to remain accommodative,  so as to provide the monetary conditions for \nimproved economic growth. \nIn addition, there are significant downside risks a ssociated with an outlook that includes only \nvery slow improvement in the economy.  The headlin es from Europe continue to remind us of this. \nWith fiscal austerity slowing down economies both here  and abroad, it will in my view be important \nto maintain sufficiently accommodative U.S. monetary  policy so that national labor market conditions \ncan improve.   \n \nOpportunities and Challenges for New England’s Mid-Sized Cities \n \nSo the national outlook is for a continued slow  recovery, which of c ourse factors into the \nopportunities and challenges for New E ngland’s mid-sized cities we ha ve come together to discuss \ntoday.   \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL 9:10 AM Eastern time on Wednesday, July 13, 2011, or upon delivery * \n \n \n \n 5Also, with widespread pressure  for fiscal austerity not only impacting Federal budgets but also \nbudgets at the state and local leve l, I think we should acknowledge the acute challenges that cities \nface in prioritizing expenditures to ensure that program cuts do not impair the ability of their \ncommunities to prosper over the long term.    \nAs we think about their opportuni ties and challenges, I th ink it is useful to highlight some of \nthe trends in New England’s mid-si zed cities relative to New England as a whole, and the nation.  For \nexample, Figure 5  highlights the differences in the populations  of our mid-sized ci ties and the rest of \nthe region and the country with respect to age, at roughly decade intervals.  The most recent data \nsuggest that New England as a whole now has a greater portion of people over 65 and a smaller \nportion of people under 15, and age 15 to 24, than the U. S.  However, the residents of the region’s \nsmall and mid-sized cities are on av erage younger than the rest of New England – with a smaller share \nof people over 65 and a larger share of people 15 to 24 than both the region and the nation.  As for the \nportion of people under 15, these cities exceed the regi on and are basically on par with the nation.   \nIn exploring these trends and ch aracteristics, I would like to o ffer a few possibilities – in the \ninterest of generating discussion today.   \nFirst, it may be that younger workers “just startin g out” are especially r eceptive to training for \njobs in a growing sector.  So this  younger profile of our mid-sized cities, and the fact that they are \noften the site of medical facili ties serving the surrounding communities,  together highlight a potential \nopportunity.  Many of the mid-sized cities may be ab le to build on their medi cal-services base.  While \nmedical employers require highly sk illed doctors and nurses, they also hire a variety of other \nemployees in positions that often require only an associate’s or bachelor’s degree.  Indeed, our \nanalysis suggests that the number of  jobs in the healthcare industry as a percent of total jobs is much \nhigher for these mid-sized New Engla nd cities than it is for the regi on as a whole, or for the nation.5 \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL 9:10 AM Eastern time on Wednesday, July 13, 2011, or upon delivery * \n \n \n \n 6Worcester is a particularly good example of this, being home to hospitals, the University of \nMassachusetts medical school, and medical research firms.  Other cities in the region have major \nmedical facilities with spillover benefits to the broader community, including Providence (with \nBrown medical school and partner ho spitals), New Haven (with Yale school of medicine and Yale-\nNew Haven Hospital), greater Hartfo rd (with the University of Conn ecticut Health Center in the \nHartford suburb of Farmington), and Spri ngfield (with Baystate  Medical Center). \nTurning to educational  characteristics in these cities, Figure 6  shows the percent of the \npopulation with a bachelor’s degree  or higher, and with some colle ge education or an associate’s \ndegree – again at roughly decade intervals.  New E ngland has a much higher percentage of college \ngraduates than the nation as a whole, but a smaller percentage of people with  some college education \nor an associate’s degree.  In c ontrast, the mid-sized cities have  a smaller percentage than New \nEngland or the U.S of people with a bachelor’s de gree or higher, or some college education or an \nassociate’s degree. The trend is up in  these cities, however, over time.   \nThis is particularly significant when we not e that the unemployment experience over the past \ndecade has been quite different when segmen ted by educational attainment, as shown in Figure 7 .   \nThis is particularly true over the past several years, when the unemploym ent rates by educational \nattainment have widened significantly fr om where they were 10 years ago.  \nAll this may suggest that commun ity colleges can and should play a larger role in many of our \nmid-sized cities.  Community colleges in New Engl and have played less of a role in workforce \ndevelopment than in some parts of the country, where there is a very close connection between \nemployers (and potential employers) and the curricul a developed and offered at community colleges.  \nAs we think about future developments in our mi d-sized cities, it is impor tant that leaders at \ncommunity colleges and local business leaders wo rk together in the ongoing development of \nspecialized curricula that will meet th e evolving needs of local employers.   \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL 9:10 AM Eastern time on Wednesday, July 13, 2011, or upon delivery * \n \n \n \n 7Figure 8  shows that mid-sized cities in  New England are increasingly diverse .  Mid-sized \nNew England cities have a much higher proportion of  individuals who were born outside of the U.S. \nthan the rest of New England or the country, and this has intensifie d over recent decades.  These cities \nalso have a much higher percentage  of individuals who are not prof icient English speakers.  This \nhighlights a potential impediment to gett ing higher education or some jobs.   \nThe availability of English classes remains extremely important, and increasingly so.  The \nsame is true for providing greater  access to government programs for those with limited English.  For \nexample, a working paper by the Bank’s Ana Patricia Muñoz shows that small business \nentrepreneurship programs often do not target Latino populations.6  State and Federal programs \ndesigned to help fund or provide technical assistance to small busin esses may need to increasingly \ntailor some of their programs to  fit the needs of local populations. \nHowever, despite these challenges I believe that the diversity in our mid-sized cities can also \nbe a decided advantage.  Let me show another chart, Figure 9 , which instead of foreign born and \nlimited English speakers simply indicates the porti on of the population that is Hispanic, and the \nportion that is African American.  You see again that while New E ngland as a whole may be less \ndiverse than the rest of the nati on, our mid-sized cities are more di verse -- and increasingly so over \nthe decades.  Finding ways for businesses to reach  diverse populations is likely to become \nincreasingly important as the c ountry as a whole becomes more di verse, and as technology allows \neven small companies to reach markets in other c ountries.  A product or service developed by or for a \ndiverse population in Worcester or Hartford or another mid-sized ci ty may be a first step toward \naccessing diverse markets in the U.S., or even globally. \nMoreover, developing successful en trepreneurs within a diverse population could of course be \na source of local economic development.  The M uñoz paper finds Latino businesses starting up in \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL 9:10 AM Eastern time on Wednesday, July 13, 2011, or upon delivery * \n \n \n \n 8many of New England’s mid-sized cities, and this can  be a source of future job growth if some of \nthese businesses can grow.   \nFinally and importantly, I would observe that while New England has fared better than the rest \nof the country during the recession and the early stages  of the recovery, the same is not true for our \nmid-sized cities, as shown in Figure 10.   Unemployment rates are much  higher in the mid-sized cities \nthan they are in New England or the country as a whole, in contrast to 10 years ago when the \nunemployment rates in the regi on’s mid-sized cities were be low the national average.   \n \nConcluding Observations  \n \nIn summary and conclusion, our mid-sized ci ties are on average younger, proportionally less \nadvanced in education, and more diverse than the rest of New Engla nd.  This provides both \nopportunities and challenges,  as I have noted.   \nAs many of these cities are regi onal centers, further developing their activities as medical and \neducational centers will be impor tant, particularly given their younger population compared to New \nEngland as a whole.   \nA theme for this conference is the need to build collaborative leadership.  Leaders in \ngovernment will need to work collaboratively with leaders in education, the sciences, and businesses \nmore generally, and find ways to take advantage of some of the differences we see in our mid-sized \ncities.   \nI think we all know this, and the challenge is in  finding the best ways to do so, to everyone’s \nbenefit.  It is our hope that this forum will be one avenue for supporting and advancing that \ncollaboration. \nThank you. \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL 9:10 AM Eastern time on Wednesday, July 13, 2011, or upon delivery * \n \n \n \n 9                                                 \n \nNOTES : \n \n1  We define mid-sized cities in New England as those with a population ranging from 75,000 to 250,000, excluding \n“suburb cities” within 20 miles of Boston – specifically, Bridgeport, CT; Danbury, CT; Hartford, CT; New Haven, CT; \nNorwalk, CT; Stamford, CT; Waterbury, CT; Brockton, MA ; Fall River, MA; Lawrence, MA; Lowell, MA; Lynn, MA; \nNew Bedford, MA; Springfield, MA; Worc ester, MA; Manchester, NH; Nashua, NH;  Cranston, RI; Providence, RI; and \nWarwick, RI. \n \n2  As I have discussed in other forums, the following dynamic forms one explanation for why recessions that are \naccompanied by problems at financial intermediaries tend to be deeper recessions, followed by slower recoveries. Banks \nexperiencing large losses are often reluctant to raise additio nal capital – either because it could signal financial problems \nor be perceived as an attempt to avoid diluting existing shar eholders.  Instead, firms that choose not to raise additional \ncapital often satisfy capita l-to-assets requirements by shrinking their assets , and more importantly for the real economy, \nreducing their willingness to lend  (loans are assets on a bank’s balance sheet).  If this behavior is widespread, it can \nsignificantly reduce credit intermediation.  Earlier in my car eer I studied this dynamic with my colleague Joe Peek, and \nour research found such behavior during the credit crunch period in the United States during the 1990 recession and during \nthe Japanese banking crisis.   \n See the following from Peek and Rose ngren: “The Capital Crunch: Neither a Borrower nor a Lender Be,\" Journal of \nMoney, Credit and Banking, vol. 27, no. 3 (August 1995): 625-638.  “Bank Regulation and the Credit Crunch,” in the Journal of Banking & Finance, Volume 19, Issues 3-4, June 1995, pages 679-692.  \"The International Transmission of \nFinancial Shocks: The Case of Japan\" in the American Economic Review vol. 87, no. 4 (September 1997), pages 495-505.  \n\"Collateral Damage: Effects of the Japanese Bank Crisis on Real Activity in the United States\" in the American Economic \nReview, vol. 90, no. 1 (March 2000), pages 30-45.  \"Unnat ural Selection: Perverse Incen tives and the Misallocation of \nCredit in Japan\" in the American Economic Review, vol. 95(4), September 2005, pages 1144-1166. \n \n3  About 18,000 jobs were added in June and the May figure was revised to 25,000.  The percent change over the two \nmonths is 0.03%.  Employment rose by an average of 215,000 jobs per month from February through April but now has \naveraged 21,500 jobs over the past two months.  \n4  The employment-to-population ratio hit 58.2 percent in Dec. 2009, Nov. 2010, and June 2011.  It was 58.1 percent in \nJuly of 1983.  \n5  Using data from the Economic Census, the figure for health care employment in mid-sized cities is almost 30 percent \n– twice as large a proportion as for the U.S. or New England – but it should be noted that the figures are calculated as a percent of total jobs that are available in the Economic Ce nsus, which excludes several job-heavy sectors (like elementary \nand secondary schools, colleges and universities, public administration  and employees in most government owned \nestablishments like public utilities). Using di fferent data sources that include many of  these sectors suggests health care is \nover 22 percent of jobs in mid-sized Massachusetts cities, just under 15 percent in New England, and around 12 percent  in \nthe U.S. Either approach suggests that health care is a very important sector for jobs, in absolute terms and compared to \nthe U.S. and rest of New England.      \n \n6  Ana Patricia Muñoz, \"Small Businesses in Springfield, Massachusetts: A Look at Latino Entrepreneurship\", a Federal \nReserve Bank of Boston Community Development Discussion paper with Lynn Browne, Sol Carbonell, Prabal \nChakrabarti, DeAnna Green, Yolanda K.

Rosengren  \nPresident &  Chief Executive Officer  \nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston  \n \nRemarks at the Economic Outlook Seminar  \nStockholm, Sweden  \n \n \nSeptember 28, 2011  \n \n \n \nIt is a great pleasure to be in Sweden to participate in today’s session on the current economic \noutlook and tomorrow’s conference on capital markets in the post -crisis environment.  It is vital that \npolicymakers and practitioners study and apply the recen t lessons of the global economy and financial \ninterdependence, so I am glad to be able to join you in these discussions.   \nI should note, of course, that the views I express today are my own, and not necessarily those \nof my colleagues on the Federal Reserv e’s Board of Governors or the Federal Open Market \nCommittee (the FOMC).  \nOn a personal note, I should mention that my grandfather John Johanson left Sweden at the \nage of six, changing his name to Rosengren and joining his father – who was deploying what he had \nlearned as a gardener in Sweden to open greenhouses in America.  My relatives were able to take \nwhat they had learned in Sweden and apply it – with perhaps some variation – in the United States.  In \n\n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Weds ., Sept . 28, 2011, at 2:40 AM U. S. Eastern Time & 8:40 AM in Stockholm, Sweden;  or upon delivery  * \n \n \n \n 2 a similar way, there is much to consider about the ec onomic experience in Europe and the U.S. over \nthe past four years.  What is similar?  What is different?  And what can be learned and applied?  \nThe window into these broader questions that I would like to use today is housing.  One of the \nhallmarks of the r ecent financial crisis, and subsequent economic disruption, has been the very \nsignificant role played by unusually large movements in residential real estate values, within and \nacross countries.   \nGiven our setting today, let me start by comparing U.S. and  Swedish home price movements \nsince 1995, shown in Figure 1 .  In the U.S., house prices increased steadily and reached a peak in \n2006, before beginning an unprecedented decline – not just in selected regions of the country, but \nnationally  – resulting in ag gregate declines of more than 30 percent.  In contrast, Swedish real estate \nprices increased even more substantially, and have not experienced any substantial decline.  Indeed, \nthey continued to rise after the global financial crisis.  \nWhile the U.S. housin g price decline was a nationwide phenomenon, there were relatively \nmore severe declines in some parts of the country, such as the so -called “sand states” of Florida, \nArizona, Nevada, and California.  Figure 2  shows the home price declines in various metrop olitan \nareas (a subset of those included in the S&P/Case -Shiller 20 -city composite index) and the lines drop \nfurthest and fastest for the metro areas in Nevada, Arizona, Florida, and California.  \nAs I talk with economists from countries whose housing values  have risen markedly but not \nexperienced sharp declines, I have been struck by two things.  First, they are often confident that \nnational (versus regional) house -price reductions are unlikely.  And secondly, most assume that a \ndecline in house prices would  have a measured impact on the economy should that in fact occur.  But \nthe experience of Japan in recent decades and the U.S. more recently1 should provide some caution – \ngiven that the economic retrenchment that followed these significant declines in home  values \nexceeded most people’s expectations.  \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Weds ., Sept . 28, 2011, at 2:40 AM U. S. Eastern Time & 8:40 AM in Stockholm, Sweden;  or upon delivery  * \n \n \n \n 3 While sustained rapid increases in house prices are frequently followed by significant \ndeclines, I am certainly not predicting price declines in any country, given my limited knowledge of \nmarket characteristics .  But I do recommend a thoughtful consideration of the recent U.S. experience, \ngiven its severity and the fact that it was not foreseen.  Indeed, while residential investment2 now \ncomprises only 2.2 percent of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in the U.S., our  housing problems have \nhad a tremendously disproportionate impact on economic performance and on the recovery of growth \nand employment.   \nI would like to discuss some of the reasons for that disproportionate impact today.  By way of \npreview, let me mention  that I plan to highlight the following points.   \nFirst, while housing is a small component of U.S. GDP, it is also quite volatile.  Historically, \nan outsized proportion of U.S. economic growth in the first two years of a recovery from a recession \nis gener ated by residential investment.  The sector is very responsive to monetary policy3 since the \nability to purchase a home can be quite sensitive to the interest rate and the resulting cost of financing.  \nSecond, the characteristics of a country’s mortgage -finance market determine the impact that \nwill come from a change in the rates directly influenced by monetary policy.  In the U.S., most homes \nare financed by 30 -year fixed -rate mortgages, so a fall in long -term interest rates really only affects \nexisting hom e owners to the extent they refinance.  As a result, the U.S. gets less effect from the \nmovement of short -term, monetary policy interest rates compared to countries where the primary \nmortgage financing instruments are floating -rate loans.  In countries wit h this institutional feature, \nboth new and existing home buyers get more immediate boosts from lower short -term rates.  Figure 3  \nhelps to illustrate this by showing the greater responsiveness of U.S. adjustable -rate mortgage rates to \nthe target federal fun ds rate, versus 30 -year fixed -rate loans.  \nThird, many U.S. financial institutions have significant exposure to real estate, either through \ndirect lending or through the purchase of mortgage -backed securities.  As a result, declines in real \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Weds ., Sept . 28, 2011, at 2:40 AM U. S. Eastern Time & 8:40 AM in Stockholm, Sweden;  or upon delivery  * \n \n \n \n 4 estate prices ca n have a substantial impact on the capital of financial institutions, which impacts their \nability to finance not only the housing sector, but also other sectors of the economy.4 \nFourth, falling home prices have not only impaired the capital of many financi al institutions, \nbut in a very real sense have disrupted the transmission of monetary policy.  This is because falling \nhome prices have brought about a situation where the availability  of credit is more important in many \ncases than the cost of credit.  Bor rowers may not qualify for lower rates – in other words, the credit \nmight not be available to them – because their household balance sheet is weaker than prior to the \nrecession, because the collateral values of homes and commercial real estate have fallen,  and because \nlender perception of risks inherent in the economy and in collateral valuations has risen – all at a time \nwhen lenders’ capital has been depleted.  \nFifth, I will argue that changes in some housing policies in the U.S. could make it less difficu lt \nfor monetary policy to affect the economy when housing prices have fallen.  \nI will also discuss the actions taken last week at the FOMC to promote a faster recovery in the \nhousing sector and the economy more broadly.  I am very supportive of these action s. \nLet me stress that I know housing markets have critical institutional features that differ greatly \nacross countries – including financing arrangements, mortgage insurance, the role of government, tax \ntreatment, mortgage servicing, and borrower liability  in foreclosure.  This makes it difficult to \ngeneralize from the U.S. experience.   \nWhat may be transferable, however, is the observation that sharp declines in housing prices \ncan have additional negative effects, with broad implications for macroeconomic outcomes and \nmonetary policy – broader, perhaps, than may be assumed and incorporated into most statistical \nmodels of the economy.  I don’t intend to talk about whether housing prices will fall, but rather want \nto emphasize that when they do fall the effec t on the economy is often much greater than many people \nexpect.  \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Weds ., Sept . 28, 2011, at 2:40 AM U. S. Eastern Time & 8:40 AM in Stockholm, Sweden;  or upon delivery  * \n \n \n \n 5 Let me pause to mention at the outset that a number of my colleagues at the Federal Reserve \nare studying and speaking about these important issues.  Most recently Elizabeth Duke, a member of \nthe Fed’s Board of Governors and herself a former banker, spoke at the Board’s Policy Forum on the \nHousing Market Going Forward and I recommend her address to you.5  I share Governor Duke’s \nview that in the U.S. we “currently have a housing market that is s o severely out of balance that it is \nhampering our economic recovery.”  I may not be as convinced as she is about one possible remedy – \nthat banks may be suitable landlords upon converting foreclosed properties to rentals – but I \nrecommend absorbing her pe rspectives on things that can be done in the near term to help the housing \nmarket stabilize and rebalance.6 \nAlso, colleagues at the Boston Fed including Paul Willen and Chris Foote have done a great \ndeal of empirical work on these issues, and are exploring  the key institutional characteristics of the \nhousing market that play important roles in the current problems.  Among other things, they are \nworking on estimates of the macroeconomic effects of possible refinancing plans.  \n \nThe Role of Housing in the Slow U.S. Recovery  \n The decline in housing prices has created a multitude of difficulties for the U.S. economic \nrecovery.  I would like to provide some evidence of the problem, and discuss its origins.  \nThe housing sector in the U.S. played a major role in the recent financial crisis, and in making \nthe recovery from the resulting recession so anemic.  In the U.S. we had seen regional declines in \nhome prices during previous recessions, but had not seen a national  decline in house prices in the \npost-war era.  So for most lenders, investors, and homeowners, the sustained and substantial decline \nin home prices was not anticipated.  Even sophisticated investors had placed only a very small \nprobability on such a  correlated decline.  A key lesson from the past several years is that homes are \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Weds ., Sept . 28, 2011, at 2:40 AM U. S. Eastern Time & 8:40 AM in Stockholm, Sweden;  or upon delivery  * \n \n \n \n 6 not riskless investments – and that highly rated, regionally -diversified mortgage securities do not \nnecessarily carry low risk.  \n As mentioned earlier, even though residential investment is a small share of GDP (today only \n2.2 percent), it is quite interest -sensitive – it can decline quite dramatically as interest rates rise, and \nexpand quickly when interest rates are relatively low.  So it has been a disproportionally important  \npart of the monetary policy transmission mechanism.   \nIn the current situation, however, U.S. mortgage rates are quite low but residential investment \nhas not been the engine of growth that it normally is in economic recoveries.  As shown in Figure 4 , \nexpo rts have been a source of strength in the first two years of the U.S. recovery, and business fixed \ninvestment has grown at approximately the same rate in this recovery as in the previous three.  Yet the \nhousehold sector has been particularly weak.  Consump tion, which accounts for approximately 70 \npercent of U.S. GDP, has grown only about half as much in the first two years of the recovery as it did \nin the previous three recoveries.  And the shortfall for residential investment is even more striking.  In \nthe previous three recoveries, residential investment grew over 30 percent on average in the first years \nof the recovery – but has actually decreased  in the first two years of this recovery.  \n Figure 5  explores this pattern further by showing the contribution s to total GDP growth that \nresidential investment has provided in the first and second years of recent recoveries.  In the past three \nrecoveries, residential investment on average contributed more than 20 percent of GDP growth in the \nfirst year and 10 perc ent of growth in the second.  So in the typical recovery, residential investment \ncontributes much more to growth in the first two years of the recovery than would be expected given \nits share of GDP.  This reflects the fact that interest rates generally fal l during a recession and the \ninitial stages of a recovery – and residential investment is usually quite responsive to interest rates.   \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Weds ., Sept . 28, 2011, at 2:40 AM U. S. Eastern Time & 8:40 AM in Stockholm, Sweden;  or upon delivery  * \n \n \n \n 7 In this recovery, residential investment was only a small share of the growth in the first year of \nthe recovery and declined in the second year.  So the unusually slow recovery is, in part, due to the \nuncharacteristically muted response of residential investment to very low interest rates.  \nMore than one observer has commented that we are seeing a different pattern this time  that \nequates almost to a “negative feedback loop.”  High unemployment leads to risk aversion, which \ndecreases demand for new housing.  But without construction activity we are not seeing the typical \nuptick in housing -related jobs.  \n Having said a bit about  residential investment and the slow recovery, I would like to now \ntouch on other problems that stem from the decline in housing prices.  Because residential investment \nis not the only facet of the economy that is affected by the drop in home values.   \nIndeed, the decline in housing prices has contributed to a sharp decline in household wealth.  \nIn fact, Figure 6  shows (in both dollar and percent terms) that there was a significant decline in \nhousehold net worth from 2005 to 2009, and that it particularly i mpacted racial and ethnic minorities \nin the U.S.7  These insights are drawn from a Pew Research Center study that used data from the \nCensus Bureau's Survey of Income and Program Participation .8 \nTo explore this a bit more, Figure 7  shows that while homes ar e an important component of \nnet worth for Americans regardless of racial and ethnic group, African American and Hispanic \nhouseholds are particularly reliant on home values as a share of their wealth (between 50 and 60 \npercent, versus between 30 and 40 perc ent for White and Asian households in the U.S.).  While stock \nprices have increased substantially from their crisis lows, those households whose primary source of \nwealth is their home have been disproportionately affected by the decline in house prices.  A nd \nintuitively, households whose net worth has been significantly impacted are likely to reduce their \nconsumption levels by more than households whose net worth has recovered.  \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Weds ., Sept . 28, 2011, at 2:40 AM U. S. Eastern Time & 8:40 AM in Stockholm, Sweden;  or upon delivery  * \n \n \n \n 8  Figure 8  shows the erosion in home equity for U.S. households, again in both do llar and \npercent terms.  Home equity is not only a source of funds to finance consumer purchases, but also \nfrequently serves as a source of funds for individuals starting new businesses.  With the decline in \nhome equity, many entrepreneurs do not have that  route available to finance start -ups or to expand \nexisting small businesses.  \n The weak housing sector also has an impact on employment.  Figure 9  shows that far fewer \njobs have been created in the first two years of this recovery (the left bar in each pai r) than in previous \nrecoveries (the right bar in the pair).  In fact, construction jobs have continued to decline during the \nfirst two years of this recovery – we have lost over a half a million construction jobs since the \nrecovery began.  While constructi on employment is typically volatile during a recovery, on average \nthe sector adds roughly 150,000 jobs.   \nIndeed, Figure 10  shows that employment in construction has declined by 9 percent in the \nfirst two years of this recovery compared to growth over 4 pe rcent during the previous three \nrecoveries. And weak construction employment and activity also reduces the demand for labor in \nsectors that support construction.   \n Figure 11  highlights that the rate of mortgage delinquency in the U.S. has been much greate r \nduring this recession than in previous ones.  Despite two years of recovery (albeit a very slow one), \nthe mortgage delinquency rate remains well above the peak level seen over the previous 30 years.   \nAnd Figure 12  shows that with significant foreclosure s and a weak economy, both the housing \nvacancy rate and the rental vacancy rate remain quite high by historical standards.  \n So the problems in housing have greatly complicated the recovery in the U.S.  Not only has \nresidential investment been unusually wea k, but “to add insult to injury” consumption, business \nformation, and employment have also been affected by problems in the housing sector.  \n \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Weds ., Sept . 28, 2011, at 2:40 AM U.

Short -term interest rates were cut \nessentially to zero.   \nHitting the so -called “zero lower bound” has certainly brought challenges to the ability of \nmonetary policy to stimu late the economy.  However, once the zero lower bound was reached, the \nFederal Reserve used a variety of tools to try to push down longer -term interest rates, as merited by \neconomic conditions.  Our efforts have included asset purchases both traditional (T reasury securities) \nand nontraditional (mortgage -backed securities).  We have also altered our communications strategy.  \nAt the August  FOMC meeting we announced that the Fed expects to maintain short -term interest \nrates (the target range for the federal f unds rate) near the zero bound at least through mid -2013 unless \nthere is a significant improvement in economic conditions relative to our forecast, and as long as the \ninflation outlook remains subdued.9  At the September FOMC meeting we announced a plan to  extend \nthe maturity of our holdings of securities and reinvest principal payments from our holdings of agency \ndebt and agency mortgage backed securities in agency mortgage -backed securities.  The recent \nactions have helped lower long -term interest rates s ignificantly, which is intended to promote growth \nin interest -sensitive sectors of the economy such as housing.  \nFigure 13  shows that in the U.S. the 10 -year Treasury rate, and 30 -year mortgage rates, have \nreached historically low levels.  Figure 14  illustr ates that the combination of low rates and falling \nhouse prices significantly improved the affordability of homes.10  In addition, Figure 15  shows that \nboth population and household formation in the U.S. have continued to rise over the past five years.11   \nThe problem is, while many households have been able to refinance and some new home \nbuyers have taken advantage of the improved affordability of houses, falling home prices have made \nmany unable to refinance, and many unable or unwilling to purchase a home .  While the housing \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Weds ., Sept . 28, 2011, at 2:40 AM U. S. Eastern Time & 8:40 AM in Stockholm, Sweden;  or upon delivery  * \n \n \n \n 10 market would have been more severely impacted (and housing prices fallen more substantially) had \nthe Federal Reserve not eased monetary policy aggressively, the impact of our policies on the \neconomy has clearly been impaired by falling  housing prices.  \n Monetary policy would have had a greater impact if households were able to respond to the \nlower interest rates as if house prices had not fallen.  The data can help one gauge the scope of the \npotential.  The widely followed CoreLogic esti mate is that as of the second quarter, 10.9 million, or \n22.5 percent, of all mortgaged residential properties had negative equity, where the debt exceeds the \nvalue of the house.12  These so -called upside -down homeowners typically have a much harder time \nrefinancing than owners with positive equity.  \nAlong these lines, CoreLogic estimates that about three -quarters of owners with negative \nequity are paying \"above -market\" interest rates, which the company defines as rates above 5.1 \npercent.13 By contrast, slightly more than half of positive -equity owners are paying above -market \nrates. All in all, CoreLogic estimates that there are about 28 million borrowers who are paying above -\nmarket rates and thus might potentially benefit from a refinance.14  \nThere are several proposals that attempt to facilitate refinancing for homeowners who have \nbeen negatively impacted by the drop in housing prices. These proposals do face hurdles, including \nhow to address private mortgage insurance and second liens.  How ever, a program that made it \npossible for many homeowners to refinance, even if they were upside down, would likely provide \nsignificant reductions in mortgage payments to individuals who are likely to have a relatively high \npropensity to consume.  Clearly getting more money into the hands of homeowners who would spend \nit could help to fuel GDP growth.  This would reduce one of the impediments to a more significant \neffect from the monetary policy actions taken to date.  \nI hasten to add that there is already a  government program to allow underwater borrowers to \nrefinance, the Home Affordable Refinance Program (HARP).  This program allows underwater \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Weds ., Sept . 28, 2011, at 2:40 AM U. S. Eastern Time & 8:40 AM in Stockholm, Sweden;  or upon delivery  * \n \n \n \n 11 borrowers with Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac loans to refinance at lower rates. Unfortunately, the \nprogram has helped fewer borrowers than was originally hoped.  Fed Governor Betsy Duke outlined \nsome of the potential reasons why, in the talk I mentioned earlier.  They include loan -level price \nadjustments (LLPAs) that raise interest rates for many borrowers and thereby red uce the benefit of \nrefinancing; originator worries about “buybacks” forced on them by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac; \njunior lien -holder resistance to re -subordinating their loans; and mortgage insurance policies.   \n  The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) is now investigating whether there are ways \nto enhance the program to benefit more borrowers.15  As this work proceeds, I hope the FHFA \nconsiders dropping or reducing LLPAs in cases when a GSE loan is refinanced into another GSE \nloan.  Such a refinance actu ally reduces the GSE’s credit risk (they already guarantee the existing \nmortgage and the homeowner will be able to take advantage of lower rates, freeing up cash flow).  \n A second potential way to help resuscitate the housing sector would be to facilitate the \nreduction in the number of vacant homes.16  One way to do this would be to help responsible investors \npurchase vacant homes and then convert them into rental properties. Today, a majority of investor \ndeals are financed with cash, which suggests that the re is room for improvement in the financing of \ninvestor properties.  \nA step in the right direction is a new loan product from Fannie Mae that allows a cash -out \nrefinance of properties purchased with cash within the past six months, helping to “recycle” inv estor \ndollars through the market.  But more could be done. Two possibilities include allowing investors to \naccess FHA 203(k) purchase -rehab loans and increasing the cap on the number of Freddie Mac loans \nthat are available to a single investor.  In short, improving access to credit for responsible investors to \npurchase and improve properties would not only help provide affordable rental housing.  It would also \nhelp to boost housing demand and limit some of the collateral problems from the large supply of \nvacant homes.17 \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Weds ., Sept . 28, 2011, at 2:40 AM U. S. Eastern Time & 8:40 AM in Stockholm, Sweden;  or upon delivery  * \n \n \n \n 12 A third way to help today’s housing market would be to provide as much certainty as possible \nregarding future government policy in this area. The GSEs are likely to play a different role in the \nnew system.18  The uncertainty has real effects on  how well our current system works. A case in point \nconcerns GSE repurchase requests on delinquent loans.19  \nFinally, I would like to be able to guarantee that the United States will never again suffer a \nsignificant house -price decline.  But instead I can s uggest some improvements that could make the \nhousing market of the future more robust in the face of disruptive shocks.  One suggestion concerns \nspeeding up20 the resolution of delinquent mortgages that have no hope of becoming current again. \nThe government ’s Home Affordable Foreclosure Alternative program (HAFA) is intended to speed \nthe resolution of troubled homeownerships by offering monetary incentives to borrowers and \nservicers who agree to short sales or deeds -in-lieu of foreclosure. But like the large r HAMP program, \ntake-up rates for HAFA have been disappointing.21  \nThe ultimate solution may be to rethink the foreclosure process from the start, and economic \ntheory could play a role here.22 By influencing the costs and benefits of non -foreclosure transfer s, a \nnew system of ownership transfer might better align the incentives of borrowers and lenders, while \nstill protecting the legitimate property rights of homeowners. If so, society as a whole would benefit.  \n \n \nConcluding Observations  \nIn conclusion, I woul d reiterate that problems in the housing sector of the U.S. economy have \nbeen a major impediment to recovery.  As you know, we took significant actions last week at the \nFOMC to promote a faster recovery in the housing sector and the economy more broadly.23   \nI am very supportive of the actions, which were designed to promote stronger growth and \nreduce unemployment rates, consistent with our dual mandate, by putting downward pressure on \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Weds ., Sept . 28, 2011, at 2:40 AM U. S. Eastern Time & 8:40 AM in Stockholm, Sweden;  or upon delivery  * \n \n \n \n 13 longer -term interest rates and helping make financial conditions more acc ommodative.  The actions \nannounced last week involve extending the average maturity of our holdings of securities, by selling \n$400 billion of Treasury securities with maturities of less than three years, and purchasing $400 \nbillion in securities with matur ities of from six to thirty years.  I would highlight that 29 percent of the \nsecurities being purchased are in the maturity range over 20 years.  \nThe FOMC also announced that to support conditions in mortgage markets we will now \nreinvest principal payments from our holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage -backed securities \nin agency mortgage -backed securities, rather than purchasing Treasury securities.   \nThere was a substantial market reaction to the announcement.  Thirty -year Treasury yields \ndeclined by 18 basis points and thirty -year mortgage rates declined by 22 basis points that day – and \nfell further the following day.   \nPictured in Figure 16  is the spread between the 30 -year mortgage yield (a wholesale yield) \nand the 10 -year Treasury yield.  The spread illustrates in part what the Fed's actions are addressing – \nthe upward movement in the spread since mid 2011 – and the market's reaction, a 17 -basis -point drop \nin the spread, following the Fed’s announcement.  Since some of this action had been anticipated and \nalready reflected in market prices, I view this as a very significant decline.  \nWhile there are a variety of impacts that lower long -term Treasury and mortgage yields can \nhave, certainly one is encouraging more refinancing and home purchases than would happen in the \nabsence of action.  In my own view, the Federal Reserve should continue to closely monitor spreads \nbetween mortgage and Treasur y yields and consider taking action if that spread widens significantly, \nas it had recently.  \nWhile the housing sector and the economy would have been weaker in the absence of the \nFed’s actions to lower rates, I believe it is equally important to examine ho using policies that might be \nchanged to reduce the impediments to monetary policy and more generally help facilitate recovery.  \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Weds ., Sept . 28, 2011, at 2:40 AM U. S. Eastern Time & 8:40 AM in Stockholm, Sweden;  or upon delivery  * \n \n \n \n 14 There should be strong encouragement for the GSEs to focus on the housing recovery so home buyers \nand those that already have lo ans can fully benefit from the lower interest rates generated  by our \nmonetary policy action.  Given that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are currently under conservatorship \nby the U.S. government, I believe they should play a larger role in achieving the public  policy goals \ninherent in addressing these housing -market problems.  \n While monetary policy cannot fully offset the many problems stemming from the recession, it \ncan certainly mitigate some of the effects.  A policy action that, for instance, reduces the \nunemployment rate by half a percent over time will not return the economy to full employment, of \ncourse, but will still mean 750,000 jobs that would not have been created in the absence of the action.  \nOf course, carefully weighing the potential costs of add itional action with the expected potential \nbenefits involves a high degree of uncertainty, given we have not operated at the zero bound with \nfalling housing prices in the post -war period.   However, with unemployment at 9.1 percent and with \ninflation in th e medium term expected to remain below 2 percent, monetary and fiscal policies should \nbe focused on returning the economy to full employment.  \nGiven what I have laid out today, let me close with this.  We need to recognize the urgency of \nthe situation and t he broader economic implications of housing’s continued struggles.  All parties in \nthese markets should redouble their efforts, given the broader economic effects and their painful toll.   \n Thank you.  \n \n                                                 \n \n1 Not to mention some European countries.  \n \n2 Residential investment is the housing component of Gross Domestic Product (GDP).

Immigration does not have a similar effect on estimates \nfor white, black, or Hispanic households.  \n \n8 The Pew study by Rakesh Kochhar, Richard Fry and Paul Taylor was published on July  26, 2011, and entitled \"Wealth \nGaps Rise to Record Highs Between Whites, Blacks and Hispanics.\"  See http://pewsocialtrends.org/2011/07/26/wealth -\ngaps-rise-to-record -highs -between -whites -blacks -hispanics/  \n \n9 The statement, available at http://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/monetary/20110809a.htm , noted that \nconsistent with its mandate, “The Committee now expects a somewhat slower pace of recovery over coming quarte rs than \nit did at the time of the previous meeting and anticipates that the unemployment rate will decline only gradually toward \nlevels that the Committee judges to be consistent with its dual mandate” to foster maximum employment and price \nstability.  “Th e Committee also anticipates that inflation will settle, over coming quarters, at levels at or below those \nconsistent with the Committee's dual mandate.”  The Committee decided to keep the target range for the federal funds rate \nat 0 to 1/4 percent and “cu rrently anticipates that economic conditions – including low rates of resource utilization and a \nsubdued outlook for inflation over the medium run – are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels for the federal funds \nrate at least through mid -2013.”  \n \n10 Given median income, relative to the income needed to purchase the median priced home.  \n \n11 And if anything, household formation has not kept up with population growth, suggesting a growing pent -up demand for \nhomes.  \n \n12 See http://www.corelogic.com/about -us/new s/new -corelogic -data-reveals -q2-negative -equity -declines -in-hardest -hit-\nmarkets -and-8-million -negative -equity -borrowers -have -above.aspx  \n \n13 CoreLogic gets the 5.1 percent number by noting that the current mortgage rate is roughly 4.1 percent, then adding a \n100 basis -point “refinance trigger.”  Refinances are costly even under normal circumstances, so there has to be a non -\ntrivial difference b etween the existing rate and the new rate in order for a refinance to make financial sense.  \n \n14 The fraction of negative -equity mortgages paying above 5.1 percent is 74.3 percent (8.1 million out of a total 10.9 \nmillion underwater mortgages).

This document, titled “Reforming \nAmerica’s Housing Finance Market: A Report to C ongress,” is available at \nhttp://www.treasury.gov/initiatives/Documents/Reforming%20America%27s%20Housing%20Finance%20Market.pdf . \n \n19 The GS Es regularly review delinquent loans to ensure that their loan files are consistent with the representations and \nwarranties made by originators. In cases where the GSEs believe the loan file does not match what the originator \npromised, the GSE s can issue a  repurchase request. As delinquencies have risen, so have the number of these buyback \nrequests. Many have argued that concern over buybacks has made originators less willing to issue certain types of loans.  \nOver the long run, economic theory would predict  that market participants could work out a solution to this problem. For \nexample, third -party firms could arise to offer insurance to originators against buybacks. Alternatively, the originators and \nthe GSEs could find ways of doing business that would bet ter capture the mutual gains from trade. But these market \nsolutions are less likely to come about if mortgage -market participants are uncertain abo ut the future role of the GSEs.  \n \n20 According to the August 2011 Mortgage Monitor, published by Lender Process ing Services, Inc., foreclosure timelines \nhave lengthened significantly during the past three years. In July 2011, the average mortgage in foreclosure was \ndelinquent for 599 days, up from 319 days in January 2009 [The LPS Mortgage Monitor, published by LPS  Applied \nAnalytics, is available at \nhttp://www.lpsvcs.com/LPSCorporateInformation/ResourceCenter/PressResources/Pages/MortgageMonitor.aspx. The \nAugust 2011 Monitor includes data through the end of July. The days -delinquent statistic quoted in the text appe ars on \nslide 3.]. Also, foreclosure delays tend to be especially serious in states that require judicial involvement.  \n \n21 A report from the Special Inspector General for the Troubled Asset Relief Program (which funds HAFA) reports that far \nmore short  sales and deeds -in-lieu have taken place outside of HAFA than in it.  See p. 67 of the SIGTARP’s July 2011 \nQuarterly Report to Congress, available at \nhttp://www.sigtarp.gov/reports/congress/2011/July2011_Quarterly_Report_to_Congress.pdf.  \nThis report states: “As of June 30, 2011, which according to Treasury is the latest data available, approximately $37.9 \nmillion from TARP had been paid to investors, borrowers, and servicers in connection with 10,280 short sales or deeds -in-\nlieu of foreclosure transfers completed  under HAFA. As of May 31, 2011, which according to Treasury is the latest data \navailable, Treasury reported that the 10 largest servicers alone had completed 112,525 short sales and deeds -in-lieu \noutside HAMP for borrowers whose HAMP trial modifications h ad failed, borrowers who had chosen not to participate, or \nwere ineligible for the program.” The most recent data on the number of HAFA transactions is available from the U.S. \nTreasury at http://www.treasury.gov/initiatives/financial -stability/results/MHA -Reports/Pages/default.aspx. While \ndocumentation requirements and other regulations in HAFA may be responsible for much of this difference, the Special \nInspector General’s report suggests that the difference could result in part by the ability of servicers to collect fees and \ndeficiency judgments for non -HAFA transactions. Deficiency judgments are not permitted in the HAFA program. \nNotably, many HAFA requirements have recently been relaxed. For example, as of February 1, servicers of non -GSE \nmortgages partic ipating in HAFA are no longer required to verify a borrower’s financial information, or to determine that \nhis monthly mortgage payment exceeded 31 percent of his monthly income. However, servicers must continue to obtain a \nsigned affidavit indicating that the borrower has experienced some sort of financial hardship.

Rosengren \nPresident & Chief Executive Officer \nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston \n \nRemarks at the Global Interdependence Center’s \nConference on Capital Markets in  the Post Crisis Environment \n \nStockholm, Sweden \nSeptember 29, 2011 \n  \n \nI am very happy to be with you for this substant ive conference on capital  markets in the “post-\ncrisis” environment.  It is vital for policymak ers and practitioners to study and apply the recent \nlessons of financial interdependence, given the o bvious effects on public wellbeing.  So I am glad to \nbe able to join you in these discussions.  A nd I commend the Global Interdependence Center for \norganizing this event, and others like it. \nI should note, of course, that the views I expr ess today are my own, and not necessarily those \nof my colleagues on the Federal Reserve’s Boar d of Governors or the Federal Open Market \nCommittee (the FOMC).  That is a st andard disclaimer for Fed officials, but I really do mean it.  My \ncomments should not be construed as  official Fed perspectives or policy, but rather one person’s \ncarefully considered perspectives, based on much study.  Let me also mention that my charts, and the \nanalysis I will share with  you today, are all built on publicly available data. \n\n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Thurs., Sept. 29, 2011, at 2:50 AM U.S. Eastern Time & 8:50 AM  in Stockholm, Sweden; or upon delivery * \n \n \n \n 2My intent today is to offer up some constructive observations that I believe will help us move \ntowards greater financial stability, to the benefit of all.  We need to create a more stable financial infrastructure and I believe we can, in a thoughtful manner.   \nFor the second time in four years, problems w ith financial institutions have captured the \nattention not only of economists, but  also the mainstream press and th e public at large.  Given the \nimportance of credit to economic performance, we should reflect on why our financial system seems \nso susceptible to shocks, and on how we can strengt hen its resilience so gove rnment intervention is no \nlonger necessitated by such shocks.  My hope is that bankers and cen tral bankers can once again be \nrelegated from the front pages of our newspapers to the business sections. \nYesterday I had an opportunity to participate in an economic outlook forum and discuss some \nof the challenges in the real econom y – specifically in housing – that we are trying to address in the \nUnited States.  Today I’d like to shift somewhat from the real economy directly, and focus on more \nunderlying financial-market challenges.    \nIt goes without saying that this is  an important time to be disc ussing financial markets.  Global \nfinancial markets are being buffeted by concerns about the challenges f acing various financial \ninstitutions, in part as a result of issues with fiscal imbalances  in a number of countries.  This \nheightened uncertainty is occurri ng despite the aggressive monetary policy actions taken in response \nto the recent recession – actions that at first blush w ould seemingly mitigate some of these challenges.   \nConsistent with our mandate, the Federal Re serve acted aggressively when financial \ndisruptions emerged and the economy faltered.  After cutting the federa l funds rate essentially as far \nas possible, the Fed took less traditional policy actions, again to pursue our mandate.  Figure 1  shows \nthat bank reserves in the United Stat es have increased dramatically.  We have increased the size of the \nFederal Reserve balance sheet, providing over a trilli on dollars in additional bank reserves – yet even \nso, dollar funding markets have experienced strains.   \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Thurs., Sept. 29, 2011, at 2:50 AM U.S. Eastern Time & 8:50 AM  in Stockholm, Sweden; or upon delivery * \n \n \n \n 3Figure 2  highlights that interbank markets are showi ng more strains as th e spread between the \n3-month London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) and the overnight index swap rate has widened.  \nThis is happening even though most banks are loath to post higher rate s for fear of signaling financial \nchallenges.   \nAlso reflective of the current strain is Figure 3 , which essentially shows the cost of utilizing \nderivatives contracts to secure dollar funding.  It show s the spread between the 3-month dollar cash \nrate implied by a 3-month euro-dollar FX sw ap, and 3-month dollar LIBOR.  Under normal \nconditions the line should be quite close to zero, but during periods of dollar funding problems, the \nspread can widen.  As the chart shows, the spread is now at the widest it has been in the past several \nyears. \nSo how can there be a shortage of dollar f unding at a time when there are so many bank \nreserves?  One answer lies in th e structure of short-term funding markets – a structure that has \nevolved to a state that is, unf ortunately, particularly sensi tive to liquidity shocks.   \nToday I will highlight that the structure of  the U.S. money market mutual fund (MMMF) \nindustry1 -- and the practice of many fina ncial institutions to fund long-te rm dollar assets with short-\nterm dollar liabilities – have both helped make th e global financial system susceptible to liquidity \nshocks and (relatedly) to change s in the perceived credit risk  of market participants.   \nI will first discuss the role that MMMFs pl ay in providing short-term funding, including \nserving as an important source of short-term financ ing for European banks.  I will highlight that the \ncurrent structure makes MMMFs particularly susceptible to credit shocks that can turn into liquidity \nproblems for the whole industry – and will suggest so me ways that the industry could be made more \nresilient.   \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Thurs., Sept. 29, 2011, at 2:50 AM U.S. Eastern Time & 8:50 AM  in Stockholm, Sweden; or upon delivery * \n \n \n \n 4And I will then turn to the practice among some European ba nks of funding long-term dollar \nassets with short-term paper purchased by MMMFs.  Th is too, has proved to be a structure that makes \nshort-term credit markets suscep tible to liquidity shocks.   \nI will conclude with some general observations about the current stresses in financial markets. \n \nThe Role of Money Market Mutual Funds in Short-Term Credit Markets \nMMMFs are mutual funds that provi de investors the ability to i nvest in a diversified set of \nshort-term credit-market instruments.  Because  MMMFs generally invest in highly liquid, high \nquality, short-term credit instruments they are not required to alter their net value to reflect small \nmovements in underlying asset values.  The resulti ng stable (versus floating) net asset value makes \nthe investments attractive to investors looking for a transactional account that generally has paid a \nsomewhat higher return than comparable bank products.   \nLike other mutual funds, MMMFs are not required to hold any capital as protection against \nadverse movements in the value of the assets they hold.  This absence of cap ital, together with the \nstable net asset value, results in a structure that desp ite its appeal in other ways is prone to shareholder \n“runs” during times of financial stresses. \nMMMFs have been viewed as appealingly safe investment vehicles for investors seeking \nhighly liquid investment opportunities.  As a condition of transacting at a stable net asset value, the \nMMMFs, which are regulated by the Securities and Exchange Commi ssion (SEC), are required to \nmaintain significant liquidity ratios and are limited in the duration and credit ratings of the financial instruments they can hold.\n2, 3  \nMMMFs are critical players in short-term credit markets.  They have been very significant \nbuyers of commercial paper, asset-backed commer cial paper, and certificates of deposit.  MMMFs \nhave provided an important source of financing for organizations dependent  on wholesale financing, \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Thurs., Sept. 29, 2011, at 2:50 AM U.S. Eastern Time & 8:50 AM  in Stockholm, Sweden; or upon delivery * \n \n \n \n 5including branches of foreign banking organizations operating in the U.S. – I will discuss them in a \nmoment – and others that issu e short-term credit instruments to finance longer-term dollar-\ndenominated assets. \nAs Figure 4  illustrates, MMMFs are sizeable participan ts in financial markets with about $2.5 \ntrillion of assets under management.  They grew rapi dly for much of the last decade, but encountered \nsignificant problems in the wake of the failure  of Lehman Brothers.  One MMMF, the Reserve \nPrimary Fund, had a position in Le hman Brothers and was unable to maintain a fixed net asset value \n(“broke the buck”) after Lehman faile d and the value of its commercial  paper plummeted.  This led to \nrapid withdrawals from many MMMFs (a “run”) as  investors became concerned that other MMMFs \nwould not be able to maintain their stable net asset value.   \nIn response to the rapid withdrawals, the U. S. Treasury announced a temporary insurance \nprogram for MMMFs.  The Federal Reserve Bank of  Boston administered on behalf of the Federal \nReserve System a lending facility that was designed  to address the short-term liquidity needs of \nMMMFs and help stabilize short-term  credit markets that were disrupted by the rapid liquidation of \ninvestments by many MMMFs.4,5  These efforts proved successful at restoring stability and avoiding \nfurther harm, and all of the loan s were repaid with interest.6   \nSince then, balances at MMMFs have gradually d eclined – by more than a trillion dollars from \ntheir peak – over the past three year s in response to the historically low interest rate environment and \ncorresponding returns. \nFigure 5  shows the three major categor ies of MMMFs, determined by the assets in which they \ninvest.  The prime money market funds are the largest category, w ith approximately $1.5 trillion in \nassets.  The prime funds have the most flexibility  in investing and are a llowed to hold commercial \npaper, jumbo CDs,7 and asset-backed commercial paper as well as government-backed securities.  \nThe second largest category, with approximately $850 million in assets, involves MMMFs that invest \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Thurs., Sept. 29, 2011, at 2:50 AM U.S. Eastern Time & 8:50 AM  in Stockholm, Sweden; or upon delivery * \n \n \n \n 6in U.S. Treasury and agency securities.  These funds  have lower credit risk, but also generate lower \nreturns.  The smallest category involves MMMFs th at provide tax-free returns to investors.   \nAt the time of the Lehman Brothers failure, prime MMMFs that had credit-sensitive investors \nand exposure to large financial institutions expe rienced the largest and most rapid redemptions.8  \nMany investor outflows from prime funds were redirected to MMMFs that  were government-only \nfunds.   \nMMMFs have substantially increased their liquidity over the last y ear.  In part this reflects a \ntightening of liquidity requirements by the SEC,  but it also reflects th e realization among MMMF \nmanagers that during times of significant liquidity risk, they need to maintain a more defensive \nposture.  As Figure 6  shows, prime funds have been increasing their holdings of short-maturity assets \nof late – in part, one assumes, as a result of th e debt ceiling concerns in the U.S. and the funding \nworries related to governments and fi nancial institutions in Europe. \nSince MMMFs have increased liquidity in an en vironment of very low returns on short-term \ncredit instruments, their returns to inve stors have been squeezed further.   Figure 7  illustrates the \nimpact on MMMF returns.  The first line in the tabl e provides the average yiel ds for the five highest \nyielding MMMFs, and the second line  provides the average yields for the next five highest yielding \nfunds.  The table highlights that while the gross  yield averages about 40 basis points for the five \nhighest yielding MMMFs, inve stors are only getting a net yield of only five basis points.  \nMMMFs have purchased a large amount of  foreign-bank securities.  But as Figure 8  shows, \nmost MMMFs have been reducing their exposure to  European banks that the market may see as \nposing more significant credit risk s.  Some of the reductions have  been quite dramatic, and MMMFs \nare no longer holding short-term credit instruments i ssued by institutions headquartered in the most \nfinancially strained countries.  Th ey have greatly reduced the size of  their overall exposure, and have \nalso significantly reduced the matu rity they are willing to hold. \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Thurs., Sept. 29, 2011, at 2:50 AM U.S. Eastern Time & 8:50 AM  in Stockholm, Sweden; or upon delivery * \n \n \n \n 7However, one of the challenges for the MMMF i ndustry is that, just as in the fall of 2008, a \nvery few aggressive MMMFs – maybe even one – could under certain circumstances encounter \ntrouble that ends up ratcheting up redemp tion requests across the industry.   \nNo one wants to see a repeat of 2008, nor should we.  The industry and all participants can get \nto a better place.  For example, an examination of  the publicly available m onthly reports on portfolio \nholdings of MMMFs highlights that a few MMMFs hold financial paper that has not been \ndowngraded but nonetheless is seen by the market as posing more credit risk than could seem \nappropriate for entities that are allowed to maintain a fixed net asset value. \nMMMFs have been required to provide a monthly report of holdings and have increased their \nliquidity.  Still, we are passing the three-year anniversary of the failure of Lehman and the run on the MMMFs and it remains important to explore the ways that the industry, which pl ays a pivotal role in \nshort-term credit markets, can address its susceptib ility to a credit shock that could in turn be \ntransmitted to short-term financial markets.  I am  not saying anything that has not been expressed \nbefore, but want to highlight the opportunities we all have to move thoughtfully but expeditiously to a \nmore stable place. \nGiven all this, I believe a more proactive regu latory approach may be necessary.  While the \nmonthly reporting has been helpful, given the very s hort maturity of many of the assets, I believe the \nreporting should be more frequent to avoid the possi bility of “window dressi ng” at the end of the \nmonth.  Also, reducing a fund’s maximum permissibl e exposure to any one firm could reduce the \npotential loss that would occur from a credit even t involving only one counterparty.  Consideration \nmight also be given to whether the assets of risk ier firms (for example thos e with very high market \ncredit default swaps (“CDS”) prices are appropriate  investments for MMMFs, which are expected to \nmaintain a low risk profile. \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Thurs., Sept. 29, 2011, at 2:50 AM U.S. Eastern Time & 8:50 AM  in Stockholm, Sweden; or upon delivery * \n \n \n \n 8There have been a variety of proposals recommendi ng more substantial changes in this arena.  \nHowever, three years after a systemically significan t episode, no one proposal has been settled on.   \nMy own preferred approach would be to requ ire MMMFs to have a meaningful capital-like \nbuffer that exceeds, for example, their single-issu er concentration exposure limits – perhaps on the \norder of 2 to 3 percent – that, if violated, automatically leads to a fund’s conversion to a floating net \nasset value.  Examples of how to structure such  a buffer include having the MMMF’s sponsor directly \nfund the creation of the buffer, or creating a separate class of loss- absorbing shares that could be \nmarketed to investors willing to bear  some risk in exchange for a higher return than that provided by \nthe stable value shares.  If in some appropriate pe riod of time a satisfactory plan for such a capital \nbuffer is not produced and accepted, then those prime funds would be required to  float their net asset \nvalue.  \nAll in all, though, given the systemic importance of the MMMF industry, it is critical that one \nway or another we make the industry less susceptible to credit shocks and li quidity runs.  While many \nin the MMMF industry have been reducing their e xposure to troubled financ ial institutions, some \ncontinue to take what some observers might consid er outsized credit risks.  The experience of 2008 \nshowed the potential for a MMMF’s problems to precipitate redemptions that are ultimately \ndestabilizing to short-term credit ma rkets, and contribute to economic difficulties.  I am certainly not \npredicting any such outcome but not ing that policymakers, market pa rticipants, and the industry can \nand should make steady progress on these matters.  \nForeign Branches and Agenci es in the United States \n The consideration of MMMFs is intertwined with another issue of systemic risk that I would \nlike to discuss – the dependence, to  a large degree, of foreign branch es and agencies in the U.S. on \nshort-term wholesale funding. \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Thurs., Sept. 29, 2011, at 2:50 AM U.S. Eastern Time & 8:50 AM  in Stockholm, Sweden; or upon delivery * \n \n \n \n 9 Let me first note that while I will raise some concerns in this arena, we are beginning to \naddress them within the existing statutory framewor k.  However, over time other structural remedies \nmay be warranted and possible.   \nUnlike domestic banks or foreign bank subsidiaries  in the U.S., foreign branches and agencies \nare not allowed to have U.S. deposit insurance a nd thus cannot rely on insu red retail deposits as a \nfunding source.  In addition, forei gn banks are ineligible for member ship in, and receiving secured \nfunds from, the Federal Home Loan banks – which have been an important source of liquidity for \nmany domestic banks.  As a result, they are especi ally reliant on wholesale funding – that is, raising \nfunds by issuing jumbo certificates of deposit, commercial paper, a nd repurchase agreements; all of \nwhich during times of stress are less stab le than typical retail deposit accounts.9   \nParenthetically, I would note that foreign branches are not required to directly hold any capital \nwith their U.S. operations.  I will say more on this in a moment. \nWhile wholesale funding is an important part of a bank’s liability st ructure, an excessive \nreliance on short-term wholesale funding to finan ce long-term assets can be problematic.  In \nparticular, in situations where wholesale financing is not available, foreig n branches can find it \ndifficult to raise required dollar funding and the forei gn parent may not be able  to fill the funding gap \neffectively.  This is one of the reasons why fore ign banks were among the most aggressive users of \nthe Fed’s liquidity facilities a nd Discount Window in the wake of the run on MMMFs in the fall of \n2008.  Foreign branches and agencies utilize wholesale dollar deposits for two main purposes.  First, \nthey use the short-term wholesal e deposits to fund longer-term U.S.  dollar bank loans and securities \nholdings.  They frequently fund large corporate borro wing needs.  Second, the branches are often used \nto raise dollar funding for their global parent.  Thus , branches frequently pr ovide longer-term funding \nto their parent to fund dolla r assets the parent is holding outside of the branch. \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Thurs., Sept. 29, 2011, at 2:50 AM U.S. Eastern Time & 8:50 AM  in Stockholm, Sweden; or upon delivery * \n \n \n \n 10 I will say a fair amount about foreign branches today, so I want to stress that the focus stems \nfrom the important and useful func tion that they serve as a source of finance in our global economy. \n Figure 9  provides the major components of foreign br anch assets.  These are principally loans \nand leases and securities holdings such as high-grade corporate secu rities.  In addition, you can see \nthat foreign banks have been attemp ting to increase their liquidity in  case their access to wholesale \nfunding becomes constrained – as reflected in the sharp increase  in cash and bank reserves. \nFigure 10  provides the major components of foreign branch liabilities.  Roughly 75 percent of \nbranch liabilities are generated by jumbo deposits,  commercial paper and other borrowing, including \nfinancing through repurchase agreements.  One of  the primary sources of these funds are the \nMMMFs.    Using shorter-term wholesale funding (in bran ches) to fund longer-term assets held by the \nbranch or the parent proved probl ematic in the fall of 2008.  The investor run on money market funds \nforced the funds to stop acquiring new (and “rolli ng over” existing) jumbo deposits and commercial \npaper, causing a serious f unding problem for the issuing entities .  Short-term credit markets became \nseverely stressed, requiring signifi cant government intervention to re store liquidity to the market. \n Concerns over problems in Europe are once ag ain posing a problem for the strategy of short-\nterm wholesale funding of longer-ter m U.S. dollar assets.  Despite th e large supply of bank reserves I \nmentioned earlier, a reduction in MMMF financ ing has once again result ed in a problem for \nwholesale dollar funding.  The recent announcement of several central banks that they would provide \nlonger-term dollar financing has once again highlighted that short-term  credit markets are, in my own \nopinion, overly dependent on structures  that are highly sensitive to cr edit and liquidity conditions.  \nOver time it will be important to get to a place wh ere adequate funding flows do not require official \nintervention during times of stress. \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Thurs., Sept. 29, 2011, at 2:50 AM U.S. Eastern Time & 8:50 AM  in Stockholm, Sweden; or upon delivery * \n \n \n \n 11 As with MMMFs, a greater focus on financial stability should cause a re-evaluation of \nstructures with no direct capital and a clear relia nce on rolling over short-te rm liabilities to fund \nlonger-term assets.  The foreign branch system is im portant because of the role it plays in U.S. credit \nmarkets and also because of the dollar funding it f acilitates for foreign banks, facilitating global \ncommerce.  However, it does suffer from some of the same problems as the money market funds. \n There are a number ways to try to reduce these liquidity problems associated with the current \nbranch structure.  Clearly this issue requires much  careful thought and analys is, so what I’ll suggest \ntoday should be viewed only as examples of possible approaches  that could be taken.   \nOne supervisory approach could be  to preserve the current branch  structure but take steps to \nreduce funding risks in various ways.10  It may be advisable to requi re greater liquidity from global \nparents.  And I would note that several of the Basel III Capital Accord’s liquidity measures will make \nreliance on wholesale funding less attractive.11 \nSecondly, regulatory approaches that have been taken in so me countries require foreign \nbranches to hold capital, or re quire all bank operations to be under a separate holding company \nstructure with capital to support the entirety of domestic operations in the country.  Requiring capital \nfor all domestic operations of foreign banks has costs.12  But it is one option, worthy of study.   \nBoth of these approaches would in all likeli hood cause firms to reconsider whether a more \nstable funding model – for example a more stable mix of funds including wholesale, insured, and \nlonger-term debt – could be superi or to purely wholesale funding.   \nWhile we should actively consider a variety of options, my personal preference would be to \nmove towards all foreign banking operations requiri ng some form of bank capital.  This approach \ncould reduce the liquidity crises th at have occurred episodically, and could also address the possibility \nthat as some banks have become large relative to the size of their countries,  it could be difficult for \nparents to back up branches during a crisis. \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Thurs., Sept. 29, 2011, at 2:50 AM U.S. Eastern Time & 8:50 AM  in Stockholm, Sweden; or upon delivery * \n \n \n \n 12 All in all, I would suggest th at the financial stability issues  raised in 2008, and which have \nbecome increasingly prevalent of late , require a reexaminatio n of issues that influence the stability of \nshort-term credit markets. \n \nConcluding Observations \n In sum and in conclusion, short-term credit ma rkets have become increasingly susceptible to \nrapid shifts in sentiment – shifts that can create  global liquidity problems.  The structure of MMMFs, \neven with improvements that make them less at risk  of runs, can still cause problems – for example if \nMMMFs move assets quickly out of certain segmen ts of wholesale funding markets.  This could \nhappen because of increased credit concerns on the part of  either money-market investors or money-\nmarket managers.   \nAnd foreign banks that have become dependent on MMMFs and other sources of wholesale \nfunding are another concern.  As in 2008, now in  2011 we are seeing dollar shortages as MMMFs \nshun some financial institutions with various exposu res to troubles in Europe  – a situation that is \nhaving a negative impact on short-term credit markets.  All in all, the global banking system curren tly remains more vulnerable than it should and \ncould be.  And more than just the liquidity struct ure is problematic.  Some  global banks appear to \nhave lost the confidence of more than the MMMFs.  Share prices have fallen dramatically for some \nbank stocks, and credit default swap prices for some global banks are at elevated levels.   \nBank supervisors worldwide may do more to utilize these market signals when deciding \nwhether banks should be allowed to issue di vidends or make share repurchases.  Using market  \ntriggers as well as capital  triggers to prevent capital from leavi ng the banking system (or to bolster it \nas necessary) during times of stress should be revi sited.  Should market assessments be wrong, banks \nwould only have deferred dividends or share repurchases.  They c ould be resumed at a higher level \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Thurs., Sept. 29, 2011, at 2:50 AM U.S. Eastern Time & 8:50 AM  in Stockholm, Sweden; or upon delivery * \n \n \n \n 13once the problems are resolved.  Furthermore, using publicly observed signals to  trigger a cessation of \ndividends may have less of a market impact th an dividend reductions  based on management \njudgment.13   \nAllowing dividends and share repurchases to occu r when the risk of a crisis is high allows \nscarce capital to leave the banking system at a time when it is most needed.  Such a policy risks that \ntaxpayers, debt holders, and the economy will suffer should bank capital be insufficient to weather the \ncrisis.   \nIf market triggers were hit and bank supervis ors became concerned about credit availability \nfrom the financial system, in certa in circumstances they could choos e to suspend dividends and stock \nrepurchases for all systemically im portant banks.  This would retain capital in the banking system and \nallow the stronger banks to continue  their important role as financia l intermediaries at a time when \nsome of their peers are constraine d by their financial problems. While Basel III has proposed dividend \nreductions as capital becomes deplete d, I suspect that is likely to be too late, given th e slow pace at \nwhich accounting losses are realized.   \nIt has become clear that financial stability is too central to the perfor mance of economies not \nto explore options for moving forward and reducing in stability.  We need to move constructively and \nprudently to a better place, a nd I believe we can and should.   \n Thank you.                                                     \n \n \n1 The analysis presented here includes 2a-7 funds but, in fact, a broader definition of money funds can be considered  \nwhen discussing the structure and the sensitivity to liquidity shocks. \n \n2 Under section 2a-7 of the Investment Company Act – that is, under Securities and Exchange Commission Rule 2a-7 (17 \nCFR 270.2a-7) issued pursuant to the Investment Company Act of 1940 (Rule 2a-7). \n \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Thurs., Sept. 29, 2011, at 2:50 AM U.S. Eastern Time & 8:50 AM  in Stockholm, Sweden; or upon delivery * \n \n \n \n 14                                                                                                                                                                     \n3 They cannot hold securities with a maturity greater than 13 months, and the average maturity of their assets cannot \nexceed 90 days.  The securities have to be of low credit risk, an d a fund can have no more than  5 percent of its assets with \nany one issuer.   \n \n4 Given the disruptions, the Federal Reserve System announced an asset-backed commercial paper MMMF liquidity \nfacility. The facility, operated for the System by the Bost on Fed, allowed money market funds to sell asset-backed \ncommercial paper to banks – the MMMFs could use the sale procee ds to meet redemption requests – and the asset-backed \ncommercial paper was pledged by the banks to the Fed as part of a loan from the Fed, which was ultimately paid back \nwith interest.    \n5 For more on this episode see my remarks at the Stanford Finance Forum in June: \nhttp://www.bostonfed.org/news/speeche s/rosengren/2011/060311/index.htm  \n \n6 See “How Effective Were the Federal Reserve Emergenc y Liquidity Facilities? Evidence from the Asset-Backed \nCommercial Paper Money Market Mutual Fund Liqu idity Facility” (QAU Working Paper No. QAU10-3 \nby Burcu Duygan-Bump, Patrick M. Parkinson, Eric S. Roseng ren, Gustavo A. Suarez, and Paul S. Willen).  The working \npaper explains that following the failure of Lehman Brothers in September 2008, short-term credit markets were severely \ndisrupted. In response, the Federal Rese rve implemented new and unconventional facilities to help restore liquidity. Many \nexisting analyses of thes e interventions are confounded by  identification problems because they rely on aggregate data. \nTwo unique micro datasets allow us to exploit both time series and cross-sectional variation to evaluate one of the most \nunusual of these facilities—the Asset-Backed Commercial Pape r Money Market Mutual Fund Liquidity Facility (AMLF). \nThe AMLF extended collateralized loans to depository institutio ns that purchased asset-backed commercial paper (ABCP) \nfrom money market funds, helping these funds meet the heavy redemptions that followed Lehman’s bankruptcy. The \nprogram, which lent $150 billion in its first 10 days of oper ation, was wound down with no credit losses to the Federal \nReserve. Our findings indicate that the facility was effective as measured against its dual objectives: it helped stabilize \nasset outflows from money market mutual funds, and it impr oved liquidity in the ABCP market. Using a differences-in-\ndifferences approach we show that afte r the facility was implemented, money market fund outflows decreased more for \nthose funds that held more eligible collateral. Similarly,  we show that yields on AMLF-eligible ABCP decreased \nsignificantly relative to those on otherwise comparable AMLF-ineligible commercial paper.  \n7 Some funds restrict their investme nts to FDIC insured CDs.  The fore ign branch CDs tend to be jumbos. \n \n8 These are shareholders redeeming  their equity investments. \n \n9 During times of stress it may also be more difficult to rely on the foreign parent organization for support, as it may be \nunder stress as well. \n \n10 Steps could include increasing liquidity  concentration; limiting the level of r eceivables from related entities; requiring \nthat any such receivables be collateralized  by high-quality assets held at the paren t; increasing diversification in third part y \nfunding; establishing funding tenor limits, so that branches hold less shorter-term wholesale funding; requiring that \nbranches collateralize some of their third party funding with high-quality collateral; and requiring branches to better match \nthe tenor of assets with the tenor of liabilities they hold. \n \n11 However, in this regard it depends upon how the rules for “significant currencies” are enforced. \n \n12 For example, banks would have less flexibility to move liqui dity and capital across borders, and maintaining separate \nrisk analysis by country could raise costs for global banks. \n \n13 Since by construction the public trigger approach conveys no negative information about the bank’s earnings prospects \nbeyond what the market already knows. \n\nTowards Greater Financial Stability \nin Short -Term Credit Markets\nEric S.

Rosengren \nPresident & Chief Executive Officer \nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston \n \n \nOctober 19, 2011 \nBoston, Massachusetts \n \n \n \n \nI’d like to reiterate the welcome to confer ence participants that I offered yesterday.  \nThank you for being here to take part in this conference on the long-term  effects of what many \nhave come to call, sadly, the “Great Recession.”  I hope that the ideas and analysis exchanged at \nthis conference will help alleviate the effects of this downturn and the slow recovery, as well as help prevent future problems from cau sing so much hardship for so many. \n\n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, October 19, 2011 at  8:30 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY  * \n \n \n2 \n I should mention that the views I express toda y are my own, and not necessarily those of \nmy colleagues on the Federal Reserve’s Board of Governors or the Federal Open Market \nCommittee (the FOMC).   \nAs I – and others – have noted many times, a key lesson from the recent downturn and \nprior financial crises is that problems in financial institutions  and financial markets can and do \nspill over to the real economy, very significantl y.  Policymakers must worry about the financial \nsystem and markets because problems there can disrupt the financial intermediation on which market economies depend.\n1  When this happens the economy suffers, and the economic \nprospects of its participants.   \nGiven the severity of the recession that follo wed the recent financial crisis, it is crucial \nthat our financial infrastructure becomes res ilient enough so that financial intermediation can \ncontinue, regardless of a shock, without extraordinary interventi on from the public sector (the \ngovernment and, ultimately, taxpayers).  Du ring 2007 and 2008, the U.S. Congress, Treasury \ndepartment, Federal Deposit Insurance Cor poration, and the Federal Reserve all took \nextraordinary actions to avoid a more-severe fi nancial crisis and more damage to economic \nprospects.  Despite this unprecedented public-polic y response, the recession was long and severe \nand the recovery continues to be much slower than we would like.  And the United States was \nnot unique in this respect. Many foreign gove rnments and foreign cen tral banks also took \nunprecedented action to try to alle viate the effects of the financ ial crisis in their countries. \nParticularly noteworthy is how  many large global financial intermediaries experienced \nsevere distress.  These institutions play a vital role in the credit flows and financial \nintermediation that underpin the global economy.  They span national borders and presumably \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, October 19, 2011 at  8:30 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY  * \n \n \n3 \n have the ability to be better di versified across products and ge ographic locations than smaller \ninstitutions or intermediaries doi ng business in just one country.   \nBut because these global intermediaries are key players in many countries and in many \nfinancial markets, and because they are highly interconnected with other financial institutions, \nthey also serve as particularly efficient conductors  or transmitters of shocks in one area to the \nwider global financial system.  Unfortunately, such was the case  with the major shock caused by \nresidential real estate problems in the U.S.  Mo re recently it appears to be the case with the \nsovereign debt problems in Europe. \nAs you know, there have been significant legi slative and regulatory responses to the \nfinancial crisis that emerged in 2007.  In th e United States, the Dodd- Frank legislation made \nsignificant changes to frameworks for addressing systemically important financial institutions, \namong other things.  Internati onally, many of the impending Basel III rules are similarly \nintended to address some of the le ssons of the financial crisis.   \nI am very supportive of these efforts, but I suspect they can be strengthened and \nimproved.  Indeed some countries, such as the U.K. and Switzerland, are fairly far along in \nestablishing standards that are hi gher than those required by Basel III.  But in my view some \nsignificant challenges remain to be addressed if we are to have  a global banking system in which \nno institution is “too big to fail” given the collater al damage its disorderly demise would cause to \neconomies and citizens.   \nBefore the new domestic and international rules could be fully implemented, the world \nhas once again been buffeted by financial shocks , this time emanating in Europe.  And once \nagain large financial intermediaries, despite all th e positive roles they play in facilitating global \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, October 19, 2011 at  8:30 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY  * \n \n \n4 \n commerce, have been efficient in transmitting or  conducting the shocks.  As a result the world \neconomy has slowed, and stock prices of large financ ial intermediaries have fallen significantly.   \nOnce again, governments have started to inte rvene to mitigate global banking problems, \nwhich in turn may stress the debt burden of those governments, and could ultimately undermine the credit ratings of some countries.  While the full impact of sovereign debt problems and their \nimpact on large financial intermediaries will not be known for some time, it is apparent that the \nfinancial intermediaries encompass some vulnera bilities for the world financial system and the \nglobal economy. \n \nConsidering the Large Financial Intermediaries \nGiven the key role that large financial inte rmediaries played in the crisis of 2007 and \n2008, as well as their role in the problems that have arisen more recently, it is important to \nunderstand why financial intermediaries contribute vulnerabilities to  the global financial system.  \nSo I’d like to provide some background on the la rge intermediaries a nd their potential for \nconducting shocks aroun d the global economy. \nFigure 1  explores bank size relative to the size of  the home country, spec ifically the asset \nsize of the largest bank in each  country as a share of GDP.\n2  When financial intermediaries \nbecome large relative to the GDP of the home country, several potential challenges exist.3   First, \na large institution could essentiall y be “too big to save.”   Shou ld a global bank become insolvent \nand the home country need to recapita lize it – so that it can continue  its crucial role in financial \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, October 19, 2011 at  8:30 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY  * \n \n \n5 \n intermediation within the economy – then the sheer scale of the required equity capital could \nstrain a country trying to raise suffici ent funds to provide the equity.    \nConsider a hypothetical example.  A troubled two trillion dollar bank located in a country \nwhose GDP is also two trillion dollars would in all likelihood put  the country in a position of \nneeding to issue government debt to finance an e quity infusion.  If the government recapitalized \nthe bank with 10 percent more capital, the natio n’s debt to GDP ratio would increase by 10 \npercent.  If multiple banks failed at the same time,  the national debt to GDP ratio would rise even \nfurther.  Thus while government rescue of a bank may stem an individual institution’s crisis, it \ncan precipitate sovereign debt concerns. \nIreland’s recent experience is instructive.  The Irish banks were not among the world’s \nlargest financial intermediaries, but they were large relative to the size of their home country’s \neconomy.   Prior to its banking crisis, Ireland was a country with a relatively low debt to GDP, \nbut became a country with a high debt to GDP ratio – largely as  a result of providing emergency \nequity support for its troubled banking sector. \nNow I would like to dire ct your attention to Figure 2 , which shows the pricing on \nsovereign credit default swaps fo r a number of countries.  Cred it default swap (CDS) rates for \nmany countries are now very high by historical st andards – meaning the cost of insuring against \na sovereign default has risen appreciably.  While I know that thin trading in credit default swaps \nfor individual entities necessitates caution in their interpretation, the overall trend is clear.  A \ncountry needing to recapitalize on e or more of its financial intermediaries faces further fiscal \nstrain – potentially at a precarious time, when investors have already become more cautious \nabout trends in the countr y’s debt to GDP levels. \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, October 19, 2011 at  8:30 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY  * \n \n \n6 \n Another potential problem arises when investors have little confidence in a particular \nglobal bank or the home government.  In this cas e, simply recapitalizing the bank may not be \nsufficient to address concerns, and additional fina ncial support by the country may be necessary.  \nFor example if depositors rapidly withdraw their deposits from a troubled bank, the home \ncountry may need to support deposit holders in addition to providing equity (capital) – \nparticularly in countries wh ere deposit insurance regimes ar e not robust, or payment of \ndepositors’ claims is not timely.   \nWhat’s more, a failure to support the liabili ties of a troubled ba nk (in this case the \ndeposits) would poten tially destabilize other  banks in the country, even  those with relatively \nhealthy balance sheets.  Compared to simply in fusing capital, supporting lia bilities co uld require \nmuch larger expenditures by the home country and thus the home country would need to \ncontribute substantial additional funds. \nYet another issue concerns th e reliance of large financial intermediaries on so-called \nwholesale financing arrangements.  As you know, retail depositors are frequently covered (to \nvarying degrees) by deposit insurance, so in countries with credible deposit insurance \nframeworks, retail depositors cove red by insurance are less likely to  “run.”  In contrast, however, \nwholesale funds – such as very large certificat es of deposit, and commercial paper – tend to \nmove out of troubled banks relatively quickly.  Thus banks that depend heavily on wholesale \nfunding can potentially experien ce a fairly sudden liquidity crisis.  Such crises force \ngovernments to make quick decisions about prov iding support – decisions that have important \neconomic ramifications for their countries. \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, October 19, 2011 at  8:30 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY  * \n \n \n7 \n Discussing these concerns is not an esoteric exercise.  Figure 3  shows the average credit \ndefault swap spreads for largest financ ial intermediaries, in groups of five.4  As I just mentioned, \none needs to use caution in reading too much into credit default swap  rates – but they do indicate \nthat similar to credit default swap spreads on countries, financial firms around the world have \nseen a marked increase in CDS spreads.  Th e cost of insuring agai nst default has gone up \nsubstantially relative to the begi nning of the financial crisis.  Suffice to say for many banks, the \nrates remain quite elevated at present.   \nFigure 4  shows stock price declines  at the largest bank by count ry (and for countries with \nmore than one bank in the top 20 in assets, the d eclines are averaged).  Bank stock prices have \ndeclined substantially since the beginning of the year.  Many large financial intermediaries have \nexperienced significant declines and market pric es already reflect concerns with financial \nintermediaries outside and inside Europe.  Figure 5  provides stock-price data on the largest \ninstitutions in Europe and the U.S., again in gr oups of five, including th e average change from \nthe peak to the current level, and from the e nd of 2010 to the current level for each group of \nbanks. \n \nOutstanding Issues Related to Large Financial Intermediaries \nThe Basel III capital accord is designed to  reduce the risk that large financial \nintermediaries will become troubled and require government intervention.   While there are a \nvariety of proposed requirements in Basel III, two major initiativ es include potentially raising \ncapital requirements for systemically important institutions – to reduce the probability they \nbecome insolvent – and improving the ability of large financial intermediaries to withstand \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, October 19, 2011 at  8:30 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY  * \n \n \n8 \n liquidity shocks.  These are important and necess ary improvements, and the overall accord is an \nimportant step in the right dir ection.  Yet some important outs tanding issues remain to be \naddressed.  I would like to menti on some key ones, which of course are more interrelated than \nstand-alone. \n \n1. Resolution of large financial intermediaries  \nThe first outstanding issue involves the chal lenge of resolving a failing international \nfinancial institution.  Different countries ha ve very different bankruptcy frameworks and \nresolution arrangements, and these differences can  significantly impact who gets payment in a \nrestructuring.  These differences remain a major impediment to orderly resolution.5 \nAs seen in Figure 6, related to absolute pr iority in liquidation, there are significant \ndifferences across countries, particularly rela ted to the treatment of secured creditors and \nemployee claims.  These differences mean that the place where funds “reside” in a global organization will determine which creditors get pai d.  Knowing this, there is the potential for the \norganization in danger of failure to shift funds (pri or to closure) to coun tries where the treatment \nof particular classes of creditor s is favorable to the organization. \nA disorderly failure of a global financia l institution can be extremely damaging.  \nCreditors may not know which jurisdictions hold va luable assets.  They may be unclear on the \nprevailing bankruptcy rules, how these rules aff ect their positions, or how long their funds will \nbe tied up.  The situation surrounding  the failure of Lehmann Brothe rs is quite relevant here.  \nThree years after the bankruptcy, significant litiga tion continues.  Some creditors were impacted \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, October 19, 2011 at  8:30 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY  * \n \n \n9 \n by the movement of funds in the final days be fore bankruptcy, and many creditors still do not \nknow the amount they will recei ve or the timeframe in which they will be paid. \nThe failure of several Icela ndic banks also highlights th e problem.  While small by \ninternational standards, the tr oubled banks were large relative to the size of the Icelandic \neconomy.  Uncertainty about whethe r depositor claims (particular ly foreign depositors’ claims) \nwould be satisfied – and by whom – highlights the difficulties that can emerge when even \nrelatively small institutions fail. \nSuch uncertainty could provide depositors and creditors with a strong incentive to remove \nfunds from a troubled global financial instit ution.  This may mean that large financial \nintermediaries could be particularly susceptibl e to the rapid withdrawal of deposits due to \nuncertainty surrounding resolution.  Needless to say, th is is particularly probl ematic at a time of \nfinancial stress.   \nIdeally, international agreements would govern cross-border claims on global institutions.  \nHowever, as the table highlights, differences in  national views on which creditors should get the \nhighest priority make obtaining an  international agreement quite el usive, at least any time soon.  \nThere are fundamental legal and cultural diffe rences in national insolvency and resolution \nregimes – including differences in insolvency crit eria; which parties can initiate an insolvency \nproceeding; whether the debtor or an administrato r is in charge; the time for payment of claims; \nset-off and preference rules; and others.   \nWhile a uniform approach to creditor hi erarchy would arguably enhance financial \ninstitution resolution and financial stability efforts globally, the likelihood of harmonizing the \narray of entrenched national creditor hierarchies would seem to be unlikel y in the near term.  \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, October 19, 2011 at  8:30 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY  * \n \n \n10 \n Moreover, these differences are unique and import ant to individual countr ies.  Consequently, \ninterim or alternative measures seem appropriate.  But I hope I have helped illuminate a key \nchallenge that could make an orderly failure of a large institution potentially elusive. \n \n2. Wholesale financing of larg e financial intermediaries  \nA second outstanding issue involves large financ ial intermediaries’ re liance on wholesale \nfunding arrangements.  Many larg e financial intermediaries ra ise funds across international \nborders, so the location of their creditors may well differ from the location of their assets.  This \nsituation is quite prevalent among many large Eur opean banks that have raised funds in the \nshort-term credit markets for commercial paper a nd jumbo certificates of deposit, in order to \nfund longer-term assets either in the United States or elsewh ere in their global operations.6   \nBut this practice of raising s hort-term dollar liabilities to fund longer-term dollar assets \ncan make the financial institution less stable if gl obal creditors come to feel less certain about the \ninstitution’s prospects (or the prospects of a class of institutions).  In fact, Figure 7  shows that \nthe cost of raising dollar liab ilities through the use of forei gn exchange swaps has increased \nsubstantially this year – an indicator of  creditor concern about such institutions. \nThis reliance on wholesale liabilities – compar ed to retail liabilities like deposits that \nusually enjoy deposit insurance – makes a large financial intermediary more susceptible to \nliquidity pressures.  This is  precisely why the new Basel II I requirements devote significant \nattention to the liquidity a nd funding strategies of large financial intermediaries.   \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, October 19, 2011 at  8:30 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY  * \n \n \n11 \n Additionally, during periods of distress there is a natural incentive for regulators in a \ngiven country to “ring fence” some operations of a global bank within their borders – in other \nwords to prevent any bank assets from leav ing the country in order to maximize funding \navailable to meet their liabilities to domestic creditors.  Such a policy could make it difficult for \nlarge financial intermediaries to continue f unding – particularly wholesale funding – across \nnational borders.   \nAs long as the sources and uses of funds in  such situations differ because of national \nborders and related regulatory and legal requiremen ts, the ability to resolve a global bank will be \ncomplicated, giving rise to concer ns about the risks of broad fi nancial contagion.  I would add \nthat if we are to avoid future  crises and the need for extrao rdinary government intervention in \ncrises, then the issue of over-reliance on w holesale funding will need to be addressed.   \n 3. Protection of home country operations\n \nA third lingering issue concerns the prot ection of home count ry operations.  An \nalternative being explored in the United Ki ngdom and in Switzerland – areas with global \nfinancial intermediaries that are large relativ e to their economies – is whether in some \ncircumstances the public sector will only support the domestic operations of their banks.  By \nring-fencing responsibilities, the home country govern ment will be better able to forestall a crisis \nin their country.  However, other countries coul d be adversely affected  if subsidiaries and \nbranches in their jurisdiction must “fend for themselves.”  \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, October 19, 2011 at  8:30 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY  * \n \n \n12 \n Again, the Icelandic example highlights the problem of small countries supporting large \nfinancial intermediaries, and whether the hom e country and its regulatory authority and \ntaxpayers can be expected to be willing and able  to serve as a source of strength should the bank \nbe in danger of failing, or fail.  It is exactly these concerns that  have caused some countries to \nrequire that all branches of fo reign banks operating within thei r borders be supported by capital \n(sometimes referred to as full subsidiarization).   \nThe benefits of creating a subsidiary with  deposit insurance and access to the Federal \nHome Loan Bank system would likely change the nature of their U.S. operations.  By requiring \ncapital against all assets in the country, fina ncial firms are more likely to depend on a more \nstable mix of liabilities – includ ing retail deposits, wholesale fundi ng, and term debt – rather than \njust wholesale deposits.  And th e capital in the country would provide additional protection to \nmeet domestic claims should the global parent  become troubled.  Alternatively, the domestic \noperations would be more readily salable, which could potentially reduce the spread of \ndifficulties and limit the disruption of crucial fina ncial intermediation.  However, this solution \nalso comes at a cost – as risk management , liquidity management, capital management and \nregulatory requirements become more  costly to the parent, since all financial operations in a \ncountry are now subject to  the regulatory requiremen ts of that host country. \n 4. Reluctance to be proactive in re taining and raising additional capital \n \nA fourth outstanding issue involves the reluct ance of bank management or regulators to \nbe proactive in retaining and raising additiona l capital for an institution or for groups of \ninstitutions.  Basel III provides ne w restrictions on the ability of banks to pay dividends as their \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, October 19, 2011 at  8:30 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY  * \n \n \n13 \n capital becomes depleted.  However, book and re gulatory capital measures tend to be lagging \nindicators of the financial strength of the bank.  Some financial intermediaries have experienced \nlarge declines in share prices and large increases in the pricing on credit default swaps, but still \ncontinue to pay dividend s or buy back shares.   \nGiven the support of governments to large fina ncial intermediaries around the world in \n2008, a more proactive approach to  retaining capital within organi zations during times of stress \nis in my view warranted – a view I have expr essed a number of times in  various talks.  If \ntaxpayer funds in a country may be used to bolster  a bank due to its critica l role as a financial \nintermediary in the country’s economy, that step  should not manifest itself in paying scarce \nfunds to equity holders.   \nMoving to a structure where an institutio n’s dividends are deferred during times of \nfinancial stress would greatly facilitate the increa se of capital buffers at times when investors are \nconcerned with a given bank’s financial performan ce.  Using easily observable financial triggers, \nsuch as very substantial declines in a firm’s stock price, to  pause share repurch ases and dividends \nwould provide no additional information about th e institution’s financial strength – but would \nallow it to build up capital during times of stress.   \nThe amount of necessary government support fo r large financial institutions globally \nshould provide a strong incentive for the capital requirement aspects of Basel III.  In fact, it is \nnotable that proposals in both the U.K. and Switzerland are ca lling for significantly higher \ncapital requirements than in Basel III, to re duce the need for future  interventions by those \ngovernments.   \n \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, October 19, 2011 at  8:30 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY  * \n \n \n14 \n Concluding Observations \nIn conclusion, during 2008, governments around th e world were forced to intervene to \nprotect the global financial system.  The Dodd- Frank legislation provide d significant regulatory \ntools to address the “too big to fail” problem.  However, three years after the failure of Lehmann \nBrothers, there remain significant impediments to  avoiding the need for government intervention \nto protect large financial inte rmediaries.  Everyone knows that some large European financial \ninstitutions have of late encount ered problems. So it is  critical that we focus on strengthening the \nfinancial architecture, so that the struggles of one institution or a group of them no longer poses \nrisks to the broader global economy.   \nSignificant challenges remain to be addresse d if we are to have a global banking system \nwhere no bank is too big to fail given the collat eral damage it would cause to economies and \ncitizens.  I hope that this conference and others like it will be part of the important process of \naddressing these outstanding issues and challenges. \nThank you.  \n                                                             \n \n1 I discussed my definition of financial stability, and the implications of the definiti on, in a talk earlier this \nyear at the Stanford Financial Forum.  I noted that in my view “Financial stability reflects the ability of \nthe financial system to consistently supply the cred it intermediation and payment services that are needed \nin the real economy if it is to continue on its gr owth path.” And “Financial  instability occurs when \nproblems (or concerns about potential problems) within  institutions, markets, payments systems, or the \nfinancial system in general significantly impair th e supply of credit intermediation services – so as to \nsubstantially impact the expected path of real  economic activity.”  The talk is available at \nhttp://www.bostonfed.org/news/speeches /rosengren/2011/060311/index.htm. \n \n2 This includes the U.S., and all European countries with a bank ranked among the top 50 worldwide as of  \nDecember 31, 2010. \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, October 19, 2011 at  8:30 A.M.

Rosengren \nPresident & Chief Executive Officer \nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston \n \n \nNovember 7, 2011 \nBoston, Massachusetts \n \n \n \n \n \nIt is a great pleasure to be with you today.  I want to welcome all of you to the Boston \nFed and especially commend all the educators in the room for the work that you do.  I benefited \nimmeasurably from my experience at Colby College as an undergraduate and at the University of \nWisconsin-Madison in graduate school.  I am pleas ed now to have the opportunity to “give back” \nto both schools, in that I se rve on an advisory committee for the economics department at \nMadison, and on Colby College’s Board of Trustees .  These experiences give me a window into \nsome of the daunting challenges that you face, part icularly in the current economic environment.   \nToday I want to spend a few minutes di scussing the nexus between what you do as \neducators and what I do as a centr al banker.  Like a central banke r should, let me first note that \n\n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Monday, November 7, 2011 at 8:30 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY  * \n \n \n2 \n my comments represent my perspectives, and no t necessarily those of my colleagues on the \nFederal Reserve’s Board of Governors or the Fe deral Open Market Committee.  Returning to \nthat nexus between what you and I do, at first glance it might seem as if there is not much \ncommonality.  A case in point – generally when se tting monetary policy, we assume we have \nlittle impact on demographic variables including the educational attainment of the workforce.1  \nNot that such variables are unimportant, by any st retch, because we all know that the educational \ncharacteristics of the workforce play an importa nt role in the dynamics of an economy.  A well-\neducated work force is likely to be more pr oductive, and highly skille d workers tend to have \nmuch lower unemployment rate s in economic downturns. \n On the other hand, as senior officials at  colleges and univers ities, you likely view \nmacroeconomic conditions as something you have little control over.  You focus instead on key matters like educating students, worrying about ra ising funds for the endowments that are a key \ningredient to financial aid, a nd affording new and engaging edu cational programs.  So while you \nmight take them as “given,” the recent rece ssion has only highlighted how economic conditions \naffect how you go about educating students. \nI would like to suggest, however, that what educators do matters to the Fed and what the \nFed does matters to educator s.  I’ll touch briefly on some of the reasons why. \nAs you all probably know, the monthly U.S. employment report was released last Friday.  \nThe unemployment rate is now 9.0 percent – a rate that remains stubbornly, and unacceptably, \nhigh.  The Federal Reserve has taken unprecedented actions to improve the growth rate in the \neconomy.  But economic “headwinds” – stemming from the previous financial crisis and \nconcerns about possible future financial shocks – have meant that despite Federal Reserve \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Monday, November 7, 2011 at 8:30 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY  * \n \n \n3 \n actions, economic growth has been lethargic an d job growth has been too slow to make \nsignificant inroads into reduci ng the unemployment rate.   \nHowever, underlying the average  unemployment statistic s are a vast range of \ncircumstances, depending on educational attainment.   \nToday I want to discuss some of those st atistics and propose that  as you and your peers \nare making admissions, financial aid, and retent ion-program decisions at your schools, you are \npowerfully shaping the outcomes for individuals – and society more generally.  I also want to \nemphasize that institutions represented in this  room play an important role in economic \ndevelopment in the communities in which you ar e located.  There are important synergies \nbetween communities and schools of higher educati on.  Schools are important anchors for their \ncommunities.  They provide good and stable jobs  for people in the area, and businesses that \nsupport the academic community benefit as well.  Th ey also bring in highly motivated students, \nsome of whom choose to use their education to  form businesses in the communities where they \nwere educated. And of course the schools benefi ts, in many ways, from their communities.   \n \nEducational Attainment and the Work Force \n It is stating the obvious, but educational attainment is one of the defining characteristics \nof a workforce.  Particularly in New England we  tend to have highly skilled and highly educated \nworkers.   \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Monday, November 7, 2011 at 8:30 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY  * \n \n \n4 \n I would like to take just a mo ment to show how educational attainment is important not \nonly to individuals, but also to the communitie s they inhabit.  In the current economic \nenvironment, the variation in unemployment by edu cational attainment is pa rticularly striking.   \nTo begin, let me draw your attention to Figure 1 .  As a result of a long and severe \nrecession, the unemployment rate has gone up dramatically for people in all categories of \neducational attainment, but no one will be surprise d to hear that the levels of unemployment are \ndramatically different depending on educational attainment.  Thos e with no high school diploma \nare experiencing more than three times the unemploym ent rate of those with at least a bachelor’s \ndegree.   While the current unemployment rate is  9.0 percent percent, for those with at least a \ncollege education it is only 4.4 percent.    \nIt is important to note that while the leve l of unemployment has va ried by educational \nattainment, Figure 1 is not supportive of what  economists call a “structural” unemployment \nexplanation for persistently high unemployment – such as when th ere are lots of open jobs that \ncannot be filled because the available workers ha ve the wrong skill sets for those positions.  As \nyou may know, evidence of a change in the struct ural level of unemployment has been a matter \nof significant debate among economists and pol icymakers.  Figure 1 might provide some \nevidence that structural unemployment was a pr oblem if, for example, unemployment had risen \ndramatically for lower-skilled workers but there wa s a shortage of highly sk illed workers (that is, \ntheir unemployment rate had fallen).  \nStimulating an economy where most of the unemployment is structural would place \nadditional demand on high-skilled jobs – causing  rapid increases in compensation for those \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Monday, November 7, 2011 at 8:30 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY  * \n \n \n5 \n workers without generating improvement in the overall unemployment ra te, as the supply of \nhighly educated workers would be slow to respond.   \nBut we see quite the opposite right now, because people at all levels of educational \nattainment have experienced a substantia l increase in unemployment, as shown in Figure 2 .  In \nfact, if one compares the percentage increas e in unemployment by category of educational \nattainment, it is striking what a high percentage increase in un employment has occurred in each  \ncategory.  This is consistent not with the “m ismatch” dynamic of structural unemployment but \nwith a story of weak demand  throughout  the economy.   \nOn this subject I would recommend a recen t paper by economists Bob Triest and Bill \nDickens, presented last month at the Boston Fed’s annual economi c conference.  They provide \nimportant evidence on employment flows – eviden ce that is consistent with most of the \nunemployment being driven by inadequate demand, rather than structural problems.2 \nA look at the compensation data in Figure 3  provides additional evidence that structural \nunemployment cannot explain the persistently high unemployment rate.  If most of the current \nunemployment were structural, we  would expect to see compen sation increasing as employers \nbid for scarce high-skilled workers.  But as th e figure shows, compensation growth has slowed, \nand remains quite low relative to compen sation over the past 30 years.   \nSimilarly, Figure 4  shows there has been no great di vergence in compensation trends \nacross occupations.  If a skills mi smatch existed, one would exp ect wages in the sectors where \nsupply is short to be accelerating, while wages would be declining in sectors where there was \nexcess labor supply.  We do not see this happeni ng.  Growth in compensation for management \nand professionals – presumably a higher skilled occupational category – has not shown evidence \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Monday, November 7, 2011 at 8:30 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY  * \n \n \n6 \n of sharp acceleration relative to occupations that one would pres ume have somewhat lower skill \nrequirements, such as work in natural re sources, construction, and maintenance.   \nIn fact, Figure 5  presents the increase in labor costs over the past nine quarters (since the \nbeginning of the recovery) by occupation, and it does not show dramatically different growth in \ncompensation by job type.  In fact, management  and professional occupations have seen \ncompensation grow less than workers in natura l resources, constructi on, and maintenance over \nthese nine quarters of recovery.   \nThis is just some of the evidence that suggests why the notion of rising structural \nunemployment cannot explain th e high aggregate unemployment rate we are unfortunately \nexperiencing.  This distinction is very impor tant to the policy response.  Of course, for \nindividuals it should be noted that employment prospects ar e significantly improved with \neducational attainment. \nBut educational attainment affects far more than just employment prospects.  The left-\nhand chart in Figure 6  shows the relationship between median household income and \neducational attainment.  While the median in come of all households is approximately $50,000, \nthere are substantial differences based on edu cational attainment.  Those with no high school \ndiploma have less than half the median income, and those with just a high school diploma (no \ncollege experience) have about three-quarter s of the median income.  And those with \nprofessional degrees have more than twice the median income.   \nAnd the right panel of the figure shows that growth in median income over the past two \ndecades also varies substantially by educational a ttainment.  For example, those with only a high \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Monday, November 7, 2011 at 8:30 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY  * \n \n \n7 \n school education have experienced  a significant decline in median  real income where the most \nrapid growth has been for those that have  received doctorate or master’s degrees. \n Figure 7  shows that educational attainment also translates into significant differences in \nnet worth.  Those with college degrees have more than triple the net wort h of those that do not.  \nOver the last two decades, those with college degr ees have had a significant increase in their real \nnet worth – while in contrast, those with no hi gh school diploma have substantially less net \nworth, and their real net worth has declined over  the past two decades.  Of course, the causation \ncan work in both directions here, especially with regard to inheri ted net worth – that is, parental \nwealth makes it easier to afford higher education. \n \nThe Implications \n Figure 8  shows that the U.S. workforce is beco ming more educated.  There has been a \nsubstantial increase in the number of people in the workforce that have a bachelor’s degree or \nhigher.  Given the employment, income, and net wo rth differentials shown in earlier charts, it is \nnot surprising that an increasing number of hi gh school students are re alizing that higher \neducational attainment is in their interest.   \nHowever, underlying this positive trend are sh arp differences across racial categories.  \nFigure 9  shows that educational attainment diffe rs substantially by race.  While Asian \nindividuals have been particul arly successful in obtaining colle ge degrees, African-Americans \nand Hispanics in the labor force significantly la g in educational attain ment.  This lack of \neducation makes it much more difficult for them  to maximize their potential, given the evolving \nwork-force needs in the US economy. \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Monday, November 7, 2011 at 8:30 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY  * \n \n \n8 \n  I think there are a number of potential impli cations for educational leaders from this \nanalysis.  As you consider whom to admit, how  much of an endowment to spend to provide \nfinancial aid, whether financial ai d should be in the form of grants  or loans, and how those scarce \nfunds should be allocated, I would urge you to k eep in mind that you are making choices that are \nnot only important for individuals but for societ y more generally.  And I would urge public \npolicymakers to keep similar notions in mind when they consider budgetary investments in public and community institutions.     \nIndeed, income and net worth differences are highly related to educational attainment, as \nI have shown.  Insuring that children have ad equate preparation, from  early childhood education \nthrough high school, is critically important.  A nd it is critical that t hose whose families have \nlimited financial means are not shut out from the opportunities an education provides.  In short, \nfinding ways to encourage greater educational a ttainment – particularly for low and moderate \nincome families and those racial groups that have traditionally been underrepresented – will be \nan important determinant of the quality of the U. S. work force and the income distribution in our \ncountry. \n Similarly, many of your instituti ons are in cities that have been hard hit by the economic \ndownturn and tepid recovery, making it even more  important – to a macroeconomic policymaker \n– that you reach out to affect ed communities, and view your institutions as anchors of \ncommunity economic development.  Certainly the location of this conference, in Boston, \nhighlights the tangible benefits that can accrue to a community when it has great colleges, and \ncollege leaders that take the development of their communities seriously. \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Monday, November 7, 2011 at 8:30 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY  * \n \n \n9 \n  Finally, I am pleased to note that many sc hools have become better at bridging their \nstudents to the working world.  I would strongly  encourage using alumni networks and other \nresources to provide students with internship  opportunities.  A vibrant New England needs a \nvibrant work force, and internship s can be an important way for co mmunities to attract and retain \ntop talent.   \nHelping the region attract and retain talented  college students is one reason the Boston \nFed partnered with the Greater Boston Chambe r of Commerce to provid e a better clearinghouse \nfor college internships in the Boston area.  I would encourage your institutions’ career offices to \ndirect students looking for internship opportuni ties to the web site that has been set up.3  We and \nour partners hope it will continue  to grow and provide many oppor tunities in the greater Boston \narea over time. \n I have described the Boston Fed’s research  that highlights the important role that \neducation plays in our regional development.  Le t me touch briefly on other policy work that we \ndo and describe what is currently a major concern to us.  At the Boston Fed it is central to our \nmission to explore ways that U.S. monetary policy – entrusted by C ongress to the Federal \nReserve System – can promote maximum employmen t with stable prices.  My own forecast is \nthat inflation is likely to be below 2 percent over the next several years, in part because of the \nvery weak labor markets.  Given the very weak  labor market conditions and the low expected \ninflation rate, the Federal Reserve should in my view continue to take action to aggressively try \nto reduce the stubbornly high U.S. unemployment rate. \nBut clearly the Federal Reserve cannot do it alone.  Given the sobering macroeconomic \nsituation, it is important that fiscal policy, cont rolled by the federal government and the states, do \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Monday, November 7, 2011 at 8:30 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY  * \n \n \n10 \n its part.  It is also important for international policy makers to take actions that provide more \nstable world markets.  But at the same time, in  my view the Federal Reserve should continue to \nuse the tools at its disposal to boost demand in the economy.  And at the same time, we would do \nwell to work on addressing any impediments to  students getting the employment opportunities \nthat will serve them, their comm unities, and the macroeconomy. \nIt is a pleasure to be here with you today, and to take a fe w minutes to explore the nexus \nbetween higher education and the macroeconomy.  Thank you for having me. \n \n                                                             \n \nNOTES: \n \n1 I am aware, of course, that invest ment in human capital through schooling may have a degree of sensitivity to \ninterest rates. \n \n2 See their paper at http://www.bostonfed.org/eco nomic/conf/LTE2011/pape rs/dickens-triest.pdf .

Rosengren \nPresident & Chief Executive Officer \nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston \n \n \nNovember 16, 2011 \nBoston, Massachusetts \n \n \n \n \n \nI would like to thank Chip Case for inviti ng me to address the Boston Economic Club.  \nOver the years Chip has been a visiting scholar  at the Boston Fed and has provided wonderful \ninsights into developments in real  estate markets.  As you all know , Chip is one of the country’s \nleading experts on real es tate – an area that has been the fo cus of much attention and a lot of \ndifficulties over the last few years.   \nNormally when giving a talk I try to focu s on an important element of the economic \noutlook, or an important policy action the Federal Reserve has recently taken – and I use data to \nexplain the issue and its relevance.   \n\n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, November 16, 2011 at  12:40 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY  * \n \n \n \n \n \n \n2 \n Today, however, I am going to take a different ta ck.  I still want to us e data – never fear – \nbut for a somewhat different reason.   \nAs you know, ever since the financial crisis , the Federal Reserve has been lauded by \nsome for its bold actions and criticized by others .  This comes with the territory of being the \nnation’s central bank.  Certainly much of the cr iticism stems from an economy that is very \ndifficult for many citizens.  And importantly, some of the criticism is deserved – and we at the \nFed truly try to learn wh en we do fall short.   \nBut some of the criticism stems from wh at I’ll call some “common misconceptions” or \nassumptions about the Fed.1  Today I would like to offer a pl ainspoken defense to some of those \ncommon misconceptions.  A defense rooted in fact s and numbers, to be sure – my rhetorical \nskills may not win over Fed critics, but the f acts and numbers may help them and others \nunderstand how the Fed actually operates. \nLet me acknowledge, of course, that as importa nt and illuminating as they are, facts and \ndata do not capture the emotion and the frustratio n of these challenging economic times.  At the \nFed we appreciate the widespread frustration st emming from the financia l crisis, the recession, \nand the anemic recovery.  But to go forward a nd tangibly improve things, we must use facts to \nguide our work, and must do a better job of shari ng key facts and the data that underlie how and \nwhy the Fed takes the steps it does. \nLet me add as I always do that my comments  reflect my perspec tives, not necessarily \nthose of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee or the Fed’s Board of Governors. \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, November 16, 2011 at  12:40 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY  * \n \n \n \n \n \n \n3 \n In recent years the U.S. central bank has taken unusual steps to combat a threatening \nfinancial crisis, a severe recession, and a disappoin ting recovery.  By no means were we perfect, \nbut we acted in the public’s inte rest and I’m very supportive of the strong steps taken.  I would \npoint out that the U.S. experience in the 1920s  and 1930s, and Japan’s experience in recent \ndecades, show the even more dramatic economic pain that comes when central banks and national governments act less than forcefully, or declar e the crisis over too soon. \nHowever, the extraordinary steps the Fed has taken over the last four  years have led to \nsome misconceptions and mistaken assumptions.  Central banking and monetary policy are not \neasy to explain, but the Fed could have done a better job of it.  But at the end of the day we’ve \nseen the creation of certain misconceptions, not supported by facts, about the U.S. central bank \nas an institution.  The best way to address a mi sconception is to offer up the facts.  So today I \nplan to address some of the misconceived a ssumptions about the Federal Reserve and our \nactions. \nIt is not surprising the Fede ral Reserve and other central banks have received an unusual \namount of attention of late.  We  are experiencing historic times , and an unusual confluence of \nevents.  We experienced a global financial crisis which underlined the fact that financial markets \nand financial institutions have a si gnificant impact on the real econom y and all of its participants.  \nWe have seen in dramatic fashion how increased  global interconnectedness , despite its benefits, \nallows problems to quickly move across natio nal borders.  As a case in point, witness the \nreactions of our own U.S. financial markets to actions occurring, or not occurring, in Greece – a \ncountry of less than 11 million people, roughly th e size of Ohio – and other countries.  Add to \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, November 16, 2011 at  12:40 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY  * \n \n \n \n \n \n \n4 \n this the fact that, both  here and abroad, fiscal problems ha ve increasingly limited the response we \nwould normally expect in a severe economic do wnturn and a painfully slow recovery.   \nThese events, taken together, have made for ecasting the future path  of the economy quite \nchallenging – and should instill humility about pred icting the future, or how future shocks could \nimpact the domestic or world economy. \n In response to the crises, the Federal Rese rve has been forceful in trying to promote \ngrowth and thus reduce the unemployment rate, wh ile achieving core inflation rates close to 2 \npercent.  Other central banks have too.  Central banks2 have attempted to fight the crisis and \ndownturn by dramatically increa sing their balance sheets (see Figure 1 ), buying non-traditional \nassets, and pushing short and long-term rates to  new lows to try to create conditions that \nstimulate economic activity.   \nUnfortunately, the creative and forceful response of many central banks to a bad \neconomic situation has not often been matched by fi scal policymakers and international officials.   \nCentral banks cannot address these economic problems on their own.  They can mitigate some of the problems by reducing the cost of credit to in dividuals and businesses.  And make no mistake, \nwhile the scale of the problem is great, that should not dissuade us  from actions that make even \njust “a dent.”  For instance, an action that re duces the unemployment rate  by half a percent does \nnot bring us close to full em ployment, and does not solve the country’s problems, but \nnonetheless would perhaps create roughly 750,000 jobs  that may not have been created in the \nabsence of the action.  \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, November 16, 2011 at  12:40 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY  * \n \n \n \n \n \n \n5 \n Federal Reserve actions alone cannot solve a ll the problems affecting the domestic and \nworld economy.  But the Fed can carefully weigh the costs and benefits of actions, and where \nactions can move us closer to better economic  outcomes without substa ntial costs, it can and \nshould take action.  In fact, that’s  exactly what the Fed has been doing, and that is exactly what it \nshould be doing – consistent with  the dual mandate given to us by Congress, to do what we can \nto achieve maximum sustainable employm ent consistent with stable prices. \nWith that introduction, allow me now to disc uss four common misconceptions about the \nFed.  To give you an overview, the four assumptions or misconceptions are as follows: \n• The Federal Reserve is not audited and its actions occur without oversight \n• The Federal Reserve is not a transparent organization \n• “Printing money” has caused serious inflation \n• Rates are already low so further moneta ry policy actions wi ll have no impact on the \neconomy \nThere are of course a number of other issu es we could discuss, but I think these are \nimportant and involve plenty for us to cover today. \n \nCommon Misconception 1:  The Federal Reserve is not audited a nd its actions occur without oversight \n \n In recent years there have been those a dvocating that the Federal Reserve should be \naudited.  They are right in that the Fed should be audited – but they  are mistaken in believing that \nthe Fed is not.  In truth the Fed is a heavily a udited organization subject to substantial oversight.  \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, November 16, 2011 at  12:40 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY  * \n \n \n \n \n \n \n6 \n This is entirely appropriate given the sensitivit y of what central banks do, and the need to do it \nwithout reproach.   \nIn truth, \n• all twelve Federal Reserve Banks em ploy professional internal auditors; \n• an outside audit firm, Deloitte & Touc he, audits our financial statements; \n• the Federal Reserve’s Inspector General, cr eated by Congress, aud its our activities; \n• the U.S. Government Accountability  Office audits our actions, and  \n• Congress, which created the Federal Reserv e System, provides si gnificant oversight \nregarding Fed actions, as demonstrated by frequent requests to testify before \ncommittees – and by legislation over th e years that has altered our role.3   \nBut as one who loves data and facts, let me say a bit more to be quite specific on this \nmatter. \n We produce an annual report that  includes audited financial st atements and a letter from \nme as CEO attesting to effective internal contro ls, based on the work of our internal audit and \nrisk-management teams.  We include a letter fr om Deloitte & Touche at testing that we have \nmaintained in all material respects effective internal control over financial reporting. \n We are also audited by the Office of Inspect or General, created by Congress to provide \nindependent oversight over the Federal Rese rve – with the power to do investigations, \ninspections, audits, and reports.  The Inspector General reports to Congr ess semi-annually – the \nmost recent report covers activities th rough March and is available on the web.4   \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, November 16, 2011 at  12:40 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY  * \n \n \n \n \n \n \n7 \n In Figure 2,  I list some of the reports by the Inspect or General over the past year, all of \nwhich are available on the Board’s web site.   As  you can see, the reports cover a wide range of \ntopics.   \nWe are also audited by the U.S. Govern ment Accountability Office (GAO), which \nconducts audits, investigations, inspections, and re ports on behalf of Congre ss.  These reports are \npublicly available on the GAO web site.  Figure 3  shows some of the GAO reports done in the \npast year regarding a wide variet y of Federal Reserve activities.   As with the Inspector General \nreports, one GAO report covers the operations of  the Fed’s emergency liquidity facilities, \nincluding the one run at the Bost on Fed on behalf of the System.5   \n And we have direct oversight by Congress,  which requests testimony on a wide range of \ntopics.  Figure 4  lists some of the recent Congre ssional testimony provided by the Fed’s \nGovernors, all of which are available on the Boar d website.  For the sake of brevity this figure \ndoes not include the testimony of staff other than Governors.  Naturally, Congressional hearings \ninclude extensive questioning concer ning our actions and policies.   \nWe are an entity created by Congress.  C ongress can and does change our roles and \nresponsibilities over time.  A good example is th e Dodd-Frank legislation which increased our \nresponsibilities in some areas (like savings and loan holding company supervision) and curtailed \nour role in others (such as lending in “emergency and exigent” circumstances). \n So in sum we are a heavily audi ted and supervised organization.   \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, November 16, 2011 at  12:40 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY  * \n \n \n \n \n \n \n8 \n However, I suspect that some  who argue for more audits of the Federal Reserve may \nactually be advocating for the politicization of monetary po licy.  The Federal Reserve was \ndesigned by Congress to be a non-partisan organi zation that conducts mo netary policy in the \npublic interest free of pol itical influence.  Good m onetary policy in the pu blic’s long-run interest \ncan involve unpopular decisions in the short run – such as the Vo lcker-era effort to rein in \ninflation using very high interest rates.  Ce ntral banks in developed countries have become \nindependent of legislative bodies and the chief executive precisely because monetary policy has \nbeen shown to result in better economic outcomes (e.g., growth, a nd price stability) when it is \nnot influenced by partisan politics.   \nI strongly believe that offici als in the Federal Reserve c onduct policy without regard to \npartisan politics, and to the best of their abilities try to administ er monetary policy in the national \ninterest.  This is a hallmark of our  organization and should not change. \nIn sum, the common misconception is that th e Federal Reserve is not audited and its \nactions occur without oversight.  The fact is that the Fed is widely audited, and is subject to \nrobust oversight – which is as it should be.6 \n \nCommon Misconception 2: The Federal Reserve is not a transparent organization  \n When I first joined the Federal Reserve 25 y ears ago, the lack of tr ansparency was a very \nvalid criticism of the Fed and most other central  banks.  However, the fact is that much has \nchanged in the last 25 years – and particularly in recent years.  \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, November 16, 2011 at  12:40 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY  * \n \n \n \n \n \n \n9 \n Let me admit that in the midst of the financia l crisis in the fall of 2008 one could fairly \nsay that we did not spend sufficient time explai ning to the public the unique and extraordinary \nactions being taken.  All I can say is that in the midst of the crisis there was a focus on solutions, \nand given the severity of the situation, this resulted in our spending less time communicating \nwell about what we were doing a nd why.  Though no excuse, reacting to a crisis in real time \neffectively requires something else “give” – and we were frankly so preoccupied with \nextinguishing the fire we did not explain as we ll as we should have wh at we were doing and \nwhy.  At the Fed we have tried since to explain precisely what we did and why, but we are still \nsome distance from being understood, or fully trusted for that matter. \nI think the Fed has learned from this.  I would argue that at this poi nt our organization has \nshifted a great deal compared to two years ago, and at this point we ar e quite transparent and \ngetting better at it in time. \n When I started at the Fed there was no explic it mention of our federal funds target after \nFederal Open Market Committee meetings, no mi nutes of the meetings, and no transcript \nreleased with a five-year lag.  The minutes we  provide now are quite detailed, providing a \nsummary of staff presentations, di scussion of the views of all participants regarding the outlook \nfor the economy, and discussion of the de bate around the policy recommendation.    \nIn addition, we have started providing economic projections after each scheduled two-day \nmeeting – currently four times a year.  This pr ovides a summary of the forecasts by the twelve \nReserve Bank presidents and the Governors (currently there are five); on variables related to \ninflation, unemployment, and the growth rate of GDP.  We provide both the range of forecasts \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, November 16, 2011 at  12:40 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY  * \n \n \n \n \n \n \n10 \n and the central tendency of the forecasts.  And the Fed is continuing to review its \ncommunications practices to en sure accountability and increa se public understanding.   \nAlso, after the four two-day FOMC mee tings the Chairman now conducts a press \nconference.  He fully describes re cent policy decisions and the forecas ts of the participants in the \nFOMC meeting, and answers questions pos ed by members of the press.    \n And the Federal Reserve has also been communicating more directly with the public.  \nThe Chairman has participated in a variety of  what for central bankers are less traditional \nopportunities, from “60 Minutes” to various town  hall style meetings, including one last week \nwith soldiers and their families on base in Texas.    \nThe role of the Reserve Bank presidents has also evolved.  Figure 5  lists the speeches I \nhave given this year that like today’s include a published text, charts, and an invitation to \nmembers of the media.  The text and slides of  this speech are availabl e to anyone on our public \nweb site.  When we can, we make video summarie s available as well.  We  “tweet” some of the \nmain points.7  And at the end of the speech I will be  answering whatever questions you would \nlike to raise.   \nI also give a variety of informal talks that generally provide condensed versions of some \nof my previous public speeches.  In addition, I have from time to time had interviews with \nmembers of the media working in print, radio, and TV.  And I am not alone in this respect.  My \npeers have similarly been tryi ng to communicate more about actio ns we are taking on a range of \nissues, from monetary policy to supervisory policy to financial st ability.  We do not always agree \non policy matters and this in itself is an indicator of transparency. \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, November 16, 2011 at  12:40 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY  * \n \n \n \n \n \n \n11 \n  Also, there are some areas in which the Fede ral Reserve is now bei ng more transparent – \nin part with the encouragement of Congress.  The emergency facility lo ans we made during the \ncrisis are listed on our web site, and inform ation on “Discount Window” loans to banks are \nprovided with a lag.   \nThe reason for this lag is straightforward – not  secret for secrecy’s sake.  As a lender of \nlast resort concerned about fina ncial stability and the continua tion of lending during times of \nfinancial turbulence, you want in stitutions that are in generally sound financial condition to turn \nto the central bank when there is  a temporary shortage of liquid ity in the banking system – in \nother words when they have liquidity  but not solvency  problems.  In the pa rlance of monetary \npolicymaking, this prevents interest rates from rising significantly during a financial disruption.8   \nHowever, immediate disclosure might cause fi nancial institutions to view loans from the \nFed as stigmatized, possibly raising concerns with depositors and investors, and further \ncontributing to liquidity problems.  The Dodd-Fr ank legislation wrestled with this issue and \ncame up with what I view as a reasonable solu tion – disclosure of Discount Window loans after \ntwo years. \n So I fully acknowledge that the Federal Rese rve has not always been very transparent – \nbut feel very comfortable attesti ng that there has been a rather dr amatic change over the last two \ndecades, and in particular over the last few years.  While we at the Fed continue to examine ways \nto better explain and describe monetary polic y and other aspects of central banking, I would \nsuggest that there are now regular opportunities to hear from Federa l Reserve officials directly or \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, November 16, 2011 at  12:40 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY  * \n \n \n \n \n \n \n12 \n via the press, and I am glad that Fed official s are now much more pub licly discussing policy \nactions.  \nIn sum, the common misconception is that the Federal Reserve is not a transparent \norganization.  The fact is that we are quite an op en central bank – much better than we used to be \n– and are improving in this area even as we speak. \n \nCommon Misconception 3: “Printing money” has caus ed serious inflation \n \n Figure 6  highlights that both bank re serves and the total assets of the Federal Reserve \nhave grown substantially during the crisis, recessi on, and anemic recovery – with the most rapid \nexpansion occurring in the fall of 2008.  The asse t expansion is broken out in more detail in \nFigure 7 .  In the wake of the failure of Lehman Brot hers and the freezing up of short-term credit \nmarkets, the Federal Reserve established a variet y of emergency liquidity facilities.  Something \nthat is frequently overlooked is that over time all the loans were paid back with interest and the \nfacilities have been closed.  The size of the Fed’s balance sheet ha s still continued to grow, as a \nresult of our large-scale purchases of Treasury and mortgage-backed secu rities – policy actions \nwe took given the weak economy and our primar y policy rate hitting the lower bound of near \nzero.   \nHowever, while the most rapid growth in reserves occurred three years ago, Figure 8  \nshows that over the three-year period ending last quarter the U. S. has experienced the lowest \naverage inflation rate of any such  period over the past th irty years.  Over the past three years, \ntotal personal consumption expenditures (PCE\n9) inflation has averaged only 1.2 percent.   \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, November 16, 2011 at  12:40 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY  * \n \n \n \n \n \n \n13 \n Figure 9  shows that in only two of the five most  recent three-year periods has total PCE \ninflation been above 2 percent – and these two pe riods were ones where food and energy shocks \noccurred.   \nWe have indeed expanded our balance sheet – some call that “printi ng money” – but it is \na misconception that it has resu lted in significant inflation. \n The reason why this is so is shown in Figure 10 , which depicts loan growth at \ncommercial banks over the same three-year periods.   Anemic loan growth in the credit crunch \nera of the early 1990s is one outlier on the char t, and the negative growth in the most recent \nthree-year period is another.  In the recent period  banks have become more risk averse, and have \nfocused (appropriately) on rebui lding their capital – while many borrowers have had their \nborrowing capacity weakened by the difficult business conditions of a severe recession and slow recovery.  The end result is cu rtailed lending.  Bank reserves are not going to be inflationary \nwhen bank lending is not expanding.\n10   \n Let me be quick to stress that inflation woul d be serious and detrimental at higher levels.  \nI am not suggesting otherwise.  I am just pointing out some facts that sugges t it is currently very \nrestrained. \nIndeed, other market indicators show little ev idence of concern over inflation.  The 10- \nyear U.S. Treasury bond has fallen to  around 2 percent, as shown in Figure 11 .  Similarly, other \ncountries where the central banks have expande d their balance sheets to fight the anemic \neconomic conditions also have very low 10-year  government bond rates.   Evidently investors \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, November 16, 2011 at  12:40 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY  * \n \n \n \n \n \n \n14 \n are not expecting large increases in inflati on, or they would demand much higher rates to \npurchase long-term securities.   \nAs everyone knows, high unemployment goes hand in hand with wages and salaries \ngrowing very slowly, at least for most jobs.  Given the current c onditions in the job market, there \nis little upward pressure on wages and salaries – and this means that there is little reason to \nexpect significant inflationary pressures as highe r labor costs push up higher end prices.  I would \nadd that while measures of money such as M211 have grown rapidly of late, much of that growth \nreflects investor risk aversion – investors move d funds to bank accounts during the debt ceiling \ndiscussion in August and in light of the European problems that have emerged more recently. \nFinally, I would note that one country where the central bank expanded its balance sheet \nsignificantly, some time ago, is Japan.  The Ja panese central bank bega n expanding its balance \nsheet more than a decade ago but rather than experiencing rapid inflation, they have been \nconcerned with deflation, as shown in Figure 12 .  Deflation – which is not my forecast at this \npoint, let me say – can be extremely difficult to overcome, as consumers expect products will be \ncheaper in the future, wages and salaries declin e, and debtors face high real interest rates. \nMake no mistake, the Federal Reserve will need to remove its current policy \naccommodation as the economy improves.  The cu rrent level of bank re serves would not be \nappropriate if we were at fu ll employment – such accommodation would indeed be inflationary \nin that situation.  However, that is not the situ ation the country is in now , and I fully expect we \nwill remove accommodation appropriately as the economy improves. \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, November 16, 2011 at  12:40 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY  * \n \n \n \n \n \n \n15 \n In sum, the common misconception is that “pri nting money” has caused serious inflation.  \nThe fact is that inflation has remained extrem ely restrained during this period of accommodative \nmonetary policy necessitated by economic conditions.  \n \nCommon Misconception 4: Rates are already low so further monetary po licy actions will have no impact on the \neconomy  \n The empirical evidence shows that Fed purch ases of Treasury and MBS securities did \ncause market interest rates to fall.  While rate s can be impacted by a variety of factors – for \nexample if the economy were to show signs of ra pid growth you would expect  rates to rise – 10-\nyear rates now are much lower than they  were before we unde rtook our actions.   \n It is unlikely that lower rates would have no impact on the economy.  Such an assumption \nwould be quite a leap of faith, because in general further lowering rates would:\n  \n  \n• impact home purchases – because lower rate s can have a big impact on cash flow of \nconsumers; \n• impact consumer durables like cars – because  auto-loan rates are one of the largest \npayments many people make each month; \n• impact investment – because lower rates im prove the potential benefit (the net present \nvalue) of investment projects; \n• impact exchange rates and foreign trade – as suggested by the complaints heard from \nsome trading partners when the Fe d has previously lowered rates; \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, November 16, 2011 at  12:40 P.M.

Research by my colleague Giovanni Olivei \nhas found that prior to the cris is our statistical model of th e economy would imply that a \nsustained decline in the 10-year Treasury rate of 100 basis points would lead to a cumulative \nincrease in real GDP over two year s of approximately 2.5 percent.   \nWith the reduction in interest sensitivity in housing more recently, the model would \nimply that a sustained decline in the 10-year Trea sury rate of 100 basis points would now lead to \na cumulative increase in real GDP over two year s of approximately 2 percent – as shown in \nFigure 13 .12  Concerns with falling prices, high unem ployment, and limited access to credit have \nlikely all contributed to this lower – but clearly non-zero – re sponse to lower rates in housing \nmarkets.13  The assertion that our rate actions simp ly will have no impact is not supported by our \nstatistical work. \nIn sum, the common misconception is that ra tes are already low so further monetary \npolicy actions will have no impact on the economy.  In fact, statistical analysis suggests the \nopposite. \n \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, November 16, 2011 at  12:40 P.M.

We had significant \nfinancial shocks that impacted the real economy during the crisis and recession, and we remain at \nrisk that financial shocks  here or abroad could s till impact our economy.   \nThe Federal Reserve, like other central ba nks, has taken strong action to mitigate the \nimpact and avoid worse outcomes for the economy.  As stated at the outset of my talk, the Fed’s \nactions have mitigated problems but we alone ca nnot quickly restore full employment.  That will \ntake time and appropriate actions by internationa l policymakers, U.S. fiscal policymakers, and \nmonetary policymakers.   \nThank you for indulging me today as I di scussed some common misconceptions about \nthe Federal Reserve.  In sum, I believe the fact s show that the Fed rema ins an organization with \nsignificant oversight, which has s ubstantially increased its transp arency, and continues to pursue \nactions consistent with our Congressional mandate to  work to the best of our ability to achieve \nmaximum employment consistent with st able prices, in the national interest. \nThank you, and I would be happy to  take a few questions now. \n \n                                                             \n \nNOTES:  \n \n1 The American Heritage Dictionary’s primary definiti on of a misconception is “An incorrect interpretation or \nunderstanding.”  I am also thinking of assumptions, which the same dictionary defines as “a statement accepted or \nsupposed true without proof or demonstration.” \n \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, November 16, 2011 at  12:40 P.M.

Rosengren \nPresident & Chief Executive Officer \nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston \n  \nThe Connecticut Business & Industry Association \nand the MetroHartford Alliance \nEconomic Summit & Outlook 2010 \n  \nHartford, Connecticut \nJanuary 8, 2010 \n \n \n \n \nI am very pleased to be back at this important event, focused on the economy in \nthe year ahead.  I thank Jim Smith for that generous introduction, and the CBIA and the \nMetroHartford Alliance for inviting me to share my perspectives with you.* \nAs we begin a new year, financial markets are in a much better state than they \nwere a year ago.  Interest spreads reflecting a “panic premium” on risk have narrowed to \nmore normal levels, markets have resumed mu ch more normal trading patterns, and the \nFederal Reserve is likely to be able to wind down many of its emergency lending \n                                                 \n \n* Of course, the views I express today are my ow n, not necessarily those of my colleagues on the \nBoard of Governors or the Federal Open Market Committee (the FOMC). \n 1\n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, January 8, 2010 at 10: 15 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY  \nfacilities without any adverse impacts, as soon as next month – as the Federal Open \nMarket Committee affirmed in its statement last month. \nBut despite the improvement in financial conditions, the reco very in the real \neconomy has proceeded more slowly – with the declines in the firs t half of 2009 turning \nto slow but positive growth in the third quarter , and what appears to be stronger growth in \nthe fourth quarter.  This is  resulting, in part, from fi rms less aggressively cutting \ninventories as their sa les prospects improve.1   \nIn sum it seems to me that growth will be positive, but  slow enough that \nunemployment remains much higher than I would like.  I would be happy if in hindsight \nit is clear I have been too pessimistic.  But as  I see it, the economy faces three significant \n“headwinds.” \nFirst, while the banking crisis  has passed, banking problems  remain.  Most \neconomies that experience signif icant banking problems have been slow to recover, and \nthat is likely to be true this time in the U. S.  Loans at banks have declined over the past \nseveral quarters, as many businesses are cons trained by their balance sheets and reluctant \nto take on new debt.2  Many banks are also concerned with their  balance sheets – and \nparticularly their capital ratios3 -- and have restrained their terms of lending to avoid \ntaking on too much additional risk, given that  they are still working through problems \nwith existing loans. \nSecond, consumers and businesses will likely remain cautious – which is \nconsistent with positive but slow growth.  Consumption will continue to be subdued, as \nconsumers are fully aware that housing prices are well off their peak, unemployment rates are high, and home foreclosures are con tinuing.  Consumer caution and the desire to \n 2\n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, January 8, 2010 at 10: 15 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY  \nrebuild savings will likely result in some incr ease in the savings rate, which is of course \ngood in the long run but dampens growth in th e short term.  Many businesses seem likely \nto only gradually expand investment, at l east until they are more confident that the \neconomy will continue expanding even after so me of the stimulative government support \nwinds down.  Also, many businesses may be li mited in how much external funding they \ncan raise. \nThe third headwind involves the fact that  recessions this severe have broader \nramifications for labor markets.  Workers be come discouraged and leave the labor force, \nwhile the skills of workers that are unemployed for long periods may atrophy, and new \nentrants in the labor market often have to se ttle for jobs at levels below what they would \nbe offered in a more robust economy.   \nIndeed, to most Americans, economic prospects are better measured by an \nexpansion of jobs rather than growth in GDP.  So I would like to spend the rest of my \ntime with you reviewing some of  the patterns we have seen in labor markets during early \nstages of previous recoveries.  Of course, given the severity of this recession, consumer and business behavior this time may be somewhat  more restrained than in past recoveries. \nTo reveal a bit of the “punc h line,” my conclusions from  the analysis I am about \nto walk through are that the employment response in the last two recoveries was much \nslower than it was in the two earli er recoveries in the 1970s and 1980s.\n4  And \nunfortunately the financial headwinds, linge ring labor market problems, and a cautious \nattitude of consumers and businesses in the wake  of the financial crisis make it likely that \nrecovery in employment terms will also be slow this time.   \n 3\n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, January 8, 2010 at 10: 15 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY  \nUnfortunately, I expect a rath er slow recovery in output, and a rather slow \nrecovery in employment given  the level of output growth – and I will explain why, this \nmorning.  But since unemployment is so funda mentally important, I think it is good to \nstudy our labor markets and earlier recovery periods so policymaker s, businesses, and \nworkers can anticipate and adapt to the experience we are likely to see. \nIn addition, I would note that during the ea rly phases of a recovery, improvements \nin unemployment tend to lag those in the ec onomy.  But the strength of the recovery is \npartly dependent on how confident businesses and consumers are becoming that the \neconomy will be able to grow fast enough for tangible progress in labor markets and the \nrecovery will become self sustaining. \n \nEmployment Patterns in the First Year of Recovery \nAllow me to walk you through a few slides  that help illustrate employment \npatterns in the first year of recoveries. \nGDP growth in the just-com pleted fourth quarter of 2009 looks like it will prove \nto have been stronger than in the third quarter, a result largely driven by businesses \nbringing their significant inventory draw-down to a close.   \nAs shown in Figure 1 , this is not unusual for the firs t year of a recovery. Consider \nthe following logic.  The difference between re al GDP and real final sales is the change \nin inventories.  In the first year of the r ecovery from the four previous recessions, real \nGDP grew faster than real fi nal sales.  This shows how the normalizing of inventories has \nbeen an important source of economic growth in the early stages of  most recoveries.   \n 4\n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, January 8, 2010 at 10: 15 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY  \nThe figure shows that the smallest invent ory response was in the recovery in the \nearly 1990s.  Since inventories are often ba nk-financed, so-called headwinds provided by \nthe troubles in the banking syst em that result in credit cons traints are, unfortunately, a \npotential source of restraint on inventory replenishment now, as then.  Indeed, research I \nhave done with colleagues Joe Peek and Geo ff Tootell confirms that inventory buildup \ntends to be more restrained during peri ods of significant banking problems.   \nThus today, as in the early 1990s, invent ory levels became quite low during this \nrecession as businesses prepared for the worst, and I expect that inve ntory buildup will be \nan important source of growth – but also that it will likely be more restrained than one \nmight have otherwise expected, beca use of tighter credit conditions.   \nFigure 2  shows that the past two recoveries did not feature job growth in the first \nyear of the recovery, in sharp contrast to the recoveries of the 1970s and 1980s.  The past \ntwo recessions had positive economic  growth in the first year of the recovery, but it was \nnot rapid enough to generate job growth.  In contrast, in th e recoveries in the 1970s and \n1980s, growth was sufficient to yield employment  growth in the first year of the recovery. \nFigure 3  illustrates another pattern typical of  recoveries.  While there has been a \nlongstanding downward trend in  the average weekly hours of  production workers, it is \ncommon for average hours to decline more steeply during a recession.  Note that in \nprolonged recessions, where the shading is th e widest, average weekly hours decline \nmore significantly – as workers are placed on shortened work weeks.   \nAs the economy begins to recover, businesses will restore the hours of such \nworkers before hiring additional new workers.  Note that in our current recession, there \n 5\n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, January 8, 2010 at 10: 15 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY  \nwas a significant decline in th e hours of production workers, which are just beginning to \nshow signs of a rebound. \nAnother harbinger of a recovery in employ ment is growth in temporary services.  \nFirms often extend work weeks and hire tem porary workers before committing to hiring \npermanent workers.  As Figure 4  highlights, the use of temporary workers fell quite \ndramatically during the rece ssion, but has been rebounding more  recently.  Of course \ntemporary jobs reduce the unemployment rate, and provide a needed bridge for workers \nlooking for, but not yet finding, more perm anent employment.  But when businesses \nbecome more confident of the strength of th e recovery, they will begin to hire permanent \nworkers rather than rely on temporary workers. \n \nLabor-Market Dynamics that Impact Employment Growth \nNow I would like to explore with you so me of the labor-market dynamics that \nwill likely restrain employment growth in this recovery. \nThe severity of a recession can have a significant impact on how quickly firms \nresume hiring.  As Figure 5  shows, this recession was qu ite severe in a number of \nrespects.  This recession was much longer than  typical, making it diffi cult for those that \nlost their jobs to find employment.  Research  has highlighted the fact that workers that \nhave been unemployed for extended periods ca n have significant difficulty being rehired.  \nIt may be that their skills atrophy, or just th at their sector of the economy is particularly \nhard-hit.  And potential employers may worry  about the underlying reasons for the long \nunemployment spell.   \n 6\n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, January 8, 2010 at 10: 15 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY  \nAs shown in the figure, currently the percentage of the unemployed who have \nbeen out of work for 27 weeks or more is much  higher than in previous recessions, at just \nunder 40 percent.  This is likely to be one impediment to our seeing significant, speedy \ndeclines in unemployment. \nThe next set of challenges is  related to the lack of business confidence that I cited \nearlier.  Businesses are most lik ely to hire new workers when they are confident that their \nsales and orders will increase significantly fo r an extended period of time.  Absent this \nconfidence, businesses have at their dispos al several alternatives for deploying more \nlabor without incurring all the co sts entailed in new hires. \nThe first of these alternatives is  reflected in the blue line in Figure 6.  Roughly 6 \npercent of the labor force is working part tim e for reasons related to the economy.  Such a \nhigh percentage of workers being placed on part time work schedules is, as you can see in \nthe figure, much higher than in the past two recessions – and was last at these levels in \nthe 1980s.   \nMany workers reflected in these data ha d their schedules reduced to part time \nbecause employers want to retain them but did not have sufficient work to keep them on full time.  Before an employer is likely to do any significant new hiri ng, they will usually \nreturn these workers to full time work.  While  that defers new hiri ng, it does of course \nmean additional income for the worker. \n A second alternative to permanent hire s is evident in th e data for weekly \novertime, which declined quite significantly during this recession, as shown in Figure 7 .  \nBusinesses frequently will not only restor e the aforementioned workers to full time \nstatus, but also begin incurring overtime befo re making the investment in new hires.  \n 7\n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, January 8, 2010 at 10: 15 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY  \nWhile there has been some rebound in overtim e work, you can see in the figure that it \nremains well below pre-recession levels. \nA final alternative to employment growth  is improving the efficiency of the \nexisting work force.  In recent quarters, employers have found ways to produce more \ngoods with fewer workers.  While a more pr oductive work force is very good news for \nthe economy in the long run, it lessens the need for hiri ng in the short run.   \nThe combination of these labor market  challenges and the headwinds from \nproblems in the banking sector make it quite likely that the unemployment rate will \ndecline only gradually.  While layoffs are s ubsiding, in sum it seems that new hiring is \nlikely only after employers more fully utilize existing employees.  \n \nIndustry Patterns  \nNow I would like to share some thoughts on various industries and recoveries.  \nFigure 8  shows the changes that have o ccurred in the industrial mix of \nemployment over the past 30 years.  Overall, much less of the work force is employed in \nmanufacturing, which has fallen from 21 percent of the work force to  only 9 percent of \nthe work force now.  The two areas that have  increased significantl y are professional and \nbusiness services, and education and health serv ices – both areas that  have tended to be \nless responsive to economic downturns. \nGiven the difficulties in predicting overall employment trends going forward, it is \neven more difficult to determine which industr ies are likely to be engines of growth.  \nHowever, it is instructive to see which industrie s, in the past, have tended to grow in the \nfirst year of a recovery. \n 8\n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, January 8, 2010 at 10: 15 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY  \nFigure 9  shows four industries that have tende d to perform well in the first year \nof a recovery – professional and business serv ices, education and heal th services, leisure \nand hospitality, and to a lesser extent governme nt.  The first three are areas that have \nincreased their share of total employment, a nd all have tended to be less sensitive to \neconomic downturns.    \nWhile it is quite possible that these areas wi ll grow in the initial stages of this \nrecovery, that growth is likely to be restrained by various fact ors.  In education and health \nservices, there is the matter of the significant retrenchment in college endowments, and  \nuncertainty as national health reform proposal s are debated in Washington.  Government \nspending grew modestly in the first year of the past recoveries from recessions.  This \ntime, however, the outlook for government empl oyment remains quite dim – as federal, \nstate, and city governments struggle with ra ther severe revenue shortfalls and budget \nissues.  \nProfessional and business services, and leisure and hospita lity, have often \nincreased employment in the first year of a recovery; however, the degree has been significantly less in the past tw o recoveries compared to the 1980s (and in fact negative \nfor professional and business services in 2001- 2002).  The strength in these sectors this \ntime around will depend on how quickly consum er and business confidence returns. \nFigure 10  highlights industries that have had more mixed results in the first year \nof a recovery and are uncertain this time as well.  While construction employment will be restrained by low housing prices and el evated foreclosures – and commercial \nconstruction employment is restrained in many areas by falling co mmercial real estate \n 9\n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, January 8, 2010 at 10: 15 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY  \nprices and high vacancy rates – employment levels in these sectors have experienced \nsuch significant declines that we may still see some rebound.   \nThe behavior of the consumer will help determine employment in manufacturing \nand retail trade.  It is uncl ear how willing consumers will be to increase spending once \nthe government’s various stimulus programs abate.  If consumption is relatively \nrestrained, as many expect, then these sectors are not likely to hire significantly until \nconsumers become more confident.  On th e bright side, though, a potential upside to \nmanufacturing employment is  the strong growth occurring in some emerging economies \nand prevailing exchange rates that favor U.S. exports. \n \nConcluding Observations \nTo sum up my remarks and conclude, I think we can gain insights on this \nrecovery from the experience and trends of  the past.  Certainly for economies that \nexperience substantial financ ial shocks, recovery is normally quite slow.  While \ninventory rebuilding will likely provide some  spark, the strength of underlying demand as \ngovernment stimulus subsides is an open question.   \nThe employment picture overall has improved, and the outlook is  certainly much \nbrighter than one year ago.  Layoffs are ab ating, although many firms are not yet ready to \ndo new permanent hiring.  Any significant hiring will likely have to wait while current labor resources are more fully utilized. \nSo it appears that this recovery will li kely experience only a slow improvement in \nthe employment picture, and that the unemp loyment rate will remain quite elevated \nduring the early phases of the recovery.  GDP growth is expected to be strong enough to \n 10\n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, January 8, 2010 at 10: 15 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY  \n 11                                                produce some employment growth, but that rate of employment expansion will not likely \nbe rapid enough to put a large dent in the unemployment rate.     \nOur research and analysis at the Bost on Fed suggests that with significant \ncapacity in labor markets, wages and salaries  and the ability of businesses to increase \nprices are all likely to be restrained, resulti ng in little immediate inflationary pressures.  \nIn my view this should allow for accommodativ e monetary policy to continue to support \nthe economy until the underlying demand of consumers and businesses becomes self-\nsustaining. \nThank you again for inviting me to speak with you today.  I do wish each of you \nsolid improvements in your businesses in th e year ahead, and better economic times for \nall New Englanders as the recovery proceeds.  Thank you. \n \n \n \n \nNOTES: \n \n1 While most private forecasters have inventories declining in Q4 of 2009 and Q1 of 2010, the \ndecline is projected to be at a slower rate (i.e., firms cutting less  from their inventories), thus \nadding to GDP growth.  \n2 In a recent speech, Federal Reserve Governor E lizabeth Duke noted that “the decline in bank \nloans outstanding has been stark. For example, our data show that total loans on banks' books fell \nat an annual rate of more than 11 percent during the third quarter of 2009, with all major loan categories contributing to the decline…”  She goes on to describe a number of factors at work in \nexplaining the reduction in bank loans in her remarks, available at \nhttp://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/duke20100104a.htm. \n \n3 As I have noted in prior talks, the losses of  capital and de-leveraging of balance sheets at \nfinancial institutions serve as a drag on th e economy, as financial institutions focus on \nrestructuring their balance sheets with the conseque nt tightening of lending standards.  Recall that \na loan is counted as an asset on a bank's bala nce sheet. Banks hold capital in part to reserve \nagainst the possibility that a loan defaults, and must maintain a reasonable ratio of capital to assets. If a bank experiences a reduction in the value of its capital, it must take steps to shrink the asset side of its balance sheet in order to restore its desired capital-to-assets ratio. The bank \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, January 8, 2010 at 10: 15 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY  \n 12                                                                                                                                                 \nbecomes more restrictive in its lending – no small matter for the broader economy when you \nconsider that, thanks to levera ge, when a bank's capital declines, the bank must reduce its loans \nby much more to maintain its capital-to-assets ratio . In addition to this state of affairs, often \nreferred to as a \"credit crunch,\" a new and unwelco me wrinkle occurred in many short-term credit \nmarkets during the recent financial turmoil − something you might call a \"liquidity lock.\" By \nliquidity lock, I mean extreme risk aversion by  many investors and institutions, which makes \nshort-term financing difficult to come by for even the most creditworthy firms – even financing \nfor very short maturities, measured in days.  See “The Impact of Financial Institutions and \nFinancial Markets on the Real Economy: Implications  of a 'Liquidity Lock'”, delivered at The \nUniversity of Wisconsin – Madison in October 2008 (available at http://www.bos.frb.org/news/spe eches/rosengren/2008/100908.htm  \n \n4 As is often done, here we lump the very brief 1980:Q2 “credit” recession with the 1981-82 \nrecession.  \n\nFigure 1\nReal Growth in First Year of Recovery \nSource:  BEA, NBER / Haver Analytics02468\n1975:Q1 -1976:Q1 1982:Q4 -1983:Q4 1991:Q1 -1992:Q1 2001:Q4 -2002:Q4Real GDP\nReal Final SalesPercent Change from Trough (Year Earlier)\n\nFigure 2\nEmployment Growth in First Year of Recovery \nSource:  BLS, NBER / Haver Analytics9899100101102103104\nTrough Q1 Q2 Q3 Q41975:Q1 -1976:Q1\n1982:Q4 -1983:Q4\n1991:Q1 -1992:Q1\n2001:Q4 -2002:Q4Index, Trough = 100\n\nFigure 3\nAverage Weekly Hours of Production and \nNonsupervisory Workers\nJanuary 1964 – November 2009\nSource:  BLS, NBER / Haver Analytics00000111111\n3234363840\nJan-64 Jan-68 Jan-72 Jan-76 Jan-80 Jan-84 Jan-88 Jan-92 Jan-96 Jan-00 Jan-04 Jan-08\nRecessionAverage Weekly Hours\n\nFigure 4\nGrowth in Temporary Help Services Employment\nFebruary 1990 – November 2009\nSource:  BLS, NBER / Haver Analytics00000111111\n-5-4-3-2-101234\nFeb-90 Feb-92 Feb-94 Feb-96 Feb-98 Feb-00 Feb-02 Feb-04 Feb-06 Feb-08Percent Change from Previous Month\n\nFigure 5\nEmployment Challenges: \nPercent Unemployed for 27 Weeks or More\nJanuary 1959 – November 2009\nSource:  BLS, NBER / Haver Analytics012345678\n0510152025303540Jan-59 Jan-64 Jan-69 Jan-74 Jan-79 Jan-84 Jan-89 Jan-94 Jan-99 Jan-04 Jan-09\nRecessionPercent\nPercent of unemployed out of\nwork for 27 weeks or more \n\nFigure 6\nEmployment Challenges: Percent of Labor Force \nPart Time for Economic Reasons\nJanuary 1959 – November 2009\nSource:  BLS, NBER / Haver Analytics012345678\nJan-59 Jan-64 Jan-69 Jan-74 Jan-79 Jan-84 Jan-89 Jan-94 Jan-99 Jan-04 Jan-09\nRecessionPercent\nPercent of labor force part time\nfor economic reasons \n\nFigure 7\nAverage Weekly Overtime Hours of Production \nand Nonsupervisory Workers\nJanuary 1959 – November 2009\nSource:  BLS, NBER / Haver Analytics00000111111\n0123456\nJan-59 Jan-64 Jan-69 Jan-74 Jan-79 Jan-84 Jan-89 Jan-94 Jan-99 Jan-04 Jan-09\nRecessionAverage Weekly Overtime Hours\n\nFigure 8\nEmployment Composition by Major \nIndustry Sector\nSource:  BLS / Haver Analytics1.2%4.9%\n20.5%\n20.3%\n2.6% 5.6%8.4%7.9%7.4%3.1%18.1%November 1980\nMining and Logging\nConstruction\nManufacturing\nTrade, Transportation & Utilities\nInformation Services \nFinancial Activities\nProfessional & Business Services \nEducation & Health Services\nLeisure & Hospitality \nOther Services  \nGovernment0.5%4.5%\n8.9%\n19.1%\n2.1%\n5.9%\n12.8%14.8%10.0%4.1%17.2%November 2009\n\nFigure 9\nRecovery in Employment by Industry Sector:  \nGrowth in First Year of Recovery\nSource:  BLS, NBER / Haver Analytics-8-6-4-202468\n1975:Q1 -1976:Q1 1982:Q4 -1983:Q4 1991:Q1 -1992:Q1 2001:Q4 -2002:Q4Professional & Business Services\nEducation & Health Services\nLeisure & Hospitality\nGovernmentPercent Change from Year Earlier\n\nFigure 10\nRecovery in Employment by Industry Sector:  \nGrowth in First Year of Recovery\nSource:  BLS, NBER / Haver Analytics-8-6-4-202468\n1975:Q1 -1976:Q1 1982:Q4 -1983:Q4 1991:Q1 -1992:Q1 2001:Q4 -2002:Q4Construction\nManufacturing\nRetail TradePercent Change from Year Earlier",

Rosengren \nPresident & Chief Executive Officer \nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston \n  \nThe Global Interdependence Center's Conference on \n\"Financial Interdepen dence in the World's \nPost-Crisis Capital Markets\" \n  \nPhiladelphia \nMarch 3, 2010 \n \n \n  Thank you, Charles, for your kind introduction.  I am very happy to be here today, to \noffer some perspectives on central banking and systemic supervision in an interdependent \nworld – and in particular some lessons from th e past that may serve us well in the future.\n*  \n The past three years have dramatically unde rscored the interdependence of the world’s \nfinancial institutions and financial markets.   The financial crisis also, by the way, \nincreased awareness of the interdependence of the actions of monetary and fiscal \nauthorities around the world.  In light of the crisis and the reality of financial \ninterdependence, the Federal Reserve expande d the types of policy actions it was willing \nto take.  My view is that our  openness to innovative measures  was critical to avoiding far \nmore severe outcomes – by which I mean cas cading failures of financial firms and a \nlocking up of liquidity and credit extensi on, further impeding households and companies \nand eventually leading to unemployment that  far exceeds our current, far too high, level. \n However, I must also stress that the nation’s “f inancial crisis toolki t” was, unfortunately, \nincomplete, resulting in the Federal Reserve needing to reluctantly take some controversial actions – notably as a result of government in gene ral lacking adequate \n                                                \n \n \n* Of course, the views I express today are my ow n, not necessarily those of my colleagues on the \nBoard of Governors or the Federal Open Market Committee (the FOMC). \n 1\n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, March 3, 2010 at 9:15 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY  \ntools or powers to address the resolution (or “winding down”) of certain institutions, \nespecially systemically important nonbank financ ial firms.  If the U. S. puts in place better \nresolution powers for such institutions, the Federal Reserve will not need to be involved in lending under unusual and exigent circumstances to systemically important institutions that we have no regulatory or supervisory pow ers over, to prevent even worse outcomes. \nUnfortunately, at this point the U.S. is operating with the same incomplete toolkit \navailable to policymakers that we had befo re the crisis.  I know that Congress is \nconsidering various proposals for financia l regulatory reform.  My hope is that \nestablishing resolution authority for system ically important nonbank financial firms will \nbe an area with broad bipartisan agreement and support for change.    \n \n  Looking Back, to Look Forward \n \nDespite the Fed’s aggressive use of both trad itional and non-traditiona l policy tools, the \neconomy is experiencing a slow recovery from  a very severe recessi on, particularly when \nit comes to jobs.\n1  Still, with recent events fresh in our minds it is an appropriate time to \ndiscuss the actions a central bank should take  during a crisis – and in the periods that \nprecede a crisis – and the tools and powers needed  to help avoid future crises.  Of course, \npolicymakers and lawmakers are studying these matters right now.    So now is the time to be compiling and applying the lessons of the cris is and its lead-up.  \nBut as I’ve noted in other talks, we must learn the right  lessons, not necessarily the \ncommonly accepted ones.  The generally accepted narrative does not always stand up to \ncloser scrutiny, and reacting to  these narratives might lead to the wrong remedies.  When \nyou consider the human toll of this financial crisis and recession, nothing is more \nimportant than making sure we parse out a nd learn the “real” less ons.  Otherwise the \nfixes may miss the mark and i nvite unintended consequences. \n So today I would like to pose some key que stions:  Did monetary policy cause the \nhousing bubble that played such a large role in this crisis?  Was it, as some have \nsuggested, mainly due to the Fed keepi ng rates too low for too long, after the 2001 \nrecession?  Or should our attention be  less on monetary policy and more on supervisory  \npolicy?  Looking forward, what are the best remedies to avoid a similar crisis in the \nfuture?  Do we need traditional supervision done better, as some assume, or do we need \nsomething quite different?  And does the recen t financial crisis and recession suggest, as \nsome say, that the central bank should not be involved in supervising financial \ninstitutions and mitigating financia l instability, going forward?   \n Again, my focus is on avoiding future financial crises.  In that spirit, I will touch on the \nways that the Federal Reserve could and should use a combination of monetary and \nsupervisory tools to foster better macroeconomic outcomes.  To do this, I will look back \nat our recent economic history – specifical ly, the early part of the last decade\n2 – to \ninvestigate whether we could have employed a better mix of policy actions to strengthen \n 2\n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, March 3, 2010 at 9:15 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY  \nthe economy after the 2001 recession while a voiding the buildup of financial imbalances \nthat occurred – in other words, avoiding the bubble that eventually burst.   \n \nCauses of the Crisis? \n \nAs we unpack these issues I should begin by emphasizing that understanding the causes \nof asset-price “bubbles” is ve ry difficult.  Most economists are uncharacteristically \nhumble in admitting their ignora nce about what causes asset prices to diverge from their \nfundamentals (in other words, what causes bubbles).    Still, research by Boston Fed economists points  to a clear role fo r house prices in the \nrecent crises. The rapid ascent of house pric es – which started in 1998, accelerated in \n2004, and reversed in 2006 – is in our vi ew central to understanding the eventual \nchallenges.  The expectation of rising pr ices provided the incentive for potential \nhomeowners to invest more in housing, and made them – and their lenders – more comfortable with putting relatively little m oney down.  Rising prices also mitigated the \nrisk to institutions and invest ors that held assets based on th ese mortgages.  After all, as \nlong as prices continued to rise, mortgage holders who got into fi nancial trouble could \nsell or refinance rather than default, insu lating the holders of their mortgages from \nfinancial loss. This encouraged more relaxed credit standards, including low \ndownpayments.  Of course, a higher loan-to- value ratio exposed the homeowner and the \nlender to risk should prices fall significantly, but this risk was judged to be minimal.  \nHouse prices were expected to continue rising.  There is evidence that financial institutions understood the risks that  would arise if house \nprices fell, but assigned too low a probability to this potential outco me.  Thus they were \nwoefully unprepared to weather the conseque nces when prices did indeed fall.  Many \ninvestors believed that rising house prices made  the possibility of significant losses on \nsecuritized pools of subprime loans remote.\n3  They realized that a significant decline in \nhouse prices would indeed cause subprime secu ritization deals to suffer enormous losses, \nbut assigned a very low (or nonexistent) proba bility to the sort of drop in house prices \nthat actually occurred.  Alt hough some housing experts had rais ed concerns that the rise \nin housing prices was not sustainable, noti ng unusually high ratios of house prices to \nincome or rent, most took comfort in the fact that nominal housing prices had not fallen \nat the national level since World War II.  Even the pessimistic forecasts tended to envision a gradual leveling off of prices  rather than an outright decline. \n The story fits with the notion of a classic bubble.  The key feature of a bubble is that \ninvestors willingly pay high prices not because of the asset’s intrinsic value, but because \nthey believe some other investor will pay more  for it in the future.  The other key element \nof a bubble is that it almost always bursts.  All of this implies an important role for supervisors in undertaking scenario analyses that would make clear the exposures to such risks,  both for individual institutions and for the \nfinancial system as a whole.  I will return to this theme in a moment. \n \n 3\n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, March 3, 2010 at 9:15 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY  \nDid Monetary Policy Cause the Bubble? \n \nAgain, understanding asset bubbles is not easy.  One of the most prevalent theories on the \nsource of the bubble involves the low interest rate policies of the Federal Reserve during \nthe recovery from the 2001 recession, when the federal funds rate remained quite low –  \nstaying at 1 percent from  June 2003 to June 2004 (Figure 1). \n   Let’s look closely at the episode .  At the time, the rationale for maintaining such a low \nfederal funds rate seemed clear.  That rati onale is summarized in the FOMC’s outlook for \ninflation and unemployment.  Figure 2  shows the internal Board of Governors staff \nforecast – a well-respected input to the FOMC’s  policy deliberations – for core inflation \nand unemployment as of the end of 2003.  At the time, the Board staff had forecast that the unemployment rate would gradually fall to  5 percent over the next two years, while \ncore inflation (as measured by changes in th e core consumer price index or CPI) would \nedge down slightly and remain around 1.5 percent.   Five percent was the staff estimate of \n“full employment” at that time; so to put this another way, the unemployment rate was \nexpected to be above the fu ll employment level for the next two years.  Meanwhile, \ninflation was expected to be low.\n4  \n While the unemployment forecast was spot on, th e inflation forecast was, in contrast, too \nlow.  Actual inflation was higher and more erratic.  Had the Federal Reserve’s inflation forecast been more accurate, monetary policy might have been somewhat less accommodative.    Additionally, in the post-Sept ember 11 environment, poten tial downside risks to the \neconomy from other terrorist at tacks were a concern.  Policy makers were also anxious \nnot to repeat the mistakes of their Japanese  counterparts in the 1990s, who had withdrawn \nsupport prematurely, leading to deflation and a lost decade of economic growth. \n So, did accommodative interest rates fuel th e housing bubble?  Actually, the relationship \nbetween interest rates an d bubbles is not as obvious as one might think.  Figure 3  \nhighlights the federal funds rate and the 30-ye ar fixed mortgage rate.  While the 30-year \nrate declined during the pe riod of federal funds rate easing, the drop was relatively \nmodest relative to the decline in the fed funds rate.  Over the 10 years shown in the chart, the 30 year mortgage rate averaged 5.99 pe rcent; while during the one-year period when \nthe federal funds rate was 1 percent, the 30-year  mortgage rate averag ed 5.51 percent.  As \nthe federal funds rate increased in 2005 a nd 2006, the 30-year mortga ge rate fluctuated \nclose to the 10 year average.    So mortgage rates were a bit lower wh ile Fed policy was accommodative – but not \ndramatically lower.\n5  Most economic models of housing price movements would suggest \nthat such relatively modest fluctuations in mortgage rates – less than half a percent – would produce only modest changes in house prices.\n6 \n Moreover, contrary to the generally-assumed narrative, the empirical link between \nperiods with low interest ra tes and asset bubbles is not pa rticularly strong.  Generally \n 4\n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, March 3, 2010 at 9:15 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY  \nspeaking, lower interest rates lead to higher pr ices for a wide variety of assets, but they \ndo not necessarily lead people to expect continued increases  in asset prices – that key \ncharacteristic of a bubble that  I mentioned a moment ago. \n \nIn addition, house prices also ro se rapidly in other countries – in many cases more rapidly \nthan in the United States.  See Figure 4 .  Ireland and Spain, in  particular, witnessed \ndramatic booms in house prices – and subsequent declines.  Note  that in contrast \nGermany, which had the same monetary policy as Ireland and Spain, did not experience a \ndramatic increase.  All this makes it difficult to root an explanati on for the bubble entirely \nin the choices made by U.S. monetary policymakers.  I am not saying that low rates could have had no role in moving housing prices higher.  But I suspect the booming demand for real estate  derived in large measure from incorrect \nexpectations that housing prices would not fall,  rather than from the short-run effect on \nhousing demand of low short-term rates a nd slightly lowered mortgage rates. \n Policy Responses \n \nIf we cannot predict when bubbles will happen – or even, as many suggest, identify their \npresence – then what can policymakers do?  Financial policymakers can ameliorate the \nproblems that bubbles cause by taking a forwar d-looking and systemic view of financial \nrisk regulation. Traditional “prudential” superv ision tends to focus on areas of high risk at \nindividual institutions.  Systemic or “macroprudential” supervision needs to focus on possible misperceptions (and mispricing) of risk  more generally and the way that risk is \ndispersed throughout the system, di rectly and indirectly.  More scenario analysis, such as \nthat done in the so-called “stre ss test” of large institutions last year, needs to be a focus \nfor future systemic supervision – whether accomplished by a given agency or a council \ncharged with systemic oversight.    In the financial context, forward-looking risk  regulation focused on scenario analysis may \nhave done a better job of identifying potential risks from a bursting bubble.  Properly done, scenario analysis would have highlighted the sensitivity of fina ncial institutions to \nvarious risks, like falling house prices.  Not that this is ea sy to do.  But certainly it is \nrealistic to say that scenario analysis could have identified that values and ratings of subprime securities (especially the most e xotic) were extraordinarily sensitive to \nassumptions for which no one had especially good information.  This suggests the need, \ngoing forward, for more “stress-test” type exer cises – to first identify, and then address,\n7 \nemerging risks.    Traditional bank supervision tends to focus on the current condition of a firm by identifying write-downs of nonperforming assets  and validating the ra tings of loans and \nthe adequacy of reserves.  This partly refl ects the current focus in accounting on incurred \nlosses.  In contrast, the systemic supervis ion that is needed would focus on possible \nfuture losses and is inherently forward-looking.  Doing this well requires an \nunderstanding not only of institutions but also markets, and it requires taking into account \nthe full range of outcomes, both expected and potential – including those that have a low \n 5\n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, March 3, 2010 at 9:15 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY  \nlikelihood of occurring but that could have serious adverse consequences.  While we may \nnot be able to eliminate all bubbles, we s hould be able to limit the degree to which the \nfinancial sector feeds and propagates these booms, and the sector’s vulnerability to subsequent busts.     Such work is particularly well suited for the Fe d.  Its role as “lender of last resort” (where \nwe lend  at a penalty rate and have never had a Discount Window loss), its responsibility \nfor bank supervision, and its constant monitoring of the economy provide the Federal Reserve with a unique window on financial-stability  issues.  It is a se rious gap that there \nis no assigned responsibility for forward-looki ng, systemic risk supervision – and filling \nthis gap in some way is probably the hi ghest priority in regulatory reform. \n I would also emphasize the systemic nature of optimal supervision and regulation, because another aspect of achieving financial stability involves understanding the interdependence of financial institutions.  Ideally, supervis ors should have a good idea of \nhow a failure of one institution would imp act its counterparties;  as well as the \ncircumstances under which a large number of institutions would become insolvent.  Most accounts of the financial crisis  make clear how concern abou t counterparty risk fuelled \npanic among market participants.  It also weighed mightily on policymakers trying to \ncobble together solutions to the crisis.    It goes without saying that  understanding counterparty ri sk can be exceptionally \ncomplicated.  Large financial in stitutions have a variety of subsidiaries around the world.  \nAs a result of acquisitions they often have legacy information systems that can make it \ndifficult to aggregate their true counterparty e xposure to one entity.  Certainly this is an \narea where financial institutions and regulator s need to do more work, to be better \nprepared for any future crises.    As part of scenario analysis, firms should be  asked by supervisors to provide information \non counterparties and exposure, to examine how  major counterparty failures would affect \nthem – and, if possible, how their own failure  would impact their major counterparties.  \nThe regulators should then be able to compar e results across institutions to get a better \nappreciation of, and ability to m onitor, the counterparty risk.   \n We want analysts within a given financial in stitution to realize their firm would take big \nlosses if, for example, a particular asset pr ice were to fall. A systemic supervisor, \nconducting similar analyses across a variety of institutions, could see if others were in \nsimilar shape. And even if this supervisor saw only a small chance of a “meltdown” scenario for a particular asse t price, they could evaluate the impact and perhaps conclude \nthat the chance of a cascading systemic financ ial crisis was too big of a chance to take. \n Of course, it is also import ant to understand under what econo mic or financial situations \nsuch problems might rear their heads.  Supervisors need to collect this information regularly, and some public repo rting of interconnectedness w ould provide the public with \na useful understanding of the ri sks inherent in the institut ions, markets, and systems on \nwhich they rely.  \n 6\n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, March 3, 2010 at 9:15 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \nConcluding Observations \n \nTo conclude, I would just stress that s upervisory tools can and should provide an \nalternative to monetary polic y actions for addressing bubbles or other imbalances in \ncertain areas of the economy or financial syst em.  If we take a good hard analytical look \nat the last recovery, we see that the lo w fed funds rate was not the standout, and \nstandalone, culprit that many assume.  This is a crucial ma tter to consider right now, \nwhen rates are very low – in my opinion, totally appropriately – because some are \npredicting that these rate s will fuel another bubble. \n Financial regulatory reform needs to addre ss who has responsibility for regulating and \nsupervising systemic risk as well as who ha s responsibility for regul ating and supervising \nsystemically important institutions.  In partic ular, reform should enhance the potential to \nwind down or resolve systemically important ins titutions that are faili ng.  This is critical \nto avoiding future crises.    Because of the substantial synergies between  monetary policy, the lender-of-last-resort \nrole, and supervision of banks, I believe th e Federal Reserve shoul d play a significant \nrole in overseeing systemically important institu tions and addressing systemic risks.  It is \nalso important that the Federal Reserve c ontinue to supervise community banks, which \nprovide a window on lending to small busines ses and other bank-dependent borrowers.  \nThe reality is that supervisory policies should not be inde pendent of monetary policy – \nand similarly monetary policy should not be  conducted without th e valuable insights \ngained from supervision of large and small banks.  Understanding the business cycle and \nits potential impact on the institutions under supervision should be integral to bank \nsupervision and to understanding systemic ri sk.  And supervisory powers provide an \nimportant alternative tool to traditional m onetary policy as a way to address bubbles and \ninsure the best possible economic outcome.    The crisis has highlighted how undesirable it is  for the U.S. central bank to have to be \ninvolved in the rescue of individual institu tions.  However, it has also reinforced the \nimportant role that the central bank can and s hould play in maintaining financial stability.  \nRemember that concerns over financial instab ility and the experience of financial panics \nwere key motivations for the founding of the Federal Reserve by Congress.  No one is happy with the current state of the economy and the suffering of so many Americans who \nseek jobs or face foreclosure.  But the Federa l Reserve’s efforts to help maintain financial \nstability have averted much worse outcomes.    I believe the Federal Reserve can and should be  more focused on financial stability issues \ngoing forward.  As a result, whatever actions  are taken in Washington with regulatory \nreform, it is in everyone’s interest that any changes not impede the ability of the Federal \nReserve to be a lender of last resort or  to troubleshoot the functioning of financial \nmarkets during a crisis.    \n 7\n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, March 3, 2010 at 9:15 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY  \n 8                                                With all this in mind, I would say that le gislation that does no t provide a significant \nsupervisory and systemic responsibility for the Federal Reserve risks making us as a \nnation even less prepared for the next crisis than we were for this one. \n Thank you.  \n \n \n \n1 See my recent remarks on prospect s for employment and evidence from  prior recoveries, available at \nhttp://www.bos.frb.org/news/speeches/rosengren/2010/010810/index.htm \n \n2 A disclaimer: while the comparison yields insights, we should also r ecognize that the 2001 recession and \nrecovery were of course somewhat diff erent than the current situation.   \n \n3 For example, an August 2005 Lehman Brothers report on the expected performance, under various house-\nprice scenarios, of securitized pool s of subprime loans suggests that Lehman Brothers realized that a \nsignificant decline in house prices would cause subpri me securitization deals to suffer enormous losses. \nSpecifically, in the report’s “meltdown” scenario for house prices, the cumulative collateral losses would be 17.1 percent as all but the highest-rated secur ities in the subprime pools defa ult.  To understand why \ninvestors might have viewed these securities as a good investment anyway, one need only see that \nLehman’s analysts assigned the “meltdown” scenario a probability of only 5 percent.  Note that the \nmeltdown scenario implied a smaller drop in housing prices than what actually occurred.    \n4 For an in-depth analysis of monetary policy during th is period, as well as the re lationship of interest rates \nto housing prices, see Dokko et al.

Also see Chairman Bernanke’s \nspeech at the annual meeting of the American Eco nomic Association, entitled \"Monetary Policy and the \nHousing Bubble.\" (http://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bernanke20100103a.htm) \n \n5 Fixed-rate mortgages generally account for the ma jority of conventional mortgage originations, \napproximately 81 percent of purchase originations on average over the past decade, and 75 percent over the \nJune 2003 to June 2004 period (while adjustable-rate mortgages account for 19 percent and 25 percent, \nrespectively).  Over the decade the one -year adjustable-rate mortgage rate averaged 5.06 percent and fell to \n3.71 percent over the June 2003- June 2004 period. \n \n6 Nor is the theoretical logic that links housing prices and asset bubbles to low interest rates nearly as \nobvious as many suggest.  Standard models of housing prices, based on the user cost of owning a home, imply that housing prices rise only modestly when interest rates fall.  This does not neces sarily mean that \nthose models are correct, only that it is hard to bu ild a prima facie case that monetary policy caused the \nhousing bubble.  \n7 For example by requiring that capital be raised or certain activities curtailed. \n\n1Figure 1\nFederal Funds Target Rate\nJanuary 3, 2000 - February 26,  2010\nSource:  Federal Reserve Board / Haver Analytics01234567\n3-Jan-00 2-Jan-01 2-Jan-02 2-Jan-03 2-Jan-04 3-Jan-05 3-Jan-06 3-Jan-07 3-Jan-08 2-Jan-09 4-Jan-10Percent\nRange:\n0 - 0.25% \n2Figure 2\nUnemployment and Core Inflation Rates:\nBoard of Governors Internal Staff Forecast\nand Actual Results\nFourth Quarter 2003 - Third Quarter 2005\nSource:  Federal Reserve Board, BLS / Haver AnalyticsUnemployment \nRateCore CPI Inflation \nRateUnemployment \nRateCore CPI Inflation \nRate\nYear Quarter % % Change % % Change\n2003 Q4 6.0 1.8 5.8 1.0\n2004 Q1 6.0 1.6 5.7 1.9\n2004 Q2 5.8 1.5 5.6 2.6\n2004 Q3 5.5 1.5 5.4 1.7\n2004 Q4 5.3 1.5 5.4 2.5\n2005 Q1 5.2 1.5 5.3 2.5\n2005 Q2 5.1 1.5 5.1 1.9\n2005 Q3 5.0 1.5 5.0 1.3December 2003 Greenbook Forecast Actual Results\n\n3Figure 3\nMortgage Rates and the \nFederal Funds Target Rate\n2000:Q1 - 2009:Q4\nSource:  Bloomberg, Federal Reserve Board / Haver Analytics0246810\n2000:Q1 2002:Q1 2004:Q1 2006:Q1 2008:Q1Percent\nFederal Funds Target Rate30-Year Fixed-Rate Conventional Mortgage Rate\nRange: \n0 - 0.25%\n4Figure 4\nReal House Price Increases\n1994 - 2008\nSource:  OECD050100150200250300350400\n1994 1996 1998 2000 2002 2004 2006 2008Ireland\nSpain\nUnited States\nGermanyIndex, 1994=100",

I appreciate your warm welcome, and your \ninvitation to join the long a nd distinguished line of indivi duals who have addressed the \nMoney Marketeers over the decades.\n*  \n \nI have always taken some delight in Yogi  Berra quotes.   As a Red Sox fan, I could \nalways hope that garbled metaphors by the legendary Yogi would be as confusing to the players as they were to the public, which mi ght translate into opport unities when the Red \n                                                \n \n \n* Of course, the views I express today are my ow n, not necessarily those of my colleagues on the \nBoard of Governors or the Federal Open Market Committee (the FOMC). \n 1\n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, May 5, 2010 at 7:00 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY  \nSox came to New York.  Alas, in the early go ing this season it is not the Yankees that \nseem confused.   \n Yogi Berra was not only a great catcher and mana ger, but also an astute observer of the \nobvious.  If he were to summarize this talk  he might suggest a title like “Knowing Your \nDestination is a Good Start in  Getting Where You Are Going”  or some other derivation \nof what I believe is his actual quote: “You' ve got to be very careful if you don't know \nwhere you are going because you might not get there.”    When setting monetary policy, it is very importa nt to have a clear idea of where you want \nthe economy to go.  And fortunately, there is  now much more transparency about the \nFederal Open Market Committee’s (FOMC’s) expected destination, because the FOMC \nreleases its long-term projections for in flation and unemployment.  Unfortunately, \nhowever, actually reaching our desired dest ination will prove challenging and involve \nchoices, as I will discuss this evening.  At our January meeting, the central te ndency of the FOMC members’ long-run \nprojections for unemployment was 5.0 to 5.2 pe rcent, and for inflation (measured by the \npersonal consumption expenditures price inde x or PCE) was 1.7 to 2.0 percent.  At \npresent, both unemployment and inflation di verge significantly from these longer-term \ngoals, with the March unemployment rate at 9.7 percent, and core PCE inflation over the \npast year at 1.3 percent.  In such circumstances, one might th ink that the current path of \nmonetary policy would be particularly straightforward. \n 2\n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, May 5, 2010 at 7:00 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \nUnfortunately, just knowing your destinati on doesn’t get you there.  To reach your \ndestination you need to know how you want to get there.  If  I plug a destination into my \nnew GPS device, it asks whether I want the quickest route, or the geographically shortest route, or a route that meets some other crite ria. The quickest route is likely to involve \nhighways, but may cover more miles.  The shor test route may take side roads that reduce \ndistance and save gas, but take  substantially more time.  A nd, of course, you may run into \ntraffic or construction that for ces you to adapt your route. \n When setting monetary policy there may be a variety of paths you can take to reach the \ndestination.  For instance, aggressive pursu it of accommodative monetary policy by the \nFed and stimulative fiscal policy by Congress and the Administration might get us more \nquickly to our desired destination – but could enlarge the deficit or risk igniting inflation \nexpectations.  Alternatively, aggressive pursuit of less accommodative policies – that is, \nremoving monetary and fiscal stimulus sooner rather than later – could result in a more \nextended period of underutilized resources; or wo rse, significantly in crease the length of \nthe journey to our ultimate destination.    Right now, we are far from our destination, and the rest of my remarks will focus on \nselecting among the alternate routes to our objective.  The economy is currently beginning to reco ver from what many ar e calling the Great \nRecession.  While real GDP began to increase in the third quarte r of last year, growth so \n 3\n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, May 5, 2010 at 7:00 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY  \nfar has been insufficient to improve conditi ons much in the labor markets.  This \nunfortunate reality can be seen in Figure 1 , which shows the employment-to-population \nratio over the past 30 years w ith the shading representing recessions.  The decline of \nabout five percentage points in the employ ment-to-population ratio in this recession is \nstriking, as many workers have either beco me unemployed or dropped out of the work \nforce.   \n While it is not uncommon for the employmen t-to-population ratio to decline in a \nrecession, Figure 2  shows how dramatic the decline has been in this recession, compared \nwith previous ones.\n1  The loss of jobs has been par ticularly acute in construction and \nmanufacturing.  The severity of the job losse s in these male-dominated industries is one \nof the reasons that males in some age groups have experienced such a significant decline \nin their employment-to-popul ation ratio, as shown in Figure 3 .    For example, the March \nunemployment rates for males between the ages of 20 and 24 was 18.4 percent, more \nthan 5 percentage points higher than for females in the same age group.  The sharp reduction in the ratio of employm ent to population highlights our challenge – \nachieving a full recovery will require creating jobs for  those currently unemployed and actively seeking work, those entering the labo r force as the population grows, and those \nlikely to return to the labor force once jobs become more available.  Employing all these \nworkers within a reasonable period of time will require very strong economic growth.  \nThe question is, how likely is that?  \n 4\n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, May 5, 2010 at 7:00 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY  \nFigure 4  shows the growth rate in e ach of the first three years of the last three recoveries, \nas well as the average rates for all three recoveries.   The most  recent two recoveries were \nquite slow to get started, but picked up steam over time.  This is the pattern projected in \nmost forecasts for this recovery.   \n Over the past three quarters, GDP has increased 3.7 percent.\n2  However, some of the \ngrowth resulted from temporary rebalancing of  inventories by businesses, as suggested by \nFigure 5 , which shows that the percent change in real final sales was quite a bit smaller \nthan the percent change in GDP.  The gap be tween them would be inventory rebuilding.   \n Most private forecasts expect growth in the next four quarters to be fast enough to begin \nto make more improvement in the labor market .  My own expectation is consistent with \nthis.  As financial headwinds subside, and consumers and businesses gain more \nconfidence in the recovery, expenditures that ha ve been deferred will  be made – and we \nshould begin to see stronger economic growth.    Despite this forecast of an improved outlook, we will need very strong growth if we are \nto return to 5 percent unempl oyment in a reasonable time frame.  Economists frequently \nuse a rule of thumb, called Okun’s Law, to characterize the relationship between output growth and unemployment. According to Okun’s Law, if the economy grows one \npercentage point faster than its potential for one year, the result will be a decline in the unemployment rate of approximately one-half of a percent.  Of course, I would highlight \n 5\n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, May 5, 2010 at 7:00 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY  \nthat this is a rule of thumb, and that the relationship is more  complicated than this and, of \ncourse, subject to error.    \n But using the simple rule of thumb im plied by Okun’s Law, the left side of Figure 6  \nshows the rates of GDP growth  necessary to return unemp loyment to 5 percent over \ndifferent time frames.  The chart highlights th at we need several years of very strong \ngrowth to reach 5 percent unemployment.  For example, to reach 5 percent unemployment by the end of 2013, real GDP growth would have to average 5 percent per \nyear.\n3  Such a growth rate has some historical precedent, as shown on the right side of the \nchart, but it is much faster than the growth rate in the past two recoveries. And to reach 5 \npercent unemployment by 2015 would still take growth av eraging 4.2 percent per year – \nconsiderably faster than the average rate of growth after the 1991 and 2001 recessions. \n \nGiven the need for very rapid growth to get unemployment back to 5 percent, let me pose \nan oversimplified question – why would policymakers not keep monetary policy very \naccommodative, and fiscal policy very stimulativ e, until we had a sustained growth rate \nthat brought the economy much closer to fu ll employment?  At least on the monetary \nside, one reason might be concern among po licymakers that rapid growth would be \ninflationary.    To explore that, let’s turn to  Figure 7 , which shows the total and core inflation rates, \nmeasured by changes in the CPI, with recessi on shading.  What the chart shows is that \ninflation has declined in each recession, includ ing this so-called Great Recession.  It also \n 6\n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, May 5, 2010 at 7:00 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY  \nhighlights that inflation tends to continue falling in the early stages of a recovery.  Figure \n8 shows the change in the infl ation rate from the business cycle peak.  From the peak \n(shown at zero on the horizontal axis) the infl ation rate is very re strained, and generally \nnegative, for many months.  With substantia l excess capacity in the economy during the \nearly stages of a recovery, workers don’t te nd to demand higher wages, and firms don’t \nfeel at liberty to substantially increase pric es.  Since the Great Recession has resulted in \nsubstantial excess capacity, it woul d be unusual to see increases in  the inflation rate in the \nearly stages of this recovery. \n However, while inflation does not normally increase in the early stages of a recovery, some economic observers may be concerned that this recovery will be different, because of the unusual actions that the Federal Reserv e needed to take.  As you know, the Federal \nReserve took extraordinary measures to stab ilize the financial system – measures that \nwere critical to setting the stage for the current recovery. Figure 9  depicts the additions to \nthe central bank’s balance sheet from these temporary operations.  As you can see in the \nchart, the liquidity facilities that we set up to restore more effective financial market functioning have wound down.  At the same time,  however, in response to the severity of \nthe economic recession the Federal Reserve deci ded to expand its purchases of mortgage-\nbacked and agency securities.  These purchases were undertaken to improve market functioning in the mortgage market, and even more importantly, as a way to reduce a key \ninterest rate at a time when many short-term interest rates were cl ose to, or at, the zero \nlower bound.    \n 7\n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, May 5, 2010 at 7:00 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY  \nThe purchase program ended in March, and these balances will naturally be dropping \nover time as households prepay mortgages, sell their homes, or refinance.  This decline in \nour balance sheet will actually occur without  the Fed taking any specific actions. But it \nwill occur slowly, and absent any action of the Fed’s part, the balance sheet will remain elevated for years.  This expansion of the Federal Reserve’s balan ce sheet raises concerns for some observers \nand commentators.  An important side effect of our asset purchases has, necessarily, been \na dramatic swelling of so called excess reserves  in the banking system .  When the central \nbank purchases assets, it credits the selling institution with reserves.  Over time, banks \ncould choose to lend out these reserves, whic h would turn the reserves into broader \nmoney – and a rapid expansion of the broa der money supply would be inflationary.  \nHowever, as Figure 10  suggests, the current problem is not a rapid expansion in lending \nand the money supply.  In fact, quite the oppos ite; banks have been reluctant to lend.  \nMany have taken significant losses that have drained their capital; and, at the same time, \nthe financial condition of many potential borrowe rs is worse than before the recession.\n4 \n Were that situation to change and bank le nding to accelerate, the Federal Reserve could \ndrain the excess reserves from the banking syst em. We have a variety of tools. We could \nsell some of our long-term assets, thereby in creasing longer-term interest rates. We now \npay interest on reserves, and that rate could be increased  to discourage bank lending. The \nsize of our balance sheet, the composition of the balance sheet, and our short-term interest rate target are all instruments that we have available to reach our destination of \n 8\n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, May 5, 2010 at 7:00 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY  \nfull employment with stable prices. Fundament ally, decisions about shrinking our balance \nsheet – like decisions to tighten interest rates – should be conditional on economic \nconditions.    Some analysts warn of rapid inflation aris ing from the expansion of the Fed’s balance \nsheet; but these forecasts have not been borne  out.  In fact, despite  the buildup in excess \nreserves, the inflation rate has been falling – and I expect this tre nd to continue over the \nnear term.  The experience in both Japan and the United States is that after a banking \ncrisis, excess reserves have not been inflatio nary in the short term.  Of course, once the \nbanks have recapitalized and economic resour ces are more fully utilized, we would not \nwant to have a large stock of excess reserves.  Again, as noted, we ha ve a variety of tools \nto remove excess reserves at a tim e when that becomes appropriate. \n \nAs a result, I agree with many forecasters who expect disinflation in the near term.  The \nsubstantial excess capacity in labor market s that I mentioned earlier has caused \ncompensation to decline quite markedly (see Figure 11 ).  Because employee \ncompensation is the main cost component for most companies, lower labor costs enable \nbusinesses to improve profit margins without su bstantial price increases – particularly as \nthe demand for goods and services improves.  This brings us back to Yogi Berra, who famously said, “When you come to a fork in the road, take it.”  At times, a fork in the road is exactly what confronts monetary \npolicymakers.  We would face a fork, for example, if inflationary pressures were building \n 9\n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, May 5, 2010 at 7:00 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY  \ndespite  a high unemployment rate.  In this case, the choice between restraining inflation \nand supporting employment is  a difficult one, and the pol icy decision becomes more \ncomplicated.  However, with employment well below the level of full employment, and \ndisinflation continuing to move us away from my own inflation target of 2 percent, one \ndoes not currently need to make such trade-offs.  Another possible complication could occur if  very low interest rates were causing \nexcessive, leveraged bets that were inflating the price of assets that have macroeconomic \nimportance.  While we need to be vigilant against the buildup of asset bubbles, there is \nlittle evidence of such a problem now.  Many fi nancial institutions are still deleveraging – \na factor in why we are seeing too little lending rather than too much.  Real estate can be a \nvery important asset because it serves as co llateral for many loans.  However, in the \ncurrent situation both residential and commercial real estate are, at best, stabilizing.   \n Even if we were to see asset prices rising, it is not obvious that somewhat  tighter interest \nrates will make a significant difference.  A mo re targeted approach would be to examine \nwhether supervisors should require tighter lending standards,  or higher capital \nrequirements, in areas where asset prices ar e appreciating rapidly.   This would make \nsense from the perspective of good risk management – if institutions hold assets that appreciate quickly, they should re tain sufficient capital and be vigilant in credit standards \nto insure that they can weather a quick reve rsal in asset prices.  Raising short-term \ninterest rates because of exuberance in one market is a blunt, and possibly ineffective, \ntool against the exuberance of i nvestors in a particular asset.   As a result, in my view, \n 10\n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, May 5, 2010 at 7:00 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY  \nshort-term interest rate-setting is better suited for calibrating the growth in the overall \neconomy, rather than focusing on a particular asset class.    \n \nConcluding Observations \n \nIn sum, while the incoming economic data have certainly been more positive of late, we \nremain far from our “stated” destination.  Even with rapid growth in the economy, spurred by accommodative monetary policy and stimulative fiscal policy, it is likely to take years before we approach the growth a nd inflation rates that would really reflect \nachievement of the two elements of  the Federal Reserve’s dual mandate. \n The economy, while in a much better place than a year ago, is still susceptible to negative \nshocks.  Serious fiscal problems loom for state and local governments, the U.S. \ngovernment, and governments around the world – particularly those that have expended \nlarge sums of money to recover from this fi nancial crisis and recession. Clearly over time \nwe need to have much more sustainable le vels of budget deficits, at all levels of \ngovernment, here in the U.S. and abroad.\n5  However, I would just note that rapid \nmovement to fiscal austerity, like rapid removal of monetary accommodation, could of \ncourse significantly delay the time it takes to reach full employment. \n While financial markets have improved signifi cantly, real estate problems, bank closures, \nand significant non-performing loans on the boo ks of many banks c ontinue to provide \nfinancial headwinds to the recovery.  And clearly  – as the headlines of the past week have \n 11\n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, May 5, 2010 at 7:00 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY  \n 12                                                highlighted – financial problems abroad still ha ve the potential to result in slower U.S. \nexports, and may hold potential further pr oblems for global financial institutions. \n \nIn sum, my view is that w ith inflation expectations stable, core PCE inflation rates \ndeclining, and significant excess capacity in the economy, accommodative monetary \npolicy remains appropriate.    Thank you.    \n \n \n1 Of course, some of this is the result of the unusual  length of this recession. \n \n2 Year over year, the growth is 2.5 percent – which includes one quarter of negative growth (the second \nquarter of 2009). \n \n3 If the relationship is weaker, as some researchers su ggest, even stronger growth would be required to \nreduce the unemployment rate to 5 percent by year end 2013.  For example, if the reduction in the unemployment rate resulting from real GDP growth of 1 percent above potential is one-third of a percent \ninstead of one-half of a percent, then real GDP growth of 6.25 percent would be needed to reduce the unemployment rate to 5 percent by year end 2013.  \n4 Banks must, of course, maintain their capital ratios.  As some banks have taken significant losses that \ndrained capital, they have been reluctant to expand lending, so that the supply of loanable funds has likely been constrained.  But this supply-side effect has been exacerbated by the credit condition of potential \nborrowers in the wake of the Great Recession.  Even for banks that are less capital-constrained, with the \nbalance sheets of many potential borrowers in much worse shape than they were before the recession, \nlenders making prudent lending decisions will be relu ctant to lend to high-r isk potential borrowers. \n \n5 See for example the remarks by Chairman Ben Bernanke at the National Commission on Fiscal \nResponsibility and Reform on April 27, available at \nhttp://www.federalre serve.gov/newsevents/speech/bernanke20100427a.htm \n\nFigure 1 \nEmployment / Population Ratio\nJanuary 1980 - March 2010\nSource:  BLS, NBER / Haver Analytics000111\n54565860626466\nJan-80 Jan-83 Jan-86 Jan-89 Jan-92 Jan-95 Jan-98 Jan-01 Jan-04 Jan-07 Jan-10\nRecessionPercent\n\nFigure 2\nEmployment / Population Ratio:\nChange from Level at Business Cycle Peak\nLast Four Recessions\nSource:  BLS, NBER / Haver Analytics-5-4-3-2-1012\n- 1 2 - 9 - 6 - 3 0369 1 2 1 5 1 8 2 1 2 4 2 7 3 0 3 3 3 6\nMonths before (-) and after PeakPercentage Point Difference from Level at Peak\nDecember 2007July 1981\nJuly 1990\nMarch 2001\n\nFigure 3\nEmployment / Population Ratio:\nChange from Level at Business Cycle Peak\nSource:  BLS, NBER / Haver AnalyticsAll Men, Age 20 - 24\n-14-12-10-8-6-4-2024\n- 1 2 - 9 - 6 - 3 0369 1 2 1 5 1 8 2 1 2 4 2 7 3 0 3 3 3 6Months before (-) and after PeakPercentage Point Difference from Level at Peak\nDecember 2007July 1981 July 1990\nMarch 2001\n-14-12-10-8-6-4-2024\n- 1 2 - 9 - 6 - 3 0369 1 2 1 5 1 8 2 1 2 4 2 7 3 0 3 3 3 6Months before (-) and after PeakPercentage Point Difference from Level at Peak\nDecember 2007July 1981\nJuly 1990March 2001\n\nFigure 4\nReal Growth in First Three Years of Recovery\nSource:  BEA, NBER / Haver AnalyticsLast Three Recoveries\n02468\nRecovery from      \n1982 RecessionRecovery from      \n1991 RecessionRecovery from      \n2001 RecessionAverage of Last       \nThree RecoveriesReal GDP Growth in First Year\nReal GDP Growth in Second Year\nReal GDP Growth in Third YearPercent Change from Year Earlier\n\nFigure 5\nGrowth in Real GDP and Real Final Sales\n2009:Q3 - 2010:Q1\nSource:  BEA / Haver Analytics0123456\n2009:Q3 2009:Q4 2010:Q1Real GDP Real Final SalesPercent Change at Seasonally Adjusted Annual Rate\n\nFigure 6\nEstimates of Annual Real GDP Growth Needed to \nReturn to 5% Unemployment Rate\nSource:  BEA, NBER / Haver Analytics and author’s calculations01234567\nAnnual Growth Needed to Return to 5%   \nUnemployment Rate by Year EndFor Comparison:  Average Annual Growth in First    \nThree Years of Recovery from Last Three RecessionsBy 2012 By 2013 By 2014 By 2015Percent\n1982 Recession\n1991 Recession\n2001 RecessionRecovery from:\nNote: Estimates based on a modified Okun's Law. \n\nFigure 7\nInflation Rate:  Core and All-Items\nConsumer Price Index\nJanuary 1959 - March 2010\nSource:  BLS, NBER / Haver Analytics000111\n-40481216\nJan-59 Jan-64 Jan-69 Jan-74 Jan-79 Jan-84 Jan-89 Jan-94 Jan-99 Jan-04 Jan-09\nRecessionPercent Change from Year Earlier\nCore CPI\nCPI All Items\n\nFigure 8\nChange in Inflation Rate (Core CPI) from \nInflation Rate at Business Cycle Peak\nLast Four Recessions\nSource:  BLS, NBER / Haver Analytics-10-8-6-4-202\n-12 -9 -6 -3 0 3 6 9 12 15 18 21 24 27 30 33 36\nMonths Before (-) and after PeakPercentage Point Difference from Rate at Peak\nJuly 1981July 1990March 2001\nDecember 2007\n\nFigure 9\nFederal Reserve System Assets:\nSelected Temporary Operations\nMarch 19, 2008 - April 28, 2010\nSource: Federal Reserve Statistical Release H.4.1\n02004006008001,0001,2001,400\n19-Mar-08 2-Jul-08 15-Oct-08 28-Jan-09 13-May-09 26-Aug-09 9-Dec-09 24-Mar-10GSE/MBS\nCP Funding Facility\nAsset-Backed CP Liquidity Facility\nPrimary Dealer Credit Facility\nCentral Bank Liquidity SwapsBillions of Dollars\n\nFigure 10\nLoan Growth at Commercial and Savings Banks\n2009:Q1 - 2009:Q4\nSource:  Bank Call Reports and author’s adjustments for mergers and failed-bank acquisitions.Total Loans -1.6 -0.1 -2.6 -0.5\nCommercial Real Estate Loans 0.0 -0.8 -1.6 -2.1\nCommercial and Industrial Loans -4.2 -4.7 -6.2 -4.42009:Q1 2009:Q2 2009:Q3 2009:Q4Percent Change from Previous Quarter\n \n\nFigure 11\nEmployment Cost Indexes for Civilian Workers\nMarch 1983 - March 2010\nSource:  BLS, NBER / Haver Analytics\n00000111111\n01234567\nMar-83 Mar-86 Mar-89 Mar-92 Mar-95 Mar-98 Mar-01 Mar-04 Mar-07 Mar-10\nRecessionPercent Change from Year Earlier\nWages & SalariesCompensation",

Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY \n \n \n \n \n \nRemarks at the Federal Reserve \nConference on REO and Vacant Property \nStrategies for Neighborhood Stabilization \n \n \nEric S. Rosengren \nPresident & Chief Executive Officer \nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston \n  \nWashington, D.C. \nSeptember 2, 2010 \n \n \n \n \n [Slide 1]  \n \nI’m very happy to be here today, to take part in a conference on topics of such importance. Housing has played a central role in the fi nancial crisis and the subsequent economic \ndifficulties that we have been experiencing now for more than three years.\n* \n This conference brings together  people from around the country who have been on the front \nlines looking for solutions to mitigate the personal and societal costs of mounting \nforeclosures, and the buildup of REO properties.  By gathering together , we can learn from \neach other’s successes – and also from each  other’s well-intentioned failures.   \n                                                \n \n \n* Of course, the views I express today are my own, not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Board \nof Governors or the Federal Open  Market Committee (the FOMC). \n 1\n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL Thursday, September 2, 2010 at 9:20 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY \n \nI expect we will learn that a single solution may not work in all regions of the country.  What \nseems promising in Cleveland and in other cities  in the northern Midwes t may not be the best \nsolution for New England, or for Southern Californ ia.  The reason, I suspect, is that the effects \nof the housing and financial crisis on any community depend, importantly , on the attributes of \nthe community.  For example, how susceptibl e is the population to extended spells of \nunemployment or other income disruptions ?  How healthy was the local economy and \nindustry before the crisis?  And how well- equipped are local nonpr ofit and governmental \ninstitutions – and civic leaders – to re spond to the fallout from the crisis?  \n \n[Slide 2]  \n \nMy comments today will focus on the forecl osure and REO problem in my region – New \nEngland.  In particular, I want to ask how best to understand the problem: Is it a housing \nproblem that affects all communities similarly?  Or is it a foreclosure and REO problem that affects all communities in a similar way?  Or is  the problem better understood as a crisis that \nis reflected differently in each community, and t hus requires solutions that are very likely to \ndiffer, across communities?    \nI’ll just take a moment to preview my remarks.  I will first show that New England locations, \ndefined by zip codes, with a high concentration of REO properties have (not surprisingly) incurred larger declines in home prices than zip codes with lower REO concentrations.  I will \nthen highlight that many of these same communities were areas that faced challenges even before the foreclosure crisis – challenges that made these communities more likely to suffer disproportionately the cons equences of the crisis.\n1    \n I will then touch briefly on research and policy implications.  In particular, do we need more \nholistic approaches to addressing this crisis?  Should there be more state and federal revenue \nsharing focused on providing flexible funds to th e communities most affected?   My answer to \nboth of these questions is a yes.  But I would also argue that we need to not only explore \nalternative solutions, but also do a much better job of establishing which solutions work – and then try to replicate effective solutions on a larger scale. \n 2\n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL Thursday, September 2, 2010 at 9:20 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY \n \nHow Should the Foreclosure Problem Be Framed?  \n \n[Slide 3]  \n \nFinding the right solution require s asking the right question.   So I want to begin by asking, \nwhat is the question we are trying to answer?    To that end I suggest we do a little exercise.  We might gain some insight into how the \nattendees at this conference are framing the question by looking at the non-profit organizations on the program.  What is their key focus?  If we assume the name of an organization was chosen to indicate its central  mission, by noting the keyword in the name we \nmay learn something about their primary focus.  On the agenda for this conference, five non-\nprofit organizations have “community” or “neighborhood” in their names; two have \n“housing”; and one has “foreclos ure” or “REO.”  Most of you are no doubt focusing on rising \nforeclosures and REO properties, but it seem s that you see these through the “lens” of \ncommunity.  However, it is less clear that public policies have been similarly aligned. \n \n[Slide 4]  \n \nTo help illustrate why the framing of a problem is important, we should consider what the focus might be if we assume different primary objectives.   \n \n• If one looks at the problem as primarily a foreclosure and REO problem rooted in the \nhousing bubble, the solutions will tend to emphasize mitigating the foreclosure problem or accelerating the disposition of REO properties.  Some will also advocate \nfor a reconsideration of the legal system’s approach to personal bankruptcy and foreclosure.  \n \n \n• If, instead, one views the problem as being primarily a housing problem, you might address the problem differently.  You might focus on solutions that result in \nsustainable home ownership.  For exam ple, what should be the minimum down \n 3\n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL Thursday, September 2, 2010 at 9:20 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY \n \npayment on a house, and what financing appr oaches would results in sustainable home \nownership?  The solutions to this sort of a problem might be focusing on financial \neducation, addressing predatory home fi nancing, and redefining appropriate \nunderwriting standards.  The availability of  affordable rental housing might also be a \nfocus.   \n \n• If the problem is seen through the lens of community, however, foreclosure may be \nviewed as a symptom of broader problems  affecting neighborhoods – such as high \nconcentrations of unemployment, elevated cr ime rates, and poor code enforcement.  \nLet me be clear; I am not saying that “the community is the problem,” but rather that, \nin this view, different communities will e xperience problems differently because of \ntheir different characteristics,  requiring different solutions  in many cases.  The public \npolicy solution for this problem may be to have more general revenues available for \nnon-profits and local governments to addre ss the problem in a more holistic fashion.  \n \n[Slide 5]  \n \nClearly there are elements of a ll three in the current crisis.  This is a foreclosure problem.  \nThis is a housing problem.  This is a community  problem.  However, as I just illustrated, the \nsolutions may be somewhat different, depending on how one frames the problem.  So, we should ask, do we have the right balance as we th ink about the best way to address a serious – \nand I would argue multifaceted – public policy problem ?  My own view is th at too little focus \nhas been on community problems because the focus has been more targeted to housing and foreclosures.  \n  \n 4\n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL Thursday, September 2, 2010 at 9:20 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY \n \nEvidence from New England  \n \n[Slide 6]  \n \nAs we consider these questions, I’d like to share with you some evid ence from New England \n– and in particular Greater Boston.  \n[Slide 7]  \n \nThe first chart provides REO per square mile in three New England states by zip code and compares that with the change in the medi an housing sales price from 2005 to 2008 for the \nsame zip code.  As you can see in the chart, in  areas with a lower con centration of REO there \nis not a strong correlation with changes in median  sales price.  However, as the concentration \nof REO increases there is a much stronger corr elation with median sales price change.  Zip \ncodes with higher concentrations of REO tend to have seen larger declines in median sales \nprice.  Let me be quick to acknowledge the open questio n of causality.  We ar e doing more statistical \nwork to try to understand the causality in th e REO-concentration and house-price relationship.  \nThat work needs to also control for factors such as population density.   \n \n[Slide 8]  \n \nThe next figure highlights that high concentrations of REO are not the only problem afflicting \nthose communities.  Zip codes with four or mo re REOs per square mile also have higher \nproperty crime rates, higher rates of low birth- weight babies, higher unemployment rates, and \nweaker small business activity.  Note that all th ese charts are for the time period that generally \nprecedes the foreclosure crisis, so these communities were already challenged.   \n  \n 5\n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL Thursday, September 2, 2010 at 9:20 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY \n \n[Slide 9]  \n \nIndeed, the next figure highlight s that children in these comm unities were being impacted \neven before the dramatic increase in foreclos ures.  Communities that would eventually have \nfour or more REO properties per square mile had higher high school drop -out rates and higher \nfailures in statewide math tests.    It is hard to imagine that dramatic increases in foreclosure rates woul d not exacerbate these \nproblems.  A foreclosure is likely to mean not  only a loss of home, but  also a disruption in \nwhere, or whether, kids are in school.  Since foreclosure is often related to unemployment, \nmarital stress, or physical ailments, the foreclos ure is likely to make it difficult for even the \nmost determined student to excel.  The impact of the foreclosure crisis on children is something we are trying to bett er understand at the Boston Fed. \n The bottom chart on slide 9 highlights that thes e communities have a large gap between their \nmunicipal service needs and thei r ability to raise revenues to pay for those needs (…the so-\ncalled “fiscal gap”).  A recent study at the Bo ston Fed highlights that non-school revenue \nsharing in Massachusetts is not well aligned with communities’ fiscal gaps.\n2  Changes in \nrevenue sharing are critic al to helping those communities address their problems.  Potentially, \na federal revenue sharing program at the na tional level that focuses on these communities \ncould help.  These funds could be provided in a flexible way so they could target those areas \nof most importance – since loca l governments may be in a bette r position to determine if the \nfunds should be directed to more teachers, mo re code enforcement, more police, or more \nassistance to non-profit organizations that ar e making a difference in their communities. \n \n[Slide 10]  \n \nNow, since a picture is worth a thousand word s, I would like to show you some maps that \ndemonstrate how clusters of REO are associat ed with a host of othe r community problems. \n \n 6\n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL Thursday, September 2, 2010 at 9:20 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY \n \nThe next five figures [Slides 11, 12, 13, 14, 15]  show the community pa tterns in the data.  \nThose communities with very high REO per squa re mile also fare poorly in many other \ndimensions.  Many communities are performing poor ly in all the criteria illustrated in the \nfigures.  If these are community problems, we may need to search for community solutions. \n \nImplications for Research and Policy  \n  \n[Slide 16]  \n \nThe patterns in these data imply a need for more  holistic approaches to the problem.  This is \nnot a one-size-fits-all foreclos ure or housing problem; these are community problems.  Of \ncourse, I am showing you examples from Ne w England and one needs to examine how \nsimilar or dissimilar the patte rns are in other regions.   \n But it seems, in sum, that communities with some of these challenging attributes are likely to experience higher rates of foreclosure and RE O.  And the same communities experience \ngreater hardships in th e face of rising foreclosures and REO.   \n \nRather than treating the symp tom – the high REO problem – we need to better understand \nhow to resolve the more general problems in co mmunities that lead to higher concentrations \nof REOs and exacerbate the eff ects of high REOs.  However, the challenge of finding holistic \nsolutions is significant,  and longstanding.   \n \nI am encouraging Boston Fed staff to work to better understand how foreclosures and REO \ncan exacerbate problems in troubled communities – and to look for data that can better determine which solutions work, under which ci rcumstances.

While not \nresponsible for the foreclosure problem, childre n may be affected by its consequences for \nyears to come, if it prevents them from meeting their potential in school and eventually in the \nlabor force. \n \n[Slide 17]  \n \nWhile more research needs to be done on the communities, and on which solutions work, we should also reflect on how we ar e spending our public policy dolla rs.  Are they appropriately \nbalanced to the problems of housing, foreclosure, and community need?  If a more holistic approach is needed, states and the federal government may need to examine the most effective \nand efficient way to address the broader problems in these communities, including potentially looking at revenue sharing that provides a flex ible way to address the fiscal gap faced by \nmany of our hard-pressed communities.   Thank you.

Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY * \n \n 1 \n \n \nHow Should Monetary Policy \nRespond to a Slow Recovery? \n \n \nEric S. Rosengren \nPresident & Chief Executive Officer \nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston \n \n \nThe Forecasters Club of New York \nSeptember 29, 2010 \n \n \n \n \nThank you for the opportunity to speak w ith you today at the Forecaster’s Club.*  \nWorking at the Fed over the last 25 years has given me a healthy regard for the challenges \nyou face every day as you attempt to divine the future path of the economy.  Even during the \nbest of times it is not easy, but this has been a particularly challenging time in forecasting.  It \nhas proven to be very difficult to  incorporate the effects of the financial  system into models of \nthe economy – in part because the financial sect or may have a significant impact on economic \nforecasts only during the rare occasions when the sector is badly disrupted.  \nWhile financial markets and financial instituti ons are now in far better shape than two \nyears ago, the collateral damage  on the economy from the financial shocks has been severe.  \n                                                 \n \n* Of course, the views I express today are my own, not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Board \nof Governors or the Federal Open  Market Committee (the FOMC). \n\n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, September 29, 2010 at 1:15 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY * \n \n 2The damage has, unfortunately, followed the patte rn established in the aftermath of previous \nsignificant financial disruptions, which tend to cause an extended period of subpar economic \ngrowth.1 \n  These days, as in past recoveries, it is not uncommon to hear some observers say that \nthere is little that policymakers can or should do .  This is not my perspective, and I want to \nuse this opportunity to share some of the analytical and empirical underpinnings for my \nviews. \nWhile these topics are getting a lot of atten tion of late – understandably – many of us \nhave been researching them for so me time.  And I would just like  to reiterate that I take an \nempirical, data-driven approach to policymaking responsibilities – a fact I believe my talk \ntoday will demonstrate. \nWhile certainly the economic problems we are facing are daunting, I do not see them \nas insurmountable.  In fact, although the economy is  far from where we would like it to be, we \nare in a far better place than we were two y ears ago, when financial markets and economic \nactivity were in the process of “seizing up.”  Th e stock market is well off its lows, interest \nspreads have narrowed, and the economy has had four quarters of positive, if anemic, growth.   \nAnd it was policy – monetary policy and fis cal policy, and to some degree supervisory \npolicy – that played a critical role in the impr ovements we have seen over the past two years.  \nWe have a long way to go, but it would have be en much longer but for a number of parties \nmaking difficult but appropr iate policy decisions.   \nHowever, while we have seen positive growth  over the past year, it has been slow.  \nWe have seen some increases in employment, but there has not been any significant reduction \nin the high percentage of workers who ar e unemployed.  And, while financial market \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, September 29, 2010 at 1:15 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY * \n \n 3conditions have improved dramatically, cred it availability remains an issue for many \nindividuals and businesses.  In short,  policymaking has been effective at stabilizing  the \neconomy, but the recovery remains far too weak to restore what we consider full employment \nwith the speed I would like to see.   \nToday I would like to touch on a number of issues, including some of the recently \nhypothesized impediments to a more robust recove ry.  I would also like to explore some of \nthe options for generating a more robust reco very – options that policymakers need to \nconsider and debate, thoughtfully and analytically, as we go forward.    \nAllow me to preview my punch line.  I’ve called this talk “How Should Monetary \nPolicy Respond to a Slow Recovery?”  My answer  to that question is: vigorously, creatively, \nthoughtfully, and persistently, as long as we  have options at our  disposal.  And we do have \noptions, despite having pushed short-te rm rates to the zero lower bound.   \n \nDislocations in the Labor Market? \nSome hypothesize that a more r obust recovery is impeded by dislocations in the labor \nmarket.  Indeed, history shows that even w ith a relatively mild recession there can be \nsignificant dislocations.  The 2001 rece ssion provides a good example.  As Figure 1  shows, \ninformation technology and manufacturing were two industries that saw significant declines \nin employment in that downturn.  The end of the “dot-com” euphoria and structural shifts in \nthe manufacturing sector caused those two industr ies to be disproportionately affected, while \nwe had only modest declines in the cyclical construction industry, and increases  in \nemployment in several industries.  Similarl y, the 1990 recession had a decline in employment \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, September 29, 2010 at 1:15 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY * \n \n 4of more than 5 percent in onl y the construction industry, when overbuilding in several regions \nof the country led to a signif icant readjustment in constr uction-industry employment.   \nIn fact, in each of the three previous reces sions there was a decline of 5 percent or \nmore in no more than two industry categories – as the figure shows – with many industries \nexperiencing little or no net j ob loss over the course of the rece ssion.  Structural shifts across \nindustries are not uncommon in recessions – a nd also, some structur al dislocation seems \ninevitable as it will always take some time fo r capital and labor to flow to those industries \nwith the greatest opportunities.  In rather stark contrast, the most recent re cession is far less a re flection of dislocation \nin a few industries but rather reflects a general decline in almost all  industries.  As the chart \non the far right shows, in this recession there has been a peak to trough loss of employment of \n5 percent or greater in co nstruction, manufacturing, reta il trade, wholesale trade, \ntransportation, information technology, financia l activities, and professional and business \nservices.  To me, this does not suggest that th e driver is structural change in the economy \nincreasing job mismatches – although no doubt some of that exists – but instead I see here a \nwidespread decline in demand across most industries.   \nNot surprisingly, given this far-reaching d ecline in labor demand, job vacancies are \nremarkably low.  Not only are they low, but th ey are also well below the experience in most \nrecent recessions, making small movements in j ob-vacancy rates particularly difficult to \ninterpret.  For example, economists and forecas ters are estimating Beve ridge curves (plotting \nthe relationship between job vacancies and unemployment)\n2 well outside historical \nexperience, making it difficult to draw strong conclusions about recent movements.   \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, September 29, 2010 at 1:15 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY * \n \n 5 Figure 2  highlights that job mismatches are not the primary problem.  The bottom \nchart shows that the percentage of  small businesses with one or more hard-to-fill jobs open is \nnear the low point for the series over nearly 25 years.  According to survey data, businesses \nare having no problem finding skilled workers for what were considered hard-to-fill \nvacancies.  This is consistent with my ongoing di scussions with representatives of businesses, \nwho generally report no difficulty finding quali fied workers even for quite specialized \npositions.   \nHowever, as the top chart on the figure  shows, most small businesses are not \nexpecting to increase employment.  When I ta lk with representative s of businesses, the \nprimary reason they give for this  is they are not seeing suffici ent demand for their products.  \nIf they were confident that demand would pi ck up, they would – and easily could – hire \nadditional workers. \n \nBalance Sheet Adjustments? \n Another impediment to a more robust recovery could well be balance sheet \nadjustments by financial and nonfinancial firm s, and households.  To  explore this, let’s \nexamine this cycle in some more detail.  Figure 3  splits the time since the onset of the \nrecession into three periods:   \n• The first period runs from the beginn ing of the recession in December 2007 \nthrough August 2008.  Up to that point, the recession looked quite similar in depth \nand duration to previous recessions.  Th e only sector with a very substantial \ndecline in employment was th e construction industry.   \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, September 29, 2010 at 1:15 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY * \n \n 6• The second period is from August 2008 through June 2009.  After the large \nfinancial shocks that occu rred in September and Octobe r of 2008, there were large \nand widespread declines in employment ac ross a wide variety of industries.  Both \nthe disruption of credit and concerns that we could see an extremely severe \ncontraction caused most businesses to become far more cautious.   \n• The final period, from June 2009 to the presen t, encompasses the recovery to date.  \nThis recovery has been quite slow, with continued sharp declines in construction \nactivity.  In fact, the first y ear of the recovery has an em ployment pattern similar to \nshallow recessions, indicating just how w eak the recovery has been so far. \n Most forecasts of employment and unemploym ent during this period did not anticipate \nthe severe turn of events.  Figure 4  provides the Blue Chip for ecast for unemployment at the \nbeginning of the first two periods in the charts  we just saw – and the actual unemployment \nexperience.  In December 2007, few saw cause fo r great alarm.  The expectation was that \nunemployment would remain stable near 5 percent, when in fact what actually happened was \na marked increase in the unemployment rate.   \nIn part, the forecasts were off because ma ny of the financial disruptions that were \nalready evident were not well captured in econometric models.  Also, recessions are \nnotoriously difficult to predict, and most models struggle to cap ture turning points. \nThe second chart on Figure 4 shows that even in August 2008, many forecasts did not \npredict great difficulties.  For the most part, th e unemployment rate was expected to remain \nnear 6 percent, when in reality it rose to over 9 percent.  Thus, one month before the worst of \nthe financial crisis emerged, there was little expe ctation of a significant financial shock or the \nmajor impact that it would ha ve on the overall economy.   \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, September 29, 2010 at 1:15 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY * \n \n 7Fortunately, the Federal Reserve had alrea dy begun to ease – and continued to ease \nquite dramatically – despite most forecasts predicting a more benign outcome.  We had already reduced the federal funds  rate very substantially by A ugust, and as a result of the \nfinancial crisis eventually pushed the federal f unds rate essentially to its lower bound of zero.  \nThus, during much of this period monetary po licy was quite proactive.  While it could not \noffset the effects of the severe problems emer ging in the economy, the policy stance was more \nresponsive than if it had been in synch with most private forecasts at the time.  This \npolicymaking was key to avoiding far worse outcomes.   \nFigure 5  looks at the forecasts for unemployment at the end of this year over the span \nof time I referred to as the recovery  period.  At the beginning of 2010, the unemployment rate \nwas 9.7 percent.  As the figure shows, there ha s been a consistent vi ew that the recovery \nwould be weak and make only limited progre ss on reducing unemploy ment.  While through \nApril the forecasts were getting more optimis tic about labor market trends, since then \nforecasters have been raising  their forecasts for unemployment.  Regrettably, I have to concur \nwith the view expressed in these forecasts – th at the unemployment rate is likely to be very \nclose to the very elevated level at the beginning of the year.   \nFigure 6  provides some context for that pessi mism.  While two of the past four \nquarters had growth (in blue) above estimates of potential, the expans ion in what we call \n“final sales” (in red) has been below potenti al.  Since by definition the difference between \nGDP and final sales reflects inventories, we need final sales to pick up – especially as \ntemporary stimulus from inventories, and governme nt, subsides.  Unfortunately, there is little \nevidence in the data of that ha ppening, with growth in the sec ond half of 2010 likely to be in \nthe vicinity of 2 percent.   \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, September 29, 2010 at 1:15 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY * \n \n 8The bottom graph on Figure 6 shows the ch ange in the employment-to-population \nratio (in green).  While there was employment growth in the first half of 2010, it has only resulted in a slight improvement in the employment-to-population ratio. \nWith that background, let me note that one ch allenge in getting th e economy to grow \nfaster has been the desire of households and bus inesses to essentially “rebuild” their balance \nsheets in the wake of this so-called “Great Recession.”  Figure 7  highlights that the personal \nsavings rate has risen, and Figure 8  shows that households have  increased their holdings of \ncash and securities.  While rebuilding wealth a nd remaining more liquid are natural reactions \nto recent conditions – and positive in a long-te rm sense – the fact is they portend rather \nmodest increases in consumption in the near term, until consumers become more confident about their prospects.   \nFigure 9 highlight that businesses an d banks have also been increasing their holdings \nof cash and securities.  While this is natural, su ch behavior will likely keep growth in business \nfixed investment rather restrained. \n \nThe Policy Response \nSo how should monetary policy react to a ve ry anemic recovery?  The usual monetary \npolicy response to slow growth in nominal GD P would be to continue  reducing the federal \nfunds rate, and during the past tw o slow recoveries that is what the Federal Reserve did.  As I \nhave already highlighted, by central bank standard s we moved rather quickly to recognize the \nseverity of the problem in this downturn, and responded with mone tary accommodation.  \nHowever, since the end of 2008 the federal funds rate has been bounded by zero, which has eliminated the ability to decrease  short-term interest rates.   \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, September 29, 2010 at 1:15 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY * \n \n 9A simple Taylor Rule calculation, shown in Figure 10,  relates movements in the \nfederal funds rate to deviations  in inflation and unemployment from their targets.  The far \nright section of the chart highlig hts that given the very low leve l of inflation and the very high \nlevel of the unemployment rate, the Fed would have continued to reduce the funds rate over \nthe past two years, but for the zero lower bound. \nConstrained by the zero bound, the Federal Re serve utilized less conventional policies \n– as shown in Figure 11.   Most of these approaches had never been tried in the United States \nprior to the crisis.  New polic ies outside of historical experience necessarily involve some \nuncertainty about their impact. We  were fortunate that Chairman Bernanke and the Federal \nOpen Market Committee had the courage to undertake unconventional policies in the “teeth” of a crisis. It is easy – and I dare sa y commonplace – to underestimate the economic \ndisruption that would likely have arisen if we  at the Fed had stuck to our ”comfort zone.” \nIt is easy with hindsight to see the financ ial meltdown as an historic economic crisis, \none that galvanized officials to push out the boundaries of policymaking and take action.  But \nin my view, current economic conditions – an unemployment rate near 10 percent, sluggish \ngrowth, and undesirably low infl ation – together constitute  a serious economic problem. \nWhile it’s clear to everyone why a high unemplo yment rate is a problem, one of the reasons \nwe worry about a too-low rate of inflation is that  the closer to zero the inflation rate gets, the \ngreater the risk it could fall into a harmful deflation.   \nAs I said earlier, we do have options, despite having pus hed short-term rates to the \nzero lower bound.  One of the ch allenges is that with unconven tional policies, costs can be \napparent but benefits more indire ct, and harder to track.     \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, September 29, 2010 at 1:15 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY * \n \n 10The Federal Reserve’s large-scale asset purch ases – primarily purchases of mortgage-\nbacked securities – arguably had multiple effects, including maintaining market function in the mortgage markets. But in my view thei r primary impact on the economy was achieved by \nreducing mortgage rates. Rates had been around 6 percent prior to the change in policy, and \nmoved closer to 5 percent as our purc hases began to accumulate, as shown in Figure 12 .  It \nalso appears that by “removing duration” from the market, other long-term rates were also \nreduced in response to our purchases.   \nOf course, none of this is easy or without  complications.  There are concerns about \nthings like creating distortions  in credit allocation, complicating exit strategies when they \nbecome appropriate, and exposing the Federal Rese rve to interest-rate ri sk.  Those issues are \nimportant to recognize, and to work to mitigate.  At the same time, we cannot take lightly how \nfar off the mark unemployment and inflation seem to be. \nNow I’d like to make a few observations on Fed purchases of Treasury  securities.  \nFirst, the positives: Purchases of long-term Treasury securities are likely to push down \nlong-term interest rates on Treasury bonds, but also are likely to re duce rates on other long-\nterm securities. Some have argued that it woul d be difficult to reduce Treasury rates further, \nbut Figure 13  highlights, importantly, that U.S. Treas ury rates are still well above the zero \nbound, roughly equivalent to rates in Germany, a nd well above long-term rates in Japan.   \nNow some concerns: While purchases of Treas ury securities have the advantage of not \ndirectly “allocating credit” to  a particular industry, they have the disadvantage of only \nindirectly affecting the private  borrowing rates that more direc tly affect private investment \nspending.  In addition, Treasury pu rchases raise for some a con cern that the Fed intends to \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, September 29, 2010 at 1:15 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY * \n \n 11monetize the federal debt, using monetary policy to accommodate the financing of fiscal \npolicy.  I can assure you that we have no de sire or intention whatsoever to do so.   \nWhile lower long-term rates are likely the primary channel through which asset \npurchases would influence the economy, purchases  of Treasury or mortgage-backed securities \nalso expand the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet  and increase the amount of reserves in the \nfinancial system.  This expansion of reserves mi ght serve as an effective signal that highlights \nthe determination of the Federal Reserve to reduce disinflationa ry pressures.   \nCertainly, views on securities purchases di ffer within the ranks of policymakers and \nall manner of observers. I would just reiterate th at it is important to keep firmly in mind the \ngoal of such purchases: to stimulate the econom y by reducing long-term interest rates to a \nlevel that is more consistent with where they  would be, were we able to further reduce the \nfederal funds rate. \n \nConcluding Observations \nWhile the economy is growing, it is curren tly growing too slowly to significantly \nreduce the unemployment rate or stem disinfla tionary pressures created by the high degree of \nslack in the economy.  While fiscal policies may be the most effective way to stimulate the \neconomy when short-term interest rate s approach the zero  bound, unconventional monetary  \npolicies provide additional policy options. Of c ourse, policymakers need to carefully weigh \nthe benefits and costs of unconventional moneta ry policy – some of which I have tried to \nshare with you today.  Yet all in all, my firm view is that it is  important that policymakers be \nopen to implementing policies consistent with achieving full employment, and an appropriate \nlevel of inflation, within a r easonable time frame.  Thank you. \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, September 29, 2010 at 1:15 P.M.

            "content": "1 \n \n \nDividend Policy and Capital Retention: A \nSystemic “First Response”  \n \n \nEric S. Rosengren \nPresident & Chief Executive Officer \nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston \n \n \n“Rethinking Central Banking” Conference \nWashington, D.C. \nOctober 10, 2010 \n \n \n \n[Slide 1] \n \n Thank you for inviting me to offer a few observations on some design and implementation issues we all face with rega rd to macroprudential supervisory policies.\n*   \nPerhaps a positive offshoot of the recent severe financial crisis is that it has galvanized \npolicymakers to expedite work  on macroprudential s upervision and regula tion.  The sense of \nurgency has helped regulators make significant progress on increasing bank capital buffers and \nhas sharpened the focus on liquidity risk.  Thes e efforts are important, and should improve the \nstrength and resiliency of the financial system when fully implemented. \n \n  \n                                                             \n \n* Of course, the views I express today are my own, not  necessarily those of my colleagues on the Board of \nGovernors or the Federal Open Market Committee (the FOMC). \n\n\n 2[Slide 2] \n  \nOver the last year I have sometimes made a comparison between new and needed \nfinancial regulations and the regula tions developed in the 1800s to prevent the “great fires” that \nhad plagued many major cities.  One thing that gr eatly reduced the risk of such fires was the \ndevelopment and enforcement of tough new buildi ng codes.  This meant using building materials \nthat were less flammable, and ra ising structures that made it far less likely that a building would \ncatch fire – or that would suppress the spread  of a fire, should it nonetheless occur.  In many \nrespects I see enhanced capital a nd liquidity rules as e quivalent changes in our financial system, \nwhich should make financial institutions far le ss susceptible to “fin ancial firestorms.” \n Another aspect of the soluti on to great fires was the move  to hiring professional fire \nfighters with adequate equipment and sufficient access to water to quickly respond  to a fire.  This \nreduced the risk that if a fi re occurred, it would spread in some catastrophic way.   \nThe importance of response time is highlighted  in the questions that get asked when you \ntake out fire insurance on your hous e.  They ask how close you are to the nearest fire station, and \nhow close you are to a fire hydran t.  The questions are important because the answers impact the \nextent of the damage a fire can cause.  They al so impact the likelihood that  a fire at a neighbor’s \nhouse could spread and impact your home. \n Response time is also critically important in  financial regulation a nd in limiting financial \ndamage.  Today I am going to briefly discuss one type of financial “first  response” – the ability \nto retain capital in the banking system by cutting bank dividends when problems first emerge.   \nGiven the evidence in the data, I will highlight the fact that in relation to dividends, bank \nmanagement and supervisors responded quite slow ly in the United States during the financial \ncrisis.  I will suggest that macroprudential supervision shoul d include early detection of \nproblems, and in a troubled banking system th e reduction of dividends  to retain capital. \n \n  \n\n 3The Timing of Dividend Reductions \n \n[Slide 3] \n  \nFigure 1  shows that in August 2007, as the fi nancial crisis emerged, banks became \nwilling to lend to each other at one-month maturity only at rates dramatically different from the \nprevious year.  While the increase in August 2007 looks a bit less spectacular than the spike that \nfollowed the events of the fall of 2008, it was nonetheless a dramatic change.  The economic \nimplications of emerging financial problems contri buted to the significant  response in monetary \npolicy. \n [Slide 4]  But as Figure 2  highlights, the 2007 events did not l ead to similarly significant changes \nin supervisory  policy.  The dividends on common stock declared by the largest banking \norganizations (the 19 SCAP\ni participants and others) actually increased in the fourth quarter of \n2007, and did not show dramatic reductions until af ter the financial crisis hit a crescendo in the \nfall of 2008. \n \n[Slide 5] \n   \nFigure 3  puts in perspective the cumulative cash dividends of the largest banks by \ncomparing them to the Capital Purcha se Program (CPP) funds they received. \n [Slide 6]  This suggests that if dividends had been ha lted at the SCAP banks once the LIBOR rate \nrose, nearly $80 billion would have been retained as capital.  This repres ents close to 50 percent \nof the CPP funds used to recap italize these banks in the fall  of 2008.  Clearly a proactive \napproach to dividend retention could have substantially reduced the need for an emergency \ninfusion of public funds. \n\n 4Financial Indicators of Emerging Problems \n \n Regulatory dividend policy was focused on the ability of banks to pay dividends out of \nearnings.  However, earnings declines occurred later than the financial market responses to \nemerging problems.  In addition, banks’ management and boards of directors rarely are proactive \nin reducing dividends, because of concerns that it will signal that they are experiencing more \nsevere financial problems than their peers.  W ith earnings somewhat slow  to react to emerging \nproblems, and boards reluctant to signal problems, most of the large banks were very slow to \nreact to the crisis w ith reduced dividends. \n [Slide 7] \n  \nSimilarly, banks’ supervisory ratings were  also slow to react, as shown in Figure 4 .  The \nmeasure of the share of assets  in so-called “problem” banks\nii – the blue line – responds only with \na delay.  A similar pattern emerges if one looks at the percentage of ba nk assets in the three \nlowest supervisory ratings (CAMELS ratings of  3, 4, or 5), although it captures a much higher \npercentage of total bank assets.  In contrast, the credit default sw ap spread for the four largest \nU.S. banking organizations – the green line – began to climb in the fall of 2007 and continued to \nclimb throughout 2008 and into 2009.  I should note th at we use the four largest banks simply \nbecause of the availability of hi storical credit default swap data, but our modeling suggests this is \nrepresentative for the larg est banks more generally. \n [Slide 8] \n \nFigure 5  shows that a similar pattern emerges if one uses the market capitalization \nrelative to assets of the four  largest banking organizations.\niii  Like the credit default swaps, the \nmeasure (the green line) began to decline si gnificantly in the fall of 2007 and continued to \ndecline through 2008 and into 2009.  Again this fina ncial indicator of bank health moved far \nmore quickly than regulatory ratings (s ee the blue line) or dividend reductions. \n  \n\n 5[Slide 9] \n  \nFigure 6  highlights another issue – that as fi nancial markets took a bleaker view of \nbanks’ financial prospects (in th e top chart), banks had begun to tighten credit standards (in the \nbottom chart).  By the end of 2007, credit standards had tightened substantially, relative to where \nthey were in the beginning of th at year.  Banks seek to mainta in reasonable capital-to-assets \nratios and loans are, of course, assets for banks .  If capital is eventually reduced due to loan \nwrite-downs, and banks reduce lending to main tain capital-to-asset ratios, the “collateral \ndamage” to those who would like to borrow from  “supply-constrained” banking institutions can \nimpose a significant cost to the economy more broadly.  So the impact of only slowly reducing \ndividends, rather than retaining capital in the banking system, extends well beyond losses to \nstockholders and poten tially taxpayers.   \n \nPolicy Implications \n \n[Slide 10] \n  \nEven from the perspective of micro prudential supervision, mo re proactive dividend \nreduction would have ameliorated some of the cost s of the financial crisis .  Rather than basing \nregulatory dividend policy on accounting constructs that tend to be slow moving and backward \nlooking, regulatory policy should pr ompt supervisors to look forwar d and thus more proactively \nseek reductions in dividends in appropriate ci rcumstances.  In particular, given the financial-\nmarket signals of impending problems that I have  highlighted today, I believe that supervisors \nneed in such circumstances to be more proac tive in seeking capital retention through reduced \ndividends at banki ng organizations. \n [Slide 11] \n  \nOf course, signaling problems can make it di fficult for supervisors to mandate reductions \nat individual institutions.  When  a wide variety of indicators suggest potential problems in the \nbanking sector, signaling problems c ould be avoided if, hypothetically, all banks were required \n\n 6to reduce dividends – or all banks with outsized exposures .  For example, banks with large real \nestate exposures in loans and secu rities could in such a situation be required to reduce dividends \nbefore accounting losses were realized.  Such a policy might very well reduce the credit-availability problems that have  unfortunately been a hallmark  of this financial crisis. \n In retrospect, empirical analysis suggests that bank management and supervisors had an \nopportunity to retain capital once problems became identifiable, but before the full extent of the \ncrisis emerged in the fall of 2008.  In the spir it of learning and appl ying lessons, one must \nconsider whether this dynamic c ould repeat itself – or indeed is repeating itself.   For example, in \nsome parts of the world today, sovereign risk ex posure seems problematic and elevated credit \ndefault swaps and low stock market valuations have not prevented some banks from continuing \nto pay dividends.   \nIn sum, I suggest that more aggressive policy may not only reduce potential taxpayer \nexposure to the banking sector, but also insulate  the broader economy from the sorts of loan-\nsupply shocks that can provide significan t headwinds to an economic recovery. \n Thank you.  \n                                                             \nNOTES: \n \ni Supervisory Capital Assessment Program \n \nii Problem banks, as defined by the FDIC, are banks with a CAMELS rating of 4 or 5.  The FDIC publishes the \naggregate number and assets of  problem banks each quarter. \n \niii Again, we use the four largest banks si mply because of the availability of hist orical credit default swap data used \nin Figure 4, the companion chart to Figure 5. But the find ing is representative for the largest banks more generally.  \n\nPotential Early Response\nAnalogy to fire insurance\nHow close are you to fire station?\nHow close are you to a fire hydrant?\nResponse time matters – to homeowner but \nalso to the neighborhood\nDividend policy\nHow quickly did bank management and supervisors respond to the crisis?\n\nFigure 1\nSpread:  One-Month London Interbank Offered  \nRate (LIBOR) to Overnight Index Swap (OIS) Rate\nJanuary 2005 - September 2010\nSource:  Financial Times, Bloomberg / Haver Analytics050100150200250300\nJan-2005 Jul-2005 Jan-2006 Jul-2006 Jan-2007 Jul-2007 Jan-2008 Jul-2008 Jan-2009 Jul-2009 Jan-2010 Jul-2010Basis Points\n\n\rFigure 2 \nCash Dividends Declared on Common Stock \nby Largest Banking Organizations\n2007:Q3 - 2010:Q1\nSource:  Company Financial Statements, BloombergNote:  Includes the 19 Supervisory Capital Assessment Program  (SCAP) Participants and Wachovia and Washington Mutual  0246810121416\n2007:Q3 2007:Q4 2008:Q1 2008:Q2 2008:Q3 2008:Q4 2009:Q1 2009:Q2 2009:Q3 2009:Q4 2010:Q1Billions of Dollars\n\n\rFigure 3 \nCumulative Cash Dividends and Capital Purchase \nProgram Funds Received\n2007:Q3 - 2010:Q1\nSource:  Company Financial Statements, Bloomberg, US TreasuryNote:  Includes the 19 Supervisory Capital Assessment Program  (SCAP) Participants and Wachovia and Washington Mutual  020406080100120140160180\n2007:Q3 2007:Q4 2008:Q1 2008:Q2 2008:Q3 2008:Q4 2009:Q1 2009:Q2 2009:Q3 2009:Q4 2010:Q1 CPP Funds ReceivedBillions of Dollars\nCumulative Cash Dividends on Common StockCPP Funds Received\n\nObservations\nIf dividends had been stopped at the SCAP \nbanks once the LIBOR rate rose, nearly $80 billion would have been retained\nThis was close to 50% of the CPP funds used to recapitalize these banks in the fall  of 2008\nPro-active dividend retention strategies could have substantially reduced the need for public funds\n\nFigure 4\nAverage of CDS Spreads of Four Largest Banking \nOrganizations and Share of Assets in Problem Banks \n2005:Q1 - 2010:Q2\nSource:  Bloomberg, FDIC050100150200250300\n0.00.61.21.82.43.03.605:Q1 05:Q3 06:Q1 06:Q3 07:Q1 07:Q3 08:Q1 08:Q3 09:Q1 09:Q3 10:Q1Percent of Bank Assets Basis Points\nShare of Assets in \nProblem Banks \n(Left Scale)CDS Spread (Right Scale)\nThe CAMELS rating is a highly  confidential  supervisory  rating which assesses  six components  of a bank's condition:   capital \nadequacy  (C), asset quality (A), management  (M), earnings (E), liquidity (L), and sensitivity  to market  risk (S).  Ratings are assigned \nfor each of the six components  in addition to an overall rating.  The ratings ar e  assigned on a scale of 1 (strongest)  to 5 (weakest).\nProblem Banks are banks with a CAMELS rating of 4 or 5.\n\nFigure 5\nMarket Capitalization/Assets of Four Largest Banking \nOrganizations and Share of Assets in Problem Banks\n2005:Q1 - 2010:Q2\nSource:  Bloomberg, FDIC0369121518\n0.00.61.21.82.43.03.6\n05:Q1 05:Q3 06:Q1 06:Q3 07:Q1 07:Q3 08:Q1 08:Q3 09:Q1 09:Q3 10:Q1Percent of Bank Assets Percent\nShare of Assets in Problem \nBanks (Left Scale)Market Capitalization/Assets  (Right Scale)\nThe CAMELS rating is a highly  confidential  supervisory  rating which assesses  six components  of a bank's condition:   capital \nadequacy  (C), asset quality (A), management  (M), earnings (E), liquidity (L), and sensitivity  to market  risk (S).  Ratings are assigned \nfor each of the six components  in addition to an overall rating.  The ratings ar e  assigned on a scale of 1 (strongest)  to 5 (weakest).\nProblem Banks are banks with a CAMELS rating of 4 or 5.\n\nFigure 6\nCDS Spreads, Share of Assets in Problem \nBanks, and Changes in Loan Standards\n2005:Q1 -2010:Q2\nSource:  Bloomberg, FDIC, Federal Reserve Board050100150200250300\n0.00.61.21.82.43.03.6\n05:Q1 05:Q3 06:Q1 06:Q3 07:Q1 07:Q3 08:Q1 08:Q3 09:Q1 09:Q3 10:Q1Percent of Bank Assets Basis Points\nShare of Assets in \nProblem BanksAverage of CDS Spreads of Four Largest Banking \nOrganizations (Right Scale)\n-250255075100\n05:Q1 05:Q3 06:Q1 06:Q3 07:Q1 07:Q3 08:Q1 08:Q3 09:Q1 09:Q3 10:Q1Net Percentage of Banks Tightening Loan Standards\nC&I Loans to Large and \nMedium-Sized FirmsCommercial Real Estate Loans\n\nMicroprudential Questions\nShould dividend reductions be required \nearlier?\nShould forward-looking financial variables be more readily used?\nWhat is the appropriate time to remove dividend restrictions?\n\nMacroprudential Questions\nShould dividends be reduced for entire \nindustry when credit availability for economy is reduced?\nShould banks with a concentration in troubled assets be required to reduce dividends, before losses are realized?\nUS real estate loan and securities exposure\nCertain problem areas -- sovereign risk \nexposures",

As has been \nmentioned already, this is in some sense a retrospective.  The first conference on monetary \npolicy in a low inflation environment was held in  Vermont in October of 1999.  I would note that \nseveral speakers we will hear from today also provided comments at that gathering 10 years ago, \nand I am pleased to have them back in New E ngland to see if a decade of relevant data has \ninfluenced their thinking on the topic.* \n                                                             \n \n* Of course, the views I express today are my own, not  necessarily those of my colleagues on the Board of \nGovernors or the Federal Open Market Committee (the FOMC). \n1 \n \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Saturday, October 16, 2010 at  8:15 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY * \n \n2 \n [Slide 2]  At that conference, Alan Blinder was on the policy panel, a place he finds \nhimself again today.  He said at the time that it was of some interest that the conference was \nbeing held at the U.S. Federal Reserve, and not  in Japan or Europe.  One might attribute the \nlocation to unusually good forecasting prowess evid enced by our Research Director, Jeff Fuhrer, \nwho was actively engaged in organizing the ea rlier conference as well as this one.   \n The earlier conference took place under very different economic circumstances.  It was \nheld in the midst of the period that I believe Ji m Stock named “the Great Moderation,” reflecting \nthe reduced volatility we were seeing in unemployment and inflation.  There was a growing \nsense of confidence that seve re business cycles had been tamed, as policymakers better \nunderstood and calibrated fiscal and monetary policy.  At the time of the conference, the \nunemployment rate was 4.1 pe rcent and the core infla tion rate was 2.1 percent.1\nDespite the propitious economic environment at the time, I will say that participants at \nthe conference said quite clearly that monetary policy in a low inflation environment would be \nquite challenging. \n[Slide 3]  Perhaps the best summary of this conc ern was provided those ten years ago by \nKazuo Ueda, who is on the policy panel again this  time.  His summary of policy when the zero \nbound was hit was that “it will be a lot more painful than you can possibly imagine.”  \nUnfortunately, his comments have been accurate and prophetic – and quoted rather prominently \nof late. \n Perhaps, as well, they were more true in Ja pan than anywhere else in the world.  At the \ntime of our first conference on th is topic, many participants were expecting the Japanese \ndeflation to be quickly eradicat ed and the country to be “on the mend.”  Now, more than a \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Saturday, October 16, 2010 at  8:15 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY * \n \ndecade later, Japan continues to combat deflation with its policy still r unning up against the zero \nlower bound. \n Other participants at the earli er conference for the most part  viewed Japan as an anomaly, \nand seemed to think that the likelihood of ot hers ending up in Japan’s predicament was quite \nlow.  Unfortunately, that probability seems to  have shifted, and we now face a world where \nJapan, Europe, and the U.S. are challenged by th e need to conduct monetary policy with short-\nterm interest rates close to zero. \nAll in all, there was some disagreement over how effective alternate policies could be, \nbut there was a sense that there was little reas on not to try them, should circumstances merit it. \n [Slide 4]   Figure 1 highlights just how different this so-called Great Recession has been.  \nThe chart shows the percent employment change from the peak of employment in post-war \nrecessions.  The scale of the job loss during this recession, shown by the black line, is sobering.   \n[Slide 5]  Another feature of this Great Recessi on involves the significant difficulties \nwithin financial institutions and financial markets, and the contri butions of those difficulties to \nthe economic downturn.  While at the earlier conference ther e was due concern about the \nbanking and financial systems, I think it fair to sa y that the role that financial institutions and \nmarkets can play in aggravating the business cycl e was not fully appreciated.  A challenge that \nremains is how best to incorporate financial market developments in our economic models, as \nmuch of the modeling only ra ther poorly captures the role of financial intermediation. \n[Slide 6]   It goes without saying that the circumstances su rrounding this conference are \nvery different than those of te n years ago.  Unfortunately at today’s conference, unlike ten years \nago, we find unemployment at 9.6 percent, core CPI inflation well below 2 percent, and short-\n3 \n \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Saturday, October 16, 2010 at  8:15 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY * \n \nterm interest rates bound by zero.  Japan is stil l fighting deflation.  So the problems faced by \npolicymakers in the United States and abroad are no longer just matters of academic debate.   \nToday I would like to briefly discuss how we should, in my opinion, interpret some of the \ndata and experience we have seen since that prior conference.  In particular, I would like to draw \nsome observations from the Japanese experience,  and from the Federal Reserve’s Large-Scale \nAsset Purchase (LSAP) Program. \n \nThe Case of Japan \n[Slide 7]   Japan is the one indus trialized country that ha s faced the zero bound and \ndeflation problem for well over a decade.  I woul d note several points we can draw from Japan’s \nbattle with deflation.   \n \n• First, while the Japanese stock market a nd real estate markets peaked in 1990, and \nwere substantially off their peak prices in  the middle of the 1990s , the core inflation \nrate remained low but definitely positive (as shown in Figure 2).  While every such \nsituation is unique, the conditions in Japan  that moved a low-inflation environment to \none of actually falling prices were moneta ry and fiscal tighten ing, and also deferring \nthe process of addressing significant problems in the financial sector.   \n • [Slide 8]   Second, it is worth noting that Japan and Europe and the United States are \nfacing substantial challenges in monetary policymaking, in part because of lingering \n4 \n \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Saturday, October 16, 2010 at  8:15 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY * \n \nfinancial problems.  Because the transmi ssion of monetary polic y occurs through the \nbanking system, impaired banking systems a nd financial markets greatly complicate \nthe conduct of monetary policy.   \n \n• Third, the fact that Japan is still battling deflation highlight s how pernicious deflation \ncan be, and how difficult it is to countera ct once it has been firmly established. \n \n[Slide 9]   It is important to note that Japan has significantly a ltered monetary and fiscal \npolicy to try to address its defl ation problems.  For fiscal polic y, as shown in Figure 3, Japan has \nmore than tripled its debt-to-GDP ratio since the early 1990s, as the government has tried to \nignite the economy with more expansionary fiscal policy.   \n[Slide 10]   Similarly, the Bank of Japan has more th an tripled the size of its balance sheet \nsince 1990, to try to combat deflat ion – as shown in Figure 4.   \n[Slide 11]  These expansionary monetary and fis cal policies no doubt prevented deflation \nfrom being a much more severe problem than it nonetheless has been.  Concerns expressed at our \nearlier conference, and many economic models, highlig hted a risk of a str ong deflationary spiral, \ngiven the significant slack in the Japanese econo my.  Thankfully, policy did prevent this severe \noutcome.  However, it was not sufficient to prevent a low but persistent degree of deflation.  This \nexperience may indicate that a gradual response  may not be as effective as a more active \nresponse to arrest deflationary pressures – before they become  embedded in thinking that can \naffect household and business spending. \n5 \n \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Saturday, October 16, 2010 at  8:15 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY * \n \nFrom a policy perspective I take several less ons from the Japanese experience.  First, \nshould deflation occur, it can be quite difficult to  overcome.  Second, insuring against the risk of \ndeflation may be much cheaper than waiting until it has occurred and then trying to address it.  \nFinally, financially fragile economies may be par ticularly vulnerable to negative impacts from \npremature austerity measures. \n \nMonetary Policy Lessons from the LSAP Program \n[Slide 12]  Now I would like to touch on some le ssons for monetary policy from the \nLSAP program.  As you know, after reaching th e zero lower bound in rate-setting and seeing \ncontinued problems in economic outcomes, the Federal Reserve made a policy decision to \npurchase large quantities of govern ment-backed securities in the s econdary market, in its Large \nScale Asset Purchase or “LSAP” program.  Because such programs are relatively new \nphenomena in the United States, it was difficult  to predict with preci sion how the economy \nwould react.2  Without good historical experience to re ly on, and because we are operating at the \nzero bound for the first time in post-war history, it is  important to use the evidence we have to \ndraw out a better understanding of LSAP  programs and related channels.   \nThere are many potential impediments to accu rately measuring the effects of the LSAP \nprogram.  First, it is difficult to isolate the im pact of the program from  other relevant changes \nsuch as shifts in fiscal policy, changes in policie s of major trading partners, or developments in \nsupervisory or regulatory policies that can have an impact on financial markets.  Second, these \nprograms have been operating when many economi c and financial variables are outside their \nnormal ranges.  Thus, the impact of the pr ogram may differ depending on economic and \nfinancial conditions prevalent duri ng their operation.  Third, to the extent that policy changes are \n6 \n \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Saturday, October 16, 2010 at  8:15 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY * \n \nanticipated, the effect of a po licy change may be difficult to measure with any degree of \ncertainty. \n[Slide 13]  Despite these challenges, many research ers have begun to evaluate the policy \nchannels that are impacted by an LSAP program.3  While there is much work to be done, and the \nsample of U.S. experience is fairly limited, a llow me to provide my own take on the evidence \nthat is currently available. \n[Slide 14]   Figure 5 shows the impact on mortgage rates of the announcements of the \nLSAP program – when it was first announced and at the March FOMC  meeting when the \nparameters of the initial program were detailed.   \nSince the initial program focu sed on purchases of mortgage securities, one might expect \nthe largest impact to be on mortgage rates.  Mortgage rates that  had been trading at 6 percent \nprior to the announcements declined to roughly 5 pe rcent.  Empirical even t studies that try to \ncorrect for possible confounding events tend to find an impact on mortgage rates in the range of \n25 to 100 basis points.  Thus, I think the empiri cal evidence supports the view that an LSAP \nprogram can influence the market rate of the asse t being purchased.  Certainly the impact may be \ninfluenced by the economic and financial c onditions at the time of the announcement and \npurchase.  The scale of the program should be sensitive to the prevaili ng conditions, and the size \nof the program would need to vary to acco mplish a particular interest rate outcome. \n[Slide 15]  An LSAP program will be most effectiv e if it not only influences the rates on \nassets being purchased, but also in fluences rates on other assets with similar characteristics.  For \nexample, purchases of mortgage securities are li kely to influence the price and yield of other \nlong-term securities that may also be held by inve stors looking for long-term assets.  As the rate \n7 \n \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Saturday, October 16, 2010 at  8:15 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY * \n \non MBS securities falls, some investors will l ook to buy these other assets, and the increased \ndemand will bid up their prices and push down their rates.   \n[Slide 16]   Indeed, as Figure 6 high lights, other long-term rates did fall with the LSAP \nannouncements.  Both long-term Treasury and cor porate bond rates fell wi th the announcements. \nSeveral studies have concluded th at the cross-correlation is rela tively high, indicating that a \nbroader array of long-term rates will be influenced by an LSAP program.  Thus, the precise focus \nof the program’s asset buy may be less critical th an the broader fact th at the central bank is \npurchasing long-duration securiti es, and that rates on all long-duration securities will be \nimpacted by the program.  Lower long-term rates should stimulate demand for assets influenced \nby the cost of borrowing long – such as investme nts by businesses, and home and car purchases \nby consumers. \n[Slide 17]   Another channel that LSAPs may in fluence involves conveying the likelihood \nthat short-term rates will remain low.  While the Federal Reserve has used language referencing \n“an extended period” in the FOMC minutes for some time, the markets interpretation of that \nperiod is likely to be infl uenced by actions taken.   \n[Slide 18]   Indeed, as Figure 7 shows, prior to  the LSAP program announcements the \nthree-year Treasury rate had been  trading above 2 percent.  Si nce the announcements, the three-\nyear Treasury rate has been below 2 percent – and more recently has been trading closer to the \nrate on shorter-term Treasuries.  As of Wednesd ay of this week, the one-year Treasury was \ntrading at 0.22 percent, the two- year was trading at 0.37 percent, and the three-year was trading \nat 0.57 percent.  This compression of rates is consis tent with market partic ipants anticipating that \nlow rates are likely to continue for quite some time .   Of course, not only  Treasury securities are \n8 \n \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Saturday, October 16, 2010 at  8:15 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY * \n \ninfluenced by expectations of policy; rates on ot her securities of short to medium term are likely \nto be lower as well. \n[Slide 19]   Another area that is potentially imp acted by an LSAP is foreign exchange.  \nThis is a mechanism that received significant attention at our earlier conference.   \n[Slide 20]   Since exchange rates are determined by a variety of policies, both here and \nabroad, the empirical relationship may be difficult to  detect.  This is par ticularly true for the \ndollar exchange rate, where the precautionary de mand for dollars can cause large movements in \nthe exchange rate as investors look to park  funds in dollars during periods of economic \nturbulence.  Nonetheless, one might think that th e exchange rate would be influenced by policies \nto reduce domestic interest rates as investors move funds to countries yielding a higher return.   \nAs Figure 8 highlights, the relationship with th e LSAP and exchange rates is not visually \ncompelling, but nonetheless this is a channe l worth studying and be tter understanding. \n[Slide 21]  Another potential channel involves bank lending.  As large corporations issue \nlong-term debt at attractively lo w rates, they become less dependent on loans or lines of credits \nfrom banks.  As larger firms move to capital  markets for financing, it should free up bank \nbalance sheets to allow a focus on those firms that really depend on banks for financing.  The \nstrength of this channel needs to  be explored more thoroughly.  \n \nConcluding Observations \n[Slide 22]  This conference, more than 10 years af ter our earlier conf erence on the topic, \nhas benefitted from the additional experience that countries around the world have had, in the \ninterim, with monetary policy in a low inflati on environment.  I would summarize by saying that \nclearly, conducting monetary policy in a low inflation environment is difficult – and particularly \n9 \n \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Saturday, October 16, 2010 at  8:15 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY * \n \nso when that low inflation environment also  includes wrenching financial difficulties and \nstubbornly high unemployment rates.  At our earli er conference there was probably too little \nappreciation of the potential challenges, and too low a weight placed on how a low inflation \nenvironment could be hampered by the zero lower bound on short-term  interest rates. \nWhile it may be too early to draw firm conclusions about monetary policy at the zero \nbound for short-term interest rates, I would lik e to draw some tentative conclusions.   \n \n• First, a policy of graduall y adjusting monetary and fisc al policy, as conducted in \nJapan after deflation first occurred, may not  be as effective as an active policy \nresponse taken before deflation has become  embedded in the economy.  Of course, it \nshould depend on the given situation and incoming data. \n \n• Second, while monetary policy may have difficulty fully offsetting a severe shock \nwhen the zero bound is hit, ther e are still important channe ls for monetary policy to \nuse to mitigate the negative shocks.   \n \n• Third, it is not a coincidence that in Japan, the United States, and Europe these economic problems have been encountered in conjunction with banking and financial \nmarket problems.  Analysis of monetary  policy with the zero bound needs to more \nrichly capture the aspects of the financial  sector that are major contributors to \neconomic difficulties.   \n \n10 \n \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Saturday, October 16, 2010 at  8:15 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY * \n \n11 \n                                                            • Finally, we all recognize that conducting unconventional monetary and fiscal policy \nat the zero bound requires political will.  This  of course must be factored into any \nanalysis of policy options. \nThank you, and I look forward to the rest of today’s discussion on this crucial topic. \n \n \n \nNOTES: \n \n1 The inflation rate was 2.1 percent in October 1999 as measured by the year over year change in the core CPI, and \n2.56 percent as measured by the overall CPI. \n \n2 In the discussion paper entitled “Flow and Stock Effect s of Large-Scale Treasury Purchases,” Stefania D’Amico \n and Thomas B. King of the Federal Reserve Board’s Division of Monetary Affairs note that “During the crisis of 2008, policymakers took a number of extraordinary steps to improve the functioning of financial markets and stimulate the economy. Among the most im portant of these measures, in terms of both scale and prominence, were \nthe Federal Reserve’s purchases of large quantities of government-backed securities in the secondary market, \nconventionally known as the Large Scale Asset Purchase—or “LSAP”—programs. The LSAPs included debt obligations of the government-sponsored housing agenci es, mortgage-backed securities (MBS) issued by those \nagencies, and coupon securities issued by the U.S. Treasury, and they coll ectively amounted to $1.7 trillion over a \nperiod of about 15 months—the single largest government intervention in financial-market history. Given the unprecedented size and nature of these programs and the speed w ith which they were proposed and implemented, \npolicymakers could have had, at best, only a very rough ex ante sense of their potential impact.” \n \n3 See for example “Large-Scale Asset Purchases by the Fe deral Reserve: Did They Work?” by Joseph Gagnon, \nMatthew Raskin, Julie Remache, and Brian Sack; Federal Reserve Bank of New York Staff Reports, no. 441, \nMarch 2010.  \n\nRevisiting Monetary Policy in a \nLow Inflation Environment\nEric S.

Rosengren \nPresident & Chief Executive Officer \nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston \n \n  \nGreater Providence Chamber of Commerce \nProvidence, Rhode Island \nNovember 17, 2010 \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThank you for inviting me to speak with you here  in Providence.  Over the past 25 years \nor so, my family and I have followed and enjoyed the rebirth that happened in Providence – from \ntrying some of the great downtown restaurant s to occasionally taki ng in the WaterFire \ncelebration.   \nHowever, I have also witnessed what has happened to many Rhode Island communities \nover the past three years, as a re sult of the recession.  Rhode Island has suffered to an even larger \nextent than the rest of New England.  Despite the downtown rebirth I mentioned, unfortunately a \ndrive today through Providence includes some empty storefronts and foreclosure signs.  \n\n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, N ovember 17, 2010 at 8:20 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY * \n \n2 \n So, it is particularly appropriate to be in Rhode Island to discuss what national monetary \npolicy is doing to address economic pr oblems, here and around the country. * \n There has been a great deal of attention paid to the monetary policy actions that were \ninitiated by the Federal Reserve at the last Fe deral Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting.  \nThere has been much commentary, from a wide range of observers, on our decision to pursue \nlarge scale asset purchases.  Given the intensity of the public debate, I have decided to take a \nsomewhat different approach today than I usually  do in my talks.  Today I am going to do my \nbest to answer the five questions I most often hear about these recent monetary policy actions in \nmy conversations and mee tings around New England. \n [Slide 2]  \nQuestion 1 is, Why was policy changed at the November FOMC meeting?  \n Before we look at the data, I’ll preview my answer.  The policy change we at the Fed just \nannounced was consistent with the central ba nk’s mandate, given how far the national economy \nis from our gauges of health.  \nCongress, which created the Federal Reserve in 1913, has provided significant guidance \nover the years on what should be our primary areas of focus.  Unlike some foreign central banks \nthat only have one target – pr ice stability – the Federal Reserve has been tasked with pursuing \n                                                             \n \n* Of course, the views I express today are my own, not  necessarily those of my colleagues on the Board of \nGovernors or the Federal Open Market Committee (the FOMC). \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, N ovember 17, 2010 at 8:20 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY * \n \n3 \n the lowest possible unemployment rate consistent with price stab ility.  So we refer to a “dual \nmandate,” meaning both maximum employment and stable prices.   \nMembers of the Federal Open Market Committee or FOMC – the presidents of the \nReserve Banks and the members of the Board of Governors in Washington – all provide \nquarterly estimates of where we expect infla tion and unemployment to be in the long-run. We \ncan consider those long-run estimat es to reflect what members see as achieving our dual mandate \nfor price stability and maximum sustainable empl oyment.  According to past submissions, most \nmembers expect that inflation is likely to settle  close to 2 percent and that the unemployment rate \nis likely to settle between 5 a nd 6 percent, in the long run. \n Obviously the national economy is quite some distance from those long-run targets.  And \nin places like Rhode Island, the gap is ev en larger.  From a national perspective, Figure 1  \nhighlights that the unemployment rate, which is cu rrently 9.6 percent, has been well above that 5 \nto 6 percent range for some time, as a result of  the long recession.   Most  of this unemployment \nlikely reflects the dramatic de cline in demand for goods and serv ices that characterized the \nrecession.  With inadequate demand leading to  very high unemployment rates, one would \ngenerally expect that such a la rge gap (in rela tion to the long-run targ et) would yield a strong \nbias towards more accommodative monetary policy. \n Turning to the stable pri ces side of our dual mandate, Figure 2  shows that core inflation \nhas fallen quite significantly.  The core consumer  price index or CPI, which had been above 2 \npercent before the recession, is now below 1 percent.  With the current amount of slack in the \nlabor markets, it is certainly possi ble that inflation could fall furt her.  Thus, on inflation we are \nalso far from where we want and expect to be  in the longer run – a nd we are continuing to \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, N ovember 17, 2010 at 8:20 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY * \n \n4 \n experience disinflationary pressures.  Again, su ch a large gap on the in flation side of our \nmandate should provide a strong bias towards more accommodative monetary policy. \nIn short you see unemployment close to double the mandate-consistent target, and \ninflation about half of what we consid er consistent with price stability. \n Still, an argument against further moneta ry easing could be ma de if one thought the \neconomy was about to take off.  But are things ab out to turn, or turning now – as some suggest?  \nUnfortunately, recent data have not been particularly encouraging.  Figure 3  shows that GDP \n(shown in blue) grew by only 2 percent in the thir d quarter.  Even less encouraging is the fact \nthat final sales (shown in green) – which is a better measure of  demand for our products, since it \nexcludes inventory investment fr om the GDP number – was quite anemic in the third quarter, \nand indeed growth in final sales has been falling ove r the past four quarters.  As I have noted in \nprior talks, we are likely to need  four to five years of relativel y strong growth (above “potential”) \nto bring the unemployment rate down signifi cantly (to a rate cons istent with “full \nemployment”1). \nFurthermore, Figure 4  shows that the growth in fina l sales from the low point of the \nrecession (shown in the dark line extending out five  quarters) has been quite weak, and certainly \nin the weak camp among previous recessions.  With these doubts as to the strength of final sales \nshown in the data, one has to question the likeli hood that, other things equal, the economy will \ngrow fast enough to significantly reduce the unemp loyment rate in an acceptable timeframe and \nreduce these disinflationary pressures. \n With both employment and inflation falling shor t of the long-run expectations that reflect \nthe Fed’s mandate, one would expect additiona l accommodative monetary policy.  However, \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, N ovember 17, 2010 at 8:20 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY * \n \n5 \n with the federal funds rate close to zero, the Fed’s usual policy tool could not be utilized.  \nHowever, monetary policy can st ill be conducted.  The asset-purchase policy announced at the \nNovember FOMC meeting was in my view stro ngly consistent with our dual mandate from \nCongress – in other words, the pur suit of maximum sustainable em ployment and stable prices.  \n  Still, some have argued very forcefully that  we should not have taken further action.  This \nleads to the second question. \n [Slide 7]  \nQuestion 2 is, What is the likely cost of not\n changing monetary policy?  \n Again, as we turn to the evidence, let me sum up my answer to this important and at \ntimes overlooked question.  Not changing policy risked further disinflation, a ri se in the real cost \nof funds tantamount to monetary tightening, and risks of continued and possibly worsening pain \nin labor markets.  Allow me to explain. \nFigure 5  highlights how severe the recession ha s been, in terms of output.  We saw \ndramatic declines in GDP in the United States  (the black line), but the chart shows that many \nother countries experienced an even more  severe decline in output, a nd for some countries it is \nnot clear they have reached thei r recession trough as yet.  Partic ularly in Europe, where some \ncountries have had sovereign debt problems and si gnificant fiscal austerit y, the output decline is \nstriking. \n While that chart shows that in fact the impact on output  was lesser in the U.S. than in \nmany countries, Figure 6  shows that the impact on labor markets  here in the U.S. has been more \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, N ovember 17, 2010 at 8:20 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY * \n \n6 \n severe than in most countries; in fact, only se verely distressed Spain a nd Ireland have seen a \nbigger effect on employment.  The U.S., again s hown by the black line, is still well below the \npeak employment of prior to the onset of the r ecession, and the decline has been more significant \nthan in many other countries.  Firms in the U.S.  moved particularly aggressively to cut jobs, \nparticularly as the recession deepened in the af termath of financial problems in the fall of 2008. \n Figure 7  shows one of the problems with labor markets remaining extremely weak for a \nprotracted period.  The percent of jobless work ers who have been unemployed for 27 weeks or \nmore is over 40 percent.  This is much higher th an in recent recessions, as you can see in the \nshaded recession sections of the char t.  In fact, it is the highest read ing on record for this series.   \nLong periods of unemployment can have par ticularly corrosive effects.  Not only do \npeople have to deplete their sa vings, but unfortunately long-te rm unemployed job-seekers can \nfind it quite difficult to re-enter the workforce – because skills may atrophy and because hiring \nfirms may shun those who have been unemployed for a long time.  In short, there are real and \nsignificant long-term costs to individuals and the economy when the unemployment rate remains \nstubbornly high.  \n Allow me to walk you through the next couple of charts, which highlight that it can be \ncostly to not do anything to counteract further disinflation.  As those of you in this room know, \nmany economic decisions are influenced  by the real cost of borrowing.  Figure 8  gives us a \nhistorical perspective, going back to 1980, comp aring in the top chart the short-term federal \nfunds rate and the inflation rate.  The botto m chart shows what you get when you put the two \ntogether – the real federal funds rate resulting from the effectiv e rate minus the change in the \ncore CPI.   \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, N ovember 17, 2010 at 8:20 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY * \n \n7 \n If we simply narrow the time frame of the chart, as in Figure 9 , we see clearly that if \nshort-term interest rates are fixed – say at a bout the zero bound, as now – but the inflation rate \ndeclines, then the real interest rate actually increases.   You see this in the red line on the bottom \nchart.  As a result, a decline in the inflati on rate when interest rates are fixed amounts to \nmonetary tightening.  Given the state of the eco nomy, a monetary contra ction right now is both \nunintended and undesirable.   So we want to prevent any further disinflation – not only because it \ngets us closer to a harmful deflationary situat ion, but also because it represents a monetary \ntightening when conditions are indicating that further accommodation is desirable. \n If the federal funds rate wa s not close to zero right now, the arguments for reducing it – \nthat is, for easing in monetary policy – would be quite strong.  However, the federal funds rate is \nquite close to zero.  And this l eads us to the third question. \n [Slide 13]  \nQuestion 3 is, How Different are large scale asset purchases (LSAPs) from traditional \nmonetary policy?  \nBefore we look at the data, I’ll preview my an swer to this question.  Are large-scale asset \npurchases a fundamentally different  policy, either in intent and mechanics?  The answer is no, \nLSAPs are much closer to trad itional monetary policy than ma ny commentators assume.  We \nsimply move in other markets than the federa l funds market.  And, like traditional monetary \npolicy actions, we’re not talking about “bailouts”  or stimulus spending or placing a debt burden \non future generations.  Let me explain.  \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, N ovember 17, 2010 at 8:20 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY * \n \n8 \n In more normal times when the FOMC want s to ease monetary policy, we buy Treasury \nbills and, in paying the sellers for them2, we create additional bank reserves.  By making more \nreserves available to the banking system, we ease conditions in the overnight market for funds – \nthe federal funds market – so the primary impact of these purchases is a reduction in the federal \nfunds rate.  But more importantly for the economy, we expect the reduction in the funds rate to \nover time translate into declines  in mortgage rates, corporate bond rates, exchange rates, and a \nrise in stock prices – all of which of course help s timulate economic activity.   \nNow that the federal funds rate is near zero a nd the reserves in the system are quite large, \nthe usual course is not an option.  Instead of relying on the indirect effects of targeting a lower \nfunds rate, we are opting to more directly aff ect the interest rates th at have the greatest \nconnection to real spending; by buying Treasury bonds and creating additional bank reserves.  \nSince there are already substantial reserves in th e system, the primary expected effect is lowering \nthe long rate by purchasing a significant amount of longer-term Treasury bonds.  Like \nconventional policy, one would expect that mortga ge and corporate rates will fall, and exchange \nrates will be impacted, providing additional stimulus to the economy.  That is in fact what has already happened, which leads to Question 4.   \n \n[Slide 14]   \nQuestion 4 is, What has been the impact of the LSAP to date? \nBefore we explore the data, I’ll again shar e the punch line, which is that these policy \nactions, like more standard reductions in the fede ral funds rate, have basically had the expected \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, N ovember 17, 2010 at 8:20 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY * \n \n9 \n effects and – despite some short-run volatility as we get under way – should be broadly effective \nand helpful to the economy going forward.   \nStarting with Chairman Bernanke’s Jacks on Hole speech, the markets have gradually \ncome to expect that more monetary accommodation was likely.  As a result, the impact on financial markets of any easing was likely inco rporated into prices prior to the actual \nannouncement.  The next set of charts highlight s that the effects one might expect from a \nconventional monetary accommodation do indeed seem to have occurred in anticipation of this \nless-conventional action.\n3 \nI should note that while longer rates have been  trending down as desired, there has been \nsome recent movement up, too.  Lots of things af fect rates in the marketplace, but I am certain \nthat our purchases over time will contribute to lower rates than we would otherwise be seeing. \nFigure 10  explores inflation expectations, and highlights the fact that the implied \ninflation rate over the next 10 ye ars as measured by the differen ce between the 10-year Treasury \nyield and the 10-year inflation-indexed  Treasury yield had fallen to we ll below 2 percent.  As the \nmarkets began to anticipate the LSAP program, the implied inflation rate has risen to a little over \n2 percent.  Thus, the action seems to have convinced market participants that further \ndisinflationary pressures in the U.S. were likely to be resisted by monetary policy. \nFigure 11  shows that corporate bond  rates and mortgage rate s have fallen over this \nperiod, although there has been an  uptick over the last couple of days.  Lower rates on these \ninstruments will make it easier for firms to fina nce investments and for home buyers to purchase \nhomes, all other things equal. \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, N ovember 17, 2010 at 8:20 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY * \n \n10 \n Figure 12  shows that there has been a decline in the U.S. dollar exchange rate.  While not \na goal of our policies, this should stimulate expo rts and reduce imports.  It is important to re-\nemphasize that in the U.S., as in any country wi th a flexible exchange rate system, a modest \ncurrency depreciation is the normal consequence of  easing monetary policy.  By lowering short- \nand long-term interest rates, investors will, on the margin, seek assets that provide somewhat \ngreater returns than U.S. assets, and in the process, will lower the demand for dollars and \ndepreciate our currency.   \nWhile this is an issue that has been passiona tely discussed in many parts of the globe, I \nthink it is important to note – as shown on Figure 13  – that the current trade weighted exchange \nrate is really not much different than what it was before the recession.  Exchange rates have at \ntimes fluctuated for a variety of reasons during this period, including periods of so-called flight \nto quality that pushed U.S. rates down, and periods of flight from European currencies as a result \nof some sovereign debt issues – both of which tended to push the dollar up.  At the same time, \nthe data show that the Federal Reserve’s curr ent monetary accommodati on to date has merely \nhelped restore the dollar exchange rate to the level it was three years ago . \nFigure 14  shows that the stock market has genera lly risen over the last several months, \ndespite some downward movement over the last coupl e of days.  While this is not a targeted goal \nof our policy, it is an indicator that the combin ation of lower rates and better economic prospects \nare being manifested in a rise in stock prices.  This increases  household wealth for those who \nown stocks and should provide for somewh at stronger consumption, going forward. \nFigure 15  provides some rough estimates of what the impact of the LSAP easing could \nbe, over time, using the Boston Fe d’s internal simulation models.  While such estimates are by \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, N ovember 17, 2010 at 8:20 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY * \n \n11 \n nature quite uncertain, we estimate that the impact could be a reduction in the unemployment \nrate by the end of 2012 of a little le ss than half a percent.  This would translate into more than \n700,000 additional jobs that we would not have ha d in the absence of this monetary policy \naction.   \nIn short this action, like more standard reduc tions in the federal funds rate, has broadly \nspeaking had the expected short-run effect and should be helpful going forward.  This leads to \nthe final question. \n \n[Slide 21]  \nQuestion 5 is, What are the risks of the current policy? \nThe short answer is that ther e are – of course – some risks.  We should not gloss over \nthem, but neither should we overstate them.  I am  very confident that they can be managed and \nare worth taking. \nNormally the Federal Reserve buys primarily short-term securities.  By purchasing long-\nterm securities the Federal Reserve is in fact taking on the risk that their value will fall as interest rates rise.  The reason is that as  interest rates rise above the ra tes paid on the securities we hold, \nthe lower-rate securities we hold will (not surp risingly) fall in value, as investors favor the \nhigher-rate newer-issue securities.  Of course, an environment in which most interest rates were \nrising would imply an economy where disinflation was no longer a problem, which is one of the \nmacroeconomic outcomes the policy is indeed se eking.  But in fact the Fed has a number of \noptions and plenty of flexibility to manage the ho ldings in the best interests of the economy and \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, N ovember 17, 2010 at 8:20 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY * \n \n12 \n taxpayers.  We could hold instruments to maturity, or could sell securities of certain maturities.  \nAnd, of course, interest income will accrue.  I believe the most likely net outcome will actually \nbe a benefit to the taxpayer, al though that is not the objective of  our balance sheet moves (rather, \nour dual mandate is). \nA second risk arises from the fact that the Treasury market is quite large – much larger \nthan the federal funds market in which we normally  operate.  While relatively small purchases of \nsecurities during normal times can be sufficient to  move the federal funds rate, it takes large \nasset purchases to have a significant impact on a market as large and deep as the Treasury bond \nmarket.  As a result, this policy requires the Fe deral Reserve to expand its balance sheet much \nmore than would a traditional monetary easing.  Large expansions of the balance sheet can \ncomplicate exit strategy, when that becomes a ppropriate.  While the Federal Reserve has a \nvariety of tools designed to tig hten policy, either by raising inte rest on excess reserves, removing \nreserves, or selling secur ities, some of these tools have not been  used in the past.  Naturally this \nmakes the exact impact of various tools somewhat more uncertain than normal.  Still, I am very confident of the Fed’s ability and will to exit, when necessary. \nA third risk is that these measures have not  been conducted in the United States, at least \nat the current scale.  While there are many simila rities with typical mone tary policy and several \nother countries (for example Ja pan and the U.K.) have also b een pursuing large scale asset \npurchases, the lack of recent U.S. historical precedent makes the possibility of unintended \nconsequences higher than with more  typical monetary policy actions. \nAnother risk is that we might be too successful in raising inflation.  Thus any policy \naction needs to take care to make clear that the desire is to maintain well-anchored inflation \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, N ovember 17, 2010 at 8:20 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY * \n \n13 \n expectations.  But this can best be achieved by insuring that inflati on does not get too high nor \ntoo low .   \nFinally, some have argued that the Fed is embarking on a policy of monetizing the federal \ndebt.  I would counter  that this is a temporary  monetary policy action ta ken to return inflation \nand unemployment somewhat more quickly than otherwise to levels consistent with our \nmandate.  It is a policy designed to help reduce longer term rates over a fi xed period of time, not \nat all a policy to finance government debt indefinite ly.  I have noted in prev ious talks that it is \nimportant to provide short-term stimulus, given the current economic situation, but that long-run \nbudget projections are not sustainable and will need to  be addressed.  It is important to note that \nlarge scale asset purchases do not necessarily need to use Treasury -security purchases to \nstimulate the economy; indeed in our first round we did so with mortgage-backed securities.   \nSo all in all there are of course risks to ev aluate in light of th e current state of the \neconomy and our mandate.  We are aware of these risks.  I fully expect that we will be able to \nmanage them.   \n \n[Slide 22]  \nConcluding Observations \nAs I conclude I would like to reiterate th at the actions taken earlier this month are \nconsistent with the important mandates that Congr ess has set for the Federal Reserve in terms of \nemployment (reflecting growth) a nd prices.  With unemployment so high and inflation unusually \nlow, most models indicate that further mone tary accommodation is warranted.  In addition, I \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, N ovember 17, 2010 at 8:20 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY * \n \n14 \n believe the cost of having high unemployment rates for an extended period of time, or likewise \nfurther disinflation, could be quite high and potentially very damaging.   \nThe recently announced LSAP program has many similarities with more typical \nmonetary policy actions, but of course there ar e risks with any policy that we have not had \nsignificant experience with.  Nonetheless, the initial reactions seem similar to what we would \nhave expected from more typical monetary po licy.  And the Fed has the tools to minimize its \nown particular risks.   \nIn short, these actions are likely to reduce the unemployment rate and reduce the risk of \nfurther disinflation relative to not  taking action.  This is exactly wh at I hoped would be the result \nof the program. \nLet me leave you with an analogy – and a season ally appropriate one at that.  This past \nweekend, many New Englanders woke up to a lawn  full of leaves.  Many took out their lawn \nmower intending to get to work picking up those leaves.  When pulling on the starter cord, some \nno doubt heard the engine sputter and cough.  The im mediate reaction is to fiddle with the choke \nswitch and give a little more gas to the engi ne.  Once you get the engine started and running \nsmoothly, you still have the task of mowing up all those leaves.  But you won’t make any \nprogress unless you first get the e ngine operating.  And so it is  with monetary policy.  Our \neconomy has been faltering and sputtering, so it wa s necessary to take some steps to get it \nactually “running.”  Of course this Fed policy will not solve the economy’s problems, just as \ngetting the motor started does not in and of itself take care of the leaves  in your yard.  Solving \nthe economy’s problems will take time and actions by the public and private sectors – but getting \nthe economic engine running is the essentia l first step to the broader work ahead. \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, N ovember 17, 2010 at 8:20 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY * \n \n15 \n  Thank you again for having me join you today.  I hope that in the fu ture we will gather \nunder very different and much improved economic circumstances, and I can assure you that we \nat the Federal Reserve will work diligently towards that end. \n \n                                                             \n \n \n1 See my talk “Considering the Routes to a Policy Destination” available at \nhttp://www.bos.frb.org/news/speeches/rosengren/2010/050510/050510b/index.htm  \n2 The Federal Reserve Act does not permit purchase of new Treasury issues for cash.

Rosengren \nPresident & Chief Executive Officer \nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston \n \n \nInstitute of International Bankers \nAnnual Washington Conference  \n  \nWashington, DC \nMarch 2, 2009 \n \n \n \n \n \n Thank you for inviting me to speak with you today.   Allow me to begin with an observation:  It is \nrarely good when bankers, and centr al bankers, are considered esp ecially “newsworthy.”  But the \nfinancial and economic turmoil of the past year and a half has banking and financial markets at \nthe epicenter of current problems, and very much in the spotlight. \n\n\nEMBARGOED until Monday, March 2, 2009 \nat 11:30 A.M. Eastern Time, or upon delivery \n \n \n2 \n Two years ago, few saw the extent of the prob lems to come.  Bank stock prices were at \nrecord highs, earnings forecasts were rosy, and ba nk capital seemed sufficient.  Indeed, a striking \naspect of this episode is the fact that many banks went into the curr ent banking problems with \nunusually high capital ratios.  As Figure 1  shows, aggregate U.S. bank capital had grown \nsignificantly over the past two decades, as prep arations for the Basel II Capital Accord and \nadvances in banks’ own internal modeling le d banks, generally speaking, to become better \ncapitalized. \nHowever, in less than two years the banki ng environment has changed dramatically.  \nLosses have mounted and a number of small and large banks here and abroad have required \nextensive government support, or were forced to close.  Furthermore, banking problems are \nhaving macroeconomic consequences, as obtaining financing from banks and securities markets \nhas become a more uncertain proposi tion for companies and individuals. \nToday I want to discuss some lessons I have  drawn from the Japane se experience in the \n1990s, a topic I explored in depth with fellow resear chers.  Allow me to share at the outset two \noverarching questions that I think we must keep in mind.  First, how can we reduce the \nmacroeconomic consequences of procycl ical regulatory and accounting policies ?  (By \n“procyclical” policies I mean those that magnify economic fluctuations).  And second, how can \nwe more quickly remove problem assets to get banks and financial markets focused on future \npossibilities, rather than past problems?   Certainly my remarks today will not resolve these \nimportant questions, but they must remain in our sights. \n \n\nEMBARGOED until Monday, March 2, 2009 \nat 11:30 A.M. Eastern Time, or upon delivery \n \n \n3 \n Lessons from Japan’s Experience  \n In the early 1990s, the prices of Japanese real estate and stocks experienced sharp \ndeclines.  As is usually the case, losses in co llateral values had a disproportionate impact on \nbanks.  But unlike their counterparts in the Unit ed States, many Japanese banks had extensive \nstock holdings, which compounded their problems as falling share prices coincided with loan \nlosses and resulted in a signifi cant shortage of bank capital. \nBut as bad as the initial problems were, the failure to quickly rest ore banks’ financial \nhealth had serious consequences for the Ja panese economy, which as you know experienced \ngrowth below potential for over a decade.  There are several lessons – admittedly intertwined – that I take from my studi es of this experience: \n• First, undercapitalized banks behave diff erently than well-capitalized banks.  \n• Second, certain bank-regulatory and accoun ting policies may amplify the business \ncycle.  \n• Third, troubled assets need to be move d off bank balance sheets as quickly as \npossible.  \nAllow me to discuss each of these lessons in just a bit of detail. \n First, empirical research suggests that unde rcapitalized banks behave differently than \nwell-capitalized banks.  Undercap italized banks shift their attention to short-run capital \npreservation rather than long-run profit maximi zation, and this change in goals has several \nundesirable effects.  Perhaps the most undesi rable is that undercap italized banks, finding it \ndifficult to raise additional capital, are forced to improve their capital ratios by shrinking assets\n1. \n\nEMBARGOED until Monday, March 2, 2009 \nat 11:30 A.M. Eastern Time, or upon delivery \n \n \n4 \n Banks hold capital in part to absorb loan lo sses that are in excess of loan-loss reserves, \nand seek to maintain a reasonable ratio of capital to assets.  A reduction in the value of capital \nleads a bank to shrink the asset si de of its balance sheet, to maintain the desired capital-to-assets \nratio.  Thus, since loans are usually the bank’s most significant asset,  lending becomes more \nrestrictive. \nReturning to the case of Japane se banks in the 1990s, they tended to shrink their assets \nabroad, in some cases pulling out of markets wh ere their prospects were arguably better than \ntheir prospects from additional domestic loans2.  And, because undercapitalized banks seek to \nshrink without incurring additional losses, the specific form the asset shrinkage took could be \nperverse.  For instance, some banks would support troubled borrowers in an  effort to avoid loss \nrecognition, while reducing credit to more cred itworthy borrowers with whom the bank could \ncurtail credit without incurring a loss3.  In short, as the banks s ought to preserve or shore up \ncapital-to-assets ratios, they disposed of assets (indeed, the particularly salable ones) or declined \nto add new ones. \nAdditionally, undercapita lized banks have an incentive to  postpone reserving for problem \nloans, to avoid further depleting capital.  Th is is why loan loss provisioning often rises \nsignificantly as a result of an exam of an undercapitalized bank4. \n Figure 2  shows that lending patterns in th e United States differ depending on the \nfinancial condition of the banks.  Banks with the lowest supervisory ratings have reduced their \nlending significantly more than have banks in bett er health.  Empirical research suggests that \nduring previous banking crises th is behavior was, to an im portant degree, explained by \ndifferences in the ability to supply  credit not just differences in the demand  for credit5.  Thus the \n\nEMBARGOED until Monday, March 2, 2009 \nat 11:30 A.M. Eastern Time, or upon delivery \n \n \n5 \n evidence from Japan and previous problems in the U.S. indicates that a llowing poorly capitalized \nbanks to continue operations with insufficient cap ital is likely to exacerb ate problems with credit \navailability. \n My second observation from Japan’s experien ce, and the current banking problems in the \nU.S., is that certain bank-regul atory and accounting policies may am plify the business cycle – in \nother words, they are procyclical.  During a dow nturn, assets that are pledged as collateral \nagainst bank loans decline in va lue.  Of course, collateral valu e is only one procyclical driver6.  \nNonetheless, declining collateral values genera lly result in higher loss rates on non-performing \nloans.  In terms of accounting, high er loss rates result in larger loan charge-offs and increases in \nloan loss reserves – which depletes capital and le ads banks to reduce lendi ng (the asset side of \ntheir balance sheet) in order to maintain capital-to-assets ratios. \nOne step that might make banking problems less procyclical would be to thoughtfully \nexamine, and consider modifying, policies related to loan-loss reserves – specifically, how loan \nloss reserves are calculated fo r purposes of determining regulat ory capital and for financial \nstatements. \nUnder current policies, regulatory rules essentially follow U.S. generally-accepted \naccounting principles (GAAP) in determining an appropriate loan-loss reserve.  U.S. GAAP \naccounting rules provide that a lo an-loss reserve should reflect pr obable and estimable losses that \nhave already been incurred in the loan portfolio, but have not yet been discovered.  This is often \nreferred to as the “incurred loss” model.  The accounting profession of ten notes that these \naccounting rules were written in this way, in part, to inject more transpar ency into the reserve \nsetting process and to address conc erns about financial manipulation. \n\nEMBARGOED until Monday, March 2, 2009 \nat 11:30 A.M. Eastern Time, or upon delivery \n \n \n6 \n A criticism of the accountant’s view is that as financial conditions deteriorate, loan loss \nreserves lag the increases in nonperfor ming loans and expected losses (see Figure 3 ).  It can be \nargued that this is true because management fa iled to adequately assess changes in current loss \nestimates, or because reserve models are somewhat backward looking.  In either case, it has been \nobserved in previous periods of  banking problems that loan-lo ss reserves were low at the \nbeginning of the banking problems, lagged as problems became apparent, and likely to peak at the very time that we could most use bank capital  to be at work financing economic recovery.  \nSolutions to this predicament, which I will not expound on or argue for today, would do well to \nresult in earlier loss recognition, more rapidly addressed problems, and indeed a curtailing of \nhigh-risk lending earlier in the cycle. \n Again, my goal today is to point out some lessons we would all do well to consider and \napply.  Proposals to make reserv ing less procyclical will no doubt take different forms.  To an \neconomist’s way of thinking, a reserve should not be limited to a view of a current period or \nsnapshot in time, focusing on losses that are currently in the portfolio based on loans made \npreviously – rather, expected future losses  should also be considered.  For example, if one \nanticipates that unemployment rates were to rise  rapidly, a statistical ca lculation of expected \nlosses looking through the cycle may be very diff erent than the losses that are probable and \nestimable given current economic conditions\n7.  This more comprehensive view of loan losses \ncould lend itself to addressing so me of the perceived shortfalls  associated with the current \naccounting model. \nSome of you, I am sure, are familiar with a variant from Spain which bears study; \nwhereby “stress” losses are estimated and loan -loss reserves are built up during good times.  The \n\nEMBARGOED until Monday, March 2, 2009 \nat 11:30 A.M. Eastern Time, or upon delivery \n \n \n7 \n promising aspect is that losses dr aw down the reserve rather than capital, so capital is much less \nsensitive to current economic condi tions and thus there is less pressure to reduce lending during \nperiods of financial difficulty. \nI think there is a compelling argument for some  form of action to a ddress procyclicality \nthrough policy change.  Whether that policy cha nge should be addressed through accounting or \nregulatory rules is open to debate.  Of cour se, any changes proposed for accounting rules must \ntake pains to avoid inviting so-called “earnings management,” and should respect the needs of \ninvestors and other primary users of financial statements.  In whatever form policy ultimately \ntakes, both current losses in the portfolio as well as the “stress” lo sses would need to be \ndisclosed, in a transparen t and rules-based manner. \n The third lesson I take from the Japanese e xperience is that troubled assets should be \nmoved off bank balance sheets as quickly as pos sible.  Banks with tr oubled assets focus on \navoiding further losses and further depleting capita l.  Troubled banks in Japan were often more \nsupportive of problem borrowers than borro wers who had good prospects going forward.  \nFocusing on future growth requir es removing the problem assets. \nFurthermore, governments are not the best mana gers of bad assets.  Removing bad assets \nand quickly selling to new owners are steps that are likely to get resources allocated to their best \neconomic use.  When a bank is closed with FDIC support, this is relativel y straightforward.  The \nbad assets are removed from the bank and quickly  disposed of by the FDIC, and the good assets \nare sold to an acquirer.  The new acquirer does  not spend time focused on the problems of the \npast, but rather, focuses on maxi mizing future profitability.  Th is is a reason for moving to \nresolve, as quickly as possible, banks that are clearly insolvent. \n\nEMBARGOED until Monday, March 2, 2009 \nat 11:30 A.M. Eastern Time, or upon delivery \n \n \n8 \n  The problem becomes more difficult when the bad assets are in troubled, but not \ninsolvent, banks.  In this case, bank manageme nt becomes focused on the problem assets, and \nways to avoid realizing losses that would threat en the solvency of the bank.  The problem is \nparticularly complicated during the current perio d, because of the intertwining of liquidity and \ncredit problems in s ecurities portfolios. \n A good example of the potential liquidity  problems is provided by securities backed by \nstudent loans that are 97 percen t guaranteed by the government (see Figure 4 ).  Currently there \nexist about $250 billion in these securities, ma ny of which are held by banks or bank-affiliated \nconduits.  Despite the 97 percent guarantee, prici ng services suggest prices below, and in some \ncases significantly below, 97 percent of face value.   This discount suggests that sales of such \nassets are taking place by sell ers who have no option but to se ll – and suggests that given the \nfinancing and balance sheet constraints of most  buyers, they will only purchase the asset for a \nprice well below the level one would expect co nsidering the government guarantee.  Given the \ngovernment guarantee, most of the discount in these securities seems to be the result of liquidity \nconcerns. \nFor securities where the problem appears to be liquidity rather than credit concerns, there \nshould be a role for purchasing these assets and reducing the liquidity pr emium.  Consider the \naforementioned securities backed by student loans,  where liquidity concerns seem to be driving \nthe steep discounts.  If the securities were purch ased at a more modest haircut relative to the \ngovernment guarantee – say for 94 percent of face value – it would serve to significantly reduce \nthe liquidity premium, allowing banks to use much  higher marks in their investment portfolios, \nand thus improve their capital position while st ill purchasing the assets at a price below the \n\nEMBARGOED until Monday, March 2, 2009 \nat 11:30 A.M. Eastern Time, or upon delivery \n \n \n9 \n government guarantee.  These, of course, are bene fits they would realize if they could hold the \nsecurity to maturity.  With their capital posit ion enhanced, the banks could do more to restore \ncredit flows. \n A more difficult issue relates to loans and securities that would be deeply discounted \nprimarily because of credit  concerns.  For banks, selling such  assets below their net recorded \nvalue, thus recognizing a loss, involves further depletion of capital.  In centing banks to remove \nthese problem assets is likely to require more  supervisory pressure to appropriately reserve \nagainst or write down those asse ts, and to take actions to qu ickly dispose of the assets. \nGranted, this is not an unusual role for supe rvisors – frequently, written agreements and \ncease-and-desist orders require increasing rese rves, improving risk and credit management, and \nexpediting the removal of bad assets.  In this cas e, moving more quickly to mandate reserving for \nand disposing of problem assets will speed recovery from current problems.  \n \nConclusion  \n In sum, the Japanese experience of the 1990s  highlights the fact that forbearance can \nhave significant macroeconomic consequences.  Troubled banks are reluctant to expand balance \nsheets or to address problems with troubled asse ts.  I believe it would be desirable to move \nquickly to remove problem assets from bank ba lance sheets, so banks can once again focus on \nfuture prospects rather than past mistakes. \n\nEMBARGOED until Monday, March 2, 2009 \nat 11:30 A.M. Eastern Time, or upon delivery \n \n \n10 \n In the longer run, we need to  explore ways to make banki ng problems less procyclical.  \nCertainly an area worth further careful investig ation is whether curren t loan-loss-reserving \npolicies can be recast to enc ourage less procyclical behavior. \nAs I mentioned at the outset, it is not a good thing when bankers, and central bankers, are \ncentral to the news.  However, we should use the attention and urgenc y of this moment to \ngalvanize the hard thinking and ha rd work needed to remedy the cu rrent crisis, and put in place a \nframework that will help us a void future crises, going forward. \nThank you. \n \n                                                             \nNOTES: \n \n1 See the article I wrote with Joe Peek, \"The Interna tional Transmission of Financial Shocks: The Case of \nJapan,\" in the American Economic Review  vol. 87, no. 4 (September 1997), pages 495-505. \n2 See the article I wrote with Joe Peek, \"Collateral Damage: Effects of the Japanese Bank Crisis on Real \nActivity in the United States,\" in the American Economic Review , vol. 90, no. 1 (March 2000), pages 30-\n45. \n3 See the article I wrote with Joe Peek, \"Unnatural Selection: Perverse Incentives and the Misallocation of \nCredit in Japan,\" the American Economic Review , vol. 95(4), September 2005, pages 1144-1166. \n4 See the article I wrote with Joe Peek, “B ank regulation and the credit crunch,” in the Journal of Banking \n& Finance , Volume 19, Issues 3-4, June 1995, pages 679-692.  \n \n5 See the article I wrote with Joe Peek, “B ank regulation and the credit crunch,” in the Journal of Banking \n& Finance , Volume 19, Issues 3-4, June 1995, pages 679-692.  \n \n6 Joined by things like the increased likelihood, in  a downturn, that the borrower will have difficulty \nrepaying; a likely decline in the value of a bank’s  investment portfolio; and additional challenges in \nraising capital. \n \n7 Current accounting conventions do not capture expect ed losses in the portfolio considering all available \ninformation – which would be the concept used by a statistician, a risk mana ger, or an economist to \ncalculate expected losses.  \n\nFigure 1\nEquity Capital to Assets Ratio at \nCommercial and Savings Banks \n1989:Q1 – 2008:Q3\nSource:  Commercial and Savings Bank Call Reports.\n\n\nFigure 2\nAsset Growth at Commercial and Savings Banks \nby CAMELS Rating\nSeptember 30, 2007 – September 30, 2008\nSource:  Commercial and Savings Bank Call Reports and author ’s calculations.\nNote:  Analysis uses CAMELS ra tings as of September 30,  2008.

            "content": "Written Testimony of \nEric S. Rosengren \nPresident & Chief Executive Officer \nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston \n \n \nField hearing of the \nCommittee on Financia l Services of the \nU.S. House of Representatives: \n“Seeking Solutions – \nFinding Credit for Small and \nMid-Size Businesses in Massachusetts” \n \n \nMonday, March 23, 2009 \nMassachusetts State House \nBoston, Massachusetts  \n \n \n\n\n1 \n Note: The figures (charts) mentioned in this testimony are attached below the text. \n \n \nChairman Frank and members of the Committee, it is my pleasure to appear before you \ntoday to discuss the availability of credit for businesses amid the current economic and financial \nturmoil, and the steps the Federal Reserve is ta king to help make credit available to small and \nmedium-sized businesses.   \nIn my testimony today I plan to first share some national context, and some perspective \non the Federal Reserve System’s responses to date.  I plan to then comment, more briefly, on the \nsituation in Massachusetts. \n \nThe National Context \nSince August of 2007, financial markets have been severely disrupted.  The functioning \nof financial markets and the functioning of institutions that serve as financial intermediaries have tremendous downstream impacts on businesses, st ate and local governments, and households.  \nAs a result, these disruptions are of great concer n to the Federal Reserve as we pursue our policy \ngoals of maximum sustainable employ ment, stable prices, and moderate  long-term interest rates.   \nWhile credit availability has been a concern since the outset of the financial crisis, the \ncredit situation became more severe as problems expanded beyond a few large financial \ninstitutions focused on subprime-mortgage secu ritizations to a broa der group of financial \ninstitutions.  The Federal Reserve’s\n Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending \n\n2 \n Practices  has been showing substantial tightenin g of credit, which dovetails with the \nperspectives voiced since last summer by many advi sory groups we engage at the Boston Fed.  \nOther entities such as Associated Industries of Massachusetts are finding when they survey \ncompanies that credit conditions are tightening – and that the tightening may affect companies \ndirectly, or indirectly through suppliers a nd customers who face credit constraints.   \nThe Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) remains focused on ensuring adequate \nfinancing for businesses of all sizes.  Last week’s official  FOMC statement indicated, among \nother things, that “weaker sales prospects and difficulties in obta ining credit have led businesses \nto cut back on inventories and fixed investment.”  Earlier th is month, the Federal Reserve’s \nBeige Book  report suggested that “The av ailability of credit genera lly remained tight.  Lenders \ncontinued to impose strict standards for all type s of loans, with scattered reports of further \ntightening and particular scrutiny focused on co nstruction projects and commercial real estate \ntransactions.”     \nCredit availability issues remain a significant focus at the Federal Reserve and are a \nsignificant factor in how we ar e addressing the current economic and financial problems.  The \nFederal Reserve  has acted proactively and cr eatively to address these concerns – first by \naggressively easing conventional  monetary policy (the federal funds rate) and, since the fall, \nusing less-conventional monetary policy tools to mitigate continuing problems with the cost and \navailability of financing fo r businesses and households.   \nFigure 1  shows how the Federal Reserve acted to address problems in financial markets, \nand concerns that market disruptions would im pact the cost and availability of finance, by \nrapidly moving the target federal funds rate to on ly a little above zero.  As the Federal Reserve \n\n3 \n lowered the target federal funds rate, most short-term market in terest rates fell – although not \ncommensurate with the decline in  the federal funds rate.   \nIt is important to note that many small and medium-sized businesses have loans tied to \nthe prime rate, or to the London Interbank Offered Rate or Libor , which decreased significantly \nas we moved the federal funds rate from 5.25 percent in July 2007 to between zero and one-\nquarter of one percent at the end of December.  While a year ago many observers were critical of \nthese rapid rate cuts, it is fortunate that the Federal Reserve did move so quickly.  While the \nreduction in interest rates did not prevent the economy’s weak ening, it helped cushion the \neconomy against some of the shocks  experienced over the past year. \nWith the federal funds rate approaching the zero bound, the Federal Reserve has turned to \nsome alternative approaches to monetary policy, which have rapidly incr eased the Fed’s balance \nsheet.  Many of the new programs are intended to improve the availability of credit in the \nmarketplace and reduce the cost, which had not fallen commensurate with the decline in the \nfederal funds rate.  I would like to briefly discuss these Federal Reserve programs.   \nFigure 2  shows the composition of the Fed’s balan ce sheet.  The largest expansion of the \nbalance sheet occurred in the fall, as a series of actions were taken in resp onse to the increasingly \nfragile state of financial mark ets.  Our actions were designed to improve the functioning of \ninterbank lending.   Borrowers and businesses whos e rates are tied to inte rbank rates like Libor \nbenefit as interbank lendi ng markets see more normal spreads and declining rates. \nAllow me to mention two programs that have  been critical to the improvements in \ninterbank lending markets and th e related reduction in market interest rates – the Federal \nReserve’s Term Auction Facility or TAF, and a ne twork of liquidity swap lines we have arranged \n\n4 \n with other central banks.  The TAF is designed to  help ensure that ba nks can obtain the funds \nthey need to provide credit to their customers. It involves an auction-mo del variant of discount-\nwindow lending to financial institu tions (backed by collateral subjec t to significant “haircuts,” to \nmitigate risk to the Federal Reserve).  Central bank liquidity swaps are loans made to foreign central banks so that they can provide dollar f unding to their banks in much the same manner as \nour TAF.   \nThese two programs were designed to stab ilize and improve th e functioning of the \ninterbank dollar-lending mark et – indeed, to ease conditions in  global dollar markets that were \nspilling over into our own fundi ng markets.  As shown in Figure 3 , the Libor rate is now much \nmore aligned with the federal funds rate.  The reduction in the Libor rate helps a variety of \nborrowers.  Most subprime mortgages have reset ra tes tied to Libor, many credit card rates are \ntied to Libor, and the rates on many business loans ar e tied to Libor.  The actions we have taken \nare reducing the cost of financing for borrowers and businesses whose rates are tied to Libor and \nthus influenced by the functioning of  interbank dollar lending markets. \nI would like to mention anothe r area of substantial growth in the Fed’s balance sheet – \nspecifically, the Federal Reserve liquidity facilities designed to  provide market support and \nimprove conditions in short-term credit markets (see Figure 4 ).  Some, like the Commercial \nPaper Funding Facility (CPFF), provide  an alternative funding source to the market when interest \nrate spreads become very elevated.   \nIn general, the various programs that have expanded the Federal Re serve’s balance sheet \nshould be less attractive to market partic ipants as financial conditions improve.  Figure 5 shows \n\n5 \n that of late, the rate on asset-backed commerci al paper has fallen dramatically, and many issuers \ncan receive better terms by issuing commerci al paper directly to the market.   \nFigure 6  shows that the prime mone y market funds have tended of late to have a net \ninflow of funds, which has helped stabilize s hort-term credit markets because money market \nfunds are a key investor in these markets.  Correspondingly, money market funds have reduced \ntheir reliance on the Fed liquidity facility that was designed to help them – the asset-backed \ncommercial paper money-market mutual fund liqui dity facility, or AMLF.  This experience \nprovides a clear example of how improved market  conditions provide incentives for financial \nfirms to reduce reliance on our faci lities. We expect this to be the case for many of our facilities \nas the economy and financial markets gradually improve.  Stabilized short-term credit markets \nmean that businesses that borrow with commercial  paper are able to ob tain less costly, more \ndependable sources of financi ng.  In addition, many issuers of  commercial paper used the \nfunding to provide loans to businesses to finance r eceivables, to provide fl oor plan financing, and \nto provide other types of e ssential short-term credit.  \nTwo new programs should provide additional he lp to markets.  First, the Term Asset-\nBacked Securities Loan Facility (TALF) is de signed to facilitate the renewed issuance of \nconsumer and small business asset-backed securi ties – essentially providing a financing vehicle \nfor credit instruments that have been disrupted  by poor functioning in securitization markets.  \nThis facility, which is just starting up, should he lp make credit more avai lable for student loans, \nconsumer credit, commercial real estate, and small business loans; leading to lower borrowing \nrates and improved access in the market for cons umer and small business credit.  The facility \nwill do this by lending against triple-A rated asse t-backed securities collateralized by recently \noriginated student loans, auto loans, credit card loans, loans guaranteed by the U.S. Small \n\n6 \n Business Administration, mortgage servicing a dvances, loans or leases relating to business \nequipment, leases of vehicle fleets, or floorpl an loans.  A second program involves the large-\nscale purchases of mortgage-backed a nd agency securities.  As shown in Figure 7 , conventional \nmortgage rates that had been around 6 percent have declined since th e announcement of this \nprogram.   \nLast Wednesday the Federal Open Market Committee announced that to provide greater \nsupport to mortgage lending and housing markets, the Federal Reserve would further increase its \nbalance sheet by purchasing up to an additiona l $750 billion of agency mortgage-backed \nsecurities (bringing its to tal purchases of these securities up to $1.25 trillion this year), and to \nincrease its purchases of agency debt this ye ar by up to $100 billion (to a total of up to $200 \nbillion).  An important effect of  this program is that it provides lower cost loans to homeowners, \nbut it should be recognized that the program also bears significant benefits for many small \nbusinesses, which often rely on home equity loans as a critical source of  initial financing.  I \nshould also mention that in order to improve c onditions in private credit  markets, the Committee \non Wednesday decided to purchase up to $300 bil lion of longer-term Treasury securities over the \nnext six months. This action is expected to ease  credit conditions in a wide variety of markets \nthat tie their cost of fi nance to Treasury yields. \n \nThe Situation in Massachusetts  \n While my goal today has been to provide so me national context and perspective, I would \nlike to add a few comments about the situ ation in Massachusetts and New England.  Figure 8  \nshows that lending patterns in the United States  differ depending on the financial condition of the \n\n7 \n banks.  Banks with the lowest supervisory rati ngs have reduced their lending while banks in \nbetter health show positive asset- growth percentages.  Empirical  research suggests that during \nprevious banking crises this beha vior was, to an important degr ee, explained by differences in \nthe ability to supply  credit, not just differences in the demand  for credit.  As you know, extending \ncredit means expanding the asset side of the bala nce sheet for a bank, and banks must maintain a \nreasonable capital-to-assets ratio.  This underlines  the importance of steps to bolster or resolve \npoorly capitalized banks, in or der to address broader probl ems of credit availability. \n Figure 9  shows that the share of commercial and savings banks with the lowest \nsupervisory ratings is quite a bit smaller in New England than it is nationally – and furthermore, \nthat share has remained constant in New E ngland while doubling for the nation overall in a \nyear’s time.  Considering the aforementioned dynamic, the good ne ws locally is that a greater \nshare of New England banks are in good health and thus more able to  supply credit to businesses.  \nOf course, most anecdotal indications are th at even among healthy banks willing to lend to \ncreditworthy borrowers, standards have probably tightened in res ponse to the riskier environment \n(that is, over concern related to the impact of the slowing economy  on even creditworthy \nborrowers). \n \nConcluding Observations \nIn conclusion, I would offer just a few summar y thoughts.  Over the la st year and a half \nor so, the Federal Reserve has been proactive an d innovative in trying to  address problems in \nfinancial markets and the broade r economy.  While traditional monetary policy had focused on \nlowering the federal funds rate to spur interest-s ensitive economic activity, now that this rate has \n\n8 \n approached the zero-bound floor, the Federal Re serve has focused on more direct means of \nlowering the cost of credit in the marketplace,  which had not fallen commensurate with the \ndecline in the federal funds rate.  Federal Reserv e programs have intended to  offset disruptions to \ninterbank lending, short-term credit financing, the ability of money market mutual funds to meet \ninvestor redemption requests, a nd housing finance – and these pr ogram should have beneficial \neffects on the cost and availabil ity of credit for businesses.   \nThank you for inviting me to testify today.  If I can answer any questions I would be very \npleased to do so. \n  \n\n9 \n  \n                   \nFigures \n \n\n1\nFigure 1\nFederal Funds Effective Rate\nJanuary 2, 2007 - March 18, 2009\nPercent\n23456\nFederal Funds Effective Rate\n1Source:  Federal Reserve Board / Haver Analytics01\n2-Jan-07 17-Apr-07 31-Jul-07 13-Nov-07 26-Feb-08 10-Jun-08 23-Sep-08 6-Jan-09\nFigure 2\nComposition of Federal Reserve System Assets\nJune 27, 2007 - March 18, 2009\n2 500Billions of Dollars\n1,0001,5002,0002,500\nInstitution Specific\nGSE/MBS\nMarket Support\nCentral Bank Liquidity Swaps\nDiscount Window\nTreasury Securities and Other Assets\n2Source:  Federal Reserve Statistical Release H.4.10500\n27-Jun-07 26-Sep-07 26-Dec-07 26-Mar-08 25-Jun-08 24-Sep-08 31-Dec-08 18-Mar-09\n\n2\nFigure 3\nOne-Month London Interbank Offered Rate \n(LIBOR) and the Federal Funds Target Rate\nJanuary 2, 2007 - March 18, 2009\nPercent\n123456One-Month LIBOR\nFederal Funds Target\n3Source:  Federal Reserve Board, Financial Times / Haver Analytics01\n2-Jan-07 17-Apr-07 31-Jul-07 13-Nov-07 26-Feb-08 10-Jun-08 23-Sep-08 6-Jan-09\nFigure 4 \nFederal Reserve System Assets\nheld by Market Support Facilities\nSeptember 24, 2008 - March 18, 2009\nBillions of Dollars\n100150200250300350400\nAMLF CP Funding Facility \n4Source:  Federal Reserve Statistical Release H.4.1050100\n24-Sep-08 15-Oct-08 5-Nov-08 26-Nov-08 17-Dec-08 7-Jan-09 28-Jan-09 18-Feb-09 11-Mar-09\n\n3\nFigure 5\nAsset-Backed Commercial Paper Rate\nJanuary 2, 2007 - March 18, 2009\n8Percent\n2468\n1-Day AA Asset-Backed Commercial Paper Rate \n5Source:  Federal Reserve Board / Haver Analytics0\n2-Jan-07 17-Apr-07 31-Jul-07 13-Nov-07 26-Feb-08 10-Jun-08 23-Sep-08 6-Jan-09\nFigure 6\nDaily Change in Money Market Fund Assets\nin Prime Funds\nAugust 1, 2008 - March 18, 2009\n30Billions of Dollars\n-120-90-60-30030\nLehman \nfails.\nThe Reserve Primary \nFund breaks the buck.\nFed announces\nAMLF program.AMLF program commences.\nTreasury announces \ninsurance for MMMFs. \n6Source:  iMoneyNet-150\n1-Aug 25-Aug 17-Sep 9-Oct 3-Nov 26-Nov 19-Dec 14-Jan 6-Feb 3-Mar\nNote:  Prime funds include both retail and institutional funds. \n\n4\nFigure 7\nNational Average Mortgage Rates\nSeptember 2, 2008 - March 18, 2009\nPercent\n5678\n30-Year Fixed-Rate Jumbo\nNovember 25 -- Federal Reserve announces purchase \nprogram for GSE direct obligations and MBS.\n7Source:  Bloomberg4\n2-Sep-08 30-Sep-08 28-Oct-08 25-Nov-08 23-Dec-08 20-Jan-09 17-Feb-09 17-Mar-0930-Year Fixed-Rate Conventional \nFigure 8\nAsset Growth at Commercial and Savings Banks \nby CAMELS Rating * \nDecember 31, 2007 - December 31, 2008\n20Percent Change, December 31, 2007 - December 31, 2008 \n-20-15-10-505101520\nCAMELS Rating of 1 or 2\nCAMELS Rating of 3, 4, or 5\nSource :  Commercial and savings bank call reports, s upervisory reports and author’s calculations.\nNote:  Analysis uses CAMELS ratings as of December 31, 2008.

On my last visit I had the opportunity to speak about \nthe information that central banks need to make informed decisions during periods of financial \nturmoil.  My regret is that one year later this peri od of financial difficulty continues.  Considering the \ndownstream economic hardships that so many peopl e are encountering, these matters of regulatory \nframeworks and supervisory policies ar e both urgent and imperative.     \n Most of the world is currently  experiencing what has already b een a long and severe recession.   \nAs in several previous episodes, cr ises at leveraged financial institut ions have been at the center of \n\n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 9:30 PM on Tuesday, April 14, 2009 U.S. Eastern Time or Upon Delivery, and \n10:30 AM on Wednesday, April 15, 2009 in Seoul, Korea \n \n \n \n 2problems that eventually rippled across and prof oundly impacted the global economy.  So, realizing \nthe importance of a well-functioning financial sector to economic ac tivity, many countries have taken \nextensive steps to stabilize fina ncial systems, including providing additional capital in their banking \nsystem, guaranteeing debt, expanding deposit insu rance, and guaranteeing (or limiting losses on) \nsome banking assets.  These policy actions were taken to support the f unctioning of financial \ninstitutions and markets so that problems do not derail banks’ ability to continue lending to \ncreditworthy individuals and firms,  hampering economic activity.    \nThe need for such extensive government inte rvention on an essentially worldwide basis \nhighlights the importance of creating a more stable financial infrastructure – and, I believe, to have \norganizations with explicit responsibility for fina ncial stability.  As you know, policymakers in the \nU.S. and many other countries are right now work ing through the intricate and challenging issues \nassociated with the creation of a more effective regul atory structure.  So I be lieve this forum is both \ntimely and important.  \nDefining Financial Stability Supervision and Regulation \n In my remarks today, I plan to explore a so mewhat simple-sounding que stion that, when fully \nconsidered, has broad implications for the wider pol icy debate.  The question is, could an effective \nsystemic regulator have spotte d the roots of the cu rrent crisis, identifying the problems and \nanticipating their ramifications early enough  for action to be taken?   \nTo explore this question, I think we  need to consider the issue of what data  an effective \nregulator or supervisor w ith explicit financial-stability responsi bilities might have been examining \nover the past 5 years – and what questions  they might have been asking as they studied these data.  \nKeep in mind that unlike most prudential supervisors that focu s on the solvency of individual \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 9:30 PM on Tuesday, April 14, 2009 U.S. Eastern Time or Upon Delivery, and \n10:30 AM on Wednesday, April 15, 2009 in Seoul, Korea \n \n \n \n 3financial institutions, a financial-stability regulator  would clearly need to take more of a “macro” \nperspective on financial trends (and their cro sscurrents and unintende d consequences).   \n Financial stability is often ci ted but rarely defined, so for th e purposes of this talk let us \nassume that a financial-stability regulator would be  charged with making sure that what I will call \n“contagious” failures of financial institutions do not occur.  Such failures could involve a large group \nof financial intermediaries, all with a prominent shar ed risk exposure, or coul d involve one key player \nbecoming insolvent but many other financial institu tions failing because of their exposure as \ncounterparties to that institution.  Please note that  this definition does not require that the involved \norganizations are depository institu tions, nor does it hinge on the pres ence of deposit insurance.   \nOne – but not the only2 – important “warning flag” a syst emic regulator would watch for \nwould be any significant divergence of  financial trends from those of past experience.  This would not \nnecessarily compel action by a syst emic regulator, but should trigger more careful questioning.  For \nexample:  How are the financial trends being fina nced?  Are financial institutions taken together – \nthus, the financial system – becoming more le veraged, or significantly increasing maturity \nmismatches?  Are prudent underwriting standards st ill in use across the fi nancial system, and by \npotentially-contagious institutions – or are prudent standards being abandoned?  In short, do these \nnovel financial trends seem likely to hold up over time and be part of  a healthy financial system, or \nnot?  What are the risks to the financial system if  an institution or a “trend ing” asset type becomes \nilliquid, or valueless? \nUpon exploring such questions, if a systemic regu lator concludes that the financial trends that \ndiverge from past experience are indeed being generated by unsafe and unsound practices at highly \nleveraged institutions, and concludes that the prac tices could indeed result in highly correlated \nfinancial problems across the landscape of financ ial institutions, a fundamental issue would still \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 9:30 PM on Tuesday, April 14, 2009 U.S. Eastern Time or Upon Delivery, and \n10:30 AM on Wednesday, April 15, 2009 in Seoul, Korea \n \n \n \n 4remain.  The systemic regulator would need to have the powers  necessary to stop the unsafe practices.  \nThe issue of the powers needed to effectively mitiga te such problems is very important and deserves \ncareful thought.  I plan to make it a question for another talk, another day. \n A key point is that the systemic regulator cannot just look institution by institution, but needs \nto think about the potentially difficult trends em erging across a swath of in terconnected institutions \nand their counterparties.  And while it may go without saying, for a systemic regulator to be effective, \nthe regulator needs to be able to identify whether actual systemic problems are emerging.  This \ninvolves, in part, assessing the “feedback effects” that might result from initial problems. \nSo I think it is instructive to ask whether a system ic regulator would have been able to identify \nthe problems that we are currently grappling with.  So far today I have  put what I think are key issues \nin front of you.  Now I would like to flesh them out  a bit through a brief disc ussion of some of the \nfinancial trends leading up to the current problems, and then consider  whether these trends might have \ngenerated more actions if there had been a systemic  regulator focused on these issues.  I will conclude \nwith some thoughts on the international cha llenges to addressing systemic concerns. \n  \nThe Development of Current Financial Problems: A Brief Review \n In the United States, the initial trigger to the current financial crisis was deterioration in the \nhousing market.  Because our time today is short, I will discuss mainly these housing-related trends –  \nalthough it should be noted that questionable pr actices certainly extended beyond housing markets.3 \nBetween 2004 and the early part of 2007, the housi ng market had experien ced significant price \nappreciation, rapid expansion of construction of new houses and condom iniums in some markets, and \na willingness by many investors to provide fina ncing to higher-risk bor rowers (using reduced \nunderwriting standards).  The willingness to lend to  borrowers who represented higher credit risks – \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 9:30 PM on Tuesday, April 14, 2009 U.S. Eastern Time or Upon Delivery, and \n10:30 AM on Wednesday, April 15, 2009 in Seoul, Korea \n \n \n \n 5generally by largely unregulated mortgage companies, not traditional banks – was fueled by the \nincreased ability to secu ritize subprime loans.   \nThe securitization process took pools of subprime mortgages and split the income streams into \ntranches that would bear the first losses in the ev ent of payment disruption, and tranches that would \nbear losses only after the lower tranches were wiped out.  Because the odds were viewed as very \nsmall that losses would be so severe as to wipe ou t the lower tranches and affect the upper tranches, \nsellers of subprime mortga ge-backed securities could market th e tranches protected from most losses \nas Triple-A rated securities.   \nThe result was that lenders that normally would not have been interested in riskier subprime \nmortgage loans in the United States, including many foreign investors, were willing to purchase such \nsecurities primarily based on their Triple A ratings, rather than by car eful credit anal ysis involving the \ncharacteristics of the underlying collateral.4 \n While the ability to finance mortgages with securitization helped fuel the housing boom in the United States, other countries that did not have s ubstantial subprime lending al so saw rapid increases \nin their real estate prices.  As shown in Figure 1 , Ireland, the United Kingdo m, and Spain all saw \nresidential house prices expand mo re rapidly than did the United States.  However, there were \ncountries where residential real estate prices did not experience rapid apprecia tion – such as Japan and \nSouth Korea.  Figure 2  shows that in some countries the gr owth in housing prices was much more \nrapid than the growth in incomes.   One explanation for the rapid in crease in some countries’ house \nprices is that during this peri od, nations that enjoyed significan t trade surpluses or were the \nbeneficiaries of the commodity-price boom looked for investment opportunities ; they gravitated to \ncountries where real assets were  appreciating and where financial institutions or financial markets \nwere readily able to conver t large pools of savings into  investment opportunities.  \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 9:30 PM on Tuesday, April 14, 2009 U.S. Eastern Time or Upon Delivery, and \n10:30 AM on Wednesday, April 15, 2009 in Seoul, Korea \n \n \n \n 6In the United States, there existed signifi cant demand for houses, including among low- and \nmoderate-income households that looked to particip ate in the housing boom.  The securitization of \nsubprime mortgages provided a large pool of high-g rade securities that pa id higher returns than \nTreasury securities.  These securities  were attractive not only to U.S.  investors but al so to investors \naround the world looking for highly-rated securities.  As shown in Figure 3 , beginning in 2003 subprime mortga ges accounted for an increasing \nshare of new mortgages in the United States.  As the supply of low- and moderate-income borrowers \nwith some capital and reasonable credit scores dwi ndled, there emerged an increased willingness to \nprovide loans to borrowers with little or no money down.   With rating agencies not sufficiently \ndifferentiating their ratings to ta ke into account worsening underwri ting standards, and housing prices \nin some markets beginning to decline as the eco nomy slowed, the default rates on many pools of \nmortgages began to increase.  As the extent of the problems became apparent in the summer of 2007, \nfinancial markets became increasingly unwilling to hold securities backed by mortgages, became \nwary of the reliability of ratings, and began to ques tion the size of the direct and indirect exposure of \nfinancial institutions.  \nThe Role of a Systemic Regulator \n A starting point for an effective systemic regul ator would be to caref ully monitor any rapid \nappreciation of a particular asset class, and any rapid expansion of particular financial institutions or financial markets.  While rapid growth in asset prices  would not in and of itse lf necessitate any direct \nactions, it should cause a systemic re gulator to ask several questions. \n First, can one develop a plausible fundamentals-bas ed explanation of the rapid rise in prices?   \nMany if not all past financial cris es were associated with bubbles in asset prices, and in many cases \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 9:30 PM on Tuesday, April 14, 2009 U.S. Eastern Time or Upon Delivery, and \n10:30 AM on Wednesday, April 15, 2009 in Seoul, Korea \n \n \n \n 7careful observers could eventually identify the appreciation as suspicio usly detached from \nfundamentals.  But there also will be cases in which the introduction of a new technology or the \nopening of new markets will justify a fairly rapid appr eciation in an asset price that may not need to \nbe viewed as worrisome.   Second, is the rapid growth in an asset cl ass financed by leveraged institutions?   Losses at \nleveraged institutions tend to have a disproportio nate negative impact because the deleveraging \nprocess (in shorthand, reigning in as sets like loans to maintain a r easonable cap ital-to-assets ratio at \nthe institution) has a broad impact on the borrowers who depend on the financial intermediary for loans.  In addition, most leveraged financial inst itutions have extensive counterparty exposures to \nother financial institutions, raising the risk that counterparties will call for additional collateral from \ninterconnected institutions  they see faltering, which can exacer bate problems with capitalization. \n Third, has the rapid expansion of  the financing caused any financ ial institutions to increase \ntheir leverage?   Increases in leverage make a financial intermediary more at risk should losses be \nincurred. \n Fourth, has there been a signifi cant change in the mismatch involved in funding long-term \nassets with short-term liabilities?   While the transformation of fundi ng is an integral role for many \nfinancial intermediaries, significant changes in asset- liability maturity structur e can make the financial \nintermediary susceptible to liquidity  problems, particularly if falling asset prices reduce confidence in \nthe financial intermediary.    In the most recent experience, all of these questions would need to be answered in the \naffirmative.  As I mentioned earlier, real estate pr ices rose rapidly.  A more  subtle dynamic involved \nhow leveraged financial instituti ons financed the growth.  Many la rge commercial banks held Triple-\nA rated securities, or held these securities in off-balance sheet conduits.  While it was well understood \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 9:30 PM on Tuesday, April 14, 2009 U.S. Eastern Time or Upon Delivery, and \n10:30 AM on Wednesday, April 15, 2009 in Seoul, Korea \n \n \n \n 8that these financial institutions were involved in the originate-to-d istribute model of mortgage lending \nand securitization, what was less understood was the nature and exte nt of the holdings within the \nTriple-A securities.   \nBecause of their perceived low credit risk, Trip le-A rated securities received relatively little \nattention by bank examiners, particularly as real esta te prices were appreciating.  In addition, I think it \nis important to note that three of the largest exposures were held by a commercial bank, an investment \nbank, and a foreign bank, which likely made th e potential problem less obvious to any single \nregulator.  The increase in leverage was most obvious fo r the investment banks, which had become very \nlarge players in securitizing assets .  In part, the securitization was financed by holding large pools of \nmortgage assets and financing them through short- term repurchase agreements .  The result was that \ninvestment banks had not only increa sed their leverage significantly (see  Figure 4)  but they had also \nincreased the mismatch of the terms of their assets and liabilities.  This made the investment banks \nthat were actively originating and distributing mortga ges at greater risk should investors become less \nconfident in their organizations.  Because no one was charged with systemic re gulation, the problematic links among an array \nof key factors were largely missed, until the problems had become quite severe.  Those factors included rising real estate prices , changes in underwriting standards by largely unregulated mortgage \nbrokers, the rapid rise in securi tization outside of supervisors’  purview, the dependence on credit \nratings that are largely unregulate d, the increased holdings of highly ra ted securities both off and on \nbalance sheets, and the change in leverage and as set-liability composition of investment banks.  A \nsystemic regulator charged with taking an “aerial view” – understanding changes in markets and how \nthey impact leveraged institutions – would likely have intervened earlier, if operating effectively.   \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 9:30 PM on Tuesday, April 14, 2009 U.S. Eastern Time or Upon Delivery, and \n10:30 AM on Wednesday, April 15, 2009 in Seoul, Korea \n \n \n \n 9 This brings up a related point.  Recent events suggest that an effective syst emic regulator must \nhave very detailed understanding of institutional practices and products – simply put, how things \nreally work, in good times and bad.  For exampl e, securitization grew rapidly, and while many \nobservers did take note, it took mu ch longer to come to understand th e complexities of the servicing \nbusiness model and the reasons why it presents challe nges in a declining mark et.  Another example is \nthe market for credit default swaps, which ballo oned but still seems less well understood than is \ndesirable. \nIn sum, you might say that a systemic regulator must connect potential dots – not just actual \ndots.  Assuming the systemic regulator has the ability to monitor solvency risk, liquidity risk, and risk \nmanagement practices, and react to practices view ed as unsafe or unsound, some of the most serious \nfinancial problems might have been id entified, and their se verity lessened. \n \nInternational Coordination \n Financial problems at leverage d institutions increasingly requir e international coordination.  \nWhile the subprime market was larg ely a U.S. phenomenon, the run-up in  real estate prices was not \nunique to the United States.  Othe r countries experienced rapid appr eciation in real estate, though the \nfinancing vehicles were different.   \nIn the United States both domestic and fore ign financial instituti ons were involved.  In \naddition, many of the American institutions had a significant global footprint.  Thus, the \naforementioned deleveraging process impacts any count ry where the leveraged institutions are active.  \nThe financial assets were also being sold worldw ide.  The result was that losses were correlated \nwithout much regard to national borders, and ex posures to the subprime market appeared in a \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 9:30 PM on Tuesday, April 14, 2009 U.S. Eastern Time or Upon Delivery, and \n10:30 AM on Wednesday, April 15, 2009 in Seoul, Korea \n \n \n \n 10surprising variety of financial inte rmediaries.  Thus, the actions of intermediaries in one country can \nhave a significant spillover to ot her countries’ financial systems. \nAs financial intermediaries become more gl obal, resolution becomes more difficult.  The \nresolution of a large global  player is quite different  than resolution of a pure ly domestic institution.  A \nglobally active institution placed into receivership in the home country may quickly find that its \nability to transfer deposits, cash, and capital is hamp ered as host countries impose controls to protect \nliability holders in thei r own country.  So, until global resoluti on policies are adopted, resolution of \ninternationally active organizations will remain problematic.  \nBeyond this issue of the resoluti on of individual organizations, it seems clear that effective \nsystemic regulators will need to understand how the actions of financial intermediaries in one country \naffect other countries’ financial systems.  This w ill be both extremely important and, potentially, very \nchallenging.  \nSummary Observations \n Most countries, including the United States, do not currently have a systemic regulator.  In \norder for a systemic regulator to be effective, th e regulator clearly needs to be able to identify \nproblematic situations like those I have describe d today.  Had there been some entity charged with \nsuch responsibilities, my hope is that sufficient “red  flags” would have emerged to give such an entity \nthe opportunity to prevent, or at least mitigate, some  of the problems.  At the same time, my remarks \ntoday should also convey the profound challenges that a systemic regulator would face.  Of course, \nthe next time a crisis begins, the patterns may be very different. \nAnd while the ability to identify emerging system ic problems is critical, it is not enough.  To \nhave an effective systemic regula tor, obviously having sufficient author ity to change be havior is also \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 9:30 PM on Tuesday, April 14, 2009 U.S. Eastern Time or Upon Delivery, and \n10:30 AM on Wednesday, April 15, 2009 in Seoul, Korea \n \n \n \n 11critically important.  The issue of authority is, however, too large a t opic to be covered today.  I know \nthat I, and many of you, will be exploring th at topic in the days and weeks ahead.   \nI want to conclude by reiterating my strong hope th at the recent crisis wi ll provide not only the \nopportunity but also the urgency an d will for a thorough, global reexamination of how we think about \nsystemic problems and their mitigation and resolution.  And of course, as our nations consider the role \nof a systemic regulator it will be important that they have the ability to interact in a coordinated way \nwith their regulatory counterparts around the world.  \nThank you. \n                                                   \n \n \nNOTES: \n \n1  The views I express today are my own, not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Board of \nGovernors or the Federal Open Market Committee (the FOMC).  \n2  Other warning flags might include the emergen ce of exceptionally complicated or otherwise opaque \nfinancial instruments with contractual terms that are not widely understood.  \n \n3  For example, participation in auction-rate mark ets represented a good-faith effort by municipalities to \nachieve lower interest rates on their borrowings, but in  essence financed longer-term assets with short-term \nliabilities.  The complexity of some such arrangements obscured such problems and,  unfortunately, when the \ncrisis emerged there was a negative effect on such markets and some municipalities.  \n \n4  I discussed some of the shortcomings surrounding rati ngs and their role in the crisis in a speech in \nMarch 2008 available at http://www.bos.frb.o rg/news/speeches/rosengren/2008/030608.htm.   \n\nFigure 1\nReal Home Price Appreciation\n1990 - 2007\nSource:  OECD\n\n\nFigure 2\nRatio of Nominal House Price to Per Capita \nDisposable Income\n1991 - 2007\nSource:  OECD\n\n\nFigure 3\nSubprime Share of Dollar Volume of Mortgage \nLoan Originations in the United States\n2001 - 2007\nSource:  The 2008 Mortgage Market Statistical Annual\n\n\nFigure 4\nLeverage Ratio for Investment Banks\nas of Fiscal Year End, 2002 - 2008\nSource:  Company 10-K SEC filings",

            "content": "Good morning, and welcome to the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston.\nI’m Paul Connolly, chief operating officer of the Bank.  On behalf of my Bank colleagues, and our friends at the Greater Boston Chamber of Commerce, I want to thank you for being with us today for this Workshop on Internships. \nWe believe you will find today’s Workshop to be both interesting and valuable, in large measure because of the terrific panelists, and breakout session leaders, who bring so much to the program.  My thanks to all of them.\nThe Workshop will be valuable as well because of you.  We have a rich cross-section of employers and academic institutions represented in the room.  Our program provides for lots of discussion, and for networking.  Please take advantage of these opportunities for mutual learning.\nOur Workshop this morning represents follow-through on two important research reports issued in the fall of 2008.  The Boston Fed issued one, and the Chamber of Commerce, working with Mercer, issued the other.  Both are available here this morning if you have not already read them.\nThe two studies together comprise a call to action, for Greater Boston and the broader New England region.\nTheir message is that although the region’s skilled, educated labor force has been an engine of economic growth in the past, New England’s advantage is being eroded.\nThe research conducted by my colleague Alicia Sasser at the Boston Fed shows that the supply of recent college graduates is growing more slowly in New England than in the rest of the nation, partly because new graduates go elsewhere to get jobs.\nMoreover, the study conducted by Mercer for the Chamber finds that Greater Boston is not growing its skilled workforce fast enough to meet employers’ needs, and that gaps already exist in both professional and technical occupations.\nTo address these issues comprehensively will take multiple approaches, some of them longer-term in nature.\nOne promising short-term strategy for increasing the supply of skilled, educated  workers in New England is to expand the use of internships, to retain a higher percentage of college students graduating from our colleges and universities.\nOur higher education institutions attract local young people, and students from all over the country, and excel at producing highly skilled college graduates.\nSurveys consistently reveal that recent college grads who leave New England do so primarily for job-related reasons, often without being fully aware of local job opportunities.\nExpanding the use of internships would help college students to learn more about local opportunities, and to form networks and connections in the region.\nDuring the past few months, the Chamber and the Fed have convened a small group of business leaders, and senior people from a few universities, to develop a plan for expanding and strengthening internships in Greater Boston.\nThe group includes PriceWaterhouse Coopers, Citizens Bank, Blue Cross/Blue Shield, Genzyme, Mercer, Bentley, Northeastern, and Boston University.  And we’ll be reaching out more broadly as we go.\nWe agreed to focus on four initiatives in the near term. Our first initiative is this Workshop. In addition, we want to explore the possibility of some form of an online clearinghouse, to make internship opportunities more visible in ways that might help students, colleges, and employers.\nWhenever we mention it, we find that there are a lot of ideas about how this might be done.  We look forward to learning more, and your assistance is welcome.\nA third initiative will be to add value to this year’s internships.  We will look to do a few things this summer that might help to give college interns some broader knowledge about Boston and the region, and increase their feeling of belonging here, and wanting to stay here after graduation.\nFor example, we might invite employers with interns to ask the interns to come here to the Bank for an afternoon, to hear about the economy, and the roles of the Federal Reserve Bank.  That might be of some interest this year.\nOur fourth near-term initiative will be outreach.  We know there are numerous organizations in the region, both public and private, engaged in similar or related activities.  We want to connect with them, let them see what we are doing, learn about their plans, and see where we might be able to help each other.  Here also, your help is welcome.\nSome of the employers in this room have highly successful internship programs that already are working well as channels to full-time employment for the talented people they need.  We can learn from you, and   you may pick up some ideas today about how to be even more successful.\nThe majority of employers may be more like the Boston Fed.  We have college interns every year; we attract great young people; they do good work during the summer; and occasionally interns become employees after graduation.\nHowever, we want to use our internships more strategically.  We want to use more of them as low-cost, low-risk opportunities to look a year or two ahead, think about our expected employment needs, and hire interns who might be matches for those future needs.\nThe Bank, and the Chamber, believe individual employers and the broader community will benefit if more employers move toward this strategic use of internships. \nWe have several colleges and universities in the room this morning.  Some have broad and deep relationships with employers that are national models.  Others are looking to develop or grow such relationships.  We anticipate that you will learn from this Workshop, and from each other, and will make new contacts with employers as well as peers.\nOf course we all realize that we are facing strong headwinds this year when it comes to internships and employment.\nBusiness conditions are tough.  Most companies are making cut-backs, may not be focused on future employment needs, and may not be planning to do as much with college interns this year as they otherwise might.\nJust two points to consider.  First, the labor supply issues we face in Greater Boston and New England are long-term issues.  When economic conditions improve, as they will, the problem still will be with us, and the fight for talented recent graduates with needed skills will pick up again.  Internships are not difficult or costly, and when used strategically can position us better for tomorrow.\nSecond, one really inexpensive option is unpaid internships that provide academic credit for the students.  This approach can be particularly attractive during the academic year, say in the fall semester or the spring semester.  We have people on the program and in the audience who can explain how to work with colleges and students to set up such internships.  It could be another way to get to a win-win for everyone.\nThis Workshop is happening because Eric Rosengren, the President of the Bank, and Paul Guzzi, President and CEO of the Chamber, wanted follow-through on last fall’s studies.  They wanted to put research into action.  They wanted to bring people together to work on initiatives that would make a difference.  With their leadership, and your help, we’re doing it.  Thank you.   ",

In the past year, crises and resulting failure s of a number of larg e internationally active \nfinancial firms have rippled across and weakened  the global economy.  Events demonstrated the \nglaring absence of resolution powers in the Unite d States – except in the case of banks – and \n\n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 6:45 AM, Tuesday, May 5, 2009 U.S. Eastern Time an d 6:45 PM Tuesday, May 5, 2009 in Hong Kong – or Upon Deliver y \n \n \n \n 2demonstrated the limited ability of U.S. authori ties to intervene in troubled non-depository financial \ninstitutions, at least before the pa ssage of the TARP legislation.   \nThis state of affairs left the United States lacking the tools to smoothly address the failures of \n“systemically important” institutions – those whose disorderly failure could potentially lead to a drop \nin confidence in the global banking system, seize-ups in credit markets, the collapse of other financial \ninstitutions, and worsening economic conditions. 2  Many others, including Chairman Bernanke, have \nnoted the urgent need to address the lack of reso lution authority.3   Of course, difficulties dealing with \nfinancial troubles in several Eur opean countries have shown that the United States is not alone. \nSo clearly, the role played by financial institution s in the current crisis has laid bare the need \nto rethink how systemically important financial ins titutions should be regulated and, if they fail, how \nthey should be resolved.  As you know, policymakers in the U.S. and many other countries are right \nnow working through the intricate and challenging issu es associated with cr eating a more effective \nregulatory structure, making forums li ke this both timely and important.   \nIn a recent talk,4 I expressed my view that we need to have organizations with explicit \nresponsibility for financial stability  (that is, charged with making su re that “contagi ous” failures of \nfinancial institutions do not occur,  and alert to trends emerging across a swath of interconnected \ninstitutions and th eir counterparties5).  I argued in that talk that a regulator explicitly charged with \naddressing financial stability probabl y could have spotted some of th e financial trends leading up to \nthe crisis.  In my remarks today, I would like to make some observations related to questions about \nthe powers a systemic regulator would have needed  in order to mitigate some of the problems we \nhave seen.  \nAs you consider the perspectives I share this evening, I encourag e you to keep at the back of \nyour mind the scale of these regulato ry challenges.  In the end we ne ed to be able to address these \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 6:45 AM, Tuesday, May 5, 2009 U.S. Eastern Time an d 6:45 PM Tuesday, May 5, 2009 in Hong Kong – or Upon Deliver y \n \n \n \n 3complex questions, and adequately empower those in the systemic-regulatory and resolution roles.  If \nwe cannot, we will do well to find other ways to limit systemic risks.   \nIn particular I will focus on the need for a systemic regulator to be able to address firms’ \nglobal operations , and the increased use of financial derivatives .  These are key issues because \nfinancial institutions are likely to have a larger gl obal presence over time, and to be more active in \nfinancial derivatives.  Both trends represent th e normal outgrowth of gl obally integrated economies \nand financial markets, and are not necessarily unwelcome or unhealthy.  But the critical point is that \nthe roles and powers of supervisors and regulators have not kept up with these developments.    \nAllow me to make one important  distinction at the outset.  My remarks today touch on both \nsystemic regulation  and on the resolution  of systemically important institutions.  Clearly these roles \ncould be carried out by either one  entity or by two separate entit ies – a systemic regulator and a \nresolver of systemically important institutions .  My remarks touch on both functions, while for \nsimplicity I tend to refer in my own shorthand to  a “systemic regulator” – but the distinction is \nimportant.  \nResolution of Systemically Important Institutions \n The financial crisis has highlighted the pressi ng need for better reso lution procedures.  For \nbanking organizations, the FDIC has the abilit y to place banks under receivership without going \nthrough bankruptcy proceedings.  However, these re solution powers apply only to banks, not other \nnon-bank financial firms, and do not a pply to bank holding companies.    \nThe resolution power of the FDIC allows the FDIC to conduct an orderly resolution of the \nbank, which protects depositors and provides the least- cost solution to the government.  In the case of \nbank holding companies and non-depository financial institutions, insolvency must be addressed in \nbankruptcy court.  Unfortunately, bankruptcy procedures are designe d to provide a clear priority \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 6:45 AM, Tuesday, May 5, 2009 U.S. Eastern Time an d 6:45 PM Tuesday, May 5, 2009 in Hong Kong – or Upon Deliver y \n \n \n \n 4among creditors, but do not provide a ny special provisions for an insolv ency that has broad systemic \nimplications.  In such situations, it is very po ssible that a preferable public policy would be to \nminimize systemic implications rather than follow the normal creditor priority set out in the bankruptcy code.  Consider this argument in relation to the Lehm an Brothers failure.  The government lacked \nany resolution powers in the case of investment  banks, and Lehman had no immediate merger \npossibilities, so Lehman was fo rced to file for bankruptcy.  The Lehman failure had broad \nimplications for the financial system and economy.  The firm was internationally active, engaged \nactively in derivatives contracts, and a count erparty to many other fi nancial institutions.  Figure 1,  \nwhich shows legal proceedings resulting from th e Lehman bankruptcy filing, is instructive.  \nHad there existed the authority and procedures  to resolve Lehman outside of bankruptcy \nproceedings, there may have been a much more or derly “wind down” of Lehm an’s operations.  Of \ncourse, the Lehman failure suggests that even with  resolution powers in place this would have been a \nvery challenging situation – Lehman would have been  difficult to wind down, in part because of the \nscope of its global operations.  Lehman Brothers operated in over 40 countri es and had over 650 dis tinct legal operating \nentities outside of the United States. While there were many separate legal entities outside of the \nUnited States, the firm was managed globally — m eaning many of its risk management and operating \nplatforms stretched across its many distinct entities.   \nIn the event Lehman Brothers had been placed in receivership in the United States, it is \nunclear how Lehman’s operations outside the Unit ed States would have been treated in foreign \njurisdictions.  In such situations it is possible that a country would tr y to “ring fence” assets so that \nliability holders in the country would be paid prior to returni ng funds to a foreign parent.   \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 6:45 AM, Tuesday, May 5, 2009 U.S. Eastern Time an d 6:45 PM Tuesday, May 5, 2009 in Hong Kong – or Upon Deliver y \n \n \n \n 5Such a situation raises a number of interesti ng questions concerning the role of a systemic \nregulator.  I would like to provide  my own perspective on some of these questions – “straw man” \napproaches, if you will:  \n• First, for globally active and systemically im portant U.S. institutions , I suspect that the \npotential disruptions to operations associated with ring fencing will likely mean that capital \nsupport of foreign operations (that is, capital injec tions) will be a critical part of the resolution \nprocedures.  As a consequence, the systemic regu lator would need to have the power to inject \ncapital or request that the Treasury inject capital.   \n• Second, given the speed with which failures have occurred, it may be difficult to incorporate \nlegislative oversight of the reso lution process in the short-term – so an understanding of such \narrangements should be worked out betw een Congress and the systemic regulator. \n• Third, international agreements on receivership procedures for globally active institutions will \nbe necessary.  What institutions or agencies wi ll have a role in negotiating these procedures?  I \ncertainly believe that a systemic regulator should have a role. \n• Fourth, I would note that policymakers will ha ve to sort out the appropriate uses of \nconservatorship (operating the bank as a going c oncern) versus receivership (which has the \ngoal of liquidation) in the case of systemically important institutions. \n• Fifth, a systemic regulator may need the ability to  require reductions in foreign exposures as a \nsystemically important financial institution en counters problems.  This might include the \nability to require that foreign subsidiaries a nd branches be sold to avoid broader systemic \nproblems, as financial problems increase. \n• Sixth, perhaps the systemic regulator will need to be able to influence the “home/host” rules \nthat govern the division of labor in the supe rvision of internati onally active firms. \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 6:45 AM, Tuesday, May 5, 2009 U.S. Eastern Time an d 6:45 PM Tuesday, May 5, 2009 in Hong Kong – or Upon Deliver y \n \n \n \n 6• Seventh, a systemic regulator may need the abi lity to require higher capital requirements for \nglobally active financial institutions  that will be difficult to resolve if they become insolvent. \n \nBeyond these challenges related to global operati ons, a second problem highlighted by the \ncrisis is the difficulty in managing the derivativ es book of global financia l institutions.  While \nderivatives contracts were a problem in the case of Lehman’s failure, they were particularly acute in \nthe case of American International Group (AIG).  Because of the pres ence of complicated, interrelated \nfinancial contracts the unwinding of the derivatives positions of  AIG has been costly and time \nconsuming.   \nIncreasingly, derivatives and othe r forms of structured finance ar e inherent in the operations of \nlarge global financial institutions.  However, the presence of a small number of global financial \ninstitutions as significant counter parties or dealers in the derivatives markets has made such \ninstitutions very difficult to reso lve, whether through bankr uptcy or through receivership.  This raises \nseveral interesting issues and questions, wh ich I will provide my own current views on: \n \n• First and very importantly, I believe a systemic re gulator should have the ability to require that \ntransactions be moved to an exchange as the contract becomes standardized and widely used. \n• Second, I believe that in findi ng the most efficient way to resolve complicated financial \ntransactions in the event a majo r player becomes insolvent, the systemic regulator would need \nthe ability to explore whether bankruptcy, re ceivership, conservatorship, or governmental \nequity ownership would provide the best model for resolving complicated financial \ntransactions that affect a large number of financial institu tions around the globe. \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 6:45 AM, Tuesday, May 5, 2009 U.S. Eastern Time an d 6:45 PM Tuesday, May 5, 2009 in Hong Kong – or Upon Deliver y \n \n \n \n 7• Third, a systemic regulator may need the ability to  require financial institutions to reduce their \nderivatives exposure as they become financiall y troubled.  This might include the ability to \nrequire the selling of broker or  dealer operations in major ma rkets as a firm’s financial \nposition deteriorates. \n• Fourth, a systemic regulator will likely need th e ability to require higher capital requirements \nfor firms that are active count erparties or dealers in co mplicated financial products. \n \nFuture Resolution Challenges \n While the problems of 2008 highlighted the difficu lty of resolving financial institutions with \nlarge global operations and active in volvement in derivatives, these problems are likely to be even \nmore important in the future.  Figure 2  highlights the importance of foreign banking operations for \nU.S. commercial banks.  Looking forward, as more and more customers of financial institutions are \neither global themselves, or have supply lines and sa les channels that are global, they will expect their \nfinancial institutions to have global operations.  U. S. banks that are internationally active hold 18 \npercent of assets in foreign offices.  Over time, foreign operations seem mo re likely to grow than \ncontract in an increa singly global economy. \nAs U.S. financial institutions become more involved around the gl obe, it is likely that these \ninstitutions will become more important in their host countries and more difficult to resolve should \nthey become financially troubled.  In this regard, I would suggest the following about some of the key \nissues that will emerge: \n \n• First, a key issue will involve the willingness of home and hos t countries to supervise and, \nmore importantly, potentially bear the burden of financially supporti ng the operations of a \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 6:45 AM, Tuesday, May 5, 2009 U.S. Eastern Time an d 6:45 PM Tuesday, May 5, 2009 in Hong Kong – or Upon Deliver y \n \n \n \n 8large and systemically important financial institution, if it beco mes troubled.  This could alter \nwhat we have traditionally seen as th e roles of home and host supervisors. \n• Second, it will be important to determine how best to structure U.S. financial firms abroad, to \nminimize the potential for disruption if the firm becomes insolvent. \n \nOf course, foreign firms have signifi cant involvement in the U.S. economy.  Figure 3  shows \nthe share of U.S. bank assets held by foreign owners .  British, Canadian, German, and Swiss banks all \nhave a major presence in the United States.  Some foreign banks operate large subsidiaries in the \nUnited States; others have very large branch opera tions.  As a result, if the parent company has \nfinancial problems, it can have a downstream imp act on the U.S. economy.  Should foreign banks \nshrink as a result of financial problems, U.S. borrowe rs may find it more difficult to secure financing.  \nThis too raises several questions, about which I observe the following: \n \n• First, it will be important to de termine whether there should be a preference for branch versus \nsubsidiary structures in systemically important institutions. \n• Second, where the financial institutions are large relative to the size of the home country, there \nwill need to be expectations and obligations of the home country.  How explicit these should \nbe will need to be determined.  We should note that in some countries, systemically important \nfinancial institutions figure very prominently in the country’s economy – more so, in relation to the country’s GDP, than any one U.S. financ ial institution does in relation to U.S. GDP. \n \nDerivatives contracts have become increasingly important for financial institutions – to \nsupport their customers, to serve as brokers or deal ers, and to hedge their own positions.  Over time, \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 6:45 AM, Tuesday, May 5, 2009 U.S. Eastern Time an d 6:45 PM Tuesday, May 5, 2009 in Hong Kong – or Upon Deliver y \n \n \n \n 9the size of the gross derivatives positions of the five largest commercial banking organizations most \nengaged in derivatives activity has become quite large relative to their assets ( Figure 4 ).  These \npositions are likely to get larger over time, and substantial derivatives operations are likely to be important for more and more financial institutions .  Given their complexity and likely growth, we \nneed to explore the implications for bank regulation a nd the role of a systemic regulator, and indeed to \nbetter understand their potential impact.\n6 \n \nConcluding Observations \nGreater integration of the world economy a nd financial markets is both desirable and \ninevitable.  However, our ability to manage insolv ency risk of key players has not grown with these \ndevelopments.  The presence of globally active financial institutions involved in derivatives \noperations world-wide requires a major rethinking of how we supe rvise and regulate systemically \nimportant institutions.  Until global resolution policie s are adopted, resolution of internationally active \norganizations will remain problematic. \nBoth issues I have discussed today – global activity and deriva tives involvement – would be \nimportant for any regulator charged with systemic responsibilities.  Of course, a systemic regulator \nwill need to consider many other issues besides th e two I have highlighted today – including issues \nlike leverage, liability management, and securiti zation – but given the constraints on time these \nadditional issues will have to be a topic for another day.  Bankruptcy laws and resolution procedures are national.  Home  country financial supervisors \nhave a national focus, and bank re gulations apply within the firms’  national borders.  However, as \nfinancial firms increasingly span national borders, much gr eater coordination is necessary.  This is \nparticularly true as the size of fi nancial institutions’ on- and off-balance sheet exposures become large \nrelative to the home country’s financial capacity to provide emergency support to the financial \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 6:45 AM, Tuesday, May 5, 2009 U.S. Eastern Time an d 6:45 PM Tuesday, May 5, 2009 in Hong Kong – or Upon Deliver y \n \n \n \n 10institution.  In some countries the focus of fina ncial institution re solution has seemingly been the \nprotection of government-run deposit- insurance programs – a local mindset at odds with a potentially \nglobal issue.  Increasingly thei r attention will need to focus on potential systemic problems with \nglobal ramifications.       I hope my remarks today have provided a se nse of the urgency, and also the complexity, of \nthese issues.  I have given my own views on some  of the key questions that policymakers must \nultimately consider.  I’ll conclude by noting that the complexity  of these issues makes it no less \nimportant that we address them, for the good of all participants in our economies. \n Thank you. \n                                                 \n \n \nNOTES: \n \n \n1  Of course, the views I express today are my own, no t necessarily those of my colleagues on the Board of \nGovernors or the Federal Open Market Committee (the FOMC). \n \n \n2  In remarks on April 14, 2009, Chairman Bernanke noted that “Large, complex financial institutions tend to be \nhighly interconnected with other firms and markets... For example, AIG… [A] disorderly failure of AIG would have put at \nrisk not only the company's own custom ers and creditors but the entire global financial system. Historical experience \nshows that, once begun, a financial panic can spread rapidly and unpredictably; indeed, the failure of Lehman Brothers a \nday earlier, which the Fed and the Treasury unsuccessfully tried to prevent, resulted in the freezing up of a wide range of \ncredit markets, with extr emely serious consequences for the world economy. The financial and economic risks posed by a \ncollapse of AIG would have been at least as great as those created by the demise of Lehman. In the case of AIG, financial \nmarket participants were keenly aware that many major financ ial institutions around the world were insured by or had lent \nfunds to the company. The company's failure would thus likely have led to a further sharp decline in confidence in the \nglobal banking system and possibly to the collapse of other major financial institutions. At best, the consequences of \nAIG's failure would have been a significant intensification of an already severe financial crisis and a further worsening of economic conditions. Conceivably, its failure could have triggered a 1930s-style global financial and economic meltdown, \nwith catastrophic implications for production, incomes, and jobs.”  (from “Four Questions about the Financial Crisis,” \navailable at http://www.federalreserve.gov/ newsevents/speech/bernanke20090414a.htm) \n \n \n3  In remarks on April 14, 2009, Chairman Bernanke noted “that federal regulators urgently need a new set of \nprocedures for dealing with a complex, systemically important financial institution on the brink of failure. Such rules \nalready exists for banks: If a bank a pproaches insolvency, the FDIC is empowe red to intervene as needed to protect \ndepositors, sell the bank's assets, and take any necessary step s to prevent broader consequences to the financial system. \nHowever, for an insurance conglomerate like AIG, or for a large financial holding company that owns many subsidiary \ncompanies, these rules do not apply. Among other things, a good system for resolving nonbank financial institutions \nwould allow federal regulators to unwind a failing company in  ways that minimize disruptions in financial markets.

My assumption is that a financial-stability regulator would \nbe charged with making sure that what I will call “contagious” fa ilures of financial institutions do not occur.  Such failures \ncould involve a large group of financial intermediaries, all w ith a prominent shared risk exposure, or could involve one \nkey player becoming insolvent but many other financial institu tions failing because of their e xposure as counterparties to \nthat institution.  This definition does not require that the involved organizations are depository institutions, nor does it \nhinge on the presence of deposit insurance.  A key point is th at the systemic regulator cannot just look institution by \ninstitution, but needs to think about the potentially difficult trends emerging across a swath of interconnected institutions \nand their counterparties.  And while it may go without saying, fo r a systemic regulator to be effective, the regulator needs \nto be able to identify whether actual sy stemic problems are emergi ng.  This involves, in part, assessing the “feedback \neffects” that might result from initial problems.  \n  \n6  As I noted in a recent speech, an effective systemic re gulator would need to have ve ry detailed understanding of \ninstitutional practices and products – simply put, how things really work, in good times and bad.  For example, the \ncomplexities of the servicing business model and the reasons wh y it presents challenges in a declining market.  Another \nexample is the market for credit default swaps, which ballo oned but still seems less well understood than is desirable. \n\nFigure 1\nLegal Proceedings as a Result of \nLehman Brothers Holdings Inc.

Rosengren \nPresident & Chief Executive Officer \nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston \n \nThe Worcester Economic Club \nWorcester, Massachusetts \n \nMay 21, 2009 \n \n \n \n Thank you for inviting me to join you this ev ening to talk about re cent economic trends \nand prospects for recovery.1  As you know all too well, the econo my has been in the throes of a \nparticularly long and severe recession.  The national unemployment rate has more than doubled from its low of 4.4 percent before the “peak” of th e business cycle.  All of us in this room are \nwell aware of the toll on individuals and househol ds brought by job losses, so this is indeed \nsobering. \nHowever, incoming data have been mixed of la te – rather than solely negative – and the \nstock market has improved significantly from its low point in March.  After two quarters where \nreal GDP shrank by more than 6 percent,\n2 I expect that the economy will contract by much less \nthan that this quarter, and that we will begin to  see positive growth – pe rhaps by the end of the \nyear. \n\n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL Thurs., May 21, 2009 at 7: 45 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY \n  \n \n2 \n The severity of the recession has led both fis cal and monetary policymakers to implement \naggressive responses.  The Federal Reserve acted  aggressively on the monetary front, and the \nAdministration and the Congress on the fiscal fron t with the stimulus le gislation.  While these \npolicies will still take some time to have their full  impact, they are in my view part of the reason \nthe rate of decline in the economy seems to be slowing. \nCertainly any near-term recovery is predicat ed on continued healing of the financial \nmarkets and financial system that underpin the ec onomy.  This is an outcome that is hoped for, \nand that policymakers are working intent ly to ensure, but not yet a certainty. \n Nonetheless I hope the debate will soon center on  the nature of the recovery, rather than \nthe severity of the recession.  It  is a positive sign that some an alysts are beginning to speculate \non the likely nature of an economic recovery – and, indeed, that a talk focused on aspects of \nrecovery is now quite relevant. \nCertainly a wide range of view s have been expressed, with references to L, U, and V \nshaped recessions.  While I am at heart very much  an optimist, my own vi ew of the situation is \nthat due to some unusual features  of this recession the economy is likely to experience a slow \nrecovery.  I’ll mention these featur es briefly, and then explore them  with you in a bit more detail. \n• First, while the “financial freeze” has thawed  quite a bit, it will take some time for \ncomplete normalization of financial markets and lending. \n \n• Second, consumers’ “balance sheets” have been under significan t strain, in part due to a \nloss in household wealth, and improvements will take some time. \n \n \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL Thurs., May 21, 2009 at 7: 45 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY \n  \n \n3 \n • Third, a related point: the very sharp decline in  housing prices is likely to inflict some \nforms of “collateral damage.”  Labor market mobility is likel y to be hampered, financing \nfor homes is likely to be restrained, and the ab ility to use home equity to finance various \nprojects will be limited. \n \n• Fourth, the economic health of key trading partners remains somewhat fragile, so it \nwould be unwise to expect much help in the form of foreign growth that would propel our \nexport-led industries.3 \n Considering these issues and taking into accoun t the current level of fiscal and monetary \npolicy stimulus, my best judgment is that a rather slow recovery is likely.  Unfortunately, such a \nforecast implies continued weakness in the la bor market, and an unemployment rate that \ncontinues to rise through this year. \nWith significant growth in payroll employme nt unlikely until next year it will obviously \nand unfortunately be some time before we see labor  markets return to what we think of as “full \nemployment.”  And it is too soon to know when  the trough of the recession will occur, although \nthere are hopeful signs that we are nearing it. \n \nThe Employment Situation \n Allow me to make a few observations  on the employment situation.  As Figure 1  \nhighlights, we are in the midst of  a severe recession.  Since the o fficial onset of the recession in \nDecember 2007, on net, 5.7 million Amer ican jobs have been lost.4 \nWhile the 1973-75 and 1981-82 recessions brou ght peak unemployment rates above our \ncurrent level, in these and other recessions it is important to consider not just the peak level of \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL Thurs., May 21, 2009 at 7: 45 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY \n  \n \n4 \n unemployment but also the level at the beginning of the recession, and thus the percentage point \nincrease during the downturn.  Consider Figure 2 .  From the official start of this recession in \nDecember 2007, the unemployment rate has risen by 4 percentage points – a percentage-point \nincrease from the start of the recession that already exceeds what we saw in the last three \nrecessions.  And the unemployment rate is quite likely to continue to climb, although I hope at a \nmuch slower pace than in previous months. \nLabor markets tend to be somewhat lagging indicators.5  So the expectation that the \neconomy will grow below its potential for the rest  of this year suggests that the unemployment \nrate will likely rise through this year – even if we get to a state of slow positive growth in the \neconomy later this year. \n Figure 3  provides the peak-to-trough changes in several of the components of real GDP.  \nSeveral patterns are apparent.  First is the importa nt role played by reside ntial investment.  While \nresidential investment accounts for a relatively small share of GDP, it is a volatile component.  In \nthree of the past four recessions , residential investment has seen  the sharpest decline of the \ncomponents of GDP shown in the chart.  Only  the 2001 recession did no t have declines in \nresidential investment from peak to trough, primar ily because that recession involved imbalances \nin corporate balance sheets pa rtly triggered by the rapid inve stment in the “dot-com” boom.6 \n One reason residential investment is so volat ile is that it is the component of GDP most \nsensitive to changes in interest rates.  The housin g sector tends to be di sproportionately impacted \nby rising interest rates, which typically occur when monetary policymakers are working to \nprevent increases in the inflation rate. \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL Thurs., May 21, 2009 at 7: 45 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY \n  \n \n5 \n However, this residential investment cycle ha s been different.  Mort gage interest rates \nhave remained relatively low, but residential inve stment has declined shar ply as significant over-\nsupply in some key areas has led to rapidly falling housing prices, which provide a strong \nincentive to postpone a home purchase.  This  time falling house prices, coupled with rising \nunemployment rates (rather than interest rate increases) have been the main housing drivers. \nWhile the decline in residential investment from peak to trough has been much more \nsevere during this recession than the previous  three downturns, as shown in Figure 3, this \nactually understates the decline for two reasons.  First, residential investment was falling well \nbefore the official start of the recession.  The d ecline in residential invest ment began in the first \nquarter of 2006, while the official start to th e recession was not until December 2007.  Second, \nwe remain uncertain about the date of the trough of the recession, although it seems that it most \ncertainly will not be the end of the first quarter of this year. \n Also notable in this recession has been the decline in business fixed investment.  \nParticularly since the fall of last year, businesses have reac ted quite aggressively to the \nslowdown in economic activity.  Not only have th ey moved to reduce overall costs by reducing \nexpenditures for labor, but they have also slashed their investment budgets.7 \nFurther, exports have declined sharply during this downturn, as they have in three of the \npast four recessions.  But once agai n, the decline in exports to date likely understates the ultimate \nsize of the decline – because we have likely not yet reached the trough of this recession, and \nforeign economies have been weakening rath er rapidly since the start of the year. \n \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL Thurs., May 21, 2009 at 7: 45 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY \n  \n \n6 \n Economic Recovery \n Figure 4  highlights the recovery in several comp onents of the economy in the first year \nfollowing the trough of a recession.  Several interes ting patterns appear.  In the previous three \nrecoveries, the housing sector ha s shown the largest percentage change among the components of \nGDP shown in the figure.  This largely reflects th at this interest-sensiti ve component is usually \nbuoyed by the reductions in interest rates that  are the normal monetary policy response to \nrecessions.  This is why many analysts have hi ghlighted the importance of seeing the bottom of \nthe housing market for the economy to begin a true recovery. \n Another important point related to recovery is that consumption needs to grow.  While \nthe percent change in consumption looks small in the figure relative to some of the other \ncomponents, it is important to remember that c onsumption is by far the largest component of \nGDP.  Because consumption accounts for more th an two-thirds of GDP, these percent changes \nare on a large base.  In short, it is very diffi cult to have a recovery without consumers being \nwilling to spend, which was a motivation for some of  the fiscal stimulus being directed towards \nincreasing consumption. \nIn contrast, business fixed invest ment is not usually the driver in the initial stages of the \nrecovery, as businesses are hesitant to hire mo re workers and make further investments until the \nrecovery is more firmly estab lished.  Government spending also plays a role in recovery, as you \ncan see in Figure 4.  Certainly in the current recession, policymakers hope the stimulus spending \nwill play a role.  Furthermore, exports normally grow during the initial stages of a recovery.  \nThis is why it is important to  us that policymakers worldwid e respond to a recession that is \nclearly global. \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL Thurs., May 21, 2009 at 7: 45 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY \n  \n \n7 \n Impediments to a Recovery \n Normally forecasters are slow to recognize a recovery.  Just as economic models usually \ndo not foresee the depth of economic problems at the onset of a recession,  most models miss the \nspeed of the recovery.  Thus, while I do indeed ex pect the recovery to be slow, I am well aware \nof the perils in making such a fo recast – given the forecast errors often made at this time of the \ncycle.  Still, while every recession has its uni que features, this recession has involved larger \nimpacts on our economic and financial infrastructure  than others – a fact that makes my outlook \non the speed of this r ecovery rather subdued. \n The first major impediment is the financial infrastructure.  While we have seen some \nimprovements in financial firms’ stock prices , and a generally positive response to the banking \nindustry’s so-called “stress tests,” financial instit utions and financial mark ets are still recovering \nfrom recent turmoil.  As is shown in Figure 5 , despite recent improvements, bank stock prices \nremain well below their cyclical p eak, and the decline in bank stoc k prices has been more severe \nin this recession than in the previous one. \nContinued healing of financia l institutions requires recapi talization and full recognition \nand disposal of problem assets.  While there ha ve been significant st eps taken to recapitalize \nmany financial institutions, there has been slower  movement towards removal of problem assets \nfrom financial institutions’ balance sheets (alt hough the Treasury’s Pub lic-Private Investment \nProgram is intending to address th is).  Unfortunately, countries th at have experien ced significant \nbanking problems normally have a slower ec onomic recovery, as bank lending improves only \nslowly while banks remain risk-averse a nd work to repair th eir balance sheets. \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL Thurs., May 21, 2009 at 7: 45 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY \n  \n \n8 \n It is not only financial institutions that have been damaged; many short-term credit \nmarkets have been badly disrupted by recent events.  While the commercial paper market and money market funds have shown some improvement s – in part as a result of Federal Reserve \nlending facilities – short-term cr edit is still difficult to access for many firms.  Similarly, while \nwe are beginning to see some financing for securi tization of assets, the securitization market is \ndramatically smaller than before the recession.  A full economic recovery requires that financial \nmarkets as well as financial institutions return to  their role of efficiently allocating financing. \nA second significant impediment is the amount of wealth lost duri ng this downturn, as \nshown in Figure 6 .  Not only has the decline in the stock market been particularly severe, with \nmany people reluctant to look at their monthly 401K  statements, but our housing wealth has also \ndeclined significantly as housing prices have falle n – making the real esta te pages a section of \nthe Sunday paper many want to avoid.  Because of  the large loss in wealth implied by these two \ndynamics, it is likely that consumers will be slower to spend during this recovery as they seek to \nbalance their saving behavior to reflect their loss in wealth. \nA ramification of this loss in wealth is less  access to consumer fi nancing.  With home \nequity lower or gone, it is no longer a source of financing for many consumers.  In addition, the \nfinancial stress created by this recession has impaired the credit rating of many consumers, \nmaking credit less available and more costly fo r many borrowers.  In addition, many potential \nhome buyers are finding that if  they want to buy a house, le nders are requiring higher down \npayments, better credit ratings, and more income in relation to debt.  While housing credit was \nby most accounts too readily available several years ago, the current environment is likely to be \nparticularly challenging for first-time home buyers and those with modest incomes. \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL Thurs., May 21, 2009 at 7: 45 P.M.

As a result, j ob seekers could move to those regi ons of the country most in need \nof additional workers during an economic recover y.  This labor flexibility is important if \ndifferent regions and different industries recover at different paces.  However, during this \nrecovery low house prices and low housing demand may make individuals reluctant to move, as \nit would require them to lock in losses on their houses – particularly if the selling price is likely \nto be below the value of the loan. \n \nConcluding Observations \nThis recession has been long and severe.  Wh ile we are beginning to see more mixed \neconomic data, which are likely a harbinger of a trough in this recession, the economy and \nfinancial markets remain quite sensitive to a dditional shocks.  While problems in financial \ninstitutions and financial markets have abated from last fall, the re covery is likely to be impeded \nuntil there is greater normalization in financing flows. \nI believe the aggressive mone tary and fiscal response to the crisis has no doubt helped \nprovide the foundation for an econom ic recovery.  While I expect in the absence of significant \nfurther shocks that we will begin to see positiv e economic growth towards the end of this year, \nthat growth is not likely to be robust enough to provide much improvement in labor markets until \nnext year. \nI want to stress, however, that I anticipate that  actions taken to stabilize financial markets \nand institutions, fiscal and moneta ry stimulus, and market forces  will contribute to a gradual \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL Thurs., May 21, 2009 at 7: 45 P.M.

Furthermore the Federal Reserve has been and will remain \ncommitted to employing all available tools to promote economic recovery and preserve price stability. \nFinally, as the recovery begins, it will be critical to fully evaluate the lessons of this \nrecession, so we can make our economy, our financial markets, and our regulatory environment more resilient and less susceptible to  the shocks that have impacted us all.  Hopefully the start of \nthe recovery will be an appropriate time  to begin that process, in earnest. \nThank you. \n \n                                                             \n \nNOTES: \n \n1 Of course, the views I express today are my own, not  necessarily those of my colleagues on the Board of \nGovernors or the Federal Open Market Committee (the FOMC). \n \n2 These quarterly rates of decline are seasonally adjusted at annual rates. \n  \n3 Although of late, while exports have  dropped, imports have fallen even more – so the contribution of net \nexports to GDP has been positive. \n \n4 For reference, the situation in New England and Massac husetts is similar to that  in the nation, although \nthe unemployment rate is a bit lower.  Job losses have  not been quite as severe,  but that is because the \ndecline got started a bit later.  Rhode Island currently has an unemployment rate that is the highest in New \nEngland, and sixth highest in the nation.  However,  at the end of 2008, Rhode Island was second highest, \nafter Michigan.  Since then, things have gotten wor se in Rhode Island, but worse still in other states. \n \n5 The lag is very small for payroll employment – perh aps a month.  Unemployment’s lag is about three \nmonths. \n \n6 It was also one of the few times inflation was lo w going into the recession.  The Federal Reserve was \nnot trying to dampen inflationary pressures with higher rates.  \n \n7 It could be that disruptions in credit flows to businesses stemming from the financial turmoil also played \na role. \n\nFigure 1\nUnemployment Rate\nUnemployment  Rate\nJanuary 1959 - April 2009\nPercent Seasonally Adjusted\n111\n1012Percent , Seasonally  Adjusted  \n0111\n468\n0000\n024\n0\nJan-59 Jan-67 Jan-75 Jan-83 Jan-91 Jan-99 Jan-07\nRecession\nSource: BLS, NBER / Haver Analytics \n\nFigure 2\nMonthly Change in Unemployment Rate from\nMonthly  Change  in Unemployment  Rate  from \nStart of Recession\nOver Three Years Following Start of Last Four Recessions\n45Percentage Point Change from Start of Recession \n2007 Recession\n1981 R iUnemployment Rate at  \nStart of Recession          \nJuly 1981             7.2%\nJuly 1990 5 5%\n231981  Recess ion\n1990 RecessionJuly 1990              5.5%\nMar 2001            4.3%\nDec 2007            4.9%\n012001 Recession\n-1\n1 6 11 16 21 26 31 36\nMonths from Start of Recession\nSource: BLS, NBER / Haver Analytics \n\nFigure 3\nPk tT h Ch i R l GDP C t\n Peak-to-Trough Changes in Real GDP  Componen ts\nLast Four Recessions\nPt C h\n-55Percen t Change\n-15\nConsumption Business Fixed Investment\n-35-25\n1981:Q3 1982:Q4 1990:Q3 1991:Q1 2001:Q1 2001:Q4 2007:Q4 2009:Q1 *Consumption Business  Fixed  Investment\nResidential Fixed Investment Exports\n1981:Q3  -1982:Q4 1990:Q3  -1991:Q1 2001:Q1  -2001:Q4 2007:Q4  -2009:Q1\n*Change through 2009:Q1, trough not defined.\nSource: BEA, NBER / Haver Analytics\n\nFigure 4\nRecovery in Real GDP Components:\nRecovery  in Real GDP  Components:\nChange 1 Year from Trough \nLast Three Recoveries\n4050\nConsumption Business Fixed Investment\nResidential Fixed Investment Exports\nGovernmentPercent Change from Trough (Year Earlier)\n102030Government\n-10010\n1982:Q4 1983:Q4 1991:Q1 1992:Q1 2001:Q4 2002:Q4\n 1982:Q4  -1983:Q4 1991:Q1  -1992:Q1 2001:Q4  -2002:Q4\nSource:  BEA, NBER / Haver Analytics\n\nFigure 5\nKBW Bank Index\nKBW  Bank  Index\nJune 1992 - April 2009\n070.80.91\n100120140Month-end Close\n030.40.50.60.7\n406080100\n00.10.20.3\n02040\n30-Jun-92 30-Jun-95 30-Jun-98 29-Jun-01 30-Jun-04 29-Jun-07\n 30Jun92 30Jun95 30Jun98 29Jun01 30Jun04 29Jun07\nRecession\nNote: The KBW Bank Index comprises 24 major banks (money center banks and leading regional banks) \nchosen to reflect the financial sector.    \nSource:  Bloomberg \n\nFigure 6\nHousehold Wealth: Net Worth of Households and\nHousehold  Wealth:   Net Worth  of Households  and \nNonprofit Organizations\n1959:Q1 - 2008:Q4\n1\n1020Percent Change from Year Earlier\n1 010\n0 20-10\n0 -20\n59:Q1 65:Q1 71:Q1 77:Q1 83:Q1 89:Q1 95:Q1 01:Q1 07:Q1\nRecession\nSource:  Federal Reserve Board / Haver Analytics",

Consider \nthe fact that many models of the economy underestimated emerging problems, in part because \nthe financial links to the real economy are, in my view, only cr udely incorporated into most \n\n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, June 5, 2009 at 2: 45 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY \n  \n \n2 \n macroeconomic modeling.  Indeed, most forecasters  did not recognize we we re in a recession in \nthe spring of 2008 even though the recession, as now dated by the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER), began in December 2007.  Of c ourse this happens with recessions, but my \npoint is that\n even after serious problems in housin g and financial markets were revealed , many \nforecasters underestimated the size, severity, and length of the downturn.  In fact, many analysts \nand economists were focused on short-term inflat ion risks in the spring of 2008, when we were \nentering the most severe recession of the past 50 years.   \nPart of the reason, I thin k, relates to three critic al features of this cr isis I would highlight \n– features, I would add, that ar e likely to have a l ong-lasting impact on financial markets and \nperhaps on how economists perceive them:  \n• the first is the increased importance of disruptions to liquidity;  \n• the second involves the significan t changes that occurred in securitization;  \n• the third involves banks  and their role in  the economy.   \n \n1. The Role of Liquidity \n Liquidity risk has received relatively scant attention in academic research.  And the Basel \nII Capital Accord, which focused on a bottom-up a ssessment of risks at financial institutions, \nemphasized holding capital for credit risk, market ri sk, and operational risk.  While liquidity risk \nwas acknowledged, it had no explicit treatment in “Pillar 1” of the Basel II framework, and \nreceived relatively little attention in other portions of the framework.2   \nSimilarly, liquidity receives relatively little  focus from most macroeconomists.  While it \nis mentioned in money and banking texts, liquid ity is generally characterized as a short-lived \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, June 5, 2009 at 2: 45 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY \n  \n \n3 \n problem that can be handled by effective use of the Fed’s discount window.  With most liquidity \nproblems short-lived (for example, after the Se ptember 11 terrorist attacks), liquidity did not \nreceive that much attention from most econom ists, financial institutions, or regulators. \n But this crisis has been different in that there has been an exte nded period where bid-to-\nask spreads have widened, where conditions have hindered buying or selli ng in short-term credit \nmarkets absent significant price movements, and where there has been a drying up of the ability \nto engage in various financial tr ansactions that were formerly qu ite routine and markets that were \nquite active.  I refer to the noti on of a \"liquidity lock,\" by whic h I mean extreme risk aversion by \nmany investors and institutions that fear they will not be able to sell assets in a timely fashion \nwithout steep discounts.3  This makes short-term financing difficult to come by, for even \ncreditworthy firms – including fina ncing for very short maturities, measured in days.  At certain \npoints in this crisis, market participants saw few if any bids for even high-grade financial paper \nthat had a maturity greater than one day.  A nother manifestation was the unwillingness of many \nof the largest financial institutions to lend to each  other – as represented by the very large spread \nbetween the London Interbank Offered Rate (L ibor) and the overnigh t index swap rate.4  \nThis unwillingness to take credit risk or to lend money other than overnight constrains \ncreditworthy borrowers from undertaking worthwh ile projects – and thus has implications for \neconomic growth. And these disruptions have not been short-lived; even more than 20 months \ninto the crisis many markets are st ill not functioning as they did.   \nExchange-traded markets seem to have been  less disrupted than markets dominated by \ndealers.  This has broader implications for ma rket structure and potential systemic risk – \nimplications that I hope will get more attention from researchers and regulators in the future. \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, June 5, 2009 at 2: 45 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY \n  \n \n4 \n  A variety of financial institutions and ma rkets are undergoing signi ficant change as a \nresult of liquidity concerns.  Considering our  time today I will focus on just one example, \nchanges occurring in the money market mutual fund industry.  Money market funds do not \ngenerally receive much attention.  They receive short-term deposits that are then invested in \nhighly liquid short-term investments.  But the si ze and role of the industry has probably been \nunderappreciated – at the end of the second quarter of 2007, money market funds had $2.5 \ntrillion in assets, and were major holders of financial and non-financi al commercial paper and \nlarge certificates of deposit (CD’s).   \nFollowing the failure of Lehman Brothers, i nvestors in some money market funds that \nheld Lehman securities began to withdraw mone y.  Redemptions rose dramatically.  Because of \nlosses on the Lehman securities, the Reserve Prim ary Fund was unable to maintain the standard \n$1 per share current net asset value – they “b roke the buck.”  This had very significant \nimplications, as did the need of numerous banks  to support their money market funds to avoid a \nsimilar outcome.  For example, because of conc ern over redemptions, money market funds that \nwere still willing to purchase commercial pa per wanted only very short maturities.  \nAs Figure 1  shows, the overall result was a si gnificant outflow from prime money \nmarket funds, which merited a policy response.   The Treasury announced a temporary insurance \nprogram and the Federal Reserve created two liquidity facilities under its “Section 13-3” \nauthority.5   Since market participants largely viewed  the programs as temporary, there have been \nsignificant shifts in the holdings of money market mutual funds.  Figures 2 and 3  show that such \nfunds have shifted their composition materially, away from commercial paper and toward more \nliquid government securities.  In pa rt this represents a change in  preferences of investors, who \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, June 5, 2009 at 2: 45 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY \n  \n \n5 \n have shifted assets to government funds, and in part a change in prefer ences of fund managers \nseeking more liquid positions.  However, the sh ift has disrupted the co mmercial paper market, \nincreasing spreads and causing some issuers to rely on the Federal Reserve’s commercial paper \nfunding facility.  All in all, I su spect that the shift in money-ma rket funds’ liquidity preferences \nis likely to have longer-term repercussions for the medium-t erm financing needs of firms.   \nThis is just one example of how liquidity issues may have longer run implications.  A \nbroader question for economists is how illiquidity could persist for so long.  While this is a good topic for future research, I would hi ghlight two interrelated factors.  First, much of the illiquidity \nresults from concerns with counterparty risk.  Major financial firms were  unwilling to trade with \nother major firms in volume, because of concerns  about solvency risk – and the opaqueness of \nfirms made it difficult to ascertain their true fina ncial health.  Financial fi rms and regulators need \nto consider ways to make entities less opaque.  Second, securitization of ten relied on financial \nfirms to provide liquidity and credit support, and was dependent on investor confidence in \nratings.  As investor confidence in financial firms and ratings of st ructured products waned, \nsecuritization declined drama tically – and many markets became significantly less liquid, as \nfirms did not want to hold asse ts they could not securitize. \n \n2. The Role of Securitization \nTurning to a second major issue, securiti zation, I would note that  the aforementioned \nliquidity concerns initia lly had their roots in credit  concerns – for example, in worries about the \npotential of mortgages bundled in to securities to go into defau lt. Some of my colleagues have \nobserved that credit worries have existed for centu ries – so why, this time, have credit problems \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, June 5, 2009 at 2: 45 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY \n  \n \n6 \n turned into severe liquidity stresses?  I suspect th at securitization has played  a role, in particular \nthe rise of what I have called “surrogate securitiz ation” (where investors were willing to buy debt \nassigned high credit ratings by rating agencies, to  whom they basically delegated due diligence).6 \n With that thought, allow me to discuss s ecuritization, where loans are pooled together \nand sold to investors.  Originally, the securi tization market served as  a source of financing \nprimarily for home mortgages, but increasingly it was us ed to finance credit card receivables, \nhome equity loans, and car loans.  Because assets  were financed by issuing securities directly to \nthe marketplace, many assumed that securitization would provide a more resilient  source of \nfinancing than depending on financial intermediaries .  But ironically, the events of this crisis led \nto a state where securitization ha s been severely impaired, leading to increases in the cost of \nfinancing for assets that could no longer be easily securitized. \nFigure 4  shows the significant decrease in asset-backed commercial paper (ABCP) \noutstanding.  ABCP was frequently sold to money market funds and other intermediaries \ninterested in holding short-te rm, high-quality paper.  ABCP usually was sponsored by \ncommercial banks that provided liqui dity, credit support, or both.  W ith the onset of the crisis it \nbecame increasingly difficult for such sponsors to place their commercial paper, as potential \ninvestors became concerned about both the credit quality of the assets an d the credit quality of \nsome sponsors.  In addition, changes in accounting rules for off-balance-sheet conduits made this \ntype of financing less economical.  As a resu lt, ABCP issuance has significantly decreased. \nSimilarly, other types of secu ritization have been under seve re stress.  As investor \ndemand for structured finance decreased, relati vely few securitizations have occurred.  Figure 5  \nshows the dramatic decline in securitization of  home equity loans, credit card receivables, \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, June 5, 2009 at 2: 45 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY \n  \n \n7 \n student loans, and car loans.  Wh ile there are alternatives to secu ritization, such as bank lending, \nthis represents a narrowing of financing sources – and in the case of bank loans, has implications \nfor capital requirements.7 Overall, the cost to bo rrowers is likely to go up.8  \n  More research is needed on the links betw een banks and the securitization markets, and \nthe structure of securitization.  Many securitiza tions are sponsored by financial institutions, and \nrely on their credit and liquidity support.  As a result, securitization is not as insulated from \nbanking problems as many assumed.  Also, lack of confidence in ratings  has reduced investor \ndemand.  In an environment where investors are less willing to rely on third- party ratings, \nsecuritizations will need more tr ansparent structures that allow for easier monitoring of risks.  \n \n3. The Role of Banks  \nTurning to the role of banks, in this crisis  large banks have been  extended unprecedented \nsupport – extensions of deposit insurance, federal guarantees of debt, and equity infusions.  The \nsupport required to allevi ate the crisis suggests that clearly, financial supervision and regulation \nmust be enhanced going forward.  In the limited time we have today, we cannot do justice to all \nthe lessons we should draw from recent experi ence, but I would like to highlight three. \nFirst, the stress tests  conducted earlier this year were in structive to banks and supervisors.  \nSome banks had difficulty providing the data needed as inputs to  the tests – data that would \nideally exist as inputs to robus t budgeting and risk-management sy stems.  Thus, like the crisis \nitself, the stress tests highlighted shortcomings in management information systems and data.   \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, June 5, 2009 at 2: 45 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY \n  \n \n8 \n Because the stress-tests were done simulta neously across institutions, using the same \nassumptions, it was possible to compare result s – and, indeed, to observe differences in \ninstitutions’ ability to undertak e a rigorous test.  Previously supervisors did conduct comparative \nexercises (called horizontal revi ews), but the sequential nature of  those exercises (that is, their \noccurrence in different time periods) made it more difficult to compare results across institutions.   \nThe stress tests provide a top-down a ssessment of capital, based on economic \nassumptions – and thus provide a very good compleme nt to the bottom-up risk assessment that is \nthe cornerstone of most risk-management framewor ks at major banks and is the cornerstone of \nthe Basel II Capital Accord.  In addition, making th e results public allowe d outside investors to \n“bound” the likely losses at financial institut ions, even considering the more dire outlook \n(compared to the base forecast of many) that was pa rt of the stress tests.  This ultimately helped \nfinancial institutions raise additional capital  at a critical juncture for the economy.9 \nA second area that should be considered is the role of debt .  A variety of debt instruments \nare issued by banks and qualify as capital for institutions’ capital requirements, and the use of \nsubordinated debt has been advoc ated by some economists.  Howeve r, the reluctance to require \ndebt to be converted to equity, or to shoulder more of the losses, should cause us to reexamine \nthe role of debt in systemically important institutions.  A number of proposals exist, but one possibility for reform would be to establish that debt instruments could be used to meet capital \nrequirements only if they have automatic trigge rs to convert to common equity under certain \ncircumstances.\n10  While such instruments would not likely be attractive in the current \nenvironment, they may find acceptance once the ec onomy and financial markets have recovered. \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, June 5, 2009 at 2: 45 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY \n  \n \n9 \n A third area involves the off-balance sheet operations of banks.  Many large banks are \nmarket makers in assets held off of balance sh eets.  This has resulted in banks having very \nsizeable positions in derivatives instruments relative  to their capital positions.  In addition, banks \nhad significant positions in struct ured investment vehicles and c onduits that had much more risk \nthan many financial institutions and their superv isors thought prior to the crisis.  Examination \nand understanding of the role of off-balance sheet activities deserves significantly more \nsupervisory attention, going forwar d.  It will be important to en sure that capital held for off-\nbalance sheet exposures is commensura te with the risk that they pose. \n \nConcluding Observations \nAllow me to close with a few concluding observations.  This cr isis highlights the \nimportant role of financial institutions and mark ets on the real economy.  In my view this is an \narea that does not receive sufficient attention in research, or in the teaching of economics.   \nThe contributions of financial institutions a nd markets to the length and severity of this \nrecession are likely to be a topic of research well into the future.  However, given the extent of \ngovernment intervention that has been necessary, mo re preventive measures must be considered.   \nReform efforts will need to consider appropriate regulatory and supervisory measures to \ninsure that financial markets can efficiently allocate capital without placing the economy, and \ntaxpayers, at this degree of risk again.   To accomplish this, I would suggest that lawmakers and \npolicymakers will need to keep in mind the complex but  undeniable way that financial markets, financial \ninstitutions, and financial matters such as liquidity a nd securitization interact with the real economy.  And \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, June 5, 2009 at 2: 45 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY \n  \n \n10 \n this, I firmly believe, means the Federal Reserve can and must play an integral role in the financial \nregulatory framework in the United States.\n  \nThank you.  \n                                                             \n \nNOTES: \n \n1  Of course, the views I express today are my own, not necessarily those of my colleagues on the \nBoard of Governors or the Federal Open Market Committee (the FOMC).  \n2  See http://edocket.access.gpo.gov/2007/07-5729.htm. \n \n3  I explored this topic in a speech at the Univer sity of Wisconsin – Madison, entitled “The Impact \nof Financial Institutions and Financ ial Markets on the Real Economy: Implications of a 'Liquidity Lock'”, \navailable at http://www.bos.frb.org/news/speech es/rosengren/2008/100908.htm . \n \n4  Note that this liquidity lock, where transacti ons are impeded by severe risk aversion by potential \ninvestors, compounds problems creat ed by a traditional credit crunch – a situation in which institutions \nseek to shrink assets (like loans) in order to meet regulatory or market-imposed capital-to-assets ratios. In \nthe recent crisis, not only were financial firms faced w ith a need to de-lever (thus, a credit crunch), but \nthey were also finding it increasingly difficult to borro w other than overnight – even if they were an \norganization that was highly rated (…thus, a liquidity lock).  \n5  Section 13-3 of the Federal Reserve Act allo ws the Federal Reserve “In unusual and exigent \ncircumstances … to discount for any indivi dual, partnership, or corporation…” See \nhttp://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/section13.htm. \n \n6  Utilizing ratings to help evaluate the riskiness of securities is a normal part of the securitization \nprocess.  But when new securities ar ise, investors may need to exer cise more caution as rating agencies \nthemselves learn about the appropriate risk to attach  to the new instruments. I discussed this in more \ndetail in several talks, including “Recent Developmen ts in Real Estate, Financial Markets, and the \nEconomy” available at http://www.bos.frb.org/news/speeches/rosengren/2007/101007.htm . \n \n7  Bank lending where the loan is held as an asset  on the bank’s balance sheet has implications for \ncapital requirements, which focus on mainta ining an acceptable capital-to-assets ratio. \n \n8  The Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility  (TALF) has been an effort by the Federal \nReserve to “reopen” the securitization market.

The topics be ing discussed at this conference are of great \nimportance to us all – market participants as well as policymakers.  We share a keen interest in the \nreturn to stability, and future vibrancy, of the fi nancial infrastructure that  underpins economies around \nthe world.\n* \n The financial crisis of the past  two years has made it clear that significant gaps exist in global \nfinancial regulation.  In the United States, the cris is made absolutely necessary a great deal of \nunprecedented intervention in financial markets.   To avoid an even deeper crisis, the U.S. Treasury \nprovided capital infusions to a large number of co mmercial banks, the FDIC substantially expanded \n                                                 \n* Of course, the views I express today are my own, not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Board of Governors or \nthe Federal Open Market Committee (the FOMC). \n\n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Monday, June 29, 2009 at 9:30 a.m. U.S. Eastern Time and 3:30 p.m. in Brussels, Belgium – or Upon Delivery * \n \n \n \n 2its guarantees over bank lia bilities, and the Federal Reserve e xpanded its discount window activities \nto support the liquidity needs of banks and other financial-market participants.   \n Notably, this support for the financial syst em has, out of necessity, gone well beyond \ncommercial banks to include financial institutions that did not have access to deposit insurance and \noften did not have the oversight of a bank regulator.  Money market mutual funds were provided \ninsurance from the U.S. Treasury, and now have access to liquidity in the even t of significant demand \nfor redemptions.  Credit facilities have been established by the Fe deral Reserve to support renewed \nissuance of commercial paper and to  revive the securitization market .  The largest investment banks \nwere provided access to the Federal Reserve’s disc ount window, and have either been acquired by \ncommercial banks or become bank holding companies.   Insurance companies have received access to \nTARP funds.1  These proactive steps have been difficult but absolutely crucial, in my view, to \navoiding much worse outcomes.    The United States is not alone in  this type of necessary support for financial markets.  Central \nbanks and financial regulators ac ross the globe have adopted a va riety of programs, many of which \nare similar to those adopted in the U.S.  This  government intervention has been necessitated by \nconcerns that financial market s were in danger of significant systemic  problems, where the failure of \none or more financial institutions could create cont agious losses of confidence that would destabilize \na broad set of financial-market  participants around the globe. \n My remarks today will focus on the roles and responsibilities of a so-called “systemic regulator”.\n2  Please note that when I speak here of a sy stemic regulator I am sharing my own general \nviews of that role, in broad terms, rather th an discussing any specific proposal currently under \nconsideration.3 \n Furthermore, I am specifically focusing on the activities of a systemic risk regulator that \ninvolve so-called macroprudential analysis4 – or in shorthan d, macroprudential supervision .  There are \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Monday, June 29, 2009 at 9:30 a.m. U.S. Eastern Time and 3:30 p.m. in Brussels, Belgium – or Upon Delivery * \n \n \n \n 3other  aspects of systemic risk regula tion, such as resolution authority, that do not necessarily need to \nbe the responsibility of the entity that supervises  systemically important institutions.  As Chairman \nBernanke noted in a March speech on financial reform to address systemic risk, “Financial \nstability…could be further enhanced by a more exp licitly macroprudential approach to financial \nregulation and supervision […] Macr oprudential policies focus on risks to the financial system as a \nwhole… [and] a macroprudential approach would co mplement and build on the current regulatory \nand supervisory structure, in which the primar y focus is the safety and soundness of individual \ninstitutions and markets.”5  \nIndeed, I would like to begin by highlighting some differences between a macroprudential \nsupervisor and one focused on traditional bank-so lvency oversight.  I will then touch on the \ncharacteristics of two types of in stitutions that render them “systemi cally important” – first, large and \nhighly leveraged institutions, where losses of capital could have a magnified impact on the economy; and second, financial institutions that have exte nsive counterparty exposure to other financial \ninstitutions and financial markets,  such that their failure could create significant problems for \ndomestic and international counterpa rties in “domino” fashion.  Note that most of the institutions \nlikely to fit this definition are, or have recen tly become, bank holding companies that are already \nunder the supervision of the Federal Reserve – al though systemic regulation would differ from the \ntraditional supervisory responsibilities of the Federal Reserve. \nI plan to then discuss some of the roles and re sponsibilities a systemic regulator should have, \nin order to prevent contagious failu res.  In particular I will argue that the systemic regulator should \nhave the ability to do the following three things, at a minimum, at systemically important institutions: \n \n• First, supervise capital structure  to minimize the potential for problems originating at such \ninstitutions to spill over to others.\n6  This can, perhaps, be pursued by limiting debt instruments \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Monday, June 29, 2009 at 9:30 a.m. U.S. Eastern Time and 3:30 p.m. in Brussels, Belgium – or Upon Delivery * \n \n \n \n 4that qualify for capital; requiring banks to hold additional capital during expansionary periods; \nand mandating higher capital ratios for systemically important firms. \n• Second, supervise liquidity risk  and asset-liability management  to minimize the likelihood, \nand impact, of runs on institutions. \n• Third, supervise risk management  so that systemically important  institutions have robust and \neffective means of evaluating risk, thus mi nimizing the likelihood of needing government \nsupport to avoid the spread of contagious instability. \n To give you a peek at the bottom line, I will conc lude that such respons ibilities overlap with \nwhat is needed for effective oversight of potenti al discount window borrowing, if such borrowing is \navailable to non-depository systemica lly important financial intermedia ries.  Monitoring solvency risk \nand liquidity risk are key elements of discount window analysis, and are also key components of \nmacroprudential supervision.   \n \nTraditional and Macroprudential Oversight of Financial Institutions \nOversight of financial institutions has tradit ionally focused on the safety and soundness of \nindividual institutions, consumer protection, and i nvestor protection.  Today I am going to focus on \nthe first – safety and soundness regulation – to highlight how it differs from macroprudential \nsupervision.   \nBank supervisors have long focused on understand ing the likelihood that a bank could become \ninsolvent, and then taking actions aimed at prot ecting government-insured deposits.  One of the main \ntools employed to assess the probability that a ba nk could become insolvent has been to periodically \nrate institutions according to their c\napital, a sset quality, m anagement, e arnings, l iquidity, and \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Monday, June 29, 2009 at 9:30 a.m. U.S. Eastern Time and 3:30 p.m. in Brussels, Belgium – or Upon Delivery * \n \n \n \n 5sensitivity to market risk (the so-called CAMELS  rating).  The higher the likelihood of insolvency, \nthe higher the CAMELS rating – and the more  aggressive the supervisory response. \n Frequently, examiners spend significant time an alyzing the adequacy of reserves, given asset \nquality.  Reserve levels ar e calculated based on accounting standards that focus on incurred  losses at \nthe bank, rather than expected or unexpected loss es.  The incurred-loss model can sometimes be at \nodds with a more risk-based view that is more forward looking.  By focusing on reserves in the \nmanner defined by accounting rules, examiners are looking at history7 rather than focusing on \nwhether banks have adequately provided for future  losses.  During periods when asset prices are \nrising rapidly and when nonperforming loans tend to be low, this construct can result in lower \nestimates for incurred losses and thus lower reserv es – while at the same time, earnings and capital \nwill likely be growing.    Periods when earnings are str ong and nonperforming loans are low are likely the times that a \nmacroprudential supervisor would n eed to be particularly vigilant.  Rising asset prices are often \naccompanied by increases in leverage, as financial in stitutions provide financing for sectors of the \neconomy that are growing rapidly.  This growth frequently occu rs with lessened attention to \nunderwriting standards, a greater w illingness to finance long-run positio ns with short-term liabilities, \nand a greater concentration of lo ans in areas that have grown ra pidly.  So – unlike the focus on \nincurred losses and accounting reserves of tradit ional safety and soundness supervision – a systemic \nregulator would need to be focused on forward-looking estimates  of potential losses  that could cause \ncontagious failures  of financial institutions.   \nI should acknowledge that even in  traditional supervision, examin ers can also focus on future \nor unexpected losses – and in theory, capital is ex pected to provide protection for losses occurring \noutside the accounting reserve model.  But in practice, this is not always the case.   \n \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Monday, June 29, 2009 at 9:30 a.m. U.S. Eastern Time and 3:30 p.m. in Brussels, Belgium – or Upon Delivery * \n \n \n \n 6Lessons from the Current Financial Crisis \n These nuances in supervision approaches – and, more generally, the need for a new and \nenhanced focus on supervision – are illuminated by the recent experience of some of the large investment banks during the financial crisis.  As Figure 1  highlights, from 2004 to 2006 there was \nvery rapid growth in the issuance of asset-backed securities (ABS).  As the figure shows, privately \nissued mortgage-backed securities  outstanding grew by almost $1.5 tr illion over that period of just \nthree years.   \nFigure 2  shows that there was also rapid growth in financial assets outstanding for broker-\ndealers during this period.  This growth in their balance sheets aggravated what were already very \nlarge leverage ratios – these firms were opera ting with less than  half of the leverage capital  ratio of \nmany large commercial banks.  The investment banks were very profitable dur ing this period as the \nsecuritization of mo rtgages and the “tranching” of mortgage -backed securities provided substantial \nfee income.    One method for financing the growth was incr eased reliance on short-term repurchase or \n“repo” agreements.  As shown in Figure 3 , repo agreements outstandi ng expanded very rapidly \nbetween mid 2004 and mid 2007.  This short-term  financing of longer-term mortgage-backed \nsecurities made institutions particularly susceptible to  any disruption to their ability to “roll” the short-\nterm financing.  While during this  period broker-dealers were genera ting significant profits, they were \naccompanied by greater leverage and a riskier asset-liability mix. \n Periods of market booms and other expansi onary periods are precisely the times that \nmacroprudential supervision would diverge from  more traditional prudential supervision.  \nHistorically, prudential supervision has been largely reactive, becomi ng more activist as losses mount \n(or conditions otherwise deteriorat e) at an institution.  In cont rast, a macroprudential supervisor \nshould be particularly attuned to changes – especially  dramatic ones – in such areas as leverage, asset-\n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Monday, June 29, 2009 at 9:30 a.m. U.S. Eastern Time and 3:30 p.m. in Brussels, Belgium – or Upon Delivery * \n \n \n \n 7liability mix, or underwriting standards.  This requ ires the macroprudential supervisor to be willing \nand able to “lean against the wind”  during booming markets or other pe riods.  It is not that economic \nconditions are necessarily riskier in good times, but rather that economic actors become more \nconfident and thus more willing to incur risks.  Another key ingredient in the fi nancial crisis was the fact that several large U.S. institutions \nwere highly leveraged and had extensive counterpart y exposures.  Such exposures are particularly \nlikely to accumulate when institutions trade extensiv ely outside of traditional exchanges.  Thus, while \nfirms such as AIG and Lehman Brothers had no si gnificant depository, their counterparty exposures \ncreated the possibility of contagious failures.  Thus, both firms had attributes that made them \nsystemically important – they were highly leverage d institutions and they had extensive counterparty \nexposures.  A significant complicat ing factor, I would add, was thei r importance in international \nmarkets as well as domestic markets.  This greatly co mplicated the ability to easily restructure, or to \nuse traditional bankruptcy procedures.  While it sounds obvious, it is important to not e that a systemic regulator would need the \nability to monitor systemically important institutions.  In the mo st recent period, this would have \nrequired understanding things like the risks in the originate-to-distribute model of lending and \nsecuritizing; and the ability to link the rapid expansion in as set-backed securities to increased leverage \nand liquidity risk.  Systemic risk could potentiall y have been reduced had there been a systemic \nregulator that questioned and resi sted the increased leverage and liquidity risk, and potentially \nrequired an increase in capital reserves and possi bly the use of debt inst ruments that could be \nconverted to equity should the firms face a liquidity or solvency crisis. \n \n  \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Monday, June 29, 2009 at 9:30 a.m. U.S. Eastern Time and 3:30 p.m. in Brussels, Belgium – or Upon Delivery * \n \n \n \n 8The Role of the Discount Window \n In more normal times, the discount window is in tended to fill two roles – first to serve as a \n“safety valve” by providing liquidity to  solvent firms that is not otherwise available in the market; and \nsecondly, to help facilitate  orderly resolutions of insolvent depos itory institutions.  Both roles have \ncharacterized discount window lending during the curr ent crisis in the United States.  During the \ncrisis, both discount window roles have also been extended to non- depository institutions – for \nexample, the Primary Dealer Credit Facility enab led approved broker-dealers to have access to the \ndiscount window when interbank funding markets were under stress.  Traditional discount window \nlending requires continuous monitoring of firms to ensure they ar e solvent in order to gauge the level \nof credit risk that the firm poses  to the Federal Reserve as lender, and to determine whether funding \nneeds of a firm have transitioned from liquidity to solvency concerns.  The establishment of the Primary Dealer Cred it Facility has raised the issue of whether any \nfirm deemed systemically important should have access to the discount window facility.  As can be \nseen in Figure 4 , the Primary Dealer Credit Facility was activ ely used during spikes in financial stress \nduring the recent crisis.  These are the very times where making the distincti on between liquidity and \nsolvency risk will be most important.  If syst emically important firms are granted access to the \ndiscount window, discount window operations will – much like the role of a macroprudential \nsupervisor – have to involve evaluating the solvency and liquidity risk of such systemically important \nfirms in order to gauge the level of credit and othe r risks posed to the Federal Reserve, and ultimately \nthe taxpayer, by extending credit to the firms.    \nConcluding Observations \n I will leave you with a few summary observations.   As I mentioned at the outset and hopefully \nillustrated in my remarks, a systemic regulator shoul d have the ability to supervise capital structure, \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Monday, June 29, 2009 at 9:30 a.m. U.S. Eastern Time and 3:30 p.m. in Brussels, Belgium – or Upon Delivery * \n \n \n \n 9supervise liquidity risk and asset-liability mana gement, and supervise risk management – all to \nminimize the likelihood of systemically importa nt institutions negatively impacting market \nfunctioning and economic stabilit y, proving “contagious” to counter parties, and possibly needing \ngovernment support to avoid further spreading damage or instability. \nA systemic regulator or macropr udential supervisor would need not only the ability to monitor \nsystemically important institutions, but also the ability to change behavior  if firms are financing a \nboom by increasing leverage and liquid ity risk.  It follows that legislation that aims to design an \neffective systemic regulator needs to  provide the regulator with the authority to make such changes.  \nUnderstanding the activities of systemically import ant firms would require a clear picture of their \nleverage, their liquidity, and their risk management.  Furthermore, to  be truly effective in “leaning \nagainst the wind,” such a regulat or would need the ability to prevent  the build-up of excessive \nleverage or liqui dity risk.   \nIt is noteworthy that the role of closely mon itoring solvency and liqui dity risk on an ongoing \nbasis would be very similar to what might be expected of discount-window operations, were the \ndiscount window to be made available to systemically important institutions regardless of whether they owned a depository instituti on.  This of course suggests the logic of a role for the discount-\nwindow operator – in the U.S., the Federal Reserve – in macroprudential supervision. \nThank you. \n \n                                                 \n \n \nNOTES: \n \n1  The U.S. government’s Troubled Asset Relief Program \n \n2  Technically, “regulator” refers to the writer of ru les, regulations, and policies while “supervisor” refers \nto the enforcer of such.

Willen\nSenior Economist and Policy Advisor\nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston\nBEFORE\nThe U.S. Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, & Urban Aﬀairs Hearing on\n“Preserving Homeownership: Progress Needed to Prevent Foreclosures”\nJuly 16, 2009\n1\n\nChairman Dodd, Ranking Member Shelby, and distinguished members of the\nCommittee, I thank you for your invitation to testify today. My name is Paul Willen,\nand I am one of the Senior Economists and Policy Advisors at the Federal Reserve\nBank of Boston, which as you know is one of the twelve regional Reserve Banks in\nthe Federal Reserve System. I would like to stress that the views I share with you\ntoday are mine, not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, the\nother Reserve Banks, or the Federal Reserve’s Board of Governors.\nIn the time allotted today I plan to brieﬂy summarize some key ﬁndings in the\nresearch that I and several talented co-authors have done over the last two years –\nﬁndings that I think are particularly relevant to the issue of foreclosure prevention.\nI have also submitted a written statement to the committee, which contains more\ndetail on our research, and which I respectfully request be accepted for the record.\nI hope that my comments today and our broader research will be helpful to the\nCommittee, as you consider the important issues that are the focus of this hearing.\nThe limited success of foreclosure prevention strategies undertaken to date results,\nat least partly, from reliance on theories about the causes of the crisis that – while\nintuitively appealing – are at odds with the data. In my remarks today I will focus\non four facts from the data which contradict widely held beliefs about the causes of\nthe crisis:\n1. Resets of adjustable rate mortgages have not been the main driver of borrower\npayment problems.\n2. Household life events like job loss and illness played a central role in the surge\nin foreclosures that started in 2007, even prior to the start of the recession.\n3. Most borrowers who got subprime mortgages would not have qualiﬁed for a\nprime mortgage for that transaction.\n4. The practice of securitization is not the main reason that lenders have failed\nlarge numbers of home mortgages. A more plausible explanation is that it is\nsimply unproﬁtable for them to do so.1\n1We use lender here to refer to the institution that provided funds (the bank or the investor in\n2\n\nI would respectfully submit that policies that ignore these facts - however well in-\ntentioned - will address some smaller problems while regrettably ignoring much more\nserious ones.\nAccording to the conventional wisdom, large payment increases associated with\nthe ﬁrst reset of subprime adjustable rate mortgages led to large numbers of foreclo-\nsures. To test this in the data, researchers – including but not only my co-authors\nand me – have looked at a large sample of individual loan histories which provide\ninformation about both the expected payments owed by borrowers and whether bor-\nrowers made those payments. If resets were truly important, we would expect to\nsee a dramatic increase in the likelihood that a borrower has trouble with his or her\npayment to coincide with the ﬁrst reset of an adjustable-rate-mortgage. But we see\nno such relationship in the data and, in fact, the majority of borrowers who default\non subprime adjustable rate mortgages start missing payments long before the rate\nincreases with a reset.2\nPart of the reason for the confusion about the resets is the widespread and, we have\nfound, incorrect belief that rates on subprime ARMs spike dramatically at the reset.\nOur research reveals that in fact the so-called “teaser” rates on subprime mortgages\nwere very high to begin with. Indeed the phrase “teaser rate” is something a misnomer\nas it was typically 3 percentage points higher than the rate on an equivalent prime\nmortgage. The bump in rates at the reset, which is typically tied to six month London\nInter Bank Oﬀered Rate (LIBOR), was only about 3 percentage points when LIBOR\npeaked in 2007, and the Fed Fund rate cuts in the fall of 2007 largely eliminated the\nreset as an issue entirely. Starting in 2008, most subprime mortgages saw no change\nin the rate at the reset. The fact that there was no improvement in loan performance\ncorresponding to interest rate cuts suggests the limited scope of resets as a problem.\nAllow me a point of clariﬁcation that is more than mere semantics.

Gerardi, L.\nGoette and P. Willen. NBER Working Paper 15063 and forthcoming in the NBER Macro Annual .\nJune 2009. Attached.\n3\n\nmentators have erroneously equated subprime mortgages with alternative-mortgage\nproducts like so-called Option-ARMs. Option-ARMs, which allow borrowers to pay\nless than the interest on the loan, and make up for it by adding to the principal\nbalance, were not generally marketed to subprime borrowers, and our investigation\nof the data suggests that the typical pool of subprime loans had no Option ARMs at\nall. In fact, the majority of problem subprime loans were fully-amortized loans and\nmany of them were, in fact, ﬁxed rate mortgages. Option ARMs have been and will\ncontinue to be a problem but they are not, nor have they ever been, the main source\nof problems in the mortgage market.\nA second point. The conventional wisdom until very recently minimized the role\nof so-called “life events” like unemployment and illness in generating defaults on\nsubprime mortgages. People argued that life-events could not explain the surge in\ndefaults in 2007, because there was no underlying surge in unemployment or illness\nthat year. But I believe that view reﬂects a misunderstanding of the interaction of\nhouse price depreciation and life events in causing default. Foreclosures rarely occur\nwhen borrowers have positive equity, for the simple reason that a borrower is almost\nalways better oﬀ selling if they have to leave the house anyway. Thus, detrimental\nlife events have no eﬀect on foreclosures when prices are rising. Consider that in\n2001, Massachusetts suﬀered a fairly severe recession which led to a big increase in\ndelinquencies, but the number of foreclosures actually fell to a record low, as shown\nin the chart I have included with my testimony (Figure 1). But when home prices\nfall, some borrowers can no longer proﬁtably sell, and then the income-disrupting\nlife-events really take a toll. Thus we did not need to see a surge in life-events to\nget a surge in foreclosures, but rather a fall in house prices – which is exactly, and\nunfortunately, what we saw.\nIn understanding the role of unemployment in foreclosures, for example, one has to\nunderstand that large numbers of households suﬀer job losses – “separations,” in the\nlingo of labor economics – even when the economy is doing well. Even in the summer\nof 1999, in the best labor market in a generation, 300,000 individuals ﬁled new claims\nfor unemployment insurance every week. Because house prices were rising rapidly,\n4\n\nfew of these job losses ended in foreclosure. But the recession that started at the end\nof 2007 and worsened dramatically in the fall of 2008 has aggravated the problem.\nThe separation rate has increased and importantly, the ﬁnding rate – the rate at\nwhich unemployed worked get new jobs – has fallen to record lows. While a recession\ncertainly makes the foreclosure problem worse, it is not necessary to generate large\nnumbers of employment-related foreclosures.\nOne key policy concern I see is the likelihood that the problem of negative home\nequity and job loss will persist even after the economy recovers. A borrower with neg-\native equity is, unfortunately, somewhat like a patient with a weak immune system –\nshocks easily absorbed by a “healthy” homeowner can prove fatal to a homeowner with\nnegative equity. To see this depicted, please note again Figure 1. In Massachusetts,\nhouse prices stopped falling in 1992 and a vigorous economic recovery started the\nfollowing year; but we saw elevated foreclosure numbers for the next ﬁve years. The\nreason is, I believe, rather easily determined: homeowners who bought at the peak\nof the market in 1988 did not have positive home equity and the protection it brings\nfrom foreclosure until house prices fully recovered the 1988 peak in 1998.\nMy third point relates to the oft-made claim that many borrowers who used\nsubprime mortgages were “steered” into subprime loans and, in fact, would have\nqualiﬁed for prime loans. Part of the problem here relates again to a misunderstanding\nof what a subprime loan is. What diﬀerentiates a subprime loan from a prime loan is\nnot the loan itself – a subprime adjustable rate mortgage is no diﬀerent from a prime\nadjustable rate mortgage – but rather the characteristics of the transaction: the size\nof the down payment, the ratio of the monthly payment to income, the credit history\nof the borrower, the level of documentation provided by the borrower, among other\nthings.\nCareful analysis of the data shows that the vast majority of borrowers who took out\nsubprime loans could not have qualiﬁed for prime loans. We looked at a large sample\nof subprime mortgages in New England in 2007 and deﬁned a prime loan as a loan to\nan owner-occupant, with a loan-to-value ratio of 90% or less, full documentation of\nincome and assets, a borrower FICO scores of 620 or higher, and a monthly payment\n5\n\nthat was less than 45% of monthly income. Only 9.6% of the mortgages identiﬁed as\nsubprime met these criteria. Furthermore, that subset of prime-qualifying buyers got\nmortgages with characteristics very similar to prime mortgages available at the time\n– 65% had ﬁxed interest rates and the average initial interest rate for these loans was\n6.7%.3\nIt should be clear that borrowers may well have been steered into transactions\nthat required subprime loans. For example, a real estate agent may have convinced\nthem to buy an expensive house or a mortgage broker may have encouraged them\nto do a cash-out reﬁnance that in either case required a loan that no prime lender\nwould approve given their income and credit history. But conditional on the actual\ntransaction, there is no evidence right now that borrowers who used subprime loans\ncould have qualiﬁed for a prime loan. The evidence typically cited to make the claim\nthat borrowers were steered is that over the period 1999 to 2006, the fraction of\nborrowers who used subprime loans but had FICO scores typically associated with\nprime mortgages increased sharply, going from about 35% to 70% in our data. What\nthis evidence fails to take into account is that over that same period, all the other\ncharacteristics of the loans deteriorated sharply: the average LTV for a subprime\nborrower with 660 FICO went from 82% to 95%.4\nMy fourth and ﬁnal comment today relates to foreclosure prevention strategies.\nForeclosures are bad for homeowners, but they are also bad for lenders, which typically\nrecover less than half the principal owed to them. So it seems natural to think\nthat borrowers and lenders could work together to arrive at some happy medium\nin which the borrower gets to stay in his or her home and the lender continues to\nreceive payments, albeit smaller ones. In our most recent paper, we ﬁnd that such\nrenegotiation is extremely rare. Through careful statistical work using a dataset with\n29 million active residential loans, we were able to look at borrowers in the year after\nthey became seriously delinquent. Our main ﬁnding is that lenders are reluctant to\n3For details, see attached, Foote, C., K. Gerardi, L. Goette and P. Willen. “Just the Facts: An\ninitial analysis of the subprime crisis.” 2008. Journal of Housing Economics, 17(4):291-305.\n4See Figure 7 of Foote, C., K. Gerardi, L. Goette and P. Willen (2008), attached.\n6\n\nrenegotiate loans: only about 3 percent of the seriously delinquent borrowers in our\nsample received payment reducing loan modiﬁcations in the year subsequent to their\nﬁrst 60-day delinquency.5\nA leading explanation for this relative paucity of renegotiation is the view that\nsince most loans are securitized now, the fragmented ownership and contractual com-\nplexity inherent in such transactions makes it diﬃcult for borrower and lender to come\nto a mutually beneﬁcial agreement. But our data does not support this theory. We\nﬁnd servicers equally reluctant to modify loans, whether they are owned in portfolio\nor serviced on behalf of securitization trusts.\nWe argue that a more plausible explanation for the unwillingness of lenders to\nrenegotiate is that it simply isn’t proﬁtable. The reason is that lenders face two\nrisks that can make modiﬁcation a losing proposition. The ﬁrst, which has been\nrecognized as an issue by many observers and researchers, is “redefault risk” – the\npossibility that the borrower who receives a modiﬁcation will default again, and thus\nthe modiﬁcation will have only served to postpone foreclosure and increase the loss\nto the investor as house prices fall and the home itself (the collateral) quite possibly\ndeteriorates. The second risk, which has been largely ignored but I believe is no less\nimportant, and arguably more, is “self-cure risk” – the possibility that the borrower\nwould have repaid the loan without any assistance from the lender. About a third\nof the borrowers in our large sample are current on their mortgages or prepay a year\nafter they become sixty days delinquent. An investor would view assistance given to\nsuch a borrower as “wasted” money.\nLet me conclude by saying that my observation, rooted in our investigation of\nthe data, that servicers and investors may ﬁnd modiﬁcation unproﬁtable should not\nbe misconstrued as suggesting that modiﬁcation is not desirable for society at large\nand the economy. The private net present value and the social net present value of a\nmodiﬁed loan may well be very diﬀerent. An investor may have an urgent need for\ncash that leads it to ﬁnd the short-term payoﬀ of a foreclosure far more attractive\n5See attached, Adelino, M., K. Gerardi and P.

Rosengren \nPresident & Chief Executive Officer \nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston \n \nThe Greater Boston Chamber of Commerce: \nFinancial Services Forum \n \nBoston, Massachusetts \nOctober 2, 2009 \n \n \n \n It is a pleasure to be here today to discuss the outlook for the economy and, in particular, \nthe possible path of inflation and the orientation of monetary policy.*    In unique economic times \nlike we are experiencing, these are issues that policymakers, businesspeople, and citizens are \nrightly concerned about. \n  But before I delve into the topic, I would just like to mention how much we at the Boston \nFederal Reserve Bank enjoy having opportunities to  collaborate with the Chamber, on a number \nof initiatives.  For example, studies undertaken by the Chamber and the Boston Fed, focused on \nmaintaining a highly-educated work force in the region, are leading to concrete actions – \nincluding a successful event we held together for local employers’ summer interns.  It was \n                                                             \n* Of course, the views I express today are my own, not  necessarily those of my colleagues on the Board of \nGovernors or the Federal Open Market Committee (the FOMC). \n1 \n \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, Oct. 2, 2009, at 8:15 a. m. U.S. Eastern Time – or Upon Delivery \n \ndesigned to help the interns lear n about the benefits of living a nd working in Greater Boston after \ngraduation, with an eye to retain ing their talent within the regi on’s workforce.  My colleague \nPaul Connolly, the Bank’s Chief Operating Offi cer – whom many of you know well – has been a \ntrue leader on this effort, and on many others that the Bank and Chamber have pursued together.  \nI want to thank him for that le adership.  Paul and I and our co lleagues at the Bank certainly look \nforward to future collaboration with the Ch amber, to strengthen our local economy. \n Waves of financial turmoil have been with us  for about two years – ever since I took this \njob, by the way – but it was about a year ago that we experienced a series of financial-market \nproblems that brought us to the brink of financial meltdown.  In light of that anniversary, it is \nuseful to reflect on just how far we have come.  A year ago, the stock market was in what anyone \nwould agree was a “tailspin”; short-term and highly liquid financial instruments were either not trading or were trading at huge  spreads over Treasury securities;  and many counterparties were \nwondering whether significant financial institutions had the capacity to survive.   \nOne year later, the S&P 500 Index has increas ed more than 50 percent from its March \nnadir, and many stock market i ndices around the world have staged  similar recoveries, as shown \nin Chart 1 .  The volume of short-term in terbank lending is increasing, and Chart 2  shows that \nthe interest rates banks charge ea ch other on these loans (the Libor\n1 rate) are returning to a level \nwhere the premium or “spread” relative to other fi nancial instruments is comparable to what we \nsaw prior to the crisis. And furthermore, the stock prices of many of our major financial institutions reflect a renewed belie f that they can weather their cred it problems and be profitable.   \n The financial  recovery has in fact led the economic  recovery, which is not unusual when \nemerging from a severe recession.  However, de spite the very positive signs we are seeing, the \n2 \n \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, Oct. 2, 2009, at 8:15 a. m. U.S. Eastern Time – or Upon Delivery \n \neconomic recovery remains fragile and quite capable of falling short of the more positive \nexpectations and degrees of confidence now reflected in financial markets.   \nI believe it is important that monetary and fiscal policy continue to support the economy \nuntil private-sector spending has resumed, and until we are confident that the recovery will continue once the programs that have supported the economy over the past year are removed.  \nWe have historic precedent for accommodative po licies that were removed too quickly, thus \nexacerbating to a significant degree the financia l and economic troubles facing a nation.  Today I \nam going to discuss the risk of this sort of premature policy action, in the context of a specific historical case that I studied in  detail in my research career.  The case involves Japan, where \npolicymakers were confronted with economic di fficulties that were greatly aggravated by \nproblems in real estate, ba nking, and financial markets.\n2 \nSo this morning I intend to provide some of my own perspectives on the economy, the \nFederal Reserve’s actions, and the lessons we can draw from the Japanese experience.  I hope, in \naddition, that my remarks will bolster my funda mental argument:  It is essential that we \nultimately remove many of the ex traordinary programs needed to fight our economic problems – \nand, by the way, many of those programs are already well on the way to being unwound – but, at \nthe same time, we need to be sure the ec onomy continues on a path that will bring the \nunemployment rate down.  And in my view, we need to  see inflation return to a trajectory that is \nmore consistent with where I would like  to see it settle in the longer run. \n \n  \n3 \n \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, Oct. 2, 2009, at 8:15 a. m. U.S. Eastern Time – or Upon Delivery \n \nInflation and Monetary Policy \nI would like to begin with a few of my own perspectives on inflation, and on the \nmonetary policy actions undertak en by the Federal Reserve. \n It is particularly striking to note the divergence we currently  see among professional \nforecasters in their outlook for inflation.  In stable and developed economies, inflation is \ngenerally viewed as moving relatively slowly in response to economic policies.  So it is \nsurprising how divergent the views on the outlook for inflation currently are – even over \nrelatively short horizons.   \nFor example, in Chart 3 we see that the forecasters in the Blue Chip survey disagree to a \nsignificant degree about inflation (measured by the consumer pri ce index or CPI) in even the \nfourth quarter of 2010 – despite the consensus  forecast that the CPI infl ation rate will be about 2 \npercent then.  What is interesting is how wide th e spread is.  The ten highest inflation forecasts \naverage 3.3 percent, while the ten lowest  inflation forecasts average 0.7 percent.3   \nThe CPI forecast can be influenced by assu mptions on food and energy prices.  But no \ndoubt the major reason for this divergence involv es differences of opinion about the significant \ndrivers of inflation. \n The forecasters that are predicting relatively  low inflation over the next several years – \nand I generally share this view  – highlight the importance of excess capacity in the economy.  \nThese models note that the inflati on rate after a recession is often well below the rate prior to the \nrecession, as you can see in Chart 4 .  During recessions, there ar e downward pressures on wages \nand salaries, and many firms find it difficult to pass on price increases.  In fact, a distinctive \nfeature of the current recession has been th e near disappearance of  upward pressure on \n4 \n \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, Oct. 2, 2009, at 8:15 a. m. U.S. Eastern Time – or Upon Delivery \n \ncompensation, as seen in Chart 5 .  Indeed, in my own discussions with small and medium sized \nbusinesses over the past year, it is striking how many have reported  that they have cut wages and \nbenefits in lieu of further layoffs.   \n On the other side of the spectrum, many of the forecasters who expect much higher \ninflation rates have cited as a rationale the dramatic growth in the Federal Reserve balance sheet  \nin response to the financial crisis, as Chart 6  shows.  Just for clarit y, I should note that many \nforeign central banks have taken a similar course with their own balance sheets in this crisis.   \nInitially, much of the increase was related to our  efforts to stabilize financial markets, last \nfall, and was designed to “automatically” diminish as the economy heals.  Most of the programs \ninitiated last fall were designed to be attract ive during periods of fi nancial stress and less \nattractive (that is, quite costly for the participan t) during less stressful pe riods – thus encouraging \nfirms to seek funds from sources other than th e Federal Reserve when market conditions were \nmore normal.   \nIndeed, as Chart 7  shows, Federal Reserve lending to  support money market funds, the \ncommercial paper market, primary dealers, and fore ign central banks grew rapidly last fall, but \nhas since fallen quite dramatically.  In fact , our lending supporting money market funds and \nprimary dealers is now virt ually zero, and the other two programs have shrunk quite \ndramatically.  However, as these programs have wound down, the Federal Reserve has been \npurchasing mortgage-backed securi ties and government securities to  stabilize financial markets \nand lower the cost of funds, to help promote economic growth.  These  purchases have added to \nour balance sheet as the shrinki ng of the liquidity programs has drawn it down – so that on net \nour balance sheet has remained relatively stable, and large, in recent months.  As a reminder, \n5 \n \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, Oct. 2, 2009, at 8:15 a. m. U.S. Eastern Time – or Upon Delivery \n \nwith the constraint of the zero nominal bound on the fed funds rate , alternative policy \ninstruments had to be examined. \n \nLessons from Japan’s Experience  \nWith this background I would now like to sh are some observations on Japan’s experience \n– hopefully to help us narrow this difference of  opinion about inflation’ s trajectory and its \ndrivers.  I should stress at the outs et that I do not equate our situation to Japan’ s, or expect us to \nfollow Japan’s path; but I do think there are insights to gain from  their experience. \n This perspective may be particularly helpful in relation to concerns about the impact of \nthe growth of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet.  The impact is hard to quantify, because we have not needed to take such dramatic actions in  the previous 50 years he re in the United States \nor in most other advanced economies – there is s imply not much historical data on a crisis like \nthis.  The closest precedent to the current expansion of a central bank’s balance sheet in a developed economy involves the actions taken by the Bank of Japan, in response to their \nfinancial crisis that began in the early 1990s.   \nChart 8  shows that following the sharp decline in  stock prices in Japan in 1990, the Bank \nof Japan began to lower interest rates.   Interest rates were reduced quite gradually  – over a four-\nyear period interest rates\n4 moved from over eight percent to one half of one percent.5  The \ngradual nature of this action stands in contrast to Federal Reserve policies in the recent crisis.  Then, once the Bank of Japan had reduced interest  rates to nearly zero, the Bank began using \nwhat you might call non-traditional monetary policy actions.   \n6 \n \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, Oct. 2, 2009, at 8:15 a. m. U.S. Eastern Time – or Upon Delivery \n \nAs there were tentative signs of recovery, and because of concerns with  fiscal deficits, the \nJapanese government announced a tax increase in 1997.  Shortly thereafte r GDP fell sharply and \nJapan went into a period of deflation  that persisted for much  of the past decade.  Chart 9  \nhighlights the fact that during that period, the Bank of Japan nearly  tripled the size of its balance \nsheet.  Despite the sizable expansi on of bank reserves that  this entailed, core consumer prices fell \nthroughout the period – with a brief pause in mi d 2008.  Strikingly, the CPI line is below the zero \nline on the chart for most of a decade.   \nFurthermore, not only was monetary policy a ccommodative, but so was fiscal policy, as \nyou can see in Chart 10 .  The 1997 tax increase notwithstanding, the ratio of government debt to \nGDP more than doubled, and is currently more than  double the rate in the United States.  To be \nclear, however, I would note that Japan’s private saving has historically been much higher than \nthat of the United States. \n So, why did Japan experience deflation desp ite very accommodative fiscal and monetary \npolicy?  Certainly part of the story involves problems with fi nancial institutions.  Japan’s \ngovernment was famously slow to force resolu tion of banking problems, and many Japanese \nbanks were constrained because th eir capital was not sufficient to support growth in their assets.6 \nAs a reminder, loans are assets for banks, and banks are obliged to  maintain a reasonable capital-\nto-assets ratio.   \nAs Chart 11  shows, bank lending in Japan did not e xpand despite the sizable increase in \nthe balance sheet of the Japanese central bank.  Sizable increases in bank reserves will have little \nimpact on the economy if banks are shrinking as sets, which they do primarily by maintaining \ntight credit standards for lending, in  order to meet capital requirements.  In essence, the bank \n7 \n \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, Oct. 2, 2009, at 8:15 a. m. U.S. Eastern Time – or Upon Delivery \n \nreserves sat in the bank ing system.  Had Japanese banks been able to lend these reserves to \ncredit-worthy businesses, it would li kely have spurred economic activity.7  But dormant, un-lent \nbank reserves have little if any effect on spe nding – and consequently, in an environment of \nsignificant excess capacity, will do little to  spur an increase in inflation. \n I see three important lessons to take from the Japanese experience:   \n• First, taking gradual  action in response to a signifi cant asset-bubble decline may not \nbe as effective as taking more aggressive ac tion.  Thus I am pleased to note that both \nthe decrease in U.S. interest rates and the increase in the Federal Reserve’s balance \nsheet have occurred over a much shorter time period than we saw in Japan.   \n• Second, significant expansion of the central bank’s balance sheet is not likely to be \ninflationary during a period when financial institutions are capital-constrained and \nsubstantial excess capacity  exists in the economy.8   \n• Third, persistent problems in the financial  sector may be a signi ficant impediment to \na general economic  recovery, because of the importance of credit being available to \nfinance the economic expansion.   \n \nConclusion \nAnd now I’ll offer a few concluding remarks. \n Based on the historical expe rience with inflation in the United States and Japan, I \npersonally expect our primar y short-run concern to be disinflation  rather than inflation. The \ngrowth rate of the core PCE infl ation index over the past year is 1.3 percent.  This rate is well \n8 \n \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, Oct. 2, 2009, at 8:15 a. m. U.S. Eastern Time – or Upon Delivery \n \nbelow the 2 percent rate that most members of the FOMC expect to see in the long run, as \nrevealed in their published forecasts.9   \nThere remains substantial excess capacity in the economy, and while I expect that we will \nsee positive growth in the third a nd fourth quarter of this year, it will not be sufficient to make \nsignificant headway in improving labor-market condi tions right away.  This significant excess \ncapacity in labor markets has the potential to be disinflationary at a time when the inflation rate \nis already below where we expect it to settle in the long run.  \n Despite the many positive signs we are seeing in the economy, the financial markets and the real economy need more time to heal.  Th ere are significant impe diments to more rapid \ngrowth.  Commercial real estate prices have been falling in many area s of the country, and non-\nperforming commercial real estate loans have been rising. Such loan s are likely to be a potential \nchallenge for many of the banks that are trying to improve their balanc e sheets.  Also, while \ncredit conditions have improved, fi rms and individuals with impaired balance sheets are likely to \nfind credit difficult and costly to obtain.  And i ndividuals that are still recovering from house and \nequity values well below their p eaks are likely to remain slow to spend on consumer goods until \ntheir comfort with their “house hold balance sheet” has been rest ored.  These challenges will \nlikely make the recovery rather  restrained by historical sta ndards, with su bdued levels of \nspending and lending continuing to hold  back a more rapid recovery.  \n While many of the non-traditional approaches  to monetary policy en acted to combat the \nrecession are already in the proc ess of being removed, how quickly  to further reduce the policy \naccommodation should depend on economic conditions.  In particular, we need the economy to \ngrow rapidly enough that unemployment falls substant ially and inflation settles at a rate near 2 \n9 \n \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, Oct. 2, 2009, at 8:15 a. m. U.S. Eastern Time – or Upon Delivery \n \n10 \n                                                            percent.  Price stability implies that the inflat ion rate should not di verge significantly on the \ndownside or upside.  Thus, just as policy needs to  insure that inflation rate does not get too high, \nequally important is that it does not get too low.10   \n The extraordinary economic times we have been experiencing give us all pause, and \nleave many observers with concern about policy ac tions and their possible outcomes.  I believe, \nhowever, that despite  the differences in our economies, the lessons from Japan’s experience are \nilluminating and should bring comfort that current  U.S. policy is on the right path – with \nbeneficial implications for the trajectories  of both inflation and economic growth.   \nThank you. \n   \n \n \n \n \nNOTES: \n \n1  The London Interbank Offered Rate. \n \n2  For additional perspective see my March 20 09 talk entitled “Addressing the Credit Crisis and \nRestructuring the Financial Regulatory System: Lessons  from Japan”, available on the Bank’s website at \nhttp://www.bos.frb.org/news/speech es/rosengren/2009/030209.htm  \n \n3  For the CPI inflation rate. \n \n4  In this case, the uncollateralized call rate. \n \n5  Indeed, it took roughly eight years – early 1991 to early 1999 – to get to 0.25 percent. \n \n6  See the article I wrote with Joe Peek, \"The International Transmission of Financial Shocks: The Case of \nJapan,\" in the American Economic Review  vol. 87, no. 4 (September 1997), pages 495-505.  \n \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, Oct. 2, 2009, at 8:15 a. m.

Rosengren \nPresident & Chief Executive Officer \nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston \n  \nThe Federal Reserve Bank of Boston’s  \n54\nth Economic Conference: \n “After the Fall – Re-evaluating \nSupervisory, Regulatory, and Monetary Policy” \n  \nChatham, Massachusetts \nOctober 21, 2009 \n \n \n \nGood afternoon.  I’d like to welcome ever yone to this conference, which is the \nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston’s 54th economic  conference.  I’d like to thank my \ncolleagues from the Bank for their work in putting together such a dynamic and timely \nprogram. \nThe decision to move our conference to the fall came temporarily into question \nwhen it started snowing this weekend.  But the weather on Sunday didn’t seem to bother our football team, the Patriots, and I don’t th ink our conference will suffer, either.  The \nsnow is behind us and I think you’ll all enjoy New England in the fall. \n 1\n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, October 21, 2009 at 4:30 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY \n \nThroughout its history, this conference has aimed to bring together policymakers, \nbusiness leaders, and academics to discu ss matters of public policy.  This year’s \nconference is very aptly timed, in that the nation is currently in the midst of a very \nimportant debate about what happened over th e last two years and what we should do to \navoid similar problems in the future.   \nI want to kick off the conference by highlighting [slide 1]  some of the \nextraordinary things that have happened over the course of the last two years, and by \nsuggesting some questions we might want to  address over the next two days at this \nconference.*  I think everyone here is well aware th at over the last two years, government \nintervention into both financial markets and fi nancial institutions has been extraordinary.  \nThere has been a major investment of taxpaye r dollars in a variety of institutions.  And \nthe intervention has not only i nvolved depository institutions, but also a variety of other \ninstitutions that were seen as systemically important but did not necessarily take deposits. \nThis is a phenomenon that has occurred not  only in the United States but actually \nin many corners of the globe.  So while you might say “the match was struck” in the \nUnited States, the firestorm that we’ve seen ove r the last two years has, in many respects, \nbeen global – and policy responses have  been global in nature as well. \nI would highlight [slide 2]  a few of the significant “spi llovers” that occurred as a \nresult of the problems that were occurri ng at many of the large global financial \ninstitutions.  Perhaps the most striking was that previously very liquid financial markets essentially “seized up.”  Transactions we re not being done at anything near normal \n                                                \n \n* Of course, the views I express today are my ow n, not necessarily those of my colleagues on the \nBoard of Governors or the Federal Open Market Committee (the FOMC). \n 2\n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, October 21, 2009 at 4:30 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY \n \nprices, and in fact the bid-to-ask spread fo r many financial transactions became very \nwide. \nThe United States’ economy went into a deep and protracted recession.  And we \nwere not alone.  Much of the rest of the worl d also followed suit, in part as a result of a \nvery significant drop in international trade.  Not only did the Federal Reserve reduce its \ntarget interest rate to close to zero, but so  did central banks in many other parts of the \nworld.  And just as our deficit has swelled, so  have deficits in ma ny other countries that \nexperienced significant problems as a re sult of the financial crisis.   \nSo, this “financial firestorm” has raised a number of questions [slide 3]  that I \nthink are appropriate to e xplore at this conference; among them the following: \n \n• Was this crisis preventable? \n• Could it have been better contained? \n• What are the implications for government structures? \n• What are the implications for government policies? \n• What are the implications for the global economy? \n \nNow I’d like to digress for just a moment to explore an analogy to what recently \nhappened in financial markets, drawing on a very different type of crisis that occurred \nprimarily in the 1700s and 1800s, but not since th en.  I think there are some broad lessons \nto be drawn from this historical example.   \nAfter all, we are from the Federal Rese rve Bank of Boston, and Boston is a very \nhistorical city.  I want to hi ghlight an element of that hi story – the second Great Boston \n 3\n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, October 21, 2009 at 4:30 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY \n \nFire, which occurred steps from the current Federal Reserve building.  The results of the \nfire are shown in this picture [slide 4].   As you can see, the devastation was \nextraordinary, with over 700 buildings burned to the ground.  It was a tragic event, with a \nlarge loss of human life.  The destruction that occurred in  the downtown area devastated \nthe core of the city. \nI am not an historian, but the popular hist ories of the Great Fi re suggest a couple \nof striking thing about this tr agedy.  I think we do well to consider the analogies to the \ncurrent financial crisis. \nThe next slide [slide 5]  highlights patterns in some of the Great Fires.  The first \nthing to note is that for many of the citie s that had Great Fires, the tragedies were \nrepeated.  Boston had one in 1760, but roughly 100 years later, there was a second.  So \nactions taken as a result of the first episode did not prevent a recurrence.  This extends \nbeyond any one city, because as you can see th ere were a number of great fires in \nAmerican cities – and this is far from a co mprehensive list.  Needless to say they had \ndevastating results both in lo ss of human life and in loss of  buildings, businesses, and \nemployment.  As we contemplate the analogy, I’m sure all of us here would prefer to not \nsee a repeat of the financial fi restorm of the last two years. \nNote that as you get into th e mid to late 1900s you don’t see Great Fires anymore.  \nWhy is this?  I think there are a number of reasons, rooted in what really created some of \nthe Great Fires of the 1800s [slide 6]. \nOne cause was, clearly, dangerous conditi ons.  Buildings back then were much \nmore flammable – with either wooden structures  or at least wooden r oofs, as was true in \nBoston.  Certain business activities added danger to that situation – for example certain \n 4\n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, October 21, 2009 at 4:30 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY \n \ntypes of manufacturing taking place in dense do wntown areas.  Policy also played a role \n– interestingly, inventories in a ttics were not taxed, so attics were often stuffed with very \nflammable items.   \nAnother factor involves what you might call “inadequate mitigants.”  We take for \ngranted out fire departments now, but fi re departments in the 1800s were often \ninadequately equipped.  And the water supply in American cities was quite problematic.  \nIn the case of the great Boston fire the water pressure was completely inadequate to reach \nthe taller buildings that were  being built, but pleas to upgrade water mains (to keep pace \nwith newer buildings) had been rebuffed.  Fi re hydrants had varying sized couplings, so \nthe fire brigade’s equipment didn’t fit on some hydrants.   \nAnd finally, there was often insufficient en forcement of much of the fire code – \nwhile there were fire codes in place, to a large degree th ey were ignored. \nI’d also observe that one of the elements  you read about in Great Fires seems to \nbe – to borrow a phrase from fiction – “a series  of unfortunate events.”  Usually there are \nsome unusual, but not unimaginable, combinati ons of occurrences that  together escalate \nthe situation.  In the case of Boston’s sec ond Great Fire, one of the strange occurrences \nwas that all of the specially-trained fire horse s had come down with an equine flu, and as \na result the fire engines had to be pulled by people, as best they could. \nSo why do we not see Great Fires in our cities anymore [slide 7] ?  Well, cities \nstarted to take fire prevention quite serious ly.  When the cities burned down, many of \nthem rebuilt in a very different way, improving their layouts to inhibit the spread of fires \nthat might emerge.  Building materials improved – if you look around downtown Boston \n 5\n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, October 21, 2009 at 4:30 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY \n \ntoday you don’t see wooden structures or woode n roofs.  And strict enforcement of fire \ncodes emerged.   \nObviously there are much improved means to try to prevent fires, and to put fires \nout should they occur.  We ha ve professionalized firefighting in our major cities.  Fire \nequipment has improved dramatically.  All this  was sufficient to reduce significantly the \nrisk of Great Fires.  Certainly there have been fires, but they haven’t had the same \ndevastating effect as in pr ior eras.  Look again at the scene of Boston’s Great Fire [slide \n8], and then at the approximate scene today [slide 9] .  What can we learn from this \nanalogy to the financial firestorms of late – and can we make as much progress in the \nfinancial realm?   \nI would just highlight [slide 10]  a few things that I hope we contemplate in the \ncourse of this conference.   \nFirst I think we do need to do a better job of improving our ability to mitigate \nvarious crises.  High on my list of things we  need to attend to is to have in place \nresolution authority for all systemically-importa nt institutions.  Had we had in place such \nresolution authority, the central bank would not have had to get involved with the \nfinancial problems of in dividual institutions.   \nWhile I don’t think the Federal Reserve s hould be involved in the resolution of \nindividual institutions, it’s very important that someone does have that authority.  This \ncrisis would have unfolded quite differently had resolution authority been in place.   \nA second question I think we ought to be discussing is whether or not we can \nsimplify the structure of many of our inst itutions – akin, in my analogy, to making \nbuildings less fire-prone through enforced bui lding codes, and making fires less likely to \n 6\n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, October 21, 2009 at 4:30 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY \n \nspread by instituting planning guidelines and zoning rules.  There have been questions \nabout whether institutions should have what amount to “living wills” – meaning they’ve \ncome up with a plan so that if they get into financial problems, the plan for resolution is \nrelatively clear.  That would probably require simplifying institutions’ structures.  So, we should explore the extent to which regulator y and supervisory procedures should make \nsure institutions are easy to resolve – in other words, that they have simple enough structures so that if they do get into trouble you can sell part s of them without necessarily \nhaving to take them over. \nAnother area that I hope we focus on is improving some of the tools for dealing \nwith the problems.  This is akin to fixing the water pressure, sta ndardizing the hydrants, \nand ensuring that fire equipment can make  it to the scene – horses or not.   \nIn this vein I would mention the issue of  convertible debt, which is getting quite a \nbit of attention lately.  I think this is a ve ry good idea – giving the ability to convert debt \nto equity in times of serious stress in the banking system.  Also, during this crisis, substantial dividends were paid in the initial phases of the crisis at institutions that ended \nup needing significant government support.  Duri ng a financial crisis it is important that \nindividual institutions as well as the banking system more generally take measures to \nretain capital.  This would make it less likely that inst itutions need government support –  \nbut also would make it less likely that banks sh rink in the middle of a crisis, reducing the \ncritically important availability of credit. \nOther issues worth discussi ng at the conference are hi gher capital requirements \nfor systemically important institutions, and findi ng ways to build up loan loss reserves in \n 7\n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, October 21, 2009 at 4:30 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY \n \n 8the “good times.”  In addition, we need to reduc e the risk that large financial institutions \nbecome illiquid during a financial crisis. \nNext [slide 11]  I would argue that th e appropriate institution or institutions need a \nmandate to focus on systemic risk.  Mandates ma tter.  The last two y ears have shown that \nwe clearly need institutions that have a focus on addressing systemic risk.  With more and \nclearer focus on systemic risk, there will be more focus on identifying problems earlier and making sure those problems don’t become much larger over time. \nFinally, I think we should be discussing the issue of comprehensive oversight.  \nThere were major gaps evident in this last cr isis, which allowed risks to build up in areas \nthat were not necessarily inside regulated financial institutions.  I think we need a \nmechanism whereby if we see large asset grow th that’s being financed by leverage, we \nshould at least be asking ques tions, and there should be or ganizations designed to think \nabout whether these situations are posing systemic risks that  we need to address.   \nHopefully these and other questions will be addressed in the papers we’ll see \npresented over the next two days.  This is a time where we need to  re-consider some of \nwhat we’ve done and really learn the lessons fr om the last two years.   My hope for this \nconference is that each of us will gain a num ber of insights – allowing those of us who \nare policymakers to better serv e the public’s intere sts.  I wish you a very engaging two \ndays. \nI hope everybody enjoys the conference, and now we’ll start with  the first session. \n \n\n1.

I think it is incumbent on us to explore the \nimplications of these spillovers for both publ ic policy and macroeconomic modeling – which \ngenerally incorporates little if any role for financial intermediaries and their problems.1 \n My remarks today center on a particular irony that  I would like to discuss – that, despite the \nwidespread acknowledgement of the “too big to fail” problem, many of our largest global banks have \nactually expanded during the crisis.  Indeed, in many cases th e sizes of the largest banks have become \nquite large relative to the sizes of both their home  and host  countries.   \nAs a result, the ability – more specifically, the economic capacity – of many countries to \nresolve troubled global banks is, in  some instances, in question.  Als o, the potential cost to taxpayers \nhas made providing emergency government support to global banks deeply unpopular – a situation \nthat in some cases significantly complicates the available resolution options.  Nor is this a new \nproblem, as illustrated by the Japanese experience in the previous decade.  \n Policymakers, academics, and other observers ar e proposing a variety of measures that would \nreduce the probability of a large bank failing, or lim it the potential impact if  a large bank does fail. \nBut please note that I am sharing my own general views today, rather than  discussing any specific \nproposal under consideration.2 \nUnderlining the seriousness of th e matter, I would note that larg e banks do not tend to fail in \nisolation.  Rather, large-bank failu res tend to be clustered – highlighting the need to minimize the \nmacroeconomic  impact should groups of larg e banks become troubled.   \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Tuesday, November 10, 2009 at 11:15 a.m. U.S. East ern Time and 4:15 p.m. in Lon don, England – or Upon Deliver y * \n \n \n \n 3After briefly reviewing some of the issues that have become evident in the recent crisis, I will \ncover some of the options for reform.  Allow me to  preview some of my points, which I will then go \non to explore more fully: \n \n• First , despite concerns about the t oo-big-to-fail issue, in a variety of countries the largest \nbanks are becoming ever larger relative to the size of the economy.3 \n• Second, banks that are global  (not just large) create additional complications – they are \nmore difficult to resolve and can “export” capi tal adequacy problems (a so-called “credit \ncrunch”) to countries th at host their operations. \n• Third , so-called “living wills” that outline, in advance, wind-down arrangements in the \nevent of a failure, are not only important for addressing too-big-to-fail problems but can \nalso be used to enhance the coordination of the bank regulators and supervisors in various \naffected countries – which should improve resolution procedures. \n• Fourth , narrowly defining the acceptable activities of financial institutions will merely \nshift the location of systemic problems, rather than re duce them.  Instead, systemically \nimportant institutions should in my view be required to hold greater reserves and capital, to be built up during good times.  Also, meas ures should be put in  place that would \nfacilitate global banks’ obtaining and reta ining capital during economic downturns.  Such \nmeasures could include automatic reductions  of dividends, and re quired use of debt \ninstruments that could be converted to equity  should the firms face a liquidity or solvency \ncrisis.  And in general, supe rvisory policy should be more focused on the potential build-\nup of systemic risk. \n \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Tuesday, November 10, 2009 at 11:15 a.m. U.S. East ern Time and 4:15 p.m. in Lon don, England – or Upon Deliver y * \n \n \n \n 4Global Banks, Global Problems \nOne of the salient features of the most recent cr isis is that among banking  institutions, initially \nthe problems were concentrated in large global institutions actively engaged in complex financial \ntransactions.   \nThis feature of the crisis crea ted a number of significant complications.  First, because many \nof the troubled financial transactions were bilateral – that is, between two firms or counterparties \nrather than through established exchanges – the firms were not only large, but were highly interconnected.  As a result, the ability (or inabilit y) to fulfill the terms of financial contracts had a \nsignificant potential to impact c ounterparties.  Second, when a large interconnected financial \ninstitution became troubled, there were only a very li mited number of institutions with sufficient size \nor sophistication to acquire the problem institution.   Third, banking problems are particularly difficult \nto resolve when the banking institution spans national borders.  Because of the nation-specific nature of bankruptcy codes, bank regulation, bank supervis ion, and lender-of-last-resor t facilities, there are \ncurrently no robust infrastructures for addressing the resolution issues surrounding global institutions.   \nFourth, many of the activities that proved problem atic were transactions involving supposedly highly-\nrated assets held in off-balance- sheet entities like conduits or “struc tured investment vehicles,” which \nwere not particularly transparent.  And the le gal, accounting, and reput ational issues surrounding \nthese off-balance-sheet activ ities were often unclear.  \nThe result was that a variety of financial inst itutions became “too big to fail” not because of \ndeposits , but rather because they were so intertwined in  the global financial infrastructure that their \ndisorderly failure could cause the flow of financ ial transactions to freeze – calling into question the \nfinancial viability of their counter parties and the functioning of market s where they were key players.  \nIn essence, “too big to fail” was really “too in terconnected to fail” or “too relied-upon to fail.” \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Tuesday, November 10, 2009 at 11:15 a.m. U.S. East ern Time and 4:15 p.m. in Lon don, England – or Upon Deliver y * \n \n \n \n 5Again, as the discussion of too-bi g-to-fail institutions has increased so (somewhat ironically) \nhas the size of many of our larg est global financial firms.  Figure 1  shows the size of the three largest \nU.S. banks, relative to the size of U.S. GDP.   As is  clear from the figure, the largest institutions have \nover time become larger relative to the size of the economy.  And not  only have many of the largest \nU.S. banking institutions grown larg er, but in some cases they have become more complex – as they \nacquired firms that offer invest ment banking services and, also, expanded the global reach of the \nacquiring firm. \nThe trend toward rapid growth of  the largest financial instituti ons has not been unique to the \nUnited States.  As Figure 2  illustrates, the three largest banks in many countries have grown, relative \nto the size of the country’s economy.  What is also apparent – note the scale on the figures – is that in \nmany countries the size of the thr ee largest financial institutions rela tive to the size of the economy is \nmuch larger than it is in the United States.  In fact, in several countries the combined size of the \nlargest three banks is substantially larger than the GDP of the country.4   \n \nImplications for Policymakers \nWhen financial firms become large relative to  the size of their home country’s economy, it can \npose significant challenges for policymakers.  Firs t, should the largest banks become troubled, there \nmay be questions as to the financia l capacity of the sovereign nation to resolve these firms.  Second, \neven if there is the capacity , the costs to taxpayers may be so large that there is not the political will  to \ntake the steps that would ensure  a non-disruptive reso lution.  Third, in many countries where banks \nare large relative to GDP, the larg est banks have significant operations  outside the national borders of \nthe home country.  Fourth, most countries ar e likely to follow measures that protect domestic  \ndepositors and borrowers relative to foreign depositors and borrowers, and will be more focused on \npreventing “collateral damage” to their own domestic economy. \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Tuesday, November 10, 2009 at 11:15 a.m. U.S. East ern Time and 4:15 p.m. in Lon don, England – or Upon Deliver y * \n \n \n \n 6We care about problems at large banks because  of the collateral damage caused by banks \nshrinking their balance sheet to sati sfy capital requirements.  As you know, loans are assets for banks.  \nBanks must maintain a reasonable capital-to-assets ratio.  In times of stre ss banks may shrink their \nbalance sheet by tightening terms of credit – which can exacerbate problems that occur during an \neconomic downturn.5   \nAs Figure 3  illustrates, credit to business in the United States has been declining significantly \nover the past year.  While loan demand does tend to fall during economic downturns, loan supply is \nalso likely to decline if ba nks become capital constrained.  And as Figure 4  illustrates, the shrinkage \ntends to be larger at institutions  with a higher probability of failu re, as denoted by their supervisory \nratings.  As a few financial institutions become la rge relative to the size of a country’s economy, the \nneed to simultaneously shrink balance sheets can have potentially serious consequences for bank-\ndependent borrowers.  Thus, large banks become im portant because they not only can be too big to \nfail, but also because of the potential macroeconom ic consequences of shrinking.  In a sense, they \nbecome “too big to allow to become troubled or  constrained,” consider ing the impact on bank-\ndependent borrowers. \nA natural consequence of being concerned abou t the domestic macroeconomic implications of \nbanking problems might be to encourage globally- active banks to expand domestically but shrink \ninternationally.  This is what large Japanese ba nks did during the 1990s.  Ja panese banks significantly \nreduced their lending in the United States and Europe – which had c onsequences for credit conditions \nin the host countries.6 \nThus, global banks pose two significant  problems for host countries.   \nFirst, should the bank’s pare nt holding company fail, host-country operations could suffer \ncollateral damage.  Host country lia bility holders could be disadvantage d, particularly if assets were \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Tuesday, November 10, 2009 at 11:15 a.m. U.S. East ern Time and 4:15 p.m. in Lon don, England – or Upon Deliver y * \n \n \n \n 7transferred out of the host country prior to failure.  Because bankruptcy and bank resolutions are \nnationally focused, the impact on host country operations could be quite uncertain.   \nA second issue is the concern that global banks may export a credit crunch to countries that \nhost them.  To the extent a global bank decides to reduce operations because of balance sheet \nproblems, this reduction may exacerbate othe r economic problems in the host country.   \nIn light of these concerns, many countries are considering requir ing the domestic operations of \nglobal banks that they host to be separately capitalized.  This would have several potential benefits to \nthe host country.  Should the global ope rations run into trouble, there would still be capital supporting \nthe host country operations.  This would mean th e host country operations would be self supporting, \nand might facilitate a sale of the operations to other owners, if needed.  If the domestic regulator was \nto restrict the ability to repatria te capital to the home c ountry, then there would be little incentive to \nshrink the host country operations – thus avoiding the potential for im porting a credit crunch from the \nglobal bank to the host country.   \nOf course, the cost of such a restriction is th at it impedes the free flow of bank capital across \nnational borders.  As a result, global banks may be less willing to expand internationally, and capital \nmay be “trapped” in countries that end up having limited economic prospects or lending \nopportunities.  The cost of the inefficient use of ba nk capital is an area that deserves more research \nattention. \nWhether or not requiring bank ope rations to be separately capitalized within national borders \nmakes sense will depend, in part, on improving global resolution procedures for failing firms.  If countries can coordinate resolu tion and bankruptcy procedures, some of the costs of global bank \nfailures can be reduced.  But in the absence of im proved coordination, it seems quite likely that many \ncountries will decide to insulate their banking system and ec onomy by requiring the domestic \noperations of global banks to be separately capitalized. \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Tuesday, November 10, 2009 at 11:15 a.m. U.S. East ern Time and 4:15 p.m. in Lon don, England – or Upon Deliver y * \n \n \n \n 8Global coordination is also critical  if the so-called “living wills”  of financial firms are to be \ndrafted and utilized.  Living wills, wherein banks must detail how they would be resolved should they \nbecome troubled – or “seriously ill”, if you want to  continue the living will metaphor – are a potential \nsupervisory tool that I and many othe rs support.  However, for the tool  to be effective, a global bank’s \nmanagement team needs to have a clear idea of how regulators will react when a global bank becomes \ntroubled.  To truly be effective, a living will for a global bank would not only require a plan \ndeveloped and kept up to date by management, but also an agreement among regulators in different \ncountries that such a plan would be f easible – since supervisory, regulat ory, and legal restrictions are \ncountry dependent.  In essence, in the case of glob al banks, living wills may serve as a mechanism to \nencourage greater synchronization of supervisory policies across countries. \nI would note, however, that there may be areas that are not easily addressed by such living \nwills.  Financial institutions that  are critical market makers – or who engage extensively in \ncomplicated financial contracti ng not involving exchanges or cl earing houses – are two possible \nexamples.  However, if the living will identifies these areas, the require ment could be made that they \nbe run in separately capitalized s ubsidiaries, where these subsidiaries  hold significantl y more capital \nthan other areas of the organizati on.  Alternatively, the re quirement could be made that such activities \nbe run in independent companies – as activities that  are not seen as appropriate to run out of large \nglobal banks.  \nEffective  living wills are also likely to identify areas where banks have chosen particularly \ncomplicated legal structures – pe rhaps to avoid taxes, capital charges, or regulati on.  Complicated \nstructures that make resolution difficult impose exte rnalities that will likel y need to be addressed \ninternationally.   \nThe trade-off between the commercial benefits  of complicated struct ures and the potential \npublic costs of resolving complicated  organizations is an area that deserves more supervisory and \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Tuesday, November 10, 2009 at 11:15 a.m. U.S. East ern Time and 4:15 p.m. in Lon don, England – or Upon Deliver y * \n \n \n \n 9international study.  One potential approach is to add significant Pillar Two capital under the Basel \nAccord for banks that choose complicated structures .  This would essentially impose on institutions \nthat make themselves difficult to resolve a need to  hold additional cap ital.  At a minimum, living wills \nshould document the organizational purpose of different  legal entities, and supe rvisors would have the \nability to compare those structures with compe titors who have chosen simpler structures.    \nA more draconian solution that ha s been floated by some observers  is to move to narrow the \nactivities of banks.  Narrowed banks would be constrained to only engage in  very limited activities, \nand in particular would be banned from activities viewed as especially ri sky, such as proprietary \ntrading. \n  Personally I am skeptical that such dramatic action would significantly limit systemic risk, \nfor several reasons.   \nFirst, even narrowly defined financial institutions can run into difficulties.  One example \ninvolves money-market funds in the United States, which are very limited in their activities, and are \nonly allowed to hold highly liquid, highly rated fina ncial instruments.  Nonetheless, despite this \n“narrowness,” there was a run on prime money market funds resulting from a variety of interconnected factors, which ultimately required the creation of an insurance scheme and the establishment of temporary liquidi ty facilities – and even so, there were significant disruptions to \nshort-term credit markets, which greatly complicated financial problems in the United States last fall.   \nSecond, firms that do not engage in traditional banking activities can run into difficulty and \ntransmit their problems to the broader financial system.  In fact, the recent government interventions were not driven by deposit insurance.  The interventions were driven by concern over troubles at \nfirms so integrated in financial ma rkets that their failure would resu lt in financial and macroeconomic \nconsequences that would likely be unacceptable.   \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Tuesday, November 10, 2009 at 11:15 a.m. U.S. East ern Time and 4:15 p.m. in Lon don, England – or Upon Deliver y * \n \n \n \n 10Lehman Brothers did not have FDIC-insured de posits; rather it was systemically important \nbecause it was a significant counterpa rty to myriad financial transact ions.  Its failure to meet its \nobligations created uncertainty a bout the exposure of counterpartie s and the ability to complete \nfinancial transactions in a variety of markets, cau sing a financial market “freeze.”  The need for the \nestablishment of appropriate reso lution powers – and greater apprec iation of the systemic risks \ncreated by investment banks that might be over-leve raged and possess too little liquidity – should be \noverall lessons drawn from the crisis.    \nMoving to a narrow-bank approach is likely to merely shift the systemic risk out of banks but \nnot significantly reduce it.  Large interconnected fi rms with extensive lendi ng do not necessarily need \nto be financed by bank deposits, as was s hown by problems at many investment banks.  Instead, I \nwould advocate an alternative approach.  For syst emically important institutions, the risk of \ninsolvency should be reduced by requiring more cap ital, and requiring the in stitutions to build up \nlarger reserves during good times.  Also, measures  should be put in place that would facilitate \nsystemically important institutions obtaining an d retaining capital during economic downturns.  By \nhaving mandatory conversion of debt and mandatory reduction of dividends, banks could retain \nsufficient capital – so they hopefully  would not need to shrink during downturns.  In addition, as I \nhave argued in other talks, supe rvisors of such systemic instit utions should have the mandated \nresponsibility and authority to a ddress emerging systemic concerns. \n Concluding Remarks \nIn conclusion, I would just reiterate that the recent turmoil occurred at a time when financial \ninstitutions were becoming large relative to the size of their home  country economies.  The problems \nhighlighted by the financial turmoil illustrate how crit ical it is to address the problems of “too big to \nfail.”   \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Tuesday, November 10, 2009 at 11:15 a.m. U.S. East ern Time and 4:15 p.m. in Lon don, England – or Upon Deliver y * \n 11                                                 \n \n \nAs I have noted today, large in stitutions often are characteri zed by international expansion.  \nGlobalization significantly complicates the ability to resolve large financial institutions.  However, I \nexpect that “living wills” may be a mechanism not only to better understand the difficulties with resolving large complicated institutions, but al so may serve as a vehicle to enhance greater \ninternational coordination, which will be crucial going forward.  In addition, moving to establish a \nclear mandate for systemic regulatory responsibility is critical, as is prov iding the given regulatory \nentity the power to enforce that mandate. \nI thank you again for inviting me to speak with you today. \n \n \n \nNOTES  \n1  Although, certainly, some such research is being done. \n \n2  I have considered the topic of systemic regulation in several recent speeches:   \nIn a recent talk (“Could a Systemic Regulator Have Seen the Current Crisis?”, available at \nhttp://www.bos.frb.org/news/speeches/rosengren/2009/041509.htm) I st ressed that we need to have \norganizations with explicit responsib ility for financial stability (charged with making sure that “contagious” \nfailures of financial institutions do not occur, and aler t to trends emerging across a swath of interconnected \ninstitutions and counterparties).   \nIn another talk (“Challenges in Resolving Systemical ly Important Financial Institutions”, available at \nhttp://www.bos.frb.org/news/speeches/rosengren/2009/050509 .htm), I made some observations related to the \npowers a systemic regulator would need in order to mitigate problems we have seen.   \nIn another talk (“The Roles and Responsibiliti es of a Systemic Regulator,” available at \nhttp://www.bos.frb.org/news/speeches/rosengren/2009/062909.htm), I highlighted differences between a \nmacroprudential supervisor and one focused on traditional bank-solvency oversight, touched on the \ncharacteristics that render institutions “systemically  important,” and discussed some of the roles and \nresponsibilities a systemic regulator should have in orde r to prevent contagious failures (in particular, the \nability to supervise capital structure,  liquidity risk and asset-liability management, and risk management).  \nAnd in remarks at a recent panel discussion I shared my belief that the ways that financial institutions \nand markets, and financial matters such as liquidity and securitization, interact with the real economy must be \nwell understood, and worked into preventive measu res and supervisory frameworks (available at \nhttp://www.bos.frb.org/news/speeches/rosengren/2009/060509.htm).   \n \n3  For example, as measured by share of GDP. \n \n4  For some countries not shown on Figure 2 – such as Iceland – the share is even higher.  As of June 30, \n2008, the size of Iceland's three largest banks as a shar e of GDP approached 1,000 percent (specifically, 985 \npercent).  \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Tuesday, November 10, 2009 at 11:15 a.m. U.S. East ern Time and 4:15 p.m. in Lon don, England – or Upon Deliver y * \n 12                                                                                                                                                                     \n \n \n \n5  As I have noted in prior talks, the losses of cap ital and de-leveraging of balance sheets at financial \ninstitutions serve as a drag on the economy, as financial in stitutions focus on restructuring their balance sheets \nwith the consequent tightening of lending standards.  Recall that a loan is counted as an asset on a bank's \nbalance sheet. Banks hold capital in part to reserve ag ainst the possibility that a loan defaults, and must \nmaintain a reasonable ratio of capital to assets. If a ba nk experiences a reduction in the value of its capital, it \nmust take steps to shrink the asset side of its balance sh eet in order to restore its desired capital-to-assets ratio. \nThe bank becomes more restrictive in its lending – no small matter for the broader economy when you consider \nthat, thanks to leverage, when a bank's capital declines, the bank must reduce its loans by much more to \nmaintain its capital-to-assets ratio. In  addition to this state of affairs, often referred to as a \"credit crunch,\" a \nnew and unwelcome wrinkle occurred in many short-te rm credit markets during the recent financial turmoil − \nsomething you might call a \"liquidity lock.\" By liquidity lock, I mean extreme risk aversion by many investors \nand institutions, which makes short-term financing difficu lt to come by for even the most creditworthy firms – \neven financing for very short maturities, measured in days.   \nSee “The Impact of Financial Institu tions and Financial Markets on the Re al Economy: Implications of \na 'Liquidity Lock'”, delivered at The University of Wisconsin – Madison in October 2008 (available at \nhttp://www.bos.frb.org/news/speeches/rosengren/2008/100908.htm). \n \n6  Japanese banks in the 1990s tended to shrink thei r assets abroad, in some cases pulling out of markets \nwhere their prospects were arguably better  than their prospects from additional domestic loans.  See the article \nI wrote with Joe Peek, \"Collateral Damage: Effects of the Japanese Bank Crisis on Real Activity in the United States,\" in the American Economic Review , vol. 90, no. 1 (March 2000), pages 30-45.

I have always \nloved newspapers, and now as a policymaker I have an even greater appreciation for the \nways that reporters, editors, and publishers  inform the public, ask good and important \nquestions, and often influence outcomes.\n* \n From all I have been hearing, it is not an  easy time to be a newspaper publisher.  \nSo we have something in common.  It has not be en an especially easy time to be a central \nbanker, either.   \n                                                 \n* Of course, the views I express today are my ow n, not necessarily those of my colleagues on the \nBoard of Governors or the Federal Open Market Committee (the FOMC). \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL Thursday, December 3, 2009 at 12:45 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY \n \n 2As publishers you must spend a great deal  of time thinking about the key stories \nof our time – and the ways that your empl oyees are uncovering them,  reporting them, \nand putting forth the narratives that engage readers and shape the common understanding.  \nHere, too, we have something in common.  Central bankers care deeply about what \npeople believe – that is, the st ories they deem true – about  issues like economic growth, \nfinancial stability, and infla tion expectations.  I know we  could do a better job of \nexplaining ourselves and communicating – alt hough I think we do a much better job now \nthan we did in the past. \nBeyond those core central bank responsibi lities, we also follow with intense \ninterest the commonly accepted na rratives – the stories, if you will – of this extraordinary \nfinancial crisis.  Making sure these comp lex stories are known and understood can benefit \neveryone, if in doing so we find ways to avoid repeating  the problems of the past two \nyears.  It is also important that we don’ t assume the wrong lessons and adopt the wrong \npolicies, going forward. \n Of course, it is important and natu ral for the public, and the public’s \nrepresentatives in Congress, to ask how th e nation encountered such problems, and to \nvigorously explore what public policies – including those re lated to the central bank – \nwould best prevent future crises.  In short,  to insist on getting the “straight story.” \nIn that spirit, today I would like to “repor t” to you three stories of this crisis – \nspecifically around the controve rsial, emergency actions taken by the central bank.  \nUnderstanding the context  of those actions may help in understanding what policy \nreforms are necessary.   \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL Thursday, December 3, 2009 at 12:45 P.M.

The three \nstories I will touch on are the following: \n \n• First, why it was necessary to “bail ou t” certain firms – like AIG – and what \nthis story teaches us about avoiding such necessities in the future. \n• Second, why the Federal Reserve took such aggressive action to dramatically \nexpand its balance sheet to address the crisis – and what implications and \neffects we expect from those actions.  \n• Third, the story behind what seems to  many like a tendency of the Fed and \nother policymakers to focus more on  Wall Street than on Main Street. \n \nThe Straight Story, Book One \nThe story of AIG is being told by many observers.  I want to give you my take on \nwhy it was necessary to “bail out” AIG – and what the story says about how such \noutcomes can be avoided in the future.  This na rrative is, at its heart, about “the lesser of \nseveral evils.” \nAIG was the largest U.S. insurance comp any, with extensive business activities \naround the world.  Importantly, AIG was one of the few companies that carried a Triple \nA credit rating.   \nThe insurance subsidiaries were overseen  by state insurance regulators, since \nthere was and is no federal regulator for insu rance, and the Federal Reserve does not have \nregulatory authority over insurance companies (n or do the OCC or FDIC, for that matter).  \nAIG owned a small savings and loan institut ion that the Office of Thrift Supervision \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL Thursday, December 3, 2009 at 12:45 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY \n \n 4oversaw.  Indeed, from our perspective the f act that the Federal Re serve had little by way \nof concrete, quantifiable information on the ac tivities of the country ’s largest insurer, \nbecause it had no role in regulating or supervising the company,  was one of the serious \nproblems going into this crisis. \nAs a result of AIG’s Triple A credit rati ng, a group of “financial engineers” in a \nrelatively small subsidiary of the company (A IG Financial Products) realized that they \ncould sell insurance against the default of securities, including securities backed by \nsubprime mortgages.  Because of AIG’s reputation and stellar rating, parties felt \ncomfortable buying the insuran ce (knows as credit default swaps) from AIG, and AIG \nbecame a major insurer against credit lo sses on these types of securities.   \nThere was little supervisory ove rsight of the institution, a nd these transactions.  In \neffect, the subsidiary became an unregulated hedge fund within AIG  using the credit \nrating of the entire company to place large bets , with little held in reserve against these \nbets going bad.   \nThis reflects a significant risk-manag ement breakdown within the company.  It \nalso represents a significant gap in superv ision and regulation, because AIG had become \nsystemically important by virtue of its out-sized role in writing this kind of insurance – but no one was aware of the full extent of the activities that made it systemically \nimportant and risky. \nVital to this story and the ot hers I will tell you today is the context  – essentially, \nwhat was happening in the economy and financ ial markets as AIG’s problems were being \nrevealed.  Figure 1  provides a timeline showing some of those events.   \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL Thursday, December 3, 2009 at 12:45 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY \n \n 5Bear Stearns had failed earlier in the year, Lehman Brothers had failed that \nweekend, and it was announced th at Merrill Lynch was being acquired.  The viability of \nthe traditional investment banking model wa s fully in question. The stock market had \ndeclined sharply (as shown in Figure 2 ), and many of the credit markets were in severe \ndisarray.   Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae ha d been taken over by the government.  The \nlosses on assets in a money-market fund known as the Reserve Fund pushed its value below 100 cents on the dollar – it “broke the buck” – and this caused a run on prime \nmoney market funds that, as Figure 3  shows, was seriously disrupting short-term \nfinancial markets as mutual funds scrambled to increase liquidity. Th ere was essentially a \n“run” on prime money-market funds.  And seve ral very large banks were rumored to be \nin trouble – including Wac hovia, the nation’s fourth la rgest bank; and Washington \nMutual, the largest remaining thrift since Countrywide had been acquired. \nMy next slide (Figure 4)  reprints some of the unprecedented headlines emanating, \nmorning after morning, in some of the darkest da ys of the crisis.  To me, they serve as a \nbracing reminder of where we were then – a nd, again, the context for what was done.   \n Many firms were reporting an unwillingness to  trade in financial contracts, as the \nhealth of the counterparties to those cont racts became a growing concern.  You’ve \nprobably heard the maxim that markets a bhor uncertainty, and the aforementioned \nproblems left almost every counterparty tain ted by uncertainty related to \"cratering\" \nassets they might be holding – representi ng losses which might prevent them from \nholding up their end of financial contracts.  Fear approaching pani c swept through global \ncredit markets.   \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL Thursday, December 3, 2009 at 12:45 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY \n \n 6A manifestation of this panic was an unpreced ented increase in the interest rate at \nwhich large global banks were willing to lend to  each other for even ve ry short periods of \ntime, relative to the short term rates influen ced by the Federal Reserve.  You can see the \ndramatic widening of the spread between the two in Figure 5 . \nIn this context – let me bri ng in a second headlines slide ( Figure 6 ) – a sudden \nand disorderly bankruptcy of a company with the global scope, deep reach, and \nvoluminous activity of AIG would have seve rely exacerbated the crisis.  Banks and \nfinancial firms that thought their AIG insu rance protected them against losses on the \nmortgage-based securities they held would teet er on insolvency if, to their surprise, their \nAIG insurance evaporated and they saw large additional losses.  Their  counterparties – \nfirms that had lent them money and expected repayment – in turn quickly became fearful \nthat their debtors might have exposure to an AIG failure, which could threaten their \nability to repay and lead to  runs on these institutions. \nIn short, the failure of AIG would have caused very large losses at, and indeed \npossibly failures of, many financial firms.  While it is impossible to know exactly what \nwould have happened – what we like to call the counterfactual – I believe AIG’s failure \ncould well have caused cascading failures of many financial institutions, reminiscent of the Great Depression.  This would have furt her frozen credit creation, and the end result \nwould likely have been an even higher – I believe much higher – national unemployment \nrate than the very high rate we see now.  Let me bring up my third and final headlines \nslide ( Figure 7 ) which shows us some of what happe ned anyway, in late September and  \nearly October of 2008. \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL Thursday, December 3, 2009 at 12:45 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY \n \n 7Faced with a rapid and disorderly failur e, the best outcome – hypothetically – \nwould probably have been for the government to take over AIG. The shareholders would \nhave been wiped out, management removed, and the company placed in receivership.  \nWhile that sounds rather grave, such a re latively orderly governm ent take-over would \nhave avoided many of th e consequences of the disorderly failure that I just outlined. \nUnfortunately, though, there was no applicab le resolution authority in place to \naccomplish this for AIG or for other systemically important, non-bank  financial actors.  \nAnd there still is none today.  With banks, reso lution authority exists and is administered \nby the FDIC.  Not so for non-bank financial organizations. \nThus the experience with AIG revealed two gaps in the regulatory framework.  \nNo one was charged with regulating or s upervising the high-risk behavior; and once \neverything went wrong, no framework existed to  resolve the institution in an orderly \nmanner.     \nIf you will indulge me a metaphor, the lack  of resolution authority is akin to \nhaving a highway that moves well most of the time.  Small accidents occur, and generally \nthe parties pull to the side with only minor di sruptions to traffic – although those directly \ninvolved in the accident may be seriously imp acted.  However, if a large tractor trailer \noverturns, you need equipment that can handle an accident involving a vehicle of that size.  Emergency equipment that could handle small vehicles might be totally lacking in \nthis case.  In the absence of such equipmen t, the roadway grinds to a halt and everyone \nwho uses that road is affected  – not just those directly i nvolved in the accident.  Even \nthose with no interest in using the highway may find themselves in traffic jams that spill \nover onto surface roads.   \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL Thursday, December 3, 2009 at 12:45 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY \n \n 8We have been operating in a world where small bank failures can be addressed \nwith acceptable side effects, but large bank failures or the failures of large non-bank \nfinancial firms cannot.  It is in everyone’s interest that the tool s exist to clear large \n“vehicles” and keep th e “roadways” moving.  \nAgain, an AIG bankruptcy was likely to completely freeze over already frigid \nfinancial markets, and create runs on AIG’s ma ny counterparties.  So the problem had to \nbe contained.  Since no resolution authority (outside of bankruptcy) existed in U.S. law \nfor a firm like AIG, and because no other fina ncial institution was able and willing to buy \nAIG and internalize its financial problems, the only option for containing the problem \nwas an emergency loan from the Federal Rese rve.  Regrettably, an emergency loan is a \nfar-less-than-optimal solution.  But I believe  it was the only reasona ble solution available \nat the time.  We abhorred the steps taken, but  thought them to be the lesser of several \nevils, given the situation. \nAllow me to sum up the two gaps I menti oned a moment ago – gaps that remain \ntoday.  First, no one was explic itly responsible for systemica lly important institutions.  \nSecond, lacking a framework of resolution au thority, policymakers were faced with the \noption of an unprecedented bankruptcy that ma y have caused a run on financial markets \nand institutions.1   \nAs a result, the Federal Reserve felt co mpelled, by the likely downsides of a \nbankruptcy, to lend to a company over wh ich it had no regulatory or supervisory \noversight, in a very limited time frame, in order to prevent a tr ue financial-system \nmeltdown.   \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL Thursday, December 3, 2009 at 12:45 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY \n \n 9  There are many distasteful parts to this  story, and the frustration many feel is \nabsolutely understandable.  I would simply s uggest that the most important narrative is \nthat the legal framework for resolution in an  orderly, transparent, and more palatable \nmanner did not exist – but should have, and must as we move ahead.  \nIndeed, while these controversial Fed actio ns were taken to prevent widespread \nproblems for the entire economy, with proper reso lution authority in place in the U.S., the \nFederal Reserve would not have needed to be involved with AIG at all.   \n \nThe Straight Story, Book Two \nMy second story is about why the Federal Reserve had to expand its balance sheet \nso dramatically to address the crisis, and th e implications of its swollen balance sheet.  \nAnd how the need for such actions can be avoided in the future.  Let me bring up Figure \n8. \nThis narrative is, metaphorically, about the triage necessary in an “emergency \nroom” atmosphere where, amidst the confusion and stress of the moment we found we had more creativity than many thought – leading to some very helpful “treatments” for \nthe patients.  \nTo see how dramatic the expansion in th e Federal Reserve balance sheet has been, \nconsider Figure 8 .  Prior to the crisis, the Federal Reserve had a balance sheet of $880 \nbillion. Today it has expanded – more than  doubled – to over $2 trillion. You can see \nwhy some eyebrows have been raised.  \nInitially, most of this expansion was a consequence of attempting to “restart” \nfinancial markets in the wake of their freezing up after the failure of Lehman Brothers.  \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL Thursday, December 3, 2009 at 12:45 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY \n \n 10Figure 9  gives one picture of the freeze-up by showing the dramatic decline in \nsecuritization of financial assets  like home equity loans, cr edit card receivables, student \nloans, and car loans.2  While there are alternatives to securitization, such  as bank lending, \nthis represented a narrowing of financing sour ces and was likely to increase costs for the \nborrowers.   \nI’ll mention one example of Fed efforts.  At the Boston Fed we operated the asset-\nbacked commercial paper money market liquidi ty facility or “AMLF” on behalf of the \nFederal Reserve System.  The light green area in Figure 10  represents the AMLF, which \nprovided money market funds – an increasingly important corner of the financial world – \nthe ability to sell asset-backed commercial  paper.  The funds were having significant \ndifficulty selling the paper because potential buyers were concerned about the extent to \nwhich it was backed by troubled mortgages – a risk most were unwilling to bear.  The mutual funds, however, needed  to sell the paper in orde r to meet the substantial \nredemption requests that arose as money ma rket fund depositors sought to move their \ndeposits to insured institutions in the wake of Lehman’s failure.  \nIn the first ten days of operation, the AM LF lent out $150 billion.  Please note that \nI said “ lent out,” not “gave out.”   \nThe facility currently has no loans ou tstanding and should improvements in \nmarket conditions continue, we may close it in February.  It was structured to be \nattractive during times of financial stress, but unattractive under more normal economic \nconditions.   \nThe facility experienced no losses – all the loans were repaid, with interest.  Since \nthe Federal Reserve delivers excess return s to the Treasury, this program not only \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL Thursday, December 3, 2009 at 12:45 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY \n \n 11supported money markets and the asset backed  commercial paper ma rkets, which were \nunder great stress, but also as a side benefit generated inco me after expenses that we \nreturn to taxpayers.  The Fed’s other ma rket-stabilizing “emergency room” activities, \nsuch as the commercial paper facility and th e foreign central bank swap lines, similarly \nhelped stabilize panicked markets and are wi nding down naturally as markets normalize.  \nEven after all we did to provide and main tain sources of short-term funding, the \nFed’s traditional policy tool – the short term  interest rate – encountered the “bound” of \nzero.  To offset our inability to lower interest  rates any further, we made a policy decision \nto undertake programs to buy Treasury a nd mortgage-backed securities (see Figure 11 ).  \nThis was designed to support market function, and ease credit conditions, in the mortgage market.  While the Treasury purchase program was an extension of traditional Fed open-\nmarket operations that we use to set short- term interest rates, the mortgage-backed \nsecurities program was a significant departure from conventional policy.   \nSince announcing the program at the March FOMC meeting, the Fed has \npurchased $300 billion worth of additional Tr easury securities.  The less traditional \nmortgage-backed securities program is schedul ed to purchase $1.25 trillion by the end of \nthe first quarter of 2010.  Maintaining a healt hy mortgage finance ma rket is a critical \neconomic policy goal, because housing is a major component of most economic \nrecoveries – and because the housing sector has been significantly impacted by this \ndownturn.   \nIn fact, residential invest ment turned positive in the third quarter of 2009 after 14 \nstraight quarters of decline.\n3  While there are many factors that account for the improved \nhousing outlook, including the government’s first-time homebuyer tax credit program, \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL Thursday, December 3, 2009 at 12:45 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY \n \n 12Figure 12  highlights that 30-year mortgage ra tes declined on the announcement of the \npurchase program and have remained low si nce the Fed began purchasing mortgages.  \nPrior to the announcement of the program, the 30-year mortgage rate was over 6 percent, \nwhile over the past 6 months the mort gage rate has hovered around 5 percent. \nStill, some are concerned that the ex pansion of our balance sheet will be \ninflationary.  For several interrelated reasons, I do not believe this will  be inflationary in \nthe near term, and I offer them as  critical parts of this story. \nFirst, we can look to the one recent inst ance of a central bank in a developed \neconomy setting its policy rate to zero and dramatically expanding its balance sheet – \nJapan.  Despite the increase in the Bank of Ja pan’s balance sheet, shown in the red line of \nFigure 13 , Japan’s main problem has been defla tion, not inflation (as shown by the blue \nline in that figure).   \nSecond, despite the expansion of our bala nce sheet, U.S. inflation has been \ndeclining.  This is typical of recession periods (see Figure 14 ) for the same reasons that \nJapan experienced deflation – labor markets remain slack as recessions end, and labor \ncosts are subdued.  So total and core infla tion tend to be much lower coming out of a \nrecession than going in.  Currently in the U. S., labor markets are weak, and labor costs \nhave been trending down, not up (see Figure 15 ), as has been the case in previous U.S. \nrecessions and in Japan over a more protracted period.   \nThird, expansion of reserves could be in flationary if banks had healthy capital \nratios and loan demand was strong in an econom ic environment close to full employment.  \nUnfortunately, I do not expect those conditions  to predominate in the near term.   \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL Thursday, December 3, 2009 at 12:45 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY \n \n 13And, in general, I am confident that as conditions merit, the Federal Reserve will \nadjust the stance of monetary policy to an appropriately less accommodative stance. \nWhile the Fed’s aggressive actions and unprecedented policy stance may be a bit \nunsettling, I think this is a story of effective emergency action that will wind down \nnaturally as the emergency conditions subside, and treatments that wi ll set the patients on \nthe road to recovery. \n \nThe Straight Story, Book Three \nThe third story I offer you today invo lves what seems like a tendency of \npolicymakers to focus more on Wall Street than on Main Street. \nThis narrative is, at its heart, about fixing the underlying “plumbing” or the \nsupporting infrastructure of the economy.  The commonly held narrative, quite \nunderstandably, has been Wall Street versus  Main Street.  I might suggest the actual story \nis more about where, like it or not, Wall Street and Main Street intersect  and are \ninterdependent  – and that too few appreciated this re ality before the crisis and even now \nwith the benefit of hindsight. \nThe recent financial  crisis clearly exacerbated problems in what we call the “real \neconomy” – the production of tangible goods a nd services by real workers using real \ncapital equipment and materials.  The Fede ral Reserve has a mandate from Congress to \npursue policies that yield maxi mum employment consistent with price stability.  As \neconomic problems became worse, the Federa l Reserve took many actions that have \nreceived substantial public scrutiny, and critic ism – but, I believe, substantially mitigated \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL Thursday, December 3, 2009 at 12:45 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY \n \n 14problems that would have otherwise adversely affected employment and price stability.  \nThis was consistent with our mandate.   \nAs I suggested earlier, we undertook many of the actions to support individual \nfinancial institutions because we lacked vi able alternatives to prevent a full-scale \nmeltdown of the financial sector, with its damaging impact on everyone.  With no entity \nresponsible for ensuring financial stability a nd no way to resolve systemically important \nnon-bank financial firms (which is importa nt because the non- bank “shadow” banking \nsystem played an expanding role in cr edit delivery to firms and individuals4), the Fed \nstepped in to prevent a series  of financial failures that could and would have led to a \nmuch worse outcome for the economy – and thus for all “residents of Main Street.”   \nI can assure you, the immediate inclination was to let these institutions fail as a \nconsequence of their risk-management br eakdowns.  But when weighed against the \nresulting losses in employment throughout the economy that were likely to mount if they \nhad failed, we “held our noses” and did what we  felt we had to do to prevent the actions \nof Wall Street from inflicting further  collateral damage on Main Street. \nMy hope is that the work being done by Congress will remedy these significant \nregulatory gaps.  My hope is that the Federal Reserve will not be in a position of needing \nto choose the lesser of two or more evils and lend to a deeply troubled yet systemically \nimportant financial institution it does not supe rvise.  Similarly, my hope is that the Fed \nwill not be in a position of needing to try to put in place ad hoc emergency remedies to stem the adverse economic consequences of a di sorderly failure of one or more of these \nsystemically important institutions. \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL Thursday, December 3, 2009 at 12:45 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY \n \n 15Many of our actions operated through financ ial institutions or financial markets, \nbut were designed to help Main Street weather a crisis.  While the crisis was not of Main \nStreet’s making, it took place within the financ ial infrastructure Main Street relies upon \nfor credit, capital, and liquidity – an inhere ntly frustrating scenario for citizens, to be \nsure.   \nHowever, measures like the Fed’s mortga ge-backed securities purchase program \nhave improved mortgage-market conditions, ma king it more affordable to obtain a loan \nfor a home purchase or to refinance an existing mortgage.  Our AMLF program was \nintended to support money market mutual funds  at a time of great stress and, ultimately, \nshore up the market for commercial paper – a market that makes credit cards, student \nloans, and home equity loans more affordable.  Our Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility or TALF program was designed to improve securitization, which makes credit \nmore affordable, by facilitating the renewe d issuance of consumer and small-business \nasset-backed securities – essentially providi ng a financing vehicle for credit instruments \nthat had been disrupted by poor  functioning in securitization markets.  In doing this, the \nfacility helps make credit more available for student loans, consumer credit, commercial real estate, and small business loans; l eading to lower borrowing rates and improved \naccess in the market for consumer and small business credit.   \nAltogether, our programs to support financ ial institutions and financial markets \nwere intended to prevent a financial collapse – not to benefit financial institutions, but to avoid a dramatically higher unemplo yment rate across the economy.   \nThe actions by the Federal Reserve, while out of the ordinary and out of our own \ncomfort zone, were what were necessary duri ng these trying times.  Hopefully, we as a \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL Thursday, December 3, 2009 at 12:45 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY \n \n 16nation will take actions to ensure that many of these measures are not needed in the \nfuture. \n \nConcluding Observations \nI’m not sure if my three stories are told well enough to make it into the \nnewspapers you all publish, but  I thank you for listening. \nI will conclude by noting that we are in a far better place than we were in the \nbeginning of this year.  I believe we are – appr opriately – reading few if any articles that \ndescribe the nation as flirting with a s econd Great Depression.  One reason we are \nhearing less about the risk of  a second Great Depression is because of bold and creative \nactions taken by the Federal Reserve.   \nBut let me acknowledge, without question, that the Federal Re serve, along with \nother regulators and parts of the government, did not accurately foresee and prevent all \nthe problems that occurred over the past two years.  We were  far from perfect, but we are \ndoing our best to learn from mist akes.  We are partly responsib le for the fact that we are \ncoming out of a “great recession,” and no policymaker can be happy about that.   \nBut let me stress – in contrast to some recent pundits – that this was not just a Fed \nfailure, or that of the public sector alone.   Financial organizations and indeed many \neconomic actors of all stripes did not properly explore, and manage, the risks they were \ntaking on. \n But in the absence of the actions ta ken once the problems were apparent, we \nwould have seen outcomes far worse th an those the nati on experienced.   \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL Thursday, December 3, 2009 at 12:45 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY \n \n 17Also, importantly, we are doing a great de al to understand and apply the lessons \nof the crisis.  As Chairman Bernanke and others have pointed out, we are for example \nreorienting the Fed’s supervisory activities, in light of the lessons of  the crisis, in areas \nlike capital adequacy, risk-management practi ces, liquidity management, and the effects \non risk-taking of compensati on structures.  And we are augmenting traditional firm-\nspecific oversight with a more macroprudential5 approach to anticipating and addressing \nthreats to financial stability – that is, one  that goes beyond a focus on the safety and \nsoundness of individual instituti ons to also focus on risks to the financial system as a \nwhole.6 \nIn particular, I would point  to the fact that avoiding a much more damaging \nwholesale financial collapse hinged in no sm all part on key parties like the Federal \nReserve having the ability to obtain accurate assessments of financ ial firms’ conditions, \nand having the ability to influence the actions  of key financial institutions and financial \nmarkets.   Again, this was cri tical to avoiding an even more damaging financial collapse.   \nOne response to the crisis would be to lim it the central bank’s act ivities solely to \nmonetary policy, curtailing the Fed’s supervis ory and lender-of-last-resort roles.  My \nview – built on careful research, my expe rience as a bank supervisor and Discount \nWindow lender, and my time as a member of th e FOMC – is that supervisory and lender-\nof-last-resort responsibil ities currently in place at the Fe d were critical to preventing far \nworse outcomes for the economy and the country. \nIt is obviously appropriate, and important , for the public and the Congress to ask \nhow we got into such a mess, why it was so hard to foresee, and how we can avoid such \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL Thursday, December 3, 2009 at 12:45 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY \n \n 18problems in the future. They should insist  on getting the “straight story” – and on \nvigorously exploring what publ ic policies would best pr event future crises.   \nI firmly believe the narratives I have shared today, and I hope they help shape \nunderstanding of this important episode – and what can prevent its recurrence. \nThank you. \n \n                                                 \n \nNOTES: \n \n1 In addition, there is no legal framework for forcin g so-called “haircuts” to existing contracts (that is, \npaying out less than 100 cents on the dollar), so AIG paid them in full.   \n \n2  There was a significant decrease in asset-backed  commercial paper (ABCP) outstanding.  ABCP was \nfrequently sold to money market funds and other intermediaries interested in holding short-term, high-\nquality paper.  ABCP usually was sponsored by commer cial banks that provided liquidity, credit support, \nor both.  With the onset of the crisis it became increasingly difficu lt for such sponsors to place their \ncommercial paper, as potential investors became concer ned about both the credit quality of the assets and \nthe credit quality of some sponsors.  In addition, changes in accoun ting rules for off-ba lance-sheet conduits \nmade this type of financing less economical.  As a result, ABCP issuance has significantly decreased. \n \n3 Residential investment is the housing component of Gross Domestic Product (GDP).  GDP is essentially \nthe value of goods and services put in place during a ti me period.  “The main in dicator of the quantity of \nnew housing supplied to the economy is the residential fixed investment series from the national income \nand product accounts. Residential investment is made up of new construction put in place, expenditures on \nmaintenance and home improvement, equipment purchased for use in residential structures (e.g., washers \nand dryers purchased by landlords and rented out to tenants), and brokerage commissions.”  (Source: “Residential Investment over the Real Estate Cycle” by John Krainer, in the Federal Reserve Bank of San \nFrancisco’s Economic Letter  #2006-15; June 30, 2006). \n \n4 See, for context, “More Lessons from the Crisis,” a talk by New York Federa l Reserve Bank president \nWilliam C. Dudley, available at http://www.newyorkfed.org/newseven ts/speeches/2009/ dud091113.html. \n \n5 The IMF and OECD define macroepr udential analysis as “The assessm ent and monitoring of the strengths \nand vulnerabilities of financial systems. It encompasses quantitative information from both FSIs and \nmacroeconomic indicators that provide (1) a broader picture of economic and financial circumstances such as GDP growth and inflation, along with information on the structure of the financial system, and (2) \nqualitative information on the institutional and regulatory framework—particularly through assessments of \ncompliance with international financial sector standards and codes—and the outcome of stress tests.” (http://stats.oecd.org/glossary/detail.asp?ID=6214) \n \n6 For additional perspective see, fo r example, “Financial Regulation an d Supervision after the Crisis: The \nRole of the Federal Reserve,” a speech by Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke, available at \nhttp://www.federal reserve.gov/newsevents/s peech/bernanke20091023a.htm ; or  my talk on “The Roles and \nResponsibilities of a Systemic Regulator” available at \nhttp://www.bos.frb.org/news/speeches/rosengren/2009/062909.htm \n\nFigure 1\nEvents from September 7 2008 -October 14 2008\n Events  from September  7, 2008  October  14, 2008\nFinancial Turmoil Timeline\nFannie Mae and Freddie Mac \nare placed in Federal \nConservatorship\nLehman files for bankruptcyFed agrees to provide \nCitigroup with liquidity to aid in \nWachovia purchase\n384348\nBank of America purchases \nMerrill Lynch\nFed loans $85 billion to AIG\nReserve Primary Fund    \nbreaks the buckWells Fargo makes \ncounteroffer to purchase \nWachovia\nFed announces CPFF\n23283338\nMore money market funds \ncome under pressure\nFed announces AMLF \nTreasury announces temporary \nguarantee program formoney9 large banks agree to capital \ninjection from Treasury\n8131823\nguarantee  program  for money  \nmarket funds \nWaMu fails\n‐238\n7-Sep 10-Sep 13-Sep 16-Sep 19-Sep 22-Sep 25-Sep 28-Sep 1-Oct 4-Oct 7-Oct 10-Oct 13-Oct\n\n\nFigure 2\nUS Stock Market Indexes\nUS Stock  Market  Indexes\nSeptember 2, 2008 -
