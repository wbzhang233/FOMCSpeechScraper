        "content": "For release on delivery\n8:00 a.m. EST\nNovember 29, 2017\n\nStatement by\nJanet L. Yellen\nChair\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nbefore the\nJoint Economic Committee\nU.S. Congress\nNovember 29, 2017\n\n\fChairman Tiberi, Ranking Member Heinrich, and members of the Committee, I\nappreciate the opportunity to testify before you today. I will discuss the current economic\noutlook and monetary policy.\nThe Economic Outlook\nThe U.S. economy has strengthened further this year. Smoothing through the volatility\ncaused by the recent hurricanes, job gains averaged about 170,000 per month from January\nthrough October, a somewhat slower pace than last year but still above the range that we\nestimate will be consistent with absorbing new entrants to the labor force in coming years. With\nthe job gains this year, 17 million more Americans are employed now than eight years ago.\nMeanwhile, the unemployment rate, which stood at 4.1 percent in October, has fallen\n0.6 percentage point since the turn of the year and is nearly 6 percentage points below its peak in\n2010. In addition, the labor force participation rate has changed little, on net, in recent years,\nwhich is another indication of improving conditions in the labor market, given the downward\npressure on the participation rate associated with an aging population. However, despite these\nlabor market gains, wage growth has remained relatively modest. Unemployment rates for\nAfrican Americans and Hispanics, which tend to be more sensitive to overall economic\nconditions than those for whites, have moved down, on net, over the past year and are now near\nlevels last seen before the recession. That said, it remains the case that unemployment rates for\nthese minority groups are noticeably higher than for the nation overall.\nMeanwhile, economic growth appears to have stepped up from its subdued pace early in\nthe year. After having risen at an annual rate of just 1-1/4 percent in the first quarter, U.S.\ninflation-adjusted gross domestic product (GDP) is currently estimated to have increased at a\n3 percent pace in both the second and third quarters despite the disruptions to economic activity\n\n\f-2in the third quarter caused by the recent hurricanes. Moreover, the economic expansion is\nincreasingly broad based across sectors as well as across much of the global economy. I expect\nthat, with gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary policy, the economy will continue to\nexpand and the job market will strengthen somewhat further, supporting faster growth in wages\nand incomes. Although asset valuations are high by historical standards, overall vulnerabilities\nin the financial sector appear moderate, as the banking system is well capitalized and broad\nmeasures of leverage and credit growth remain contained.\nEven with a step-up in growth of economic activity and a stronger labor market, inflation\nhas continued to run below the 2 percent rate that the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC)\njudges most consistent with our congressional mandate to foster both maximum employment and\nprice stability. Increases in gasoline prices in the aftermath of the hurricanes temporarily pushed\nup measures of overall consumer price inflation, but inflation for items other than food and\nenergy has remained surprisingly subdued. The total price index for personal consumption\nexpenditures increased 1.6 percent over the 12 months ending in September, while the core price\nindex, which excludes energy and food prices, rose just 1.3 percent over the same period, about\n1/2 percentage point slower than a year earlier. In my view, the recent lower readings on\ninflation likely reflect transitory factors. As these transitory factors fade, I anticipate that\ninflation will stabilize around 2 percent over the medium term. However, it is also possible that\nthis year’s low inflation could reflect something more persistent. Indeed, inflation has been\nbelow the Committee’s 2 percent objective for most of the past five years. Against this\nbackdrop, the FOMC has indicated that it intends to carefully monitor actual and expected\nprogress toward our inflation goal.\n\n\f-3Although the economy and the jobs market are generally quite strong, real GDP growth\nhas been disappointingly slow during this expansion relative to earlier decades. One key reason\nfor this slowdown has been the retirement of the older members of the baby-boom generation\nand hence the slower growth of the labor force. Another key reason has been the unusually\nsluggish pace of productivity growth in recent years. To generate a sustained boost in economic\ngrowth without causing inflation that is too high, we will need to address these underlying\ncauses. In this regard, the Congress might consider policies that encourage business investment\nand capital formation, improve the nation’s infrastructure, raise the quality of our educational\nsystem, and support innovation and the adoption of new technologies.\nMonetary Policy\nI will turn now to the implications of recent economic developments and the outlook for\nmonetary policy. With ongoing strengthening in labor market conditions and an outlook for\ninflation to return to 2 percent over the next couple of years, the FOMC has continued to\ngradually reduce policy accommodation. The Committee raised the target range for the federal\nfunds rate by 1/4 percentage point at both our March and June meetings, with the range now\nstanding at 1 to 1-1/4 percent. And, in October, the Committee began its balance sheet\nnormalization program, which will gradually and predictably reduce our securities holdings. The\nCommittee set limits on the pace of balance sheet reduction; those limits should guard against\noutsized moves in interest rates and other potential market strains. Indeed, there has been little,\nif any, market effect associated with the balance sheet runoff to date. We do not foresee a need\nto alter the balance sheet program, but, as we said in June, we would be prepared to resume\nreinvestments if a material deterioration in the economic outlook were to warrant a sizable\nreduction in the federal funds rate.\n\n\f-4Changes to the target range for the federal funds rate will continue to be the Committee’s\nprimary means of adjusting the stance of monetary policy. At our meeting earlier this month, we\ndecided to maintain the existing target range for the federal funds rate. We continue to expect\nthat gradual increases in the federal funds rate will be appropriate to sustain a healthy labor\nmarket and stabilize inflation around the FOMC’s 2 percent objective. That expectation is based\non the view that the current level of the federal funds rate remains somewhat below its neutral\nlevel--that is, the rate that is neither expansionary nor contractionary and keeps the economy\noperating on an even keel. The neutral rate currently appears to be quite low by historical\nstandards, implying that the federal funds rate would not have to rise much further to get to a\nneutral policy stance. If the neutral level rises somewhat over time, as most FOMC participants\nexpect, additional gradual rate hikes would likely be appropriate over the next few years to\nsustain the economic expansion.\nOf course, policy is not on a preset course; the appropriate path for the federal funds rate\nwill depend on the economic outlook as informed by incoming data. The Committee has noted\nthat it will carefully monitor actual and expected inflation developments relative to its symmetric\ninflation goal. More generally, in determining the timing and size of future interest rate\nadjustments, the Committee will take into account a wide range of information, including\nmeasures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations,\nand readings on financial and international developments.\nThank you. I would be pleased to answer your questions.\n\n\f"

Bernanke) the\n2017 Paul H. Douglas Award for Ethics in Government\nfrom\nInstitute of Government and Public Affairs at the University of Illinois\nWashington, D.C.\n\nNovember 7, 2017\n\n\fThank you for the honor of sharing this award with such a worthy person, my\nfriend and former colleague Ben Bernanke, and also for the honor of being associated\nwith the exemplary life and legacy of Paul Douglas.\nSen. Douglas’s contributions to ethics in government are an important aspect of\nthat legacy, but since Ben and I are the first economists to win this award, I would also\nlike to give due credit to Professor Douglas for his contributions to economics.\nWorking with the mathematician Charles Cobb, Douglas gathered data and\ncreated a statistical model that advanced economists’ understanding of the relative\ncontributions to production made by capital and labor. This work demonstrated many of\nthe methods that economists would come to use and continue to use to this day. Douglas\nconstructed empirical measures of key economic concepts. He then employed what were,\nfor the time, advanced statistical techniques to analyze these data, thereby shedding light\non a basic economic relationship. As one recent commentator put it, work such as\nDouglas’s was part of “a growing literature , , , [that] played an important role in shaping\nthe approach to combining statistical methods and economic theory that would become\nthe standard econometric practice in the later decades of the 20th century.” 1\nBut, of course, Paul Douglas was much more than an economist. From an early\nage, he always seemed to be the man in the middle, seen by the two sides of a dispute as\nintelligent, knowledgeable, and impartial enough to be trusted to seek a solution. He\nmediated labor disputes and advised local government officials in Illinois. He also\nhelped governors in Pennsylvania and New York develop what became Social Security,\nunemployment insurance, and the idea of publicly owned power utilities. After losing his\n\n1\n\nSee p. 228 in Jeff Biddle (2012), “Retrospectives: The Introduction of the Cobb-Douglas Regression,”\nJournal of Economic Perspectives, vol. 26 (Spring), pp. 223-36.\n\n\f-2first election for the U.S. Senate in 1942, at the age of 49 he enlisted in the U.S. Marines\nand was awarded a Bronze Star and Purple Heart for his service in the Pacific. Later,\nafter he was elected to the Senate, Douglas was a champion of consumer protection laws,\nincluding the 1968 Truth in Lending Act, and was a leading supporter of civil rights\nlegislation.\nOne of Paul Douglas’s most important achievements in public life was to promote\nethics in government. He was raised with a strong sense of right and wrong and was\nheavily influenced by the philosopher John Stuart Mill to believe that ethical behavior\nwas also an eminently practical approach to life. As a college professor, he entered\npublic life in Chicago in the 1920s somewhat reluctantly to fight the spectacular political\nand commercial corruption that was strangling the city. Once elected to office, he faced\nthe challenge of how to act ethically when corruption was so universal that the city’s\naldermen were expected to funnel large sums to their constituents, based on the\npresumption that all politicians were “on the take.” If he refused bribes and then had no\nmoney to hand out, how would he convince people that he wasn’t simply refusing to\nshare?\nThe key was transparency and communication. Everyone who asked for a large\npayment was handed a mimeographed statement titled “Please Help Me to Be an Honest\nAlderman.” At first, the public, inured to corruption, either disbelieved him or thought\nhim a sucker for refusing to take bribes. But over time, Douglas’s stand changed both the\ndemands made by supplicants and his constituents’ expectations for ethical behavior by a\ngovernment official.\n\n\f-3Similarly, in 1939, Paul Douglas was one of the first public officials in America\nto publish a full accounting of his personal finances. In his memoir, Douglas admits that\nthis and other ethical rules he imposed on himself were often a nuisance and, in some\ncases, probably went further than needed to demonstrate his honesty. But he believed\nthat the public’s trust was so fundamental to the effectiveness of government that such\nsteps were appropriate. As a senator, he continued to publish his finances and observed\nstrict limits on the value of personal gifts he received from those seeking benefits from\nhim as a public official. He strongly believed that these gift limits also made him more\neffective as a public servant, and he campaigned for legislation that ultimately led to the\nwidespread requirement of financial disclosure and limits on accepting gifts.\nI share Paul Douglas’s view that behaving ethically is both the right thing to do\nand, in practical terms, helps maintain the trust the public places in those who act on its\nbehalf. The Federal Reserve’s very effectiveness in setting monetary policy depends on\nthe public’s assured confidence that we act only in its interest. We must act ethically, and\nwe must demonstrate our ethical standards in ways that leave little room for doubt.\nI am grateful to share this award with Ben, and I am even more grateful for the\nexample Paul Douglas set for ethics in government that has guided countless public\nofficials since his day and also shaped the public’s expectation that its leaders will put the\npublic’s interests first.\n\n\f"

        "content": "For release on delivery\n7:30 p.m. EDT\nOctober 20, 2017\n\nA Challenging Decade and a Question for the Future\n\nRemarks by\nJanet L. Yellen\nChair\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat the\n2017 Herbert Stein Memorial Lecture\nNational Economists Club\nWashington, D.C.\n\nOctober 20, 2017\n\n\fI am delighted to address the National Economists Club, and I am also honored on\nthis occasion to be associated with Herb Stein, whose public service and\nscholarship--characterized by careful analysis, clear-eyed pragmatism, and sharp wit-exemplified the best in our profession. Herb was willing to consider new ideas and new\napproaches to government policy, and that openness fits with the subject of my remarks\ntoday. Namely, I will discuss the unconventional monetary policy tools used by the\nFederal Reserve since the start of the financial crisis and Great Recession and the role\nthat those tools may play in addressing future economic challenges.\nNearly 10 years ago, with our nation mired in its worst economic and financial\ncrisis since the Great Depression, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC)\nconfronted a key challenge to the pursuit of its congressionally mandated goals of\nmaximum employment and price stability: how to support a weakening U.S. economy\nonce our main conventional policy tool, the federal funds rate, had been lowered to\nessentially zero. Addressing that problem eventually led to a second challenge: how to\nensure that we could scale back monetary policy accommodation in an orderly fashion\nonce it was no longer needed. Failure to meet either challenge would have significantly\ncompromised our ability to foster maximum employment and price stability, leading to\nserious consequences for the livelihoods of millions of Americans.\nI will argue today that we have met the first challenge and have made good\nprogress to date in meeting the second. Thanks in part to the monetary policy\naccommodation provided in the aftermath of the crisis--especially through enhanced\nforward rate guidance and large-scale asset purchases--the U.S. economy has made great\nstrides. Indeed, with the economy now operating near maximum employment and\n\n\f-2inflation expected to rise to the FOMC’s 2 percent objective over the next couple of\nyears, the FOMC has been scaling back the accommodation provided in response to the\nGreat Recession. In no small part because of our authority to pay interest on excess\nreserves, the process of removing policy accommodation is working well.\nAfter discussing a few issues related to our recent decision to start reducing the\nsize of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet, I will address a key question: What is the\nappropriate future role of the unconventional policy tools that we deployed to address the\nGreat Recession? While I believe that influencing short-term interest rates should\ncontinue to be our primary monetary policy lever in normal times, our unconventional\npolicy tools will likely be needed again should some future economic downturn drive\nshort-term interest rates back to their effective lower bound. Indeed, empirical analysis\nsuggests that the neutral federal funds rate--defined as the level of the federal funds rate\nthat is neither expansionary nor contractionary when the economy is operating near its\npotential--is much lower than in previous decades. Consequently, the probability that\nshort-term interest rates may need to be reduced to their effective lower bound at some\npoint is uncomfortably high, even in the absence of a major financial and economic crisis.\nI will return to the question about the future of our various policy tools, but first I\nwould like to review our experience this decade, which I view as instructive for\naddressing that question.\nMeeting the Challenge of Providing Additional Accommodation\nA substantial body of evidence suggests that the U.S. economy is much stronger\ntoday than it would have been without the unconventional monetary policy tools\ndeployed by the Federal Reserve in response to the Great Recession. Two key tools were\n\n\f-3large-scale asset purchases and forward guidance about our intentions for the future path\nof short-term interest rates. The rationale for those tools was straightforward: Given our\ninability to meaningfully lower short-term interest rates after they reached near-zero in\nlate 2008, the FOMC used increasingly explicit forward rate guidance and asset\npurchases to apply downward pressure on longer-term interest rates, which were still well\nabove zero.\nLonger-term interest rates reflect, in part, financial market participants’\nexpectations of the future path of short-term interest rates. As a result, FOMC\ncommunications that affect those expectations--such as the enhanced forward rate\nguidance provided in our post-meeting statements in the aftermath of the Great\nRecession--can affect longer-term interest rates. 1 In addition, longer-term interest rates\ninclude a term premium, which is the compensation demanded by investors for bearing\nthe interest rate risk associated with longer-term securities. When the Federal Reserve\nbuys longer-term securities in the open market, the remaining stock of securities available\nfor purchase by the public declines, which pushes the prices of those securities up and\nthus depresses their yields by lowering the term premiums embedded in those yields. 2\nSeveral studies have found that our forward rate guidance and asset purchases did\nappreciably reduce longer-term interest rates. 3\n\n1\n\nBefore the Great Recession, the FOMC occasionally provided forward rate guidance, but that guidance\nwas typically confined to a relatively short horizon.\n2\nIn addition to depressing term premiums, large-scale asset purchases by the Federal Reserve can lower\nlonger-term yields if those purchases are perceived by the public as a signal that short-term interest rates\nare likely to remain lower for longer than previously anticipated.\n3\nSee, for instance, Eric T. Swanson and John C. Williams (2014), “Measuring the Effect of the Zero Lower\nBound on Medium- and Longer-Term Interest Rates,” American Economic Review, vol. 104 (October),\npp. 3154-85; Joseph Gagnon, Matthew Raskin, Julie Remache, and Brian Sack (2011), “The Financial\nMarket Effects of the Federal Reserve’s Large-Scale Asset Purchases,” International Journal of Central\nBanking, vol. 7 (March), pp. 3-43, www.ijcb.org/journal/ijcb11q1a1.pdf; and Stefania D’Amico, William\n\n\f-4The FOMC’s goal in lowering longer-term interest rates was to help the U.S.\neconomy recover from the recession and stem the disinflationary forces that emerged\nfrom it. Some have suggested that the slow pace of the economic recovery proves that\nour unconventional policy tools were ineffective. However, one should recognize that\nthe recovery could have been much slower in the absence of our unconventional tools.\nIndeed, the evidence strongly suggests that forward rate guidance and securities\npurchases--by substantially lowering borrowing costs for millions of American families\nand businesses and making overall financial conditions more accommodative--did help\nspur consumption and business spending, lower the unemployment rate, and stave off\ndisinflationary pressures. 4\nOther central banks also deployed unconventional policy tools in the years that\nfollowed the financial crisis. 5 Evidence accumulated from their experience also supports\nthe notion that these tools have helped stimulate economic activity in their countries after\ntheir short-term interest rates were lowered to near-zero--and, in some cases, even below\nzero. 6\n\nEnglish, David Lopez-Salido, and Edward Nelson (2012), “The Federal Reserve’s Large-Scale Asset\nPurchase Programmes: Rationale and Effects,” Economic Journal, vol. 122 (November), pp. F415-46.\n4\nSee, for instance, Eric M. Engen, Thomas Laubach, and David Reifschneider (2015), “The\nMacroeconomic Effects of the Federal Reserve’s Unconventional Monetary Policies,” Finance and\nEconomics Discussion Series 2015-005 (Washington: Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System,\nJanuary), http://dx.doi.org/10.17016/FEDS.2015.005.\n5\nThe Bank of Japan had deployed unconventional tools well before the crisis.\n6\nSee, for instance, Andrew G. Haldane, Matt Roberts-Sklar, Tomasz Wieladek, and Chris Young (2016),\n“QE: The Story So Far,” Staff Working Paper No. 624 (London: Bank of England, October),\nwww.bankofengland.co.uk/research/Documents/workingpapers/2016/swp624.pdf; and Luca Gambetti and\nAlberto Musso (2017), “The Macroeconomic Impact of the ECB’s Expanded Asset Purchase Programme\n(APP),” ECB Working Paper 2075 (Frankfurt: European Central Bank, June),\nwww.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/scpwps/ecb.wp.2075.en.pdf.\n.\n\n\f-5Meeting the Challenge of Scaling Back Accommodation\nBy 2014, the U.S. economy was making notable progress toward the FOMC’s\ngoals of maximum employment and price stability. The unemployment rate had dropped\nto 6 percent by midyear--well below its Great Recession peak of 10 percent--and other\nmeasures of labor market conditions were also showing significant improvement. In\naddition, inflation, as measured by the change in the price index for personal\nconsumption expenditures, had reached about 1-3/4 percent by mid-2014 after hovering\naround 1 percent in the fall of 2013. Reflecting that progress, the Federal Reserve’s\nfocus was shifting from providing additional monetary policy accommodation to scaling\nit back. 7 A key question for the FOMC then was how to reduce the degree of\naccommodation in the context of a vastly expanded Federal Reserve balance sheet.\nOne possible approach was to start by reducing the Federal Reserve’s securities\nholdings while short-term interest rates remained at the lower bound. We could allow\nsecurities to roll off the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet and even sell securities, thereby\nputting upward pressure on long-term rates while calibrating the pace and configuration\nof the reduction in our holdings as warranted by our maximum employment and price\nstability objectives. Eventually, once our securities holdings had shrunk sufficiently, the\nFOMC could start nudging up its short-term interest rate target.\nOne problem of this “last in, first out” approach was that the FOMC does not have\nany experience in calibrating the pace and composition of asset redemptions and sales to\nactual and prospective economic conditions. Indeed, as the so-called taper tantrum of\n\n7\n\nSee Janet L. Yellen (2017), “From Adding Accommodation to Scaling It Back,” speech delivered at the\nExecutives’ Club of Chicago, Chicago, Ill., March 3,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/yellen20170303a.htm.\n\n\f-62013 illustrated, even talk of prospective changes in our securities holdings can elicit\nunexpected abrupt changes in financial conditions.\nGiven the lack of experience with reducing our asset holdings to scale back\nmonetary policy accommodation and the need to carefully calibrate the removal of\naccommodation, the FOMC opted to allow changes in the Federal Reserve’s securities\nholdings to play a secondary role in the Committee’s normalization strategy. Rather than\nbalance sheet shrinkage, the FOMC decided that its primary tool for scaling back\nmonetary policy accommodation would be influencing short-term interest rates.\nAs we explained in our “normalization principles” issued in September 2014, the\nFOMC decided to maintain the overall size of the Federal Reserve’s securities holdings at\nan elevated level until sometime after the FOMC had begun to raise short-term interest\nrates. 8 Once normalization of the level of the federal funds rate was “well under way”\nand the Committee judged that the economic expansion was strong enough that further\nincreases in short-term interest rates were likely to be warranted, the FOMC would\ngradually and predictably reduce the size of the balance sheet by allowing the Federal\nReserve’s securities holdings to “run off”--that is, we would allow our balance sheet to\nshrink passively by not reinvesting all of the principal payments from our securities. 9\n\n8\n\nInformation on the FOMC’s Policy Normalization Principles and Plans is available on the Board’s\nwebsite at https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/policy-normalization.htm.\n9\nThe FOMC announced in December 2015 that it anticipated maintaining its reinvestment policy until\nnormalization of the level of the federal funds rate was “well under way.” That announcement is available\non the Board’s website at https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/monetary20151216a1.pdf.\nMore recently, in June 2017, the FOMC provided additional details regarding its approach to reduce the\nFederal Reserve’s securities holdings, indicating that once the balance sheet normalization plan began,\nprincipal payments received from securities held by the Federal Reserve would be reinvested only to the\nextent that those payments exceeded certain monthly caps. The caps would rise gradually but would\nremain in place during the normalization process. The June 2017 announcement, Addendum to the Policy\nNormalization Principles and Plans, is available on the Board’s website at\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/FOMC_PolicyNormalization.20170613.pdf.\n\n\f-7One advantage of the FOMC’s chosen approach to scaling back accommodation\nis that both the FOMC and the public have decades of experience with adjustments in\nshort-term interest rates in response to changes in economic conditions. Nonetheless, the\npost-crisis environment presented a new test to the FOMC’s ability to influence shortterm interest rates.\nBefore the crisis, the FOMC could raise the federal funds rate--the rate at which\nbanks with excess reserves lend to banks with a reserve need--by removing a small\namount of reserves from the banking system. That would translate into a higher federal\nfunds rate because reserves were relatively scarce to begin with. The intuition was\nsimple: The FOMC would signal that it was going to tighten conditions in the reserve\nmarket, and the cost of obtaining reserves in the market--the federal funds rate--would\nrise. Other market interest rates would then increase accordingly.\nAfter the crisis, however, reserves were plentiful because the Federal Reserve\nfunded its large-scale asset purchases through adding reserves to the system--crediting\nthe bank accounts of those who were selling assets to the Fed. Moreover, in light of the\nFOMC’s decision not to sell the longer-term securities it acquired, reserves were likely to\nremain plentiful for the foreseeable future. Consequently, when the time came to remove\naccommodation, a key question for the Committee was how to raise the federal funds rate\nin an environment of abundant reserves. 10 An important part of the answer to that\nquestion came in the Federal Reserve’s authority to pay interest on excess reserves. The\n\n10\n\nFor a discussion of the pre- and post-crisis frameworks for implementing short-term interest rate\ndecisions, see Jane E. Ihrig, Ellen E. Meade, and Gretchen C. Weinbach (2015), “Rewriting Monetary\nPolicy 101: What’s the Fed’s Preferred Post-Crisis Approach to Raising Interest Rates?” Journal of\nEconomic Perspectives, vol. 29 (Fall), pp. 177-98,\nhttp://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/jep.29.4.177.\n\n\f-8Congress granted the Federal Reserve that authority in 2006, to become effective in 2011.\nHowever, in the fall of 2008, the Congress moved up the effective date to October 2008.\nHaving authority to pay interest on excess reserves means that the Federal\nReserve can influence the federal funds rate and other short-term interest rates regardless\nof the amount of excess reserves in the banking system. The mechanics of the new\nframework are straightforward: Banks will generally only provide short-term funding at\nan interest rate around or above what they could earn at the Fed. As a result, if the\nFederal Reserve raised the rate it paid, other short-term lending rates would likely rise as\nwell. 11 This new approach for raising short-term interest rates is working well: Since\nDecember 2015, we have raised the interest paid on excess reserves and the target range\nfor the federal funds rate by 100 basis points, and the effective federal funds rate has\nrisen accordingly. 12\nA Closer Look at Our Balance Sheet Strategy\nIn light of our recent decision to start reducing our securities holdings this month,\nI would like to discuss a few aspects of our balance sheet strategy. 13 The FOMC\nanticipated that its decision to maintain the size of the Federal Reserve’s securities\n\n11\n\nThe Federal Reserve created supplementary tools to be used as needed to help strengthen its influence\nover short-term interest rates when reserves are plentiful. For instance, the overnight reverse repurchase\nagreement facility allows a variety of counterparties, including eligible money market funds, governmentsponsored enterprises, broker-dealers, and depository institutions to invest funds overnight with the Federal\nReserve at a rate determined by the FOMC.\n12\nFor a discussion of how increases in the FOMC’s target range for the federal funds rate have transmitted\nto other short-term interest rates, see Alyssa Anderson, Jane Ihrig, Mary-Frances Styczynski, and Gretchen\nC. Weinbach (2017), “How Have the Fed’s Three Rate Hikes Passed through to Selected Short-Term\nInterest Rates?” FEDS Notes (Washington: Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, June 2),\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/notes/feds-notes/how-have-the-feds-three-rate-hikes-passedthrough-to-selected-short-term-interest-rates-20170602.htm.\n13\nThe FOMC’s announcement of the beginning of implementation of the balance sheet normalization plan\nis available on the Board’s website; see Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2017),\n“Federal Reserve Issues FOMC Statement,” press release, September 20,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/monetary20170920a1.pdf.\n\n\f-9holdings at an elevated level until sometime after the beginning of rate hikes would keep\nsome downward pressure on longer-term interest rates well after the end of its asset\npurchase programs. Although estimates of the effect of our securities holdings on longerterm interest rates are subject to uncertainty, a recent study reported that the Federal\nReserve’s securities holdings were reducing the term premium on the 10-year Treasury\nyield by roughly 1 percentage point at the end of 2016. 14\nThe guidance that the FOMC would eventually start a gradual and predictable\nreduction of the Federal Reserve’s securities holdings implied that the downward\npressure on longer-term yields would likely diminish over time as financial market\nparticipants came to expect that the start of balance sheet normalization was nearing.\nIndeed, with that process now under way, it is likely that our securities holdings are now\ndepressing the term premium on the 10-year yield by somewhat less than the\n1 percentage point estimate reported for late last year.\nSeveral factors suggest that the downward pressure on term premiums exerted by\nour securities holdings is likely to diminish only gradually as our holdings shrink. For\ninstance, as I have already noted, our intention to reduce our balance sheet by reducing\nreinvestment of repayments of principal on our holdings--rather than selling assets--has\nbeen well communicated for several years now. As a result, we do not anticipate a jump\nin term premiums as our balance sheet reduction plan gets under way. In addition, the\n\n14\n\nSee Brian Bonis, Jane Ihrig, and Min Wei (2017), “Projected Evolution of the SOMA Portfolio and the\n10-Year Treasury Term Premium Effect,” FEDS Notes (Washington: Board of Governors of the Federal\nReserve System, September 22), https://doi.org/10.17016/2380-7172.2081.\n\n\f- 10 maturity distribution of our securities holdings is such that it will take some years for the\nsize of our holdings to normalize via runoff. 15\nThe judgment that the downward pressure on term premiums will decline only\ngradually as we reduce the size of our balance sheet stands in sharp contrast to evidence\nsuggesting that this pressure built up rather quickly when we were expanding our balance\nsheet. To understand this contrast, remember that, unlike our plan to shrink our balance\nsheet, the various phases of our asset purchases had, to differing degrees, an element of\nsurprise, with asset purchase announcements occasionally leaving a distinct imprint on\nthe path of longer-term yields. Moreover, each of our asset purchase programs resulted\nin a rapid increase in our securities holdings during a relatively short period, whereas the\nnormalization process will play out gradually over many years.\nI have focused thus far on the likely response of term premiums to our balance\nsheet reduction plan. Let me turn my attention briefly to the likely response of longerterm yields, which, as I have noted, reflect both a term premium component and\nexpectations of the future path of short-term interest rates. While the available evidence\npoints to a strong reaction of longer-term yields to our asset purchases, it is conceivable\nthat those yields will react much more modestly to our balance sheet reduction plan.\nConsider, for instance, a hypothetical scenario in which the FOMC has decided\nnot to rely on balance sheet reduction to scale back accommodation, choosing instead to\ncontinue to reinvest indefinitely all principal payments from the Federal Reserve’s\n\n15\n\nMoreover, as the FOMC announced in June, the Committee decided to cap the monthly run-off in the\nFederal Reserve’s securities holdings, making the balance sheet normalization process even more\npredictable and gradual. The FOMC’s announcement is available on the Board’s website; see Board of\nGovernors of the Federal Reserve System (2017), “FOMC Issues Addendum to the Policy Normalization\nPrinciples and Plans,” press release, June 14,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20170614c.htm.\n\n\f- 11 securities holdings. If financial market participants perceived no change in the economic\noutlook and no intention on the part of the FOMC to alter the overall stance of monetary\npolicy, the FOMC’s inclination to leave the size of the balance sheet unchanged would be\ntaken as an indication that the FOMC would instead rely more on increases in short-term\ninterest rates to scale back accommodation, resulting in a faster pace of short-term\ninterest hikes. On net, longer-term yields may be little affected by this hypothetical\nscenario: While the decreased emphasis on balance sheet reduction would depress term\npremiums and hold longer-term yields lower, the expected faster pace of short-term\ninterest rate increases would push longer-term yields higher. 16\nA Key Question for the Future\nAs the financial crisis and Great Recession fade into the past and the stance of\nmonetary policy gradually returns to normal, a natural question concerns the possible\nfuture role of the unconventional policy tools we deployed after the onset of the crisis.\nMy colleagues on the FOMC and I believe that, whenever possible, influencing shortterm interest rates by targeting the federal funds rate should be our primary tool. As I\nhave already noted, we have a long track record using this tool to pursue our statutory\ngoals. In contrast, we have much more limited experience with using our securities\nholdings for that purpose.\nWhere does this assessment leave our unconventional policy tools? I believe their\ndeployment should be considered again if our conventional tool reaches its limit--that is,\n\n16\n\nIn contrast, when the Federal Reserve was purchasing assets, short-term interest rates were at their\neffective lower bound, and they were expected to remain there for the foreseeable future. As a result,\ndecisions to buy additional assets--and the resulting additional downward pressure on term premiums--were\nnot offset by expectations of a higher path for short-term interest rates. The end result was that there was\ngreater potential for asset purchases to have a discernible effect on longer-term yields in the years\nimmediately following the financial crisis than in current circumstances.\n\n\f- 12 when the federal funds rate has reached its effective lower bound and the U.S. economy\nstill needs further monetary policy accommodation.\nDoes this mean that it will take another Great Recession for our unconventional\ntools to be used again? Not necessarily. Recent studies suggest that the neutral level of\nthe federal funds rate appears to be much lower than it was in previous decades. 17\nIndeed, most FOMC participants now assess the longer-run value of the neutral federal\nfunds rate as only 2-3/4 percent or so, compared with around 4-1/4 percent just a few\nyears ago. 18 With a low neutral federal funds rate, there will typically be less scope for\nthe FOMC to reduce short-term interest rates in response to an economic downturn,\nraising the possibility that we may need to resort again to enhanced forward rate guidance\nand asset purchases to provide needed accommodation. 19\nOf course, substantial uncertainty surrounds any estimates of the neutral level of\nshort-term interest rates. In this regard, there is an important asymmetry to consider. If\nthe neutral rate turns out to be significantly higher than we currently estimate, it is less\n\n17\n\nSee, for instance, James D. Hamilton, Ethan S. Harris, Jan Hatzius, and Kenneth D. West (2015), “The\nEquilibrium Real Funds Rate: Past, Present, and Future,” NBER Working Paper Series 21476 (Cambridge,\nMass.: National Bureau of Economic Research, August); Olivier Blanchard (2016), “Three Remarks on the\nU.S. Treasury Yield Curve,” Peterson Institute for International Economics, RealTime Economic Issues\nWatch (blog), June 22, https://piie.com/blogs/realtime-economic-issues-watch/three-remarks-us-treasuryyield-curve; and Kathryn Holston, Thomas Laubach, and John C.

In contrast, if the\nneutral rate is as low as we estimate or even lower, we will be glad to have our\nunconventional tools in our toolkit.\nThe bottom line is that we must recognize that our unconventional tools might\nhave to be used again. If we are indeed living in a low-neutral-rate world, a significantly\nless severe economic downturn than the Great Recession might be sufficient to drive\nshort-term interest rates back to their effective lower bound.\nConclusion\nLet me conclude with a brief summary. As a result of the Great Recession, the\nFederal Reserve has confronted two key challenges over the past several years: One, the\nFOMC had to provide additional policy accommodation after short-term interest rates\nreached their effective lower bound; and two, subsequently, as we made progress toward\nthe achievement of our mandate, we had to start scaling back that accommodation in the\npresence of a vastly expanded Federal Reserve balance sheet.\nToday I highlighted two points about the FOMC’s experience with those\nchallenges. First, the monetary policy tools that the Federal Reserve deployed in the\nimmediate aftermath of the crisis--explicit forward rate guidance, large-scale asset\npurchases, and the payment of interest on excess reserves--have helped us overcome\nthese challenges.\nSecond, in light of evidence suggesting that the neutral level of short-term interest\nrates is significantly lower than it was in previous decades, the likelihood that future\nmonetary policymakers will have to confront those two challenges again is\nuncomfortably high. For this reason, we must keep our unconventional policy tools\n\n\f- 14 ready to be deployed again should short-term interest rates return to their effective lower\nbound.\n\n\f"

Yellen\nChair\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\nCommunity Banking in the 21st Century\nFifth Annual Community Banking Research and Policy Conference\ncosponsored by the Federal Reserve System and Conference of State Bank Supervisors\nFederal Reserve Bank of St. Louis\nSt. Louis, Missouri\n\nOctober 4, 2017\n\n\fI am very glad to welcome everyone here to this conference sponsored by the\nFederal Reserve System and the Conference of State Bank Supervisors. Since the first of\nthese gatherings five years ago, this research and policy conference has established itself\nas an important event where industry leaders, academics, and supervisors discuss the\nlatest research and exchange ideas about promoting a healthy and growing community\nbanking industry.\nAll of us share an interest in seeing that community banks continue their vital role\nin their customers’ lives and in a strong and stable U.S. financial system. The Fed has\nbeen working hard to ensure that its regulation and supervision of banks are tailored\nappropriately to the size, complexity, and role different institutions play in the financial\nsystem. For community banks, which by and large avoided the risky business practices\nthat contributed to the financial crisis, we have been focused on making sure that muchneeded improvements to regulation and supervision since the crisis are appropriate and\nnot unduly burdensome.\nOne way we are doing this is through the regulatory review required by the\nEconomic Growth and Regulatory Paperwork Reduction Act, known as EGRPRA. The\nfirst step we took, pursuant to EGRPRA, was to listen to industry and others with a stake\nin how community banks are supervised, which was accomplished through soliciting\nwritten comments and by holding six outreach meetings in 2014 and 2015. Our\nEGRPRA report, issued in March, was focused on community banks, and it noted steps\nthat had already taken place, for example, to simplify Call Report requirements and\nexpand the number of firms eligible for less frequent examinations. Since that report, the\nBoard of Governors, along with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the\n\n\f-2Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, has proposed a rule expanding the number of\ncommercial real estate transactions that will no longer require an appraisal, allowing for a\nless detailed evaluation. And just last week, the Fed, along with other regulators, took a\nsignificant step to reduce the regulatory burden on community banks and other smaller\nand less complex institutions by proposing to simplify several requirements in the\nregulatory capital rule.\nWe have done this because we have an abiding commitment to consider how our\ndecisions affect institutions and the customers they serve. We are well aware that\ncommunity banks serve communities, businesses, and households that are often\nunderserved by larger institutions and offer more extensive and more personalized\nservices than are often otherwise available. We know that community bankers are part of\nthe communities they serve, and they are often better able to understand the needs and the\naspirations of their customers.\nWe hope that the research presented at this conference stimulates discussion about\nthe leading policy issues facing the industry and supervisors. As in the past, I see that\nthis year’s agenda includes presentations related to several important issues, including the\neffect of supervision on risk-tasking and the effects of greater competition on community\nbanks. I am cheered to see that finance students at the University of Akron remain\ninterested enough in community banking to participate in a case-study competition\nrelated to community banking, and I am pleased that the conference will hear a\npresentation of the winning case study.\n\n\f-3In closing, let me thank the conference organizers with the Fed and the\nConference of State Bank Supervisors, the scholars and others making presentations, and\nall of you for attending. I hope you have a terrific conference.\n\n\f"

Yellen\nChair\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\n“Fostering a Dynamic Global Recovery,” a symposium sponsored by\nthe Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City\nJackson Hole, Wyoming\n\nAugust 25, 2017\n\n\fA decade has passed since the beginnings of a global financial crisis that resulted\nin the most severe financial panic and largest contraction in economic activity in the\nUnited States since the Great Depression. Already, for some, memories of this\nexperience may be fading--memories of just how costly the financial crisis was and of\nwhy certain steps were taken in response. Today I will look back at the crisis and discuss\nthe reforms policymakers in the United States and around the world have made to\nimprove financial regulation to limit both the probability and the adverse consequences of\nfuture financial crises.\nA resilient financial system is critical to a dynamic global economy--the subject\nof this conference. A well-functioning financial system facilitates productive investment\nand new business formation and helps new and existing businesses weather the ups and\ndowns of the business cycle. Prudent borrowing enables households to improve their\nstandard of living by purchasing a home, investing in education, or starting a business.\nBecause of the reforms that strengthened our financial system, and with support from\nmonetary and other policies, credit is available on good terms, and lending has advanced\nbroadly in line with economic activity in recent years, contributing to today’s strong\neconomy.1\nAt the same time, reforms have boosted the resilience of the financial system.\nBanks are safer. The risk of runs owing to maturity transformation is reduced. Efforts to\nenhance the resolvability of systemic firms have promoted market discipline and reduced\n\n1\n\nOver the 12 quarters ending in the first quarter of this year, borrowing by the nonfinancial business sector\nincreased at an annual rate just above 6 percent, on average, and borrowing by households and nonprofit\ninstitutions rose at an annual rate of 3-1/4 percent, on average; the corresponding average pace of increase\nin nominal gross domestic product was 3-3/4 percent. Over the same period, lending by private depository\ninstitutions advanced at an annual rate of nearly 6-1/2 percent.\n\n\f-2the problem of too-big-to-fail. And a system is in place to more effectively monitor and\naddress risks that arise outside the regulatory perimeter.\nNonetheless, the scope and complexity of financial regulatory reforms demand\nthat policymakers and researchers remain alert to both areas for improvement and\nunexpected side effects. The Federal Reserve is committed to continuing to evaluate the\neffects of regulation on financial stability and on the broader economy and to making\nappropriate adjustments.\nI will start by reviewing where we were 10 years ago. I will then walk through\nsome key reforms our country has put in place to diminish the chances of another severe\ncrisis and limit damage during times of financial instability. After reviewing these steps,\nI will summarize indicators and research that show the improved resilience of the U.S.\nfinancial system--resilience that is due importantly to regulatory reform as well as actions\ntaken by the private sector. I will then turn to the evidence regarding how financial\nregulatory reform has affected economic growth, credit availability, and market liquidity.\nDevelopments 10 Years Ago\nThe U.S. and global financial system was in a dangerous place 10 years ago. U.S.\nhouse prices had peaked in 2006, and strains in the subprime mortgage market grew acute\nover the first half of 2007.2 By August, liquidity in money markets had deteriorated\nenough to require the Federal Reserve to take steps to support it.3 And yet the discussion\n\n2\n\nA contemporaneous perspective on subprime mortgage market developments at this time is provided in\nBen S. Bernanke (2007), “The Subprime Mortgage Market,” speech delivered at the Federal Reserve Bank\nof Chicago’s 43rd Annual Conference on Bank Structure and Competition, Chicago, May 17,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bernanke20070517a.htm.\n3\nOn August 17, 2007, the Federal Reserve Board reduced the primary credit rate at the discount window\nby 50 basis points and announced a change to the Reserve Banks’ usual practices to allow the provision of\nterm financing for as long as 30 days, renewable by the borrower. The changes were announced to remain\nin place until the Federal Reserve determined that market liquidity had improved materially. See Board of\n\n\f-3here at Jackson Hole in August 2007, with a few notable exceptions, was fairly optimistic\nabout the possible economic fallout from the stresses apparent in the financial system.4\nAs we now know, the deterioration of liquidity and solvency within the financial\nsector continued over the next 13 months. Accumulating strains across the financial\nsystem, including the collapse of Bear Stearns in March 2008, made it clear that\nvulnerabilities had risen across the system. As a result, policymakers took extraordinary\nmeasures: The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) sharply cut the federal funds\nrate, and the Federal Reserve, in coordination with the Treasury Department and other\nagencies, extended liquidity facilities beyond the traditional banking sector, applying to\nthe modern structure of U.S. money markets the dictum of Walter Bagehot, conceived in\nthe 19th century, to lend freely against good collateral at a penalty rate.5 Still, the\ndeterioration in the financial sector continued, with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac failing\nin early September.6\nBut the deterioration from early 2007 until early September 2008--already the\nworst financial disruption in the United States in many decades--was a slow trickle\n\nGovernors of the Federal Reserve System (2007), “Federal Reserve Board Discount Rate Action,” press\nrelease, August 17, https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/monetary/20070817a.htm.\n4\nThe proceedings from the 2007 conference are instructive about the range of views regarding housingrelated developments preceding the acute phase of the financial crisis. See Federal Reserve Bank of\nKansas City (2007), Housing, Housing Finance, and Monetary Policy, proceedings of an economic policy\nsymposium (Kansas City: FRBKC),\nhttps://www.kansascityfed.org/publications/research/escp/symposiums/escp-2007.\n5\nFor a discussion of the correspondence between the steps taken by the Federal Reserve and those\nsuggested by Walter Bagehot in the 19th century, see Brian F.

The failure\nof Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac is marked by the decision of the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA)\nto place Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in government conservatorship on September 7, 2008. Links to\ndocuments outlining the actions taken around this time are available on the FHFA’s website at\nhttps://www.fhfa.gov/Media/PublicAffairs/Pages/Conservatorship-of-Fannie-Mae-and-Freddie-Mac.aspx.\n\n\f-4compared with the tidal wave that nearly wiped out the financial sector that September\nand led to a plunge in economic activity in the following months. Not long after Fannie\nand Freddie were placed in government conservatorship, Lehman Brothers collapsed,\nsetting off a week in which American International Group, Inc. (AIG), came to the brink\nof failure and required large loans from the Federal Reserve to mitigate the systemic\nfallout; a large money market fund “broke the buck” (that is, was unable to maintain a net\nasset value of $1 per share) and runs on other money funds accelerated, requiring the\nTreasury to provide a guarantee of money fund liabilities; global dollar funding markets\nnearly collapsed, necessitating coordinated action by central banks around the world; the\ntwo remaining large investment banks became bank holding companies, thereby ending\nthe era of large independent investment banks in the United States; and the Treasury\nproposed a rescue of the financial sector. Within several weeks, the Congress passed-and President Bush signed into law--the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008,\nwhich established the $700 billion Troubled Asset Relief Program; the Federal Reserve\ninitiated further emergency lending programs; and the Federal Deposit Insurance\nCorporation (FDIC) guaranteed a broad range of bank debt.7 Facing similar challenges in\ntheir own jurisdictions, many foreign governments also undertook aggressive measures to\nsupport the functioning of credit markets, including large-scale capital injections into\nbanks, expansions of deposit insurance programs, and guarantees of some forms of bank\ndebt.\n\n7\n\nIn the fall of 2008, the three largest investment banks were (in alphabetical order) Goldman Sachs, Merrill\nLynch, and Morgan Stanley. Merrill Lynch agreed to be acquired by Bank of America, and the remaining\ntwo firms became bank holding companies.\n\n\f-5Despite the forceful policy responses by the Treasury, the Congress, the FDIC,\nand the Federal Reserve as well as authorities abroad, the crisis continued to intensify:\nThe vulnerabilities in the U.S. and global economies had grown too large, and the\nsubsequent damage was enormous. From the beginning of 2008 to early 2010, nearly\n9 million jobs, on net, were lost in the United States. Millions of Americans lost their\nhomes. And distress was not limited to the U.S. economy: Global trade and economic\nactivity contracted to a degree that had not been seen since the 1930s. The economic\nrecovery that followed, despite extraordinary policy actions, was painfully slow.\nWhat the Crisis Revealed and How Policymakers Have Responded\nThese painful events renewed efforts to guard against financial instability. The\nCongress, the Administration, and regulatory agencies implemented new laws,\nregulations, and supervisory practices to limit the risk of another crisis, in coordination\nwith policymakers around the world.\nThe vulnerabilities within the financial system in the mid-2000s were numerous\nand, in hindsight, familiar from past financial panics. Financial institutions had assumed\ntoo much risk, especially related to the housing market, through mortgage lending\nstandards that were far too lax and contributed to substantial overborrowing. Repeating a\nfamiliar pattern, the “madness of crowds” had contributed to a bubble, in which investors\nand households expected rapid appreciation in house prices. The long period of\neconomic stability beginning in the 1980s had led to complacency about potential risks,\nand the buildup of risk was not widely recognized.8 As a result, market and supervisory\n\n8\n\nThe notion that popular sentiment may contribute to mispricing of assets--for example, the power of the\nmadness of crowds--is attributed to Charles Mackay (1841), Memoirs of Extraordinary Popular Delusions\nand the Madness of Crowds (London: Richard Bentley). A more modern perspective, and one using a\n\n\f-6discipline was lacking, and financial institutions were allowed to take on high levels of\nleverage. This leverage was facilitated by short-term wholesale borrowing, owing in part\nto market-based vehicles, such as money market mutual funds and asset-backed\ncommercial paper programs that allowed the rapid expansion of liquidity transformation\noutside of the regulated depository sector. Finally, a self-reinforcing loop developed, in\nwhich all of the factors I have just cited intensified as investors sought ways to gain\nexposure to the rising prices of assets linked to housing and the financial sector. As a\nresult, securitization and the development of complex derivatives products distributed\nrisk across institutions in ways that were opaque and ultimately destabilizing.\nIn response, policymakers around the world have put in place measures to limit a\nfuture buildup of similar vulnerabilities. The United States, through coordinated\nregulatory action and legislation, moved very rapidly to begin reforming our financial\nsystem, and the speed with which our banking system returned to health provides\nevidence of the effectiveness of that strategy. Moreover, U.S. leadership of global efforts\nthrough bodies such as the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, the Financial\nStability Board (FSB), and the Group of Twenty has contributed to the development of\nstandards that promote financial stability around the world, thereby supporting global\ngrowth while protecting the U.S. financial system from adverse developments abroad.\n\nphrase as memorable as the madness of crowds, is provided by Robert J. Shiller (2016), Irrational\nExuberance, 3rd ed. (Princeton, N.J.: Princeton University Press). The notion that economic stability can\ngenerate a buildup of imbalances that subsequently contributes to instability is presented in Hyman P.\nMinsky (1974), “The Modeling of Financial Instability: An Introduction,” in Modeling and Simulation,\nVol. 5, Part 1, proceedings of the Fifth Annual Pittsburgh Conference (Pittsburgh: Instrument Society of\nAmerica), pp. 267-72, http://digitalcommons.bard.edu/hm_archive/467. A related discussion of how\nfinancial excesses often precede downturns (and even panics) is provided in Charles P. Kindleberger and\nRobert Z. Aliber (2005), Manias, Panics, and Crashes: A History of Financial Crises, 5th ed. (Hoboken,\nN.J.: John Wiley & Sons).\n\n\f-7Preeminent among these domestic and global efforts have been steps to increase the lossabsorbing capacity of banks, regulations to limit both maturity transformation in shortterm funding markets and liquidity mismatches within banks, and new authorities to\nfacilitate the resolution of large financial institutions and to subject systemically\nimportant firms to more stringent prudential regulation.\nSeveral important reforms have increased the loss-absorbing capacity of global\nbanks. First, the quantity and quality of capital required relative to risk-weighted assets\nhave been increased substantially.9 In addition, a simple leverage ratio provides a\nbackstop, reflecting the lesson imparted by past crises that risk weights are imperfect and\na minimum amount of equity capital should fund a firm’s total assets. Moreover, both\nthe risk-weighted and simple leverage requirements are higher for the largest, most\nsystemic firms, which lowers the risk of distress at such firms and encourages them to\nlimit activities that could threaten financial stability.10 Finally, the largest U.S. banks\nparticipate in the annual Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR)--the\n\n9\n\nThese improvements encompass a number of changes. The regulatory requirements for capital have been\nincreased and focus on Tier 1 common equity, which proved more capable of absorbing losses than lowerquality forms of capital. The role of bank internal models in determining risk-weighted assets also has\nbeen significantly constrained in the United States. In addition, exposures previously considered off\nbalance sheet have been incorporated into risk-weighted assets.\n10\nThe Federal Reserve Board, the FDIC, and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency adopted a final\nrule to strengthen the leverage ratio standards for the largest, most interconnected U.S. banking\norganizations on April 8, 2014. Under the final rule, covered bank holding companies must maintain a\nleverage buffer of 2 percentage points above the minimum supplementary leverage ratio requirement of\n3 percent, for a total of 5 percent, to avoid restrictions on capital distributions and discretionary bonus\npayments (see Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation,\nand Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (2014), “Agencies Adopt Enhanced Supplementary\nLeverage Ratio Final Rule and Issue Supplementary Leverage Ratio Notice of Proposed Rulemaking,” joint\npress release, April 8, https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/bcreg20140408a.htm).\nThe Federal Reserve approved a final rule imposing risk-based capital surcharges on the largest, most\nsystemically important U.S. bank holding companies on July 20, 2015; in connection with the final rule, the\nBoard issued a white paper describing the calibration of the risk-based capital surcharges (see Board of\nGovernors of the Federal Reserve System (2015), “Federal Reserve Board Approves Final Rule Requiring\nthe Largest, Most Systemically Important U.S. Bank Holding Companies to Further Strengthen Their\nCapital Positions,” press release, July 20,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/bcreg20150720a.htm).\n\n\f-8stress tests. In addition to contributing to greater loss-absorbing capacity, the CCAR\nimproves public understanding of risks at large banking firms, provides a forwardlooking examination of firms’ potential losses during severely adverse economic\nconditions, and has contributed to significant improvements in risk management.\nReforms have also addressed the risks associated with maturity transformation.\nThe fragility created by deposit-like liabilities outside the traditional banking sector has\nbeen mitigated by regulations promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission\naffecting prime institutional money market funds. These rules require these prime funds\nto use a floating net asset value, among other changes, a shift that has made these funds\nless attractive as cash-management vehicles. The changes at money funds have also\nhelped reduce banks’ reliance on unsecured short-term wholesale funding, since prime\ninstitutional funds were significant investors in those bank liabilities. Liquidity risk at\nlarge banks has been further mitigated by a new liquidity coverage ratio and a capital\nsurcharge for global systemically important banks (G-SIBs). The liquidity coverage ratio\nrequires that banks hold liquid assets to cover potential net cash outflows over a 30-day\nstress period. The capital surcharge for U.S. G-SIBs links the required level of capital for\nthe largest banks to their reliance on short-term wholesale funding.11\nWhile improvements in capital and liquidity regulation will limit the reemergence\nof the risks that grew substantially in the mid-2000s, the failure of Lehman Brothers\ndemonstrated how the absence of an adequate resolution process for dealing with a\n\nMoreover, the Federal Reserve’s Comprehensive Liquidity Analysis and Review, in which supervisors\nanalyze the liquidity risks and practices at large banks, has promoted improvements in liquidity-risk\nmanagement. The U.S. banking agencies also have proposed a net stable funding ratio (NSFR) to help\nensure that large banks have a stable funding profile over a one-year horizon, and we are working toward\nfinalization of the NSFR.\n11\n\n\f-9failing systemic firm left policymakers with only the terrible choices of a bailout or\nallowing a destabilizing collapse. In recognition of this shortcoming, the Congress\nadopted the orderly liquidation authority in Title II of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street\nReform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act) to provide an alternative\nresolution mechanism for systemically important firms to be used instead of bankruptcy\nproceedings when necessary to preserve financial stability. The orderly liquidation\nauthority contains a number of tools, including liquidity resources and temporary stays on\nthe termination of financial contracts, that would help protect the financial system and\neconomy from the severe adverse spillovers that could occur if a systemic firm failed.\nImportantly, any losses incurred by the government in an Orderly Liquidation Authority\nresolution would not be at the expense of taxpayers, since the statute provides that all\nsuch losses must be borne by other large financial firms through subsequent assessments.\nIn addition, the Congress required that the largest banks submit living wills that describe\nhow they could be resolved under bankruptcy.12 And the Federal Reserve has mandated\nthat systemically important banks meet total loss-absorbing capacity requirements, which\nrequire these firms to maintain long-term debt adequate to absorb losses and recapitalize\nthe firm in resolution. These enhancements in resolvability protect financial stability and\nhelp ensure that the shareholders and creditors of failing firms bear losses. Moreover,\nthese steps promote market discipline, as creditors--knowing full well that they will bear\n\n12\n\nIn addition to these steps, the Board issued another proposal to make G-SIBs more resolvable in May of\nlast year (see Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2016), “Federal Reserve Board Proposes\nRule to Support U.S. Financial Stability by Enhancing the Resolvability of Very Large and Complex\nFinancial Firms,” press release, May 3,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/bcreg20160503b.htm). This proposed rule would\nimpose restrictions on G-SIBs’ qualified financial contracts--including derivatives and repurchase\nagreements (or repos)--to guard against the rapid, mass unwinding of those contracts during the resolution\nof a G-SIB. The proposed restrictions are a key step toward G-SIB resolvability because rapidly unwinding\nthese contracts could destabilize the financial system by causing asset fire sales and toppling other firms.\n\n\f- 10 losses in the event of distress--demand prudent risk-taking, thereby limiting the problem\nof too-big-to-fail.\nFinancial stability risks can also grow large outside the regulated banking sector,\nas amply demonstrated by the events of 2007 and 2008. In response, a number of\nregulatory changes affecting what is commonly referred to as the shadow banking sector\nhave been instituted. A specific example of such risks, illustrative of broader\ndevelopments, was the buildup of large counterparty exposures through derivatives\nbetween market participants and AIG that were both inappropriately risk-managed and\nopaque. To mitigate the potential for such risks to arise again, new standards require\ncentral clearing of standardized over-the-counter derivatives, enhanced reporting\nrequirements for all derivatives, and higher capital as well as margin requirements for\nnoncentrally cleared derivatives transactions.13\nAnother important step was the Congress’s creation of the Financial Stability\nOversight Council (FSOC). The council is responsible for identifying risks to financial\nstability and for designating those financial institutions that are systemically important\nand thus subject to prudential regulation by the Federal Reserve. Both of these\nresponsibilities are important to help guard against the risk that vulnerabilities outside the\nexisting regulatory perimeter grow to levels that jeopardize financial stability.14\n\n13\n\nOne area in which regulations have shifted to a lesser degree in the United States is that of time-varying\nmacroprudential tools, in which regulatory requirements are adjusted to address changes in vulnerabilities\nthat may affect the financial system. For example, U.S. regulatory authorities have adopted rules that allow\nuse of the countercyclical capital buffer, but other time-varying tools are limited in the United States. This\nissue is discussed in, for example, Stanley Fischer (2015), “Macroprudential Policy in the U.S. Economy,”\nspeech delivered at “Macroprudential Monetary Policy,” 59th Economic Conference of the Federal Reserve\nBank of Boston, Boston, October 2,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/fischer20151002a.htm.\n14\nFor example, the FSOC contributed, through its identification process, to the development of the\nSecurities and Exchange Commission reforms affecting money market funds. The FSOC has also\n\n\f- 11 The Financial System Is Safer\nThe evidence shows that reforms since the crisis have made the financial system\nsubstantially safer. Loss-absorbing capacity among the largest banks is significantly\nhigher, with Tier 1 common equity capital more than doubling from early 2009 to now.15\nThe annual stress-testing exercises in recent years have led to improvements in the capital\npositions and risk-management processes among participating banks. Large banks have\ncut their reliance on short-term wholesale funding essentially in half and hold\nsignificantly more high-quality, liquid assets. Assets under management at prime\ninstitutional money market funds that proved susceptible to runs in the crisis have\ndecreased substantially. And the ability of regulators to resolve a large institution has\nimproved, reflecting both new authorities and tangible steps taken by institutions to\nadjust their organizational and capital structure in a manner that enhances their\nresolvability and significantly reduces the problem of too-big-to-fail.\nThe progress evident in regulatory and supervisory metrics has been accompanied\nby shifts in private-sector assessments that also suggest enhanced financial stability.\nInvestors have recognized the progress achieved toward ending too-big-to-fail, and\nseveral rating agencies have removed the government support rating uplift that they once\naccorded to the largest banks. Credit default swaps for the large banks also suggest that\n\ndesignated four firms as systemically important--AIG, GE Capital, Prudential, and MetLife. GE Capital\nchose to shrink, adjust its business model, and reduce its footprint in short-term wholesale funding\nmarkets--and hence reduce a source of systemic risk. These actions caused the FSOC to subsequently\nremove its designation as systemically important last year--illustrating how the designation process allows\nboth identifying systemic firms and removing such designations when appropriate.\n15\nThe increase in Tier 1 common equity among bank holding companies has been sizable, especially for\nthe largest banks. If the largest banks are defined as either the eight U.S. global systemically important\nbanks or the U.S. bank holding companies that participated in the CCAR in 2017 (and for which data are\navailable for 2009:Q1), Tier 1 common equity has more than doubled in dollar terms and relative to riskweighted assets from the first quarter of 2009 to the most recent observations.\n\n\f- 12 market participants assign a low probability to the distress of a large U.S. banking firm.\nMarket-based assessments of the loss-absorbing capacity of large U.S. banks have moved\nup in recent years, and market-based measures of equity now lie in the range of book\nestimates of equity. To be sure, market-based measures may not reflect true risks--they\ncertainly did not in the mid-2000s--and hence the observed improvements should not be\noveremphasized.16 But supervisory metrics are not perfect, either, and policymakers and\ninvestors should continue to monitor a range of supervisory and market-based indicators\nof financial system resilience.\nEconomic research provides further support for the notion that reforms have made\nthe system safer. Studies have demonstrated that higher levels of bank capital mitigate\nthe risk and adverse effects of financial crises.17 Moreover, researchers have highlighted\nhow liquidity regulation supports financial stability by complementing capital\n\n16\n\nFor example, Natasha Sarin and Lawrence Summers have reviewed market-based measures of bank\nequity and related measures of bank risks and concluded that such measures have not improved since the\nmid-2000s. This assessment may understate the improvement in fundamental risk within the banking\nsector, as it takes the elevated valuations and low assessment of default risk implied by market prices\nduring the earlier period as indicative of fundamentals. Despite these shortcomings, their analysis is a\nuseful reminder of the importance of considering both regulatory metrics and assessments implied by\nmarket prices. See Natasha Sarin and Lawrence H. Summers (2016), “Understanding Bank Risk through\nMarket Measures,” Brookings Papers on Economic Activity, Fall, pp. 57-109,\nhttps://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/sarintextfall16bpea.pdf.\n17\nFor example, see the review of evidence in Simon Firestone, Amy Lorenc, and Ben Ranish (2017), “An\nEmpirical Economic Assessment of the Costs and Benefits of Bank Capital in the US,” Finance and\nEconomics Discussion Series 2017-034 (Washington: Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System,\nApril), https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/feds/files/2017034pap.pdf. Some research is less\nsupportive of the role of bank capital in limiting the risk of financial crises but suggests that higher levels of\nbank capital limit the economic costs of a financial crisis (for example, Òscar Jordà, Björn Richter, Moritz\nSchularick, and Alan M. Taylor (2017), “Bank Capital Redux: Solvency, Liquidity, and Crisis,” NBER\nWorking Paper Series 23287 (Cambridge, Mass.: National Bureau of Economic Research, March)). Some\nof the differences in findings across studies may be due to the degree to which the studies incorporate data\nfrom different countries and over different periods, as researchers disagree over the extent to which\ncomparisons across countries or periods appropriately account for other factors that differ across such\ndimensions.\n\n\f- 13 regulation.18 Economic models of the resilience of the financial sector--so called topdown stress-testing models--reinforce the message from supervisory stress tests that the\nriskiness of large banks has diminished over the past decade.19 Similarly, model-based\nanalyses indicate that the risk of adverse fire sale spillovers across banks or brokerdealers have been substantially mitigated.20\nIs This Safer System Supporting Growth?\nI suspect many in this audience would agree with the narrative of my remarks so\nfar: The events of the crisis demanded action, needed reforms were implemented, and\nthese reforms have made the system safer. Now--a decade from the onset of the crisis\nand nearly seven years since the passage of the Dodd-Frank Act and international\nagreement on the key banking reforms--a new question is being asked: Have reforms\ngone too far, resulting in a financial system that is too burdened to support prudent risktaking and economic growth?\nThe Federal Reserve is committed individually, and in coordination with other\nU.S. government agencies through forums such as the FSOC and internationally through\nbodies such as the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and the FSB, to evaluating\n\n18\n\nFor example, Charles A.E. Goodhart, Anil K. Kashyap, Dimitrios P. Tsomocos, and Alexandros P.\nVardoulakis (2013), “An Integrated Framework for Analyzing Multiple Financial Regulations,”\nInternational Journal of Central Banking, supp. 1, vol. 9 (January), pp. 109-43; and Gazi I. Kara and S.\nMehmet Ozsoy (2016), “Bank Regulation under Fire Sale Externalities,” Finance and Economics\nDiscussion Series 2016-026 (Washington: Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, April),\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/econresdata/feds/2016/files/2016026pap.pdf.\n19\nFor example, researchers at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York have developed a top-down stresstesting model, and simulation results from the model suggest that the resilience of the U.S. banking system\nhas improved since the crisis; see Beverly Hirtle, Anna Kovner, James Vickery, and Meru Bhanot (2014),\n“Assessing Financial Stability: The Capital and Loss Assessment under Stress Scenarios (CLASS)\nModel,” Staff Report 663 (New York: Federal Reserve Bank of New York, February; revised July 2015),\nhttps://www.newyorkfed.org/medialibrary/media/research/staff_reports/sr663.pdf.\n20\nFor example, see Fernando Duarte and Thomas Eisenbach (2013), “Fire-Sale Spillovers and Systemic\nRisk,” Staff Report 645 (New York: Federal Reserve Bank of New York, October; revised February 2015),\nhttps://www.newyorkfed.org/medialibrary/media/research/staff_reports/sr645.pdf.\n\n\f- 14 the effects of financial market regulations and considering appropriate adjustments.\nFurthermore, the Federal Reserve has independently taken steps to evaluate potential\nadjustments to its regulatory and supervisory practices. For example, the Federal Reserve\ninitiated a review of its stress tests following the 2015 cycle, and this review suggested\nchanges to reduce the burden on participating institutions, especially smaller institutions,\nand to better align the supervisory stress tests with regulatory capital requirements.21 In\naddition, a broader set of changes to the new financial regulatory framework may deserve\nconsideration. Such changes include adjustments that may simplify regulations applying\nto small and medium-sized banks and enhance resolution planning.22\nMore broadly, we continue to monitor economic conditions, and to review and\nconduct research, to better understand the effect of regulatory reforms and possible\nimplications for regulation. I will briefly summarize the current state of play in two\nareas: the effect of regulation on credit availability and on changes in market liquidity.\n\nIn response to the Federal Reserve’s review and other information, the Board finalized a rule adjusting its\ncapital plan and stress-testing rules, effective for the 2017 cycle, on January 30, 2017. The final rule\nremoves large and noncomplex firms from the qualitative assessment of the Federal Reserve’s CCAR,\nreducing significant burden on these firms and focusing the qualitative review in CCAR on the largest,\nmost complex financial institutions. More generally, changes to improve regulatory and supervisory\npractices related to stress testing by reducing unnecessary burden while preserving resilience are under\nconsideration. Possible changes have been discussed in Daniel K. Tarullo (2016), “Next Steps in the\nEvolution of Stress Testing,” speech delivered at the Yale University School of Management Leaders\nForum, New Haven, Conn., September 26,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/tarullo20160926a.htm.\n22\nAn overview of a set of principles that may guide such adjustments is discussed by Jerome H. Powell\n(2017), “Relationship between Regulation and Economic Growth,” statement before the Committee on\nBanking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, U.S. Senate, June 22,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/testimony/powell20170622a.htm. In addition, the Federal\nReserve Board has continued to engage in international efforts to assess the effects of reforms and possible\nadjustments; in this context, the FSB has developed a framework for the post-implementation evaluation of\nthe effects of the Group of Twenty financial regulatory reforms; see Financial Stability Board (2017),\nFramework for Post-Implementation Evaluation of the Effects of the G20 Financial Regulatory Reforms\n(Basel, Switzerland: FSB, July), www.fsb.org/wp-content/uploads/P030717-4.pdf.\n21\n\n\f- 15 The effects of capital regulation on credit availability have been investigated\nextensively. Some studies suggest that higher capital weighs on banks’ lending, while\nothers suggest that higher capital supports lending.23 Such conflicting results in academic\nresearch are not altogether surprising. It is difficult to identify the effects of regulatory\ncapital requirements on lending because material changes to capital requirements are rare\nand are often precipitated, as in the recent case, by financial crises that also have large\neffects on lending.\nGiven the uncertainty regarding the effect of capital regulation on lending,\nrulemakings of the Federal Reserve and other agencies were informed by analyses that\nbalanced the possible stability gains from greater loss-absorbing capacity against the\npossible adverse effects on lending and economic growth.24 This ex ante assessment\npointed to sizable net benefits to economic growth from higher capital standards--and\nsubsequent research supports this assessment.25 The steps to improve the capital\n\n23\n\nThe related literature is sizable. An early contribution is Ben S. Bernanke and Cara S. Lown (1991),\n“The Credit Crunch,” Brookings Papers on Economic Activity, no. 2, pp. 205-47. Research finding a\nsizable negative relationship between capital requirements and lending includes Shekhar Aiyar, Charles W.\nCalomiris, and Tomasz Wieladek (2014), “Does Macro-Prudential Regulation Leak? Evidence from a UK\nPolicy Experiment,” Journal of Money, Credit and Banking, vol. 46 (s1; February), pp. 181-214. Research\nfinding little relationship between lending and capital ratios (outside financial crises) includes Mark\nCarlson, Hui Shan, and Missaka Warusawitharana (2013), “Capital Ratios and Bank Lending: A Matched\nBank Approach,” Journal of Financial Intermediation, vol. 22 (October), pp. 663-87. Research suggesting\nthat higher capital levels may increase lending includes Leonardo Gambacorta and Hyun Song Shin (2016),\n“Why Bank Capital Matters for Monetary Policy,” BIS Working Papers 558 (Basel, Switzerland: Bank for\nInternational Settlements, April), www.bis.org/publ/work558.pdf.\n24\nFor example, see Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (2010), An Assessment of the Long-Term\nEconomic Impact of Stronger Capital and Liquidity Requirements (Basel, Switzerland: BCBS, August),\nwww.bis.org/publ/bcbs173.pdf; and Macroeconomic Assessment Group (2010), Interim Report: Assessing\nthe Macroeconomic Impact of the Transition to Stronger Capital and Liquidity Requirements (Basel,\nSwitzerland: MAG, August), www.bis.org/publ/othp10.pdf.\n25\nThe ex ante studies from the Basel Committee and the Macroeconomic Assessment Group referenced in\nnote 24 pointed to sizable net benefits from higher capital requirements. More academic research pointing\nto similar conclusions using macroeconomic models (and typically focused on model-specific measures of\neconomic welfare) includes Michael T. Kiley and Jae W. Sim (2014), “Bank Capital and the\nMacroeconomy: Policy Considerations,” Journal of Economic Dynamics and Control, vol. 43 (June),\npp. 175-98; Laurent Clerc, Alexis Derviz, Caterina Mendicino, Stephane Moyen, Kalin Nikolov, Livio\n\n\f- 16 positions of banks promptly and significantly following the crisis, beginning with the\n2009 Supervisory Capital Assessment Program, have resulted in a return of lending\ngrowth and profitability among U.S. banks more quickly than among their global peers.\nWhile material adverse effects of capital regulation on broad measures of lending\nare not readily apparent, credit may be less available to some borrowers, especially\nhomebuyers with less-than-perfect credit histories and, perhaps, small businesses. In\nretrospect, mortgage borrowing was clearly too easy for some households in the mid2000s, resulting in debt burdens that were unsustainable and ultimately damaging to the\nfinancial system. Currently, many factors are likely affecting mortgage lending,\nincluding changes in market perceptions of the risk associated with mortgage lending;\nchanges in practices at the government-sponsored enterprises and the Federal Housing\nAdministration; changes in technology that may be contributing to entry by nonbank\nlenders; changes in consumer protection regulations; and, perhaps to a limited degree,\nchanges in capital and liquidity regulations within the banking sector. These issues are\ncomplex and interact with a broader set of challenges related to the domestic housing\nfinance system.\n\nStracca, Javier Suarez, and Alexandros P. Vardoulakis (2015), “Capital Regulation in a Macroeconomic\nModel with Three Layers of Default,” International Journal of Central Banking, vol. 11 (June), pages 9-63;\nand Juliane Begenau (2016), “Capital Requirements, Risk Choice, and Liquidity Provision in a Business\nCycle Model,” unpublished paper, Harvard Business School, September. Subsequent analyses, albeit ones\nthat follow similar approaches, also suggest that there are net benefits to higher capital standards. One\nexample is the analysis by Firestone, Lorenc, and Ranish, “An Empirical Economic Assessment,” in\nnote 17. Another is Ingo Fender and Ulf Lewrick (2016), “Adding It All Up: The Macroeconomic Impact\nof Basel III and Outstanding Reform Issues,” BIS Working Papers 591 (Basel, Switzerland: Bank for\nInternational Settlements, November), www.bis.org/publ/work591.pdf. Indeed, this research points to\nbenefits from capital requirements in excess of those adopted, a conclusion also reached in Wayne\nPassmore and Alexander H. von Hafften (2017), “Are Basel’s Capital Surcharges for Global Systemically\nImportant Banks Too Small?” Finance and Economics Discussion Series 2017-021 (Washington: Board of\nGovernors of the Federal Reserve System, February),\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/econresdata/feds/2017/files/2017021pap.pdf.\n\n\f- 17 Credit appears broadly available to small businesses with solid credit histories,\nalthough indicators point to some difficulties facing firms with weak credit scores and\ninsufficient credit histories.26 Small business formation is critical to economic dynamism\nand growth. Smaller firms rely disproportionately on lending from smaller banks, and\nthe Federal Reserve has been taking steps and examining additional steps to reduce\nunnecessary complexity in regulations affecting smaller banks.27\nFinally, many financial market participants have expressed concerns about the\nability to transact in volume at low cost--that is, about market liquidity, particularly in\ncertain fixed-income markets such as that for corporate bonds. Market liquidity for\ncorporate bonds remains robust overall, and the healthy condition of the market is\napparent in low bid-ask spreads and the large volume of corporate bond issuance in\nrecent years. That said, liquidity conditions are clearly evolving. Large dealers appear to\ndevote less of their balance sheets to holding inventories of securities to facilitate trades\nand instead increasingly facilitate trades by directly matching buyers and sellers. In\n\n26\n\nThis conclusion is consistent with, for example, the findings in Federal Reserve Banks (2017), 2016\nSmall Business Credit Survey: Report on Employer Firms (New York: Federal Reserve Bank of New\nYork, April), https://www.newyorkfed.org/medialibrary/media/smallbusiness/2016/SBCS-ReportEmployerFirms-2016.pdf.\n27\nAs I have discussed previously, the Federal Reserve has been considering improvements through a\nnumber of work streams. For example, the Federal Reserve and the other banking agencies have recently\ncompleted the Economic Growth and Regulatory Paperwork Reduction Act (EGRPRA) review. Under\nEGRPRA, the federal banking agencies are required to conduct a joint review of their regulations every\n10 years to identify provisions that are outdated, unnecessary, or unduly burdensome. The Federal Reserve\nviewed this review as a timely opportunity to step back and identify ways to reduce regulatory burden,\nparticularly for smaller or less complex banks that pose less risk to the U.S. financial system. I discussed\npreliminary emerging themes from this review in Janet L. Yellen (2016), “Supervision and Regulation,”\nstatement before the Committee on Financial Services, U.S. House of Representatives, September 28,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/testimony/yellen20160928a.htm. For the final EGRPRA\nreport to the Congress, see Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Office of the Comptroller of\nthe Currency, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and National Credit Union Administration (2017),\nJoint Report to Congress: Economic Growth and Regulatory Paperwork Reduction Act (Washington:\nFederal Financial Institutions Examination Council, March),\nhttps://www.ffiec.gov/pdf/2017_FFIEC_EGRPRA_Joint-Report_to_Congress.pdf.\n\n\f- 18 addition, algorithmic traders and institutional investors are a larger presence in various\nmarkets than previously, and the willingness of these institutions to support liquidity in\nstressful conditions is uncertain. While no single factor appears to be the predominant\ncause of the evolution of market liquidity, some regulations may be affecting market\nliquidity somewhat. There may be benefits to simplifying aspects of the Volcker rule,\nwhich limits proprietary trading by banking firms, and to reviewing the interaction of the\nenhanced supplementary leverage ratio with risk-based capital requirements. At the same\ntime, the new regulatory framework overall has made dealers more resilient to shocks,\nand, in the past, distress at dealers following adverse shocks has been an important factor\ndriving market illiquidity. As a result, any adjustments to the regulatory framework\nshould be modest and preserve the increase in resilience at large dealers and banks\nassociated with the reforms put in place in recent years.\nRemaining Challenges\nSo where do we stand a decade after the onset of the most severe financial crisis\nsince the Great Depression? Substantial progress has been made toward the Federal\nReserve’s economic objectives of maximum employment and price stability, in putting in\nplace a regulatory and supervisory structure that is well designed to lower the risks to\nfinancial stability, and in actually achieving a stronger financial system. Our more\nresilient financial system is better prepared to absorb, rather than amplify, adverse\nshocks, as has been illustrated during periods of market turbulence in recent years.\nEnhanced resilience supports the ability of banks and other financial institutions to lend,\nthereby supporting economic growth through good times and bad.\n\n\f- 19 Nonetheless, there is more work to do. The balance of research suggests that the\ncore reforms we have put in place have substantially boosted resilience without unduly\nlimiting credit availability or economic growth. But many reforms have been\nimplemented only fairly recently, markets continue to adjust, and research remains\nlimited. The Federal Reserve is committed to evaluating where reforms are working and\nwhere improvements are needed to most efficiently maintain a resilient financial system.\nMoreover, I expect that the evolution of the financial system in response to global\neconomic forces, technology, and, yes, regulation will result sooner or later in the all-toofamiliar risks of excessive optimism, leverage, and maturity transformation reemerging in\nnew ways that require policy responses. We relearned this lesson through the pain\ninflicted by the crisis. We can never be sure that new crises will not occur, but if we keep\nthis lesson fresh in our memories--along with the painful cost that was exacted by the\nrecent crisis--and act accordingly, we have reason to hope that the financial system and\neconomy will experience fewer crises and recover from any future crisis more quickly,\nsparing households and businesses some of the pain they endured during the crisis that\nstruck a decade ago.\n\n\f"

        "content": "For release at\n8:30 a.m. EDT\nJuly 12, 2017\n\nStatement by\nJanet L. Yellen\nChair\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nbefore the\nCommittee on Financial Services\n\nU.S. House of Representatives\nJuly 12, 2017\n\n\fChairman Hensarling, Ranking Member Waters, and other members of the Committee, I\nam pleased to present the Federal Reserve’s semiannual Monetary Policy Report to the Congress.\nIn my remarks today I will briefly discuss the current economic situation and outlook before\nturning to monetary policy.\nCurrent Economic Situation and Outlook\nSince my appearance before this committee in February, the labor market has continued\nto strengthen. Job gains have averaged 180,000 per month so far this year, down only slightly\nfrom the average in 2016 and still well above the pace we estimate would be sufficient, on\naverage, to provide jobs for new entrants to the labor force. Indeed, the unemployment rate has\nfallen about 1/4 percentage point since the start of the year, and, at 4.4 percent in June, is\n5-1/2 percentage points below its peak in 2010 and modestly below the median of Federal Open\nMarket Committee (FOMC) participants’ assessments of its longer-run normal level. The labor\nforce participation rate has changed little, on net, this year--another indication of improving\nconditions in the jobs market, given the demographically driven downward trend in this series.\nA broader measure of labor market slack that includes workers marginally attached to the labor\nforce and those working part time who would prefer full-time work has also fallen this year and\nis now nearly as low as it was just before the recession. It is also encouraging that jobless rates\nhave continued to decline for most major demographic groups, including for African Americans\nand Hispanics. However, as before the recession, unemployment rates for these minority groups\nremain higher than for the nation overall.\nMeanwhile, the economy appears to have grown at a moderate pace, on average, so far\nthis year. Although inflation-adjusted gross domestic product is currently estimated to have\nincreased at an annual rate of only 1-1/2 percent in the first quarter, more-recent indicators\n\n\f-2suggest that growth rebounded in the second quarter. In particular, growth in household\nspending, which was weak earlier in the year, has picked up in recent months and continues to be\nsupported by job gains, rising household wealth, and favorable consumer sentiment. In addition,\nbusiness fixed investment has turned up this year after having been soft last year. And a\nstrengthening in economic growth abroad has provided important support for U.S. manufacturing\nproduction and exports. The housing market has continued to recover gradually, aided by the\nongoing improvement in the labor market and mortgage rates that, although up somewhat from a\nyear ago, remain at relatively low levels.\nWith regard to inflation, overall consumer prices, as measured by the price index for\npersonal consumption expenditures, increased 1.4 percent over the 12 months ending in May, up\nfrom about 1 percent a year ago but a little lower than earlier this year. Core inflation, which\nexcludes energy and food prices, has also edged down in recent months and was 1.4 percent in\nMay, a couple of tenths below the year-earlier reading. It appears that the recent lower readings\non inflation are partly the result of a few unusual reductions in certain categories of prices; these\nreductions will hold 12-month inflation down until they drop out of the calculation.\nNevertheless, with inflation continuing to run below the Committee’s 2 percent longer-run\nobjective, the FOMC indicated in its June statement that it intends to carefully monitor actual\nand expected progress toward our symmetric inflation goal.\nLooking ahead, my colleagues on the FOMC and I expect that, with further gradual\nadjustments in the stance of monetary policy, the economy will continue to expand at a moderate\npace over the next couple of years, with the job market strengthening somewhat further and\ninflation rising to 2 percent. This judgment reflects our view that monetary policy remains\naccommodative. Ongoing job gains should continue to support the growth of incomes and,\n\n\f-3therefore, consumer spending; global economic growth should support further gains in U.S.\nexports; and favorable financial conditions, coupled with the prospect of continued gains in\ndomestic and foreign spending and the ongoing recovery in drilling activity, should continue to\nsupport business investment. These developments should increase resource utilization somewhat\nfurther, thereby fostering a stronger pace of wage and price increases.\nOf course, considerable uncertainty always attends the economic outlook. There is, for\nexample, uncertainty about when--and how much--inflation will respond to tightening resource\nutilization. Possible changes in fiscal and other government policies here in the United States\nrepresent another source of uncertainty. In addition, although the prospects for the global\neconomy appear to have improved somewhat this year, a number of our trading partners continue\nto confront economic challenges. At present, I see roughly equal odds that the U.S. economy’s\nperformance will be somewhat stronger or somewhat less strong than we currently project.\nMonetary Policy\nI will now turn to monetary policy. The FOMC seeks to foster maximum employment\nand price stability, as required by law. Over the first half of 2017, the Committee continued to\ngradually reduce the amount of monetary policy accommodation. Specifically, the FOMC raised\nthe target range for the federal funds rate by 1/4 percentage point at both its March and June\nmeetings, bringing the target to a range of 1 to 1-1/4 percent. In doing so, the Committee\nrecognized the considerable progress the economy had made--and is expected to continue to\nmake--toward our mandated objectives.\nThe Committee continues to expect that the evolution of the economy will warrant\ngradual increases in the federal funds rate over time to achieve and maintain maximum\nemployment and stable prices. That expectation is based on our view that the federal funds rate\n\n\f-4remains somewhat below its neutral level--that is, the level of the federal funds rate that is\nneither expansionary nor contractionary and keeps the economy operating on an even keel.\nBecause the neutral rate is currently quite low by historical standards, the federal funds rate\nwould not have to rise all that much further to get to a neutral policy stance. But because we also\nanticipate that the factors that are currently holding down the neutral rate will diminish\nsomewhat over time, additional gradual rate hikes are likely to be appropriate over the next few\nyears to sustain the economic expansion and return inflation to our 2 percent goal. Even so, the\nCommittee continues to anticipate that the longer-run neutral level of the federal funds rate is\nlikely to remain below levels that prevailed in previous decades.\nAs I noted earlier, the economic outlook is always subject to considerable uncertainty,\nand monetary policy is not on a preset course. FOMC participants will adjust their assessments\nof the appropriate path for the federal funds rate in response to changes to their economic\noutlooks and to their judgments of the associated risks as informed by incoming data. In this\nregard, as we noted in the FOMC statement last month, inflation continues to run below our\n2 percent objective and has declined recently; the Committee will be monitoring inflation\ndevelopments closely in the months ahead.\nIn evaluating the stance of monetary policy, the FOMC routinely consults monetary\npolicy rules that connect prescriptions for the policy rate with variables associated with our\nmandated objectives. However, such prescriptions cannot be applied in a mechanical way; their\nuse requires careful judgments about the choice and measurement of the inputs into these rules,\nas well as the implications of the many considerations these rules do not take into account. I\nwould like to note the discussion of simple monetary policy rules and their role in the Federal\nReserve’s policy process that appears in our current Monetary Policy Report.\n\n\f-5Balance Sheet Normalization\nLet me now turn to our balance sheet. Last month the FOMC augmented its Policy\nNormalization Principles and Plans by providing additional details on the process that we will\nfollow in normalizing the size of our balance sheet. The Committee intends to gradually reduce\nthe Federal Reserve’s securities holdings by decreasing its reinvestment of the principal\npayments it receives from the securities held in the System Open Market Account. Specifically,\nsuch payments will be reinvested only to the extent that they exceed gradually rising caps.\nInitially, these caps will be set at relatively low levels to limit the volume of securities that\nprivate investors will have to absorb. The Committee currently expects that, provided the\neconomy evolves broadly as anticipated, it will likely begin to implement the program this year.\nOnce we start to reduce our reinvestments, our securities holdings will gradually decline,\nas will the supply of reserve balances in the banking system. The longer-run normal level of\nreserve balances will depend on a number of as-yet-unknown factors, including the banking\nsystem’s future demand for reserves and the Committee’s future decisions about how to\nimplement monetary policy most efficiently and effectively. The Committee currently\nanticipates reducing the quantity of reserve balances to a level that is appreciably below recent\nlevels but larger than before the financial crisis.\nFinally, the Committee affirmed in June that changing the target range for the federal\nfunds rate is our primary means of adjusting the stance of monetary policy. In other words, we\ndo not intend to use the balance sheet as an active tool for monetary policy in normal times.\nHowever, the Committee would be prepared to resume reinvestments if a material deterioration\nin the economic outlook were to warrant a sizable reduction in the federal funds rate. More\ngenerally, the Committee would be prepared to use its full range of tools, including altering the\n\n\f-6size and composition of its balance sheet, if future economic conditions were to warrant a more\naccommodative monetary policy than can be achieved solely by reducing the federal funds rate.\nThank you. I would be pleased to take your questions.\n\n\f"

        "content": "For release on delivery\n1:30 p.m. EDT\nMay 5, 2017\n\nSo We All Can Succeed: 125 Years of Women’s Participation in the Economy\n\nRemarks by\nJanet L. Yellen\nChair\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\n“125 Years of Women at Brown Conference”\nsponsored by Brown University\nProvidence, Rhode Island\n\nMay 5, 2017\n\n\fThank you, and let me say what an honor it is, as an alumna of this great\nuniversity, to be here today and part of this important occasion.\nAs we celebrate the 125th anniversary of women being admitted to Brown, it\nseems appropriate to reflect on the progress that women have achieved in the intervening\nyears. Since 1891, women have made tremendous strides in their ability to pursue their\ndreams of education and meaningful work and to support themselves and their families.\nIn pursuing these goals, women have helped improve working conditions for all workers\nand have been a major factor in America’s prosperity over the past century and a quarter.\nDespite this progress, evidence suggests that many women remain unable to\nachieve their goals. The gap in earnings between women and men, although smaller than\nit was years ago, is still significant; women continue to be underrepresented in certain\nindustries and occupations; and too many women struggle to combine aspirations for\nwork and family. Further advancement has been hampered by barriers to equal\nopportunity and workplace rules and norms that fail to support a reasonable work-life\nbalance. If these obstacles persist, we will squander the potential of many of our citizens\nand incur a substantial loss to the productive capacity of our economy at a time when the\naging of the population and weak productivity growth are already weighing on economic\ngrowth.\nTo enliven the history I will present today, I will include the experiences of\nwomen graduates of this institution, in most cases in their own words, as related in oral\nhistories preserved by Brown. 1 Among these alumnae, I am proud to say, is a member of\nmy own family who was an early graduate of Pembroke, Elizabeth Stafford Hirschfelder\n\n1\n\nI am grateful for the assistance of Brown University staff in facilitating access to Brown Women Speak,\nthe University’s oral history project, and particularly the help of archivist Mary Murphy.\n\n\f-2of the Class of 1923. Her career and achievements as a mathematician embody both the\nopportunities that opened for Pembroke graduates in the decades after she left here and\nthe limitations many women faced and the compromises she, like so many others, was\nforced to make.\nA Historical Perspective on Women in the Labor Force\nFrom the time that Brown began to accept women and into the 1920s, most\nwomen in the United States did not work outside the home, and those who did were\nprimarily young and unmarried. In that era, just 20 percent of all women were “gainful\nworkers,” as the Census Bureau then categorized labor force participation outside the\nhome, and only 5 percent of those married were categorized as such. 2 Of course, these\nstatistics somewhat understate the contributions of married women to the economy\nbeyond housekeeping and childrearing, since women’s work in the home often included\nwork in family businesses and the home production of goods, such as agricultural\nproducts, for sale. Also, the aggregate statistics obscure the differential experience of\nwomen by race. African American women were about twice as likely to participate in the\nlabor force as were white women at the time, largely because they were more likely to\nremain in the labor force after marriage. 3\n\n2\n\nMy discussion of the history of female labor force participation draws heavily on the pioneering work of\nClaudia Goldin, including her 2006 Ely Lecture “The Quiet Revolution that Transformed Women’s\nEmployment, Education, and Family” to the American Economic Association and her 1990 work\nUnderstanding the Gender Gap: An Economic History of American Women, from which the statistics on\nfemale labor force participation from the late 19th century until the mid-20th century are drawn. A\nthorough discussion of the quality of these data and their usefulness in making comparisons over time is\nincluded in that work.\n3\nThe higher participation rates of African American women have been attributed to different cultural\nnorms that developed during slavery and the legacy of slavery, which left blacks impoverished and with\nlow levels of education, making women’s wages an important source of family income (Boustan and\nCollins, 2013; Goldin, 1977).\n\n\f-3What was true for women in general was also true of the early graduates of what\nwas then called the Women’s College, the large majority of whom got married, raised\nfamilies, and did not pursue careers. The fact that many women left work upon marriage\nreflected cultural norms, the nature of the work available to them, and legal strictures.\nThe occupational choices of those young women who did work were severely\ncircumscribed. Most women lacked significant education--only 54 percent of girls aged\n5 to 19 were enrolled in school in 1890. 4 And women with little education mostly toiled\nas piece workers in factories or as domestic workers, jobs that were dirty and often\nunsafe. Educated women, like those who attended Brown’s Women’s College, were\nscarce. Fewer than 2 percent of all 18- to 24-year-olds were enrolled in an institution of\nhigher education, and just one-third of those were women. 5 Such women did not have to\nperform manual labor, but their choices were likewise constrained. Edna McDonald was\na graduate of the Class of 1919, and in her oral history, she summed up the opportunities\nfor her and her classmates: “Let’s be frank,” she said. “What choices did women have?\nTeaching. You could teach. You could be a lab technician. Or you could go into office\nwork and be a secretary. Those were the only real choices.” Margery Chittenden\nLeonard graduated from Pembroke in 1929 and went on to earn a J.D. as the only woman\nin her class at Boston University--after two others withdrew. And with that law degree,\nher first job was as a secretary, and she continued to struggle to find work as a lawyer. In\nher oral history, Doris Madeline Hopkins, a 1928 graduate, talked about the opportunity\n\n4\n5\n\nU.S. Department of Education (1993).\nU.S. Department of Education (1993), p. 76.\n\n\f-4that she had to work, but also about being told she had to leave her job once she got\nmarried. Indeed, at the time, marriage bars were widespread. 6\nThere were notable exceptions, such as, of course, Mary Emma Woolley, a Brown\ngraduate who went on to serve as the president of Mount Holyoke College, and Ethel\nRobinson, the first black woman to graduate from Brown, who taught English at Howard\nUniversity. Helen Butts, from the Class of 1928, taught natural sciences at Smith and\nlater zoology at Wellesley, the beginning of a long and productive career as a biological\nresearcher. Another exception was Betty Stafford, the aunt of my husband, George. She\ngrew up in Providence, earned bachelor’s and master’s degrees at Brown in mathematics\nand then rather adventurously headed west, teaching at two universities in Texas in the\n1920s before completing her Ph.D. and then teaching at the University of Wisconsin.\nDespite the widespread sentiment against women, particularly married women,\nworking outside the home and with the limited opportunities available to them, women\ndid enter the labor force in greater numbers over this period, with participation rates\nreaching nearly 50 percent for single women by 1930 and nearly 12 percent for married\nwomen. This rise suggests that while the incentive, and in many cases the imperative,\nremained for women to drop out of the labor market at marriage when they could rely on\ntheir husband’s income, mores were changing. Indeed, these years overlapped with the\nso-called first wave of the women’s movement, when women came together to agitate for\nchange on a variety of social issues, including suffrage and temperance, and which\nculminated in the ratification of the 19th amendment in 1920 guaranteeing women the\nright to vote.\n\n6\n\nGoldin (1990), pp. 160-66.\n\n\f-5Between the 1930s and mid-1970s, women’s participation in the economy\ncontinued to rise, with the gains primarily owing to an increase in work among married\nwomen. By 1970, 50 percent of single women and 40 percent of married women were\nparticipating in the labor force. 7 Several factors contributed to this rise. First, with the\nadvent of mass high school education, graduation rates rose substantially. 8 At the same\ntime, new technologies contributed to an increased demand for clerical workers, and\nthese jobs were increasingly taken on by women. Moreover, because these jobs tended to\nbe cleaner and safer, the stigma attached to work for a married woman diminished. And\nwhile there were still marriage bars that forced women out of the labor force, these\nformal barriers were gradually removed over the period following World War II.\nAnother innovation was the introduction in the late 1940s of part-time schedules, which\ncombined with the proliferation of modern appliances to make it more feasible for\nmarried women to work outside the home. 9\nOver the decades from 1930 to 1970, increasing opportunities also arose for\nhighly educated women, such as the graduates of what was by then called Pembroke\nCollege, to work in professions. That said, early in that period, most women still\nexpected to have short careers, and women were still largely viewed as secondary earners\nwhose husbands’ careers came first. Thus, while it was becoming more common for\nwomen such as Betty Stafford to teach at colleges and universities, their career prospects\nwere not the same as those for men. After earning her Ph.D. at Wisconsin, Betty married\na fellow student and over the next decade coauthored five important papers with him and\n\n7\n\nNote that for the 1970s and beyond, the participation rate is calculated as a share of those aged 16 and\nolder, whereas for earlier years it is calculated as a share of those aged 15 and older.\n8\nGoldin and Katz (2008).\n9\nGoldin (2006), pp. 5-6.\n\n\f-6a well-regarded reference work. But, while her husband progressed from instructor to\nprofessor at Wisconsin, Betty worked as an instructor on an ad hoc basis. During World\nWar II, while he worked for the government in Washington and New York, Betty stayed\nin Madison, teaching math to servicemen. When he took a job teaching in California\nafter the war, they divorced, and it was only then that she was a given a position as\nassistant professor.\nAs time progressed, attitudes about women working and their employment\nprospects did change. As women gained experience in the labor force, they increasingly\nsaw that they could balance work and family. A new model of the two-income family\nemerged. 10 Some women began to attend college and graduate school with the\nexpectation of working, whether or not they planned to marry and have families, as did\nRita Schorr-Germain, an immigrant who survived Auschwitz, graduated from Pembroke\nin 1953, and went on to teach European history while her husband also had a successful\nacademic career. In her oral history, Rita says she was encouraged by many Brown\nprofessors and never considered the possibility that her gender would stand in the way of\nan academic career, a shift in outlook that was becoming increasingly common in the\n1950s. As did most women’s colleges at the time, Pembroke continued to produce\nnurses, schoolteachers, and social workers, and many women who worked only until they\nmarried and had children. But, from the late 1950s on, it also increasingly graduated\nwriters, doctors, lawyers, diplomats, physicians, psychotherapists, and archeologists, and,\n\n10\n\nFor instance, although many women who had joined the war effort in the 1940s were fired at the end of\nthe war, as the Korean War effort picked up and the demand for the labor of women rose, women, who had\nlearned that they could combine work and family were ready to reenter the labor force, so that by the early\n1950s female labor force participation resumed its war-time high (Kessler-Harris, 1982, pp. 302-03).\nMoreover, evidence suggests that sons whose mothers increased their labor force participation in the wake\nof World War II had wives who were more likely to work (Fernández, Fogli, and Olivette, 2004).\n\n\f-7in 1959, the first female faculty member of Brown University. Among those women\nfortunate to attend Pembroke in this era of dramatic change was me. I enrolled at Brown\nfully planning to attend graduate school and have a career, as did many of my classmates\nin the Class of 1967.\nBy the 1970s, a dramatic change in women’s work lives was under way. In the\nperiod after World War II, many women had not expected that they would spend as much\nof their adult lives working as turned out to be the case. By contrast, in the 1970s young\nwomen more commonly expected that they would spend a substantial portion of their\nlives in the labor force, and they prepared for it, increasing their educational attainment\nand taking courses and college majors that better equipped them for careers as opposed to\njust jobs.\nIn surveys of young people about their expectations of their futures, young\nwomen during this era increasingly placed an emphasis on career success. 11 Susan\nGraber Slusky of the Class of 1971 said in her oral history that she chose Pembroke for\nBrown’s excellence in chemistry and physics, because she was already planning the\ncareer she went on to have as a researcher. Perhaps unsurprisingly, this is also the period\nin which many all-male colleges admitted women or combined their women’s and men’s\nundergraduate schools, as Brown did when it merged Pembroke and Brown College\nin 1971.\nThese changes in attitudes and expectations were supported by other changes\nunder way in society. Workplace protections were enhanced through the passage of the\nPregnancy Discrimination Act in 1978 and the recognition of sexual harassment in the\n\n11\n\nInterestingly, over this time young men put increasing weight on family. Goldin (2006), pp. 9 and 11.\n\n\f-8workplace. Access to birth control increased, which allowed married couples greater\ncontrol over the size of their families and young women the ability to delay marriage and\nto plan children around their educational and work choices. 12 And in 1974, women\ngained, for the first time, the right to apply for credit in their own name without a male\nco-signer. 13\nBy the early 1990s, the labor force participation rate of prime working-age\nwomen--those between the ages of 25 and 54--reached just over 74 percent, compared\nwith roughly 93 percent for prime working-age men. By then, the share of women going\ninto the traditional fields of teaching, nursing, social work, and clerical work declined,\nand more women were becoming doctors, lawyers, managers, and, yes, professors. As\nwomen increased their education and joined industries and occupations formerly\ndominated by men, the gap in earnings between women and men began to close\nsignificantly. 14\nPositive Spillovers from Women’s Increased Participation in the Workforce\nLooking back, the story of the past 125 years is one of slow but steady progress\ntoward women’s full participation in the economy and the fulfillment of their career\ngoals. Unfortunately, the success of women has often been seen as coming at the\nexpense of men. Indeed, regularly in the late 19th and 20th centuries there were calls to\nprotect men from women’s entry into the labor force. The early female graduates of\nBrown faced such attitudes from fellow students and even from faculty. Ruth Pederson, a\n\n12\n\nSee, for example, Bailey (2010) and Goldin and Katz (2002).\nThe Equal Credit Opportunity Act, passed in 1974, prohibited discrimination in the provision of credit on\nthe basis of gender, race, religion, marital status and national origin. It also disallowed credit providers\nfrom asking women about their plans for future children.\n14\nBlau and Kahn (2016).\n13\n\n\f-9member of the Class of 1919, said some professors did not want to teach women and\nprohibited women from taking their classes. Margery Leonard remembered one Boston\nUniversity professor who urged her to drop out of law school. When she refused, this\nprofessor punished her by forcing her to recite the details of rape and seduction cases\nbefore her jeering, stomping classmates. And it wasn’t only men who had this attitude.\nAmong the women who were fighting for better labor standards early in the 20th century,\nmany were heavily influenced by elite cultural standards that viewed a woman’s place as\nin the home and argued that men should be paid a “family wage” that would allow them\nto support their family singlehandedly--a standard that many working-class families\ncould not afford. Moreover, many of the labor protections promoted to protect women\nwere often based on theories about women’s weaker nature, and these protections served\nto circumscribe their work. 15 During the Great Depression, limiting women’s role in the\nworkforce was considered a way to address the high rates of unemployment, although the\nexperience of those years showed the importance of women in supporting their families\nfinancially. 16 Similarly, women who had successfully worked during World War II,\neither as part of the war effort or to support their families while their husbands were\nfighting, often were pushed out of their jobs to make room for returning soldiers. 17\nAfter the war and then single, my relative, Betty Stafford, remained an assistant\nprofessor at the University of Wisconsin despite an enviable body of research. She\nmarried another Wisconsin professor, an eminent chemist, and collaborated with him on\nhis research. But, in 1954, she gave up her assistant professorship, she said, to be able to\n\n15\n\nKessler-Harris (1982), pp. 184-85.\nKessler-Harris (1982), pp. 250-58.\n17\nKessler-Harris (1982), pp. 286-87.\n16\n\n\f- 10 accompany her husband on his frequent international travels. Betty later moved with her\nhusband to California, and after his death, she endowed a graduate fellowship in the\nsciences and a prize in theoretical chemistry. Although Betty’s accomplishments were\nconsiderable, against the backdrop of increasing opportunity for women over her lifetime\nI believe that Betty Stafford Hirschfelder was denied opportunities and greater success\nsimply because she was a woman.\nDespite the fears of some that women entering into the workforce would crowd\nout men, the evidence shows that the rise in women’s participation has contributed to\nwidespread improvements in the safety and productivity of our workplaces, to the health\nof families, and to the macroeconomic success that our country has enjoyed over the past\n125 years.\nIn the first decades of the 20th century, the struggle to improve the working\nconditions of young women drawn into factories was a pillar of the overall movement\ntoward improved labor standards. Women’s demands for safer factories, humane\nworkweeks, and higher pay, which were often pursued through organizing and striking,\ncontributed substantially to the social upheaval and public debate of that period that\neventually led to the passage of stronger labor standards. These efforts also produced\ngenerations of women who went on to be leaders in the broader labor movement and in\nthe broader movements for equality.\nThe rise in female labor force participation was an early focus of and helped\nestablish the fields of statistics and labor economics in their modern incarnations. Carroll\nWright, the first commissioner of what is now known as the Bureau of Labor Statistics\nand who established the high standards for data collection and analysis for which the\n\n\f- 11 bureau is known, devoted his agency’s fourth annual report, for the year 1888, to the\ntopic of Working Women in Large Cities. 18 Moreover, the issues surrounding women’s\nwork, such as the minimum wage, pay equity, and maximum workweeks, were topics of\ngreat interest to early practitioners of labor economics. 19\nIt is often said that we should welcome women’s presence in the workplace\nbecause it allows us to capitalize on the talents of our entire population, and this is\ncertainly true. But it is also good business. A number of studies on how groups perform\nindicate that workforces that vary on dimensions such as gender, race, and ethnicity\nproduce better decisionmaking processes and better outcomes. 20\nEvidence also suggests that women’s work has positive spillovers to their family\nlives and to the success of their children, which in turn benefits all of society. It is a wellestablished finding in the literature on development that maternal education and work are\npositively associated with better health and educational outcomes for children. 21 A\nrecent meta-study also suggests that children in the United States with working mothers\ndo as well if not better in school, both academically and behaviorally, than children with\nmothers that stay home full time. This effect is particularly strong for families that have\nfewer social and economic resources, including single-parent families. 22 As time goes\non, girls with working mothers are more likely to be employed and hold supervisory\npositions, and they earn somewhat more. In addition, sons raised in families with\n\n18\n\nBureau of Labor (1889).\nGoldin (2006), p. 4.\n20\nSee the discussion of this literature on pp. 232-33 of Bayer and Rouse (2016) and the studies cited\ntherein.\n21\nSee, for example, World Bank (2012).\n22\nLucas-Thompson, Goldberg, and Prause (2010).\n19\n\n\f- 12 working mothers assume greater childcare responsibilities as adults than sons whose\nmothers did not work. 23\nThis is not to say that children do not need attention from both parents to develop\ninto academically successful and socially well-adjusted adults--they certainly do. Also,\nas I will discuss, women are making choices that reflect their desire to balance work and\nfamily. These findings bear on the question of how best to support women’s work\nthrough public policies aimed at helping women and men better manage work and family.\nFrom a macroeconomic perspective, women’s incorporation into the economy\ncontributed importantly to the rapid rise in economic output and well-being over the\n20th century. Between 1948 and 1990, the rise in female participation contributed about\n1/2 percentage point per year to the potential growth rate of real gross domestic\nproduct. 24 And this estimate does not take into account the effect of the increases in\nwomen’s education and work experience that also occurred over that period and boosted\ntheir productivity. In addition, since 1979, women have accounted for a majority of the\nrise in real household income. In dollar terms, the gains were greatest for households in\nthe top third of the earnings distribution, but without the increase in women’s earnings,\nfamilies in the bottom and middle thirds of the distribution would have experienced\ndeclines. 25\nRemaining Challenges and Some Possible Solutions\nI have argued thus far that we, as a country, have reaped great benefits from the\nincreasing role that women have played in the economy. But evidence suggests that\n\n23\n\nMcGinn, Ruiz Castro, and Lingo (2015).\nBoard staff calculation using data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n25\nBoushey and Vaghul (2016).\n24\n\n\f- 13 barriers to women’s continued progress remain. The participation rate for prime\nworking-age women peaked in the late 1990s and currently stands at about 75 percent. 26\nOf course, women, particularly those with lower levels of education, have been affected\nby the same economic forces that have been pushing down participation among men,\nincluding technical change and globalization. 27 However, women’s participation\nplateaued at a level well below that of prime working-age men, which stands at over\n88 percent. While some married women choose not to work, the size of this disparity\nshould lead us to examine the extent to which structural problems, such as a lack of equal\nopportunity and challenges to combining work and family, are holding back women’s\nadvancement.\nAs I mentioned earlier, the gap in earnings between men and women has\nnarrowed substantially, but progress has slowed lately, and women working full time still\nearn about 17 percent less than men, on average, each week. 28 Even when we compare\nmen and women in the same or similar occupations who appear nearly identical in\nbackground and experience, a gap of about 10 percent typically remains. 29 As such, we\ncannot rule out that gender-related impediments hold back women, including outright\n\n26\n\nThe labor force participation rate for all women declined from a peak of 60 percent in 1999 and 2000 and\nnow stands a bit below 57 percent. However, as has been documented elsewhere, much of the decline for\nall women can be explained by the aging of the baby boomers into their retirement years and lower\nparticipation among teens and young adults. It is also possible that the labor force participation rate is still\nbeing held down a bit by the waning effects of the Great Recession. Aaronson and others (2014).\n27\nAaronson and others (2014). Also see Council of Economic Advisers (2016) and the studies cited\ntherein.\n28\nBlau and Kahn (2016).\n29\nManning and Swaffield (2008) find that although men and women enter the British labor force earning\nthe same amount, among those who worked continuously and full time for 10 years, women would still\nearn 8 percent less than men, even if they have the same personality traits, were childless, and profess no\ninterest in having children. Also see Blau and Kahn (2016) and Noonan, Corcoran, and Courant (2005).\n\n\f- 14 discrimination, attitudes that reduce women’s success in the workplace, and an absence\nof mentors.\nRecent research has shown that although women now enter professional schools\nin numbers nearly equal to men, they are still substantially less likely to reach the highest\nechelons of their professions. 30 For instance, 47 percent of students at top-50 law schools\nare female, and women obtain 40 percent of M.B.A.’s from top programs. Nonetheless,\nwomen are still poorly represented among corporate CEOs, as partners in top law firms,\nand as executives in finance. 31 Even in my own field of economics, women constitute\nonly about one-third of Ph.D. recipients, a number that has barely budged in two\ndecades. 32 This lack of success in climbing the professional ladder would seem to\nexplain why the wage gap actually remains largest for those at the top of the earnings\ndistribution. 33\nOne of the primary factors contributing to the failure of these highly skilled\nwomen to reach the tops of their professions and earn equal pay is that top jobs in fields\nsuch as law and business require longer workweeks and penalize taking time off. This\nwould have a disproportionately large effect on women, who continue to bear the lion’s\nshare of domestic and child-rearing responsibilities. 34 Within academia, the short\ntimeframe in which assistant professors have to prove themselves good candidates for\n\n30\n\nMoran (2015); Olson (2016).\nOn the status of women in finance and corporations see Bertrand, Goldin, and Katz (2010) and the\nstudies cited therein. For law partnerships, see New York City Bar Association (2016).\n32\nBayer and Rouse (2016), p. 223.\n33\nBlau and Kahn (2016).\n34\nBertrand, Goldin, and Katz (2010); Goldin (2014).\n31\n\n\f- 15 tenure by publishing typically overlaps with the period in which many women\ncontemplate starting a family, forcing difficult trade-offs. 35\nEmployers may require the long hours and short absences for good reasons--for\ninstance, the work may involve relationships with clients or accumulating a significant\namount of knowledge about a deal or case in a condensed period of time. If it is costly\nfor employees to share information and split the work, then there would be a high\npremium, in the form of compensation, for those who can work the long hours. 36\nWorkplaces where the income of employees depends on the effort of co-workers, such as\nlaw partnerships, also have an incentive to require long workweeks. 37\nBut however sensible such arrangements may be from a business perspective, it\ncan be difficult for women to meet the demands in these fields once they have children.\nThe very fact that these types of jobs require such long hours likely discourages some\nwomen--as well as men--from pursuing these career tracks. Advances in technology\nhave facilitated greater work-sharing and flexibility in scheduling, and there are further\nopportunities in this direction. 38 Economic models also suggest that while it can be\ndifficult for any one employer to move to a model with shorter hours, if many firms were\nto change their model, they and their workers could all be better off. 39\nOf course, most women are not employed in fields that require such long hours or\nthat impose such severe penalties for taking time off. But the difficulty of balancing\nwork and family is a widespread problem. In fact, the recent trend in many occupations\n\n35\n\nUnfortunately, in contrast to some of the successful gender neutral policies I discuss below, efforts to\naddress the tenure problem by giving all new parents extra time before the tenure decision has actually had\nthe effect of reducing female tenure rates and raising those of men. Antecol, Bedrard and Stearns, (2016).\n36\nGoldin (2014).\n37\nSee, for example, Akerlof (1976) and Landers, Rebitzer, and Taylor (1996).\n38\nSee the discussion in Goldin (2014), p. 117.\n39\nLanders, Rebitzer, and Taylor (1996), p. 334.\n\n\f- 16 is to demand complete scheduling flexibility, which can result in too few hours of work\nfor those with family demands and can make it difficult to schedule childcare. 40 Reforms\nthat encourage companies to provide some predictability in schedules, cross-train\nworkers to perform different tasks, or require a minimum guaranteed number of hours in\nexchange for flexibility could improve the lives of workers holding such jobs. Another\nproblem is that in most states, childcare is affordable for fewer than half of all families. 41\nAnd just 5 percent of workers with wages in the bottom quarter of the wage distribution\nhave jobs that provide them with paid family leave. 42 This circumstance puts many\nwomen in the position of having to choose between caring for a sick family member and\nkeeping their jobs.\nIn this context, it is useful to compare the workforce experiences of American\nwomen to those in other advanced economies. In 1990, the labor force participation rate\nin the United States of prime working-age women, 74 percent, was higher than in all but\na few industrialized nations. But in the intervening years, while the participation rate of\nU.S. women was roughly stable, elsewhere it increased steadily, and by 2010 the United\nStates fell to 17th place out of 22 advanced economies with respect to female labor force\nparticipation. 43 A number of studies have examined the role of various public policies in\nexplaining patterns in female labor force participation across countries. These studies\nfind that policy differences--in particular, the expansion of paid leave following\nchildbirth, steps to improve the availability and affordability of childcare, and increased\navailability of part-time work--go a long way toward explaining the divergence between\n\n40\n\nCajner and others (2014); Lambert, Haley-Lock, and Henly (2012).\nBivens and others (2016).\n42\nBureau of Labor Statistics (2016).\n43\nBlau and Kahn (2013).\n41\n\n\f- 17 advanced economies. 44 Evidence suggests that if the United States had policies in place\nsuch as those employed in many European countries, female labor force participation\ncould be as high as 82 percent. 45\nHowever, these policies entail tradeoffs. Women in other advanced economies\nare more likely than women in the United States to be employed part time, which could\nreflect a greater ease in arranging flexible schedules and more time with family, but it\nalso comes with costs, including a wage penalty and fewer opportunities for training and\nadvancement. Such findings raise the question of whether the policies enacted overseas\nin recent years have had the unintended consequence of making it more expensive for\nemployers there to hire women into full-time jobs with opportunities for advancement, as\nwomen are more likely to be eligible for and to make use of such benefits. 46\nThis possibility should inform our own thinking about policies to make it easier\nfor women and men to combine their family and career aspirations. For instance,\nimproving access to affordable and good quality childcare would appear to fit the bill, as\nit has been shown to support full-time employment. 47 Recently, there also seems to be\nsome momentum for providing families with paid leave at the time of childbirth. The\nexperience in Europe suggests picking policies that do not narrowly target childbirth, but\ninstead can be used to meet a variety of the health and caregiving responsibilities. 48\n\n44\n\nNote that Blau and Kahn (2013) do not find that improvement in the provision of childcare in other\nadvanced economies relative to the United States explain the divergence in participation since the 1990s;\nhowever, Thévenon (2013) finds that the greater provision of childcare has a positive effect on full-time\nemployment.\n45\nBlau and Kahn (2013), p. 7.\n46\nIn most European countries, men are significantly less likely than women to use paid parental leave,\nalthough in a few countries, including Sweden and Iceland, over 40 percent of users of parental leave are\nmen (OECD, 2016).\n47\nThévenon (2013), p. 26.\n48\nIn testimony before the Joint Economic Committee and the House Subcommittee on the Federal\nWorkforce, Postal Service, and the District of Columbia, a breakdown of claims on New Jersey’s short-\n\n\f- 18 Conclusion\nThe United States faces a number of longer-term economic challenges, including\nthe aging of the population and the low growth rate of productivity. One recent study\nestimates that increasing the female participation rate to that of men would raise our gross\ndomestic product by 5 percent. 49 And, as I have argued, our workplaces and families, as\nwell as women themselves, would benefit from continued progress. However, a number\nof factors, which I have only had a chance to touch upon, appear to be holding women\nback, including the difficulty women currently have in trying to combine their careers\nwith other aspects of their lives, including caregiving. In looking to solutions, we should\nconsider improvements to work environments and policies that benefit not only women,\nbut all workers. Pursuing such a strategy would be in keeping with the story of the rise in\nwomen’s involvement in the workforce, which, as I have described here, has contributed\nnot only to their own well-being but more broadly to the welfare and prosperity of our\ncountry.\nThe title for my remarks today, “So We All Can Succeed,” was inspired by\nMalala Yousafzai, the advocate for girls’ and women’s education, who said, “We cannot\nall succeed when half of us are held back.” 50 Brown University has played its own role\nby admitting women 125 years ago, by educating many thousands of women over the\n\nterm disability program in 2000 showed that pregnancy and childbirth constituted just 15 percent of all\nclaims (Lovell, 2008).\n49\nAguirre and others (2012).\n50\nYousafzai (2013), paragraph 22.\nNote: On May 5, 2017, a typo was corrected to change 83 to 93 in the following sentence on page 8: “By\nthe early 1990s, the labor force participation rate of prime working-age women--those between the ages of\n25 and 54--reached just over 74 percent, compared with roughly 83 percent for prime working-age men.”\n\n\f- 19 decades, and by continuing to be a place that equips men and women with the means to\nmake our nation and the world a better place.\n\n\f- 20 References\nAaronson, Stephanie, Tomaz Cajner, Bruce Fallick, Felix Galbis-Reig, Christopher\nSmith, and William Wascher (2014). “Labor Force Participation: Recent\nDevelopments and Future Prospects,” Brookings Papers on Economic Activity,\nFall, pp. 197-275, https://www.brookings.edu/wpcontent/uploads/2016/07/Fall2014BPEA_Aaronson_et_al.pdf.\nAguirre, DeAnne, Leila Hoteit, Christine Rupp, and Karim Sabbagh (2012).\nEmpowering the Third Billion: Women and the World of Work in 2012.

Yellen\nChair\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\n“Creating a Just Economy,” the 2017 annual conference of the\nNational Community Reinvestment Coalition\nWashington, D.C.\n\nMarch 28, 2017\n\n\fThank you for this opportunity to be part of the National Community\nReinvestment Coalition’s annual conference. It is a pleasure to address a group of\norganizations committed to improving the lives of low- and moderate-income Americans\nand strengthening communities. I am especially pleased to be with you in 2017, which\nmarks the 40th anniversary of the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA).\nAs you know, the CRA requires banks to help meet the credit needs of the\ncommunities they are chartered to serve, including low- and moderate-income\nneighborhoods. Since its enactment, the CRA has helped channel capital into\ncommunities and, in the process, supported innovative and effective approaches to\ncommunity development.\nWe at the Federal Reserve take our CRA responsibilities seriously. We evaluate\nthe CRA performance of the state-chartered banks we supervise and make the ratings and\nwritten evaluations public. 1 We currently are improving our examination procedures and\nexaminer training. We also work with our fellow bank regulators to continually improve\nour implementation of the law. And, as many of you know, we recently revised our\ninteragency guidance to clarify how various community development activities are\nconsidered in assessing CRA performance, among them workforce development, which\nis my topic today. 2\nWorkforce Development Initiatives and Challenges\nWorkforce development is a bit of a catchall phrase encompassing different types\nof initiatives that help prepare people for jobs by providing them with training, placement\n\n1\n\nCRA information is available on the Board’s website at\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/apps/crape/BankRating.aspx.\n2\nSee the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council’s CRA webpage “Interagency Questions and\nAnswers” available at https://www.ffiec.gov/cra/qnadoc.htm.\n\n\f-2assistance, and other support. Organizations dedicated to providing workforce\ndevelopment are interested not just in helping people secure any jobs, but jobs that pay\nwell, provide benefits, offer opportunities for advancement, and are less likely to be\neliminated during economic downturns. Significant job market changes in recent years,\nbrought about by global competition and technological advances--and the new and\nshifting skills that these changes demand--make workforce development more important\nthan ever before.\nAs community development practitioners, you know that good-paying, stable jobs\nare not only important to workers and their families, but also are the foundation of strong\nneighborhoods. As part of our CRA responsibilities, the Federal Reserve, together with\nthe Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Office of the Comptroller of the\nCurrency, has made it clear that banks will receive CRA recognition for lending to,\ninvesting in, and providing services to workforce development initiatives. In fact, two\nFederal Reserve Banks recently published a framework describing how workforce\ndevelopment initiatives can fit within a bank’s broader CRA strategy. 3\nWhile the job market for the United States as a whole has improved markedly\nsince the depths of the financial crisis, the persistently higher unemployment rates in\nlower-income and minority communities show why workforce development is so\nessential. For instance, unemployment rates averaged 13 percent in low- and moderate-\n\n3\n\nSee Elizabeth Sobel Blum and Steven Shepelwich (2017), Engaging Workforce Development: A\nFramework for Meeting CRA Obligations, Federal Reserve Banks of Dallas and Kansas City (Dallas: FRB\nDallas, January), https://www.dallasfed.org/-/media/Documents/cd/pubs/workforce.pdf?la=en.\n\n\f-3income communities from 2011 through 2015, compared with 7.3 percent in higherincome communities. 4\nThe challenges for workers in minority communities are even greater. The\naverage unemployment rate across all census tracts where minorities made up a majority\nof the population averaged 14.3 percent from 2011 through 2015. Also, a much smaller\nshare of the prime working-age population in these areas is employed--67.7 percent\nduring this period, which is nearly 9 percentage points lower than in communities with\nsmaller minority populations. 5 These elevated unemployment rates and depressed\nemployment-to-population ratios underscore the strong need for effective workforce\ndevelopment options for these communities.\nEducation as a Workforce Development Strategy\nProbably the most important workforce development strategy is improving the\nquality of general education. The rapid rise in U.S. education levels in the 20th century,\nfacilitated by the growing availability of high school education in the first part of the\ncentury and the rapid expansion of public universities after World War II, contributed\nenormously to the broad-based economic gains associated with that period. 6 But,\nunfortunately, for a wide variety of reasons that are beyond the scope of this talk,\neducation levels have historically lagged in low- and moderate-income communities,\n\n4\n\nLow- and moderate-income communities are census tracts with a family median income under 80 percent\nof the area median income. Higher-income communities are census tracts with median incomes of 80\npercent of the area median income or greater. Statistics represent the average of census tract\nunemployment rates rather than the unemployment rate across all individuals in these tracts combined.\n5\nPrime-age workers are those who are aged 25 to 54. Statistics are from the American Community Survey\n(ACS) data releases from 2011 through 2015, available on the U.S. Census Bureau’s website at\nhttps://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs.\n6\nSee Claudia Goldin (2001), “The Human-Capital Century and American Leadership: Virtues of the Past,”\nJournal of Economic History, vol. 61 (June), pp. 263-92, https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aopcambridge-core/content/view/S0022050701028017.\n\n\f-4particularly communities of color. Between 2011 and 2015, the average proportion of\nadults in low- and moderate-income communities who had dropped out of high school\nwas 23.5 percent, which is more than double the 10.9 percent rate in higher-income\ncommunities during that period. 7\nWhen students from low- and moderate-income families do complete high\nschool, they are less likely to pursue a college degree. And when they do attend college,\nthose students are less likely to graduate. 8 Among the reasons for the disparity are a lack\nof money to pay for college and the burden of family responsibilities. 9 As a result, the\nproportion of adults in low- and moderate-income communities from 2011 through 2015\nwho had a four-year college degree or graduate degree was about half the share in higherincome communities--17.6 percent versus 34 percent. 10\nThis educational disparity matters because, among many reasons, people with less\neducation experience both higher unemployment and lower average earnings. In\nDecember 2016, for example, the unemployment rate for people aged 25 and older with a\nbachelor’s or higher degree was only 2.6 percent. However, the rate was nearly double,\n\n7\nAdults are defined here as individuals aged 25 and older. Statistics are from the ACS data releases from\n2011 through 2015; see note 5.\n8\nFollowing a cohort of high school sophomores in 2002, 96 percent of students from a high\nsocioeconomic-status family pursued at least some higher education and 60 percent completed a bachelor’s\ndegree. Among students from a low socioeconomic-status family, 72 percent pursued higher education and\n14 percent completed a bachelor’s degree. Socioeconomic status is based on family income and parents’\neducation. See National Center for Education Statistics (2015), “Postsecondary Attainment: Differences\nby Socioeconomic Status,” in The Condition of Education 2015 (Washington: NCES),\nhttps://nces.ed.gov/programs/coe/pdf/coe_tva.pdf.\n9\nMany people who did not enroll for or did not complete a degree also gave as a reason that they wanted to\nwork, which may also reflect budget constraints that made pursuing or completing a higher education\ndifficult. See Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2016), Report on the Economic WellBeing of U.S. Families in 2015 (Washington: Board of Governors, May),\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/2015-report-economic-well-being-us-households-201605.pdf.\n10\nSee note 7.\n\n\f-55.1 percent, for workers in this age group with only a high school diploma and about\ntriple, 7.9 percent, for those without a high school degree. 11\nWhile high school graduates earn somewhat more than people who did not finish\nhigh school, the big payoff comes with a four-year college or advanced degree. 12 The\nadvantages of higher education, evidenced by lower unemployment rates and higher\nearnings, are clear across the spectrum but are greater for non-Hispanic whites than for\nAfrican Americans and Hispanics.\nImproving educational levels in low- and moderate-income communities is a\nlong-term task. At least partially because of a lack of early childhood education and the\nsometimes lower quality of schools, children in these neighborhoods score substantially\nlower on standardized tests and drop out of high school at higher rates. 13 Thus, a starting\npoint is to improve access to quality education in early childhood and improve the quality\nof primary and secondary schooling.\n\n11\nMoreover, “over 95 percent of jobs created during the recovery have gone to workers with at least some\ncollege education, while those with a high school diploma or less are being left behind” (as quoted from the\nintroduction on the webpage for Anthony P. Carnevale, Tamara Jayasundera, and Artem Gulish (2016),\nAmerica’s Divided Recovery: College Haves and Have-Nots (Washington: Georgetown University Center\nfor Education and the Workforce), https://cew.georgetown.edu/cew-reports/americas-divided-recovery).\nAlso see Bureau of Labor Statistics (2017), “The Employment Situation--February 2017,” news release,\nMarch 10, Table A-4: Employment Status of the Civilian Population 25 Years and over by Educational\nAttainment, https://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.t04.htm; and BLS (2017), “Labor Force Statistics\nfrom the Current Population Survey,” March 10, Table A-10: Unemployment Rates by Age, Sex, and\nMarital Status, Seasonally Adjusted, https://www.bls.gov/web/empsit/cpseea10.htm.\n12\nThe median weekly earnings for men with a high school degree but no college was $779, and for women\nit was $603. These amounts compare with median weekly earnings of $1,501 for men and $1,117 for\nwomen with a bachelor’s or higher degree.\n13\nSee Sean F. Reardon (2016), School District Socioeconomic Status, Race, and Academic Achievement,\npaper, Stanford Center for Education Policy Analysis (Stanford: Stanford CEPA),\nhttps://cepa.stanford.edu/content/school-district-socioeconomic-status-race-and-academic-achievement;\nMotoko Rich, Amanda Cox, and Matthew Bloch (2016), “Money, Race and Success: How Your School\nDistrict Compares,” New York Times, April 29,\nhttp://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/04/29/upshot/money-race-and-success-how-your-school-districtcompares.html; and Geoffrey T. Wodtke, David J. Harding, and Felix Elwert (2011), “Neighborhood\nEffects in Temporal Perspective,” American Sociological Review, vol.76 (October), pp. 713-36.\n\n\f-6We must also recognize and address the barriers faced by low- and moderateincome students trying to attain higher levels of education--barriers not typically faced by\ntheir more well-off peers. First, these students often do not have friends or family who\nhave achieved higher educational levels, which matters because students whose parents\ndid not attend college are much less likely to pursue a college degree themselves. 14 Even\nso, these students can benefit from high school counselors or other mentors who can\nassist them in choosing schools that provide the financial and counseling support that will\nhelp them complete their degrees. And they can benefit from help in picking majors and\ndegrees that lead to higher earnings. 15\nSecond, lower-income students often pursue their education while working to\nsupport themselves and family members. Educational programs that help students\nbalance these competing responsibilities go a long way to improving completion rates. In\nrecognition of this fact, the U.S. Department of Education is offering competitive grants\nto postsecondary institutions to support or establish campus-based childcare programs\nprimarily serving the needs of low-income students. 16\nI want to reiterate that addressing the particular barriers standing in the way of\nlower-income students attending college and earning a degree requires a long-term\n\n14\nFor example, 65 percent of young adults (aged 25 to 34) with a parent who received a bachelor’s degree\ncompleted one themselves, compared with 16 percent of young adults whose parents completed no\neducation beyond high school. See Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2016), Report on\nthe Economic Well-Being of U.S Households in 2015 (Washington: Board of Governors, May),\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/2015-report-economic-well-being-us-households-201605.pdf.\n15\nSee Brad Hershbein and Melissa S.

However, not every student wants a two- or four-year degree or will have the\nfinancial wherewithal to pursue and complete a postsecondary degree. To support\nprograms aimed at students not bound for college, in 2015, the Federal Reserve Banks of\nPhiladelphia, Cleveland, and Atlanta identified occupations with above-average wages\nfor workers without a bachelor's degree in the country’s 100 largest metropolitan areas. 17\nThe Reserve Banks made this information available to workforce development providers\nonline and in workshops. Educational programs and training that lead to better paying\nand more steady work are crucial for people without college degrees, particularly lowerincome workers.\nWorkforce Development Programs in Action\nIn the rest of my remarks, I would like to highlight some examples of successful\ninitiatives that illustrate key features of effective workforce development. 18 As you\nknow, within our community affairs offices, the Federal Reserve devotes considerable\neffort to studying and promoting effective workforce development, so I am able to draw\n\n17\n\nTop occupations noted across all MSAs included the following: registered nurses; first-line supervisors\nof office and administrative support workers; sales representatives, wholesale and manufacturing; business\noperations specialists, sales representative services; general and operations managers; computer system\nanalysts; automotive service technicians and mechanics; first-line supervisors of construction trades and\nextraction work; plumbers, pipefitters, and steamfitters; first-line supervisors of mechanics, installers; and\nconstruction laborers. See Keith Wardrip, Kyle Fee, Lisa Nelson, and Stuart Andreason, Identifying\nOpportunity Occupations in the Nation’s Largest Metropolitan Economies, Federal Reserve Banks of\nPhiladelphia, Cleveland, and Ohio (Cleveland: FSB of Cleveland), available at\nhttps://www.clevelandfed.org/newsroom-and-events/publications/special-reports/sr-20150909-identifyingopportunity-occupations.aspx.\n18\nFor a broad summary of recent research and policy issues related to workforce development, see the 2015\npublication Transforming U.S. Workforce Development Policies for the 21st Century (available at\nhttps://www.kansascityfed.org/publications/community/transformworkforce) developed by the Federal\nReserve Banks of Atlanta and Kansas City in partnership with the John J. Heldrich Center for Workforce\nDevelopment at Rutgers University. In addition, all Reserve Banks and the Board of Governors are\ncurrently engaged in a System workforce development initiative that will gather up-to-date perspectives\nfrom employers and organizations engaged in worker training and education. This initiative will include a\nseries of regional Reserve Bank meetings, a publication on effective investments and outcomes, and a\ncapstone conference in October in Austin, Texas.\n\n\f-8on the knowledge and experience of our staff. In discussing the examples, I would like to\nmake five points.\nFirst, it is crucial for younger workers to establish a solid connection to\nemployment early in their work lives. The Federal Reserve’s 2013 Survey of Young\nWorkers found that 18- to 30-year-olds with early work experience were more likely to\nemerge from the recent recession with a permanent job. 19 Other studies have found that\nstudents who worked 20 hours per week in their senior year of high school earned higher\nwages later in life than those who did not, and that summer youth employment programs\nimproved participants’ attitudes toward their communities, raised their academic\naspirations, and boosted their job readiness skills. 20 The findings point to some of the\nreasons that the Boston Fed decided to lend technical support to a pilot program called\nPocket Change, which aims to reduce unemployment among low-income 18- to 24-yearolds in Somerville, Massachusetts, through internships, training in job skills, and\nreinforcement of important soft skills such as punctuality and effective communication.\nIn its first two years, the initiative trained 53 low-income young people and placed 20 of\nthem in jobs. The results of this modest program indicate the promise of efforts that\n\n19\n\nThe survey found that 82 percent of workers who had worked for pay during high school had a\npermanent job--4 percentage points higher than for all workers combined. See Board of Governors of the\nFederal Reserve System (2014), In the Shadow of the Great Recession: Experiences and Perspectives of\nYoung Workers (Washington: Board of Governors, November),\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/econresdata/2013-experiences-and-perspectives-of-young-workers201411.pdf.\n20\nBaum and Ruhm (2016) do observe, however, that these gains from employment during the\nsenior year of high school have diminished substantially relative to earlier cohorts. See Charles L.\nBaum and Christopher J. Ruhm (2016), “The Changing Benefits of Early Work Experience,”\nSouthern Economic Journal, vol. 83 (October), pp. 343-63.\n\n\f-9focus on first-time work experiences, and Somerville is now seeking to expand the\ninitiative. 21\nMy second observation is that career and technical education (CTE) programs,\nwhich have seen a revival in recent years, have considerable potential. For some time,\nvocational education had fallen out of favor or was in decline in the United States, as it\nwas associated with the deleterious practice of “tracking” less advantaged students that\ndenied them the opportunity for the best education. But more recently, CTE has been\nrefined and has made a comeback as an effective way to help non-college-bound workers\ngain valuable skills and obtain a foothold in a labor market that increasingly requires\ntechnical proficiency. These programs teach the skills needed to pursue careers in fields\nsuch as construction, manufacturing, health care, information technology, hospitality, and\nfinancial services.\nThis point brings me to my third observation, which is that effective CTE\nprograms and other workforce development initiatives are able to match education and\ntraining to good-paying jobs when they actively engage employers in the training\nprocess. WorkAdvance, a regional sector-specific program, is a good example. It\ndelivers an array of aligned services to meet local business needs and provide jobs for\nunemployed and low-income adults in multiple cities. 22 An evaluation of the program\nlast year in Tulsa, New York City, and northeast Ohio found it was especially effective\n\n21\nFor more information on Pocket Change, see the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston’s Working Cities\nChallenge webpage at\nhttps://www.bostonfed.org/workingcities/massachusetts/round1/cities/somerville.html.\n22\nAligned services may include intensive screening, occupational skills training, job development and\nplacement services, and retention and advancement services.\n\n\f- 10 because it offered training for in-demand skills and industry-recognized certifications,\nand it focused on jobs that have clear paths for advancement. 23\nA fourth observation is that apprenticeships, which are more common in other\ncountries, could play a larger role for low- and moderate-income individuals in our\ncountry as part of broader career and technical education efforts. For instance, a state-run\nprogram in South Carolina, Apprenticeship Carolina, helps employers develop\napprenticeships at no cost to them. Businesses receive a $1,000 annual tax credit per\napprenticeship, and the program assists them with information and technical needs,\npaperwork, and the integration of classroom learning at local technical colleges. The\nprogram has led to sizable job gains at a modest cost to the state. 24 Similarly,\nWashington State registered apprenticeship programs contributed to substantial long-term\nincreases in employment rates and hourly wages. 25\nMy fifth and final observation is that promoting entrepreneurship could play a\ngreater role in workforce development. Entrepreneurship is a fundamental strength of the\nAmerican economy, and owning your own business or working for yourself can offer\nincome, a means of building wealth, and, sometimes, greater flexibility for balancing job\nand family commitments. Yet we see less self-employment in low- and moderate-income\n\n23\n\nFor more on the WorkAdvance program, see the MDRC website at\nwww.mdrc.org/project/workadvance#overview, and for information on that program in Northeast Ohio, see\nthe Towards Employment website at http://towardsemployment.org/strategic-initiatives/workadvance.\n24\nSee Harry J. Holzer and Robert I. Lerman (2014), Work-Based Learning to Expand Jobs and\nOccupational Qualifications for Youth (Washington: Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, April),\nwww.cbpp.org/sites/default/files/atoms/files/4-2-14fe-holzer.pdf.\n25\nKevin Hollenbeck and Wei-Jang Huang (2014), “Net Impact and Benefit-Cost Estimates of the\nWorkforce Development System in Washington State,” Upjohn Institute Technical Report 13-029\n(Kalamazoo, Mich.: W.E. Upjohn Institute for Employment Research), http://dx.doi.org/10.17848/tr13029.\n\n\f- 11 communities. 26 Moreover, when businesses are owned by minorities, they are less likely\nto have paid employees. 27 These findings speak to the opportunities that could be\nrealized by helping people start their own businesses and then helping them grow their\nbusinesses. Programs that equip people with the management skills and knowledge they\nneed to start and operate a successful small business can help. Relevant and effective\ntraining can reduce the failure rate of businesses by helping owners make better decisions\nand avoid costly mistakes. 28 These programs are especially critical in low-income and\nrural communities where other resources to support small business development may be\nscarce.\nAs part of their community affairs work, several Federal Reserve Banks have\nsmall business development initiatives. The Federal Reserve Bank of New York\norganized a small business protection and education series last year in partnership with\nthe Brooklyn Chamber of Commerce and a local development corporation. Participants\nlearned about capital resources available to small businesses, online credit alternatives for\nsmall businesses, and the risks of handling large volumes of cash. In another example,\nthe Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City developed a guide to help rural and smaller\n\n26\n\nFrom 2011 through 2015, only 8 percent of households in low- and moderate-income communities\nreported self-employment income, compared with 11 percent of all households (see ACS data releases in\nnote 5).\n27\nOnly 4 percent of African American-owned firms and 9 percent of Hispanic-owned firms have paid\nemployees, compared with 22 percent of non-minority-owned firms; see U.S. Department of Commerce,\nMinority Business Development Agency (2016), “U.S. Minority-Owned Firms,” fact sheet (Washington:\nMBDA, January), www.mbda.gov/sites/default/files/2012SBO_MBEFactSheet020216.pdf.\n28\nSee Glenn Muske and Nancy Stanforth (2000), “The Educational Needs of Small Business Owners: A\nLook into the Future,” Journal of Extension, vol. 38 (December),\nhttps://www.joe.org/joe/2000december/a4.php.\n\n\f- 12 metropolitan communities promote conditions favorable to growing local businesses\nrather than relying only on efforts to attract large companies. 29\nOf course, in addition to training, small business owners need financing. But, as\nmany of you know, factors such as lack of a credit history or a poor credit history and\nlimited collateral--for example, home equity--make it difficult for the owners of small\nenterprises to access traditional business credit. This situation is true for many minority,\nwomen, and low-income borrowers. 30 Nontraditional lenders, including more than 1,000\nCommunity Development Financial Institutions around the country, help fill the gap. 31\nConclusion\nTo conclude, while the economy overall is recovering and the job market has\nimproved substantially since the recession, pockets of persistently high unemployment, as\nwell as other challenges, remain. Fortunately, programs such as the ones I have\nhighlighted today can help address these challenges in more targeted ways than the\nFederal Reserve is equipped to do through monetary policy. I want you to know that we\napplaud your work, and we thank you for doing all that you do to serve the needs of\nlower-income communities across the country. Whether you work to provide affordable\nhousing, homeownership counseling, small business credit and technical support, or\nworkforce development, I hope you know that you have a partner in the Federal Reserve.\nIn the ways we can, with the different tools we each have, our aim is the same: to make\n\n29\n\nGrow Your Own Guide: Entrepreneurship-Based Economic Development is available on the Federal\nReserve Bank of Kansas City’s website at https://www.kansascityfed.org/publicat/community/gyo/gyoguide.pdf.\n30\nSee Joyce A.

Yellen\nChair\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\n“Strong Foundations: The Economic Futures of Kids and Communities,” the\n10th Biennial Federal Reserve System Community Development Research Conference\n\nWashington, D.C.\n\nMarch 23, 2017\n\n\fI would like to welcome all of you and thank you for joining us to discuss a set of\ntopics of considerable importance to our country. This is the Federal Reserve’s 10th\nbiennial community development research conference, dedicated as always to issues of\nsignificance to people and communities around the country. The conference is\ncosponsored by, and includes substantive contributions from, the community\ndevelopment offices of all 12 Federal Reserve Banks as well as the Board of Governors.\nThat united effort and level of commitment reflects how consequential we consider these\nissues to be. This conference is intended to present and highlight rigorous research that I\nam confident will inform how you think about your own work, whether from the\nperspective of policymaking, community development practice, or research.\nOur last conference, two years ago, explored various aspects of economic\nmobility, largely among adults. This year, we gather to discuss “The Economic Futures\nof Kids and Communities,” and, in part, I see this topic as an extension of that earlier\nconversation about mobility.\nToday and tomorrow, we focus on research about the foundation or building\nblocks for economic success that are laid even before young people enter the workforce\nand assume responsibility for their own finances.\nWe will hear from leading experts on a range of issues related to how children,\nyouths, and young adults are shaped in ways that may ultimately affect their ability later\nto productively contribute to the economy and manage their finances. We can learn from\nwhat the data and analysis tell us, and our hope is that making use of this information will\nlead to more effective programs and policies and thus better outcomes.\n\n\f-2Considerable evidence shows that growing up poor makes it harder to succeed as\nan adult, and new research by the Fed likewise shows the strong connection between the\ntypical experiences of poverty in childhood and economic challenges later as an adult.\nThe data come from the Board’s latest Survey of Household Economics and\nDecisionmaking (SHED), which will be published later this spring.1 In the most recent\nsurvey, we asked some of the younger respondents--aged 25 to 39--to think about their\nchildhoods. We asked those young adults whether, during their childhoods, they found\nthemselves worrying about having enough food to eat, having a stable caregiver, or about\ntheir personal safety. About 10 percent said they regularly worried about one or more of\nthese concerns, and an additional 19 percent said they sometimes worried about them.\nWe were then able to compare responses about their experiences in childhood to\nwhat these young adults told us about their current circumstances. Some pretty clear\npatterns emerged. Of those young adults who regularly had one or more of these\nchildhood concerns growing up, more than one-half say that they are currently facing\nchallenges in getting by financially. This fraction compares to just over one-fourth of\nthose who said they never, or only rarely, worried about these concerns as children that\nnow experience this level of financial challenge.

This conference is about understanding what kinds of environments and\nresources can best help children meet with economic success after they reach adulthood.\nThere has been a lot of discussion in the aftermath of the Great Recession about how to\nbest connect people with steady jobs. But research presented over the next two days\nmakes a compelling case that there is a need to also think longer term about how to\nprepare people for success in the labor market. In fact, this research underscores the\nvalue of starting young to develop basic work habits and skills, like literacy, numeracy,\nand interpersonal and organizational skills. These habits and skills help prepare people\nfor work, help them enter the labor market sooner, meet with more success over time, and\nbe in a position to develop the more specialized skills and obtain the academic credentials\nthat are strongly correlated with higher and steadier earnings. Indeed, a growing body of\neconomic and education literature has focused on the relative efficiency of addressing\nworkforce development challenges through investments in early childhood development\nand education compared with interventions later in life.\nI believe that data, evidence, and research can help policymakers and practitioners\nthink more clearly about the implications for improving economic and life outcomes for\neveryone. To this end, the speakers at this conference will focus on three broad issues. I\n\n2\n\nSee note 1.\n\n\f-4would like to briefly mention each, highlighting some of the questions that I believe can\nbe informed by the research that will be presented here.\nFirst, this morning’s panel will address early childhood development and\neducation. In recent years, medicine and social science has revealed more than we ever\nhave known before about which factors and experiences in childhood can make a\ndifference later in life. However, many questions demand further attention. A\nfundamental one is how positive developmental outcomes can be promoted among those\nwho were not born into families with socioeconomic advantages. While we do know\nthere are advantages to good quality early childhood education, we should strive to better\nunderstand what kind of returns on investment this education provides and how to\nmaximize these returns. The answers to these questions may influence thinking about\nhow programs and interventions meant to assist kids and their families should be\nstructured for maximum effectiveness to help put kids on the road to economic success.\nSecond, researchers have explored the effects of neighborhoods and community\nconditions on the development of young people. Some presenters at this conference will\nshare their understanding of how physical surroundings influence personal development.\nFor instance, how do the form and quality of community institutions such as schools,\ncommunity centers, and libraries play a role? What other kinds of community\ncharacteristics--such as public safety, transportation, and environmental quality--might\nhelp or hinder general education and financial skill development? A particularly\nimportant question is how kids’ home environments affect them in ways that matter for\ntheir future economic success. It is also critically important to ask, what kinds of\ninterventions have proven track records, and are these programs scalable?\n\n\f-5Third, and finally, other presenters will explore issues around skill development\nof youths and young adults, workforce outcomes, and the implications for the broader\neconomy. They will ask how we understand which formative experiences most affect the\nability of young people to successfully move to the next chapter in their lives, whether\nthat means college, a job, or other paths such as self-employment. What role does a\nrange of programs--starting with early childhood education all the way through youth\nvocational or apprenticeship training--play in affecting job readiness? How effective are\ndifferent approaches, and what are the returns on investment? We should also pay\nattention to how well young people form the sorts of “soft skills”--things like teamwork,\ncommunication, and the ability to handle conflict--that are so valued by employers. And,\nfor young people whose paths become difficult, such as those who get caught up in the\njuvenile justice system, what effect do such experiences have on their futures as workers\nand consumers, and what are the most promising approaches to foster a course\ncorrection?\nI hope that the data and other evidence presented today and tomorrow are of use\nto you in your work. Community development professionals attending this conference\nmay consider how the design and implementation of their programs may be improved.\nPolicymakers may look more closely at how kids are affected--purposefully or\nunintentionally--by public policies. And researchers may encounter ideas that spark new\nwork that can shed further light on these important topics.\nI think it is important that we better understand these issues, and I applaud you for\ntaking the time to be here to share your knowledge and to learn. Our young people are\nthe future, and we all want them to have the support they need for successful and\n\n\f-6fulfilling lives. As a central banker, I recognize the benefits to the broader economy\nwhen more people are better prepared for work and for managing their finances. In short,\nensuring that all of our kids have “strong foundations” will help build a similarly strong\nfoundation for the U.S. economy.\n\n\f"

Yellen\nChair\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\nThe Executives’ Club of Chicago\n\nChicago Hilton\n720 S. Michigan Avenue\nChicago, Illinois\n\nMarch 3, 2017\n\n\fI am pleased to join you today to discuss the U.S. economy and the Federal\nReserve’s monetary policy. I strongly believe that my colleagues and I should explain, as\nclearly as we can, both the reasons for our decisions and the fundamental principles that\nunderlie our strategy.\nToday I will review the conduct of monetary policy during the nearly 10 years\nsince the onset of the financial crisis. Although the Federal Reserve’s policy strategy for\nsystematically pursuing its congressionally mandated goals of maximum employment\nand price stability has not changed during this period, the Federal Open Market\nCommittee (FOMC) has made significant tactical adjustments along the way. I will\nspend most of my time today discussing the rationale for the adjustments the Committee\nhas made since 2014, a year that I see as a turning point, when the FOMC began to\ntransition from providing increasing amounts of accommodation to gradually scaling it\nback.\nThe process of scaling back accommodation has so far proceeded at a slower pace\nthan most FOMC participants anticipated in 2014. Both unexpected economic\ndevelopments and deeper reevaluations of structural trends affecting the U.S. and global\neconomies prompted us to reassess our views on the outlook and associated risks and,\nconsequently, the appropriate stance of monetary policy, both in the near term and the\nlonger run. Looking ahead, we continue to expect the evolution of the economy to\nwarrant further gradual increases in the target range for the federal funds rate. However,\ngiven how close we are to meeting our statutory goals, and in the absence of new\ndevelopments that might materially worsen the economic outlook, the process of scaling\nback accommodation likely will not be as slow as it was in 2015 and 2016.\n\n\f-2I should note that I will discuss the process of scaling back accommodation\nmostly from the perspective of our interest rate decisions, which my FOMC colleagues\nand I see as our primary tool for actively adjusting the stance of monetary policy when\nour actions are not constrained by the zero lower bound on short-term interest rates. 1\nAssessing the Degree of Monetary Policy Accommodation\nIn our monetary policy deliberations, the FOMC always faces two fundamental\nquestions: First, how do we assess the current stance of monetary policy? Second, what\nare the strategic and tactical considerations that underpin our decisions about the\nappropriate stance of monetary policy going forward? These questions are difficult\nbecause the interactions between monetary policy and the economy are complex. Policy\naffects the economy through many different channels, and, in turn, many factors\ninfluence the appropriate course of policy.\nGauging the current stance of monetary policy requires arriving at a judgment of\nwhat would constitute a neutral policy stance at a given time. A useful concept in this\nregard is the neutral “real” federal funds rate, defined as the level of the federal funds rate\nthat, when adjusted for inflation, is neither expansionary nor contractionary when the\neconomy is operating near its potential. In effect, a “neutral” policy stance is one where\nmonetary policy neither has its foot on the brake nor is pressing down on the accelerator.\nAlthough the concept of the neutral real federal funds rate is exceptionally useful in\nassessing policy, it is difficult in practical terms to know with precision where that rate\n\n1\n\nWhen the federal funds rate was near zero and we felt the economy still needed more support, the FOMC\nacted, beginning in 2008, to purchase longer-term securities. Although we stopped increasing the size of\nour securities portfolio in 2014, we have been reinvesting principal payments from our securities holdings\never since. We have said that we expect to maintain this policy until normalization of the level of the\nfederal funds rate is well under way. We have also said that, when it becomes appropriate to reduce the\nsize of our balance sheet, we will do so primarily by letting maturing assets run off our balance sheet.\n\n\f-3stands. As a result, and as I described in a recent speech, my colleagues and I consider a\nwide range of information when assessing that rate. 2 As I will discuss, our assessments\nof the neutral rate have significantly shifted down over the past few years.\nIn the Committee’s most recent projections last December, most FOMC\nparticipants assessed the longer-run value of the neutral real federal funds rate to be in\nthe vicinity of 1 percent. 3 This level is quite low by historical standards, reflecting, in\npart, slow productivity growth and an aging population not only in the United States, but\nalso in many advanced economies. Moreover, the current value of the neutral real\nfederal funds rate appears to be even lower than this longer-run value because of several\nadditional headwinds to the U.S. economy in the aftermath of the financial crisis, such as\nsubdued economic growth abroad and perhaps a lingering sense of caution on the part of\nhouseholds and businesses in the wake of the trauma of the Great Recession.\nIt is difficult to say just how low the current neutral rate is because assessments of\nthe effect of post-recession headwinds on the current level of the neutral real rate are\nsubject to a great deal of uncertainty. Some recent estimates of the current value of the\nneutral real federal funds rate stand close to zero percent. 4 With the actual value of the\nreal federal funds rate currently near minus 1 percent, a near-zero estimate of the neutral\nreal rate means that the stance of monetary policy remains moderately accommodative,\nan assessment that is consistent with the fact that employment has been growing at a\npace--around 180,000 net new jobs per month--that is notably above the level estimated\n\n2\n\nSee Yellen (2017).\nThis estimate of the neutral real federal funds rate is based on the difference between the medians of the\nlonger-run projections for the federal funds rate and inflation submitted by individual FOMC participants\nfor the December 2016 FOMC meeting. The most recent Summary of Economic Projections, an addendum\nto the minutes of that meeting, is available on the Board’s website at\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomcminutes20161214ep.htm.\n4\nSee, for instance, Holston, Laubach, and Williams (2016).\n3\n\n\f-4to be consistent with the longer-run trend in labor force growth--between 75,000 and\n125,000 per month. 5 As I will explain, this policy stance seems appropriate given that\nthe underlying trend in inflation appears to be still running somewhat below 2 percent.\nBut as that gap closes, with labor market conditions now in the vicinity of our maximum\nemployment objective, the Committee considers it appropriate to move toward a neutral\npolicy stance.\nMy colleagues and I generally anticipate that the neutral real federal funds rate\nwill rise to its longer-run level over the next few years. This expectation partly underlies\nour view that gradual increases in the federal funds rate will likely be appropriate in the\nmonths and years ahead: Those increases would keep the economy from significantly\noverheating, thereby sustaining the expansion and maintaining price stability.\nPost-Crisis Period: Same Strategy, New Tactics\nI will now examine the strategic and tactical considerations that go into FOMC\ndeliberations by discussing past monetary policy decisions in the context of our mandate\nfrom the Congress to pursue maximum employment and price stability.\nThe FOMC’s monetary policy strategy is based on three basic principles. First,\nour monetary policy must be goal driven. We must take care to ensure that our decisions\nover time are consistent with our commitment to achieve the Federal Reserve’s\ncongressionally mandated goals of maximum employment and price stability, and that the\npublic understands and has confidence in that commitment. Second, our monetary policy\nmust be forward looking because our decisions tend to influence economic activity and\n\n5\n\nThe estimate of the actual value of the real federal funds rate (around minus 1 percent) is based on the\ndifference between the current value of the effective federal funds rate (close to 0.66 percent) and the latest\nreading on inflation as measured by the 12-month change in the price index for personal consumption\nexpenditures excluding energy and food items (1-3/4 percent).\n\n\f-5inflation with a substantial lag. Among other things, this implies looking through shortterm and transitory developments and focusing on the medium-term outlook--roughly\ntwo or three years out--when making policy decisions. Third, our monetary policy must\nbe risk sensitive. Because the outlook is uncertain, we must assess appropriate policy\nwith an eye toward the risk that our expectations about the economy turn out to be\nsignificantly wrong.\nWe have followed this basic strategy for decades and, in 2012, the FOMC\nformalized it in our “Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy.” 6\nThe Committee has reaffirmed this commitment annually. But the challenges brought\nabout by the financial crisis, and the very deep recession and painfully slow recovery that\nfollowed, compelled us to adjust our tactics for carrying out our policy strategy. In\nparticular, once the Committee had cut the federal funds rate to near zero in late 2008, it\nbecame necessary to deploy new tools to supply the considerable monetary\naccommodation required by the extremely weak state of the job market and persistently\nlow inflation. 7 Those tools--especially our large-scale securities purchases and\nincreasingly explicit forward guidance pertaining to the likely future path of the federal\nfunds rate--enabled the Federal Reserve to provide necessary additional support to the\nU.S. economy by pushing down longer-term interest rates and easing financial conditions\nmore generally.\nMuch has been written and said already about the provision of additional\naccommodation between 2008 and 2014, when the FOMC completed its latest round of\n\n6\n\nThe Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy is available on the Board’s website at\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/FOMC_LongerRunGoals.pdf.\n7\nSee Yellen (2016).\n\n\f-6large-scale securities purchases, so I will turn now to our policy stance since 2014, when\nthe FOMC’s main focus started to shift from providing additional accommodation to\nscaling it back. 8\n2014: A Turning Point for Monetary Policy\nBy late 2013, the FOMC concluded that the economy had made sufficient\nprogress, and the outlook was sufficiently favorable, that it should reduce the pace of its\nlarge-scale securities purchases. But we reiterated that these purchases would continue\nuntil the outlook for the labor market had improved substantially. The U.S. economy\nmade notable progress toward the FOMC’s statutory goals during 2014, with the\nunemployment rate dropping to close to 6 percent by mid-year--well below its GreatRecession peak of 10 percent--and other measures of labor market conditions also\nshowing improvement: Payroll gains were solid; job openings had risen significantly;\nand the number of workers voluntarily quitting their jobs--a sign of confidence in the\nlabor market--was rising back toward pre-crisis levels. We were also seeing progress on\nachieving our price stability goal: Total inflation as measured by changes in the headline\npersonal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index reached about 1-3/4 percent by\nmid-2014 after hovering around 1 percent in the fall of 2013. Inflation seemed to be\nmoving toward the FOMC’s 2 percent objective, a level that the FOMC judges to be\nconsistent with price stability because it is low enough that it does not need to figure\nprominently into people’s and businesses’ economic decisions but high enough to serve\nas a buffer against deflation and provide greater scope for monetary policy to address\neconomic weakness.\n\n8\n\nFor a discussion of our monetary policy during the 2008-14 period, see, for instance, Engen, Laubach, and\nReifschneider (2015).\n\n\f-7The progress seen during 2014 indicated to the FOMC that it was no longer\nnecessary to provide increasing amounts of support to the U.S. economy by continuing to\nadd to the Federal Reserve’s holdings of longer-term securities. Accordingly, the\nCommittee continued to reduce the pace of asset purchases over the course of the year,\nending its purchases in October. That step, however, did not mark an immediate shift\ntoward tighter monetary policy because we also indicated then that we did not expect to\nraise interest rates for a considerable time after the end of our securities purchases.\nMoreover, as the Committee explained in a set of “normalization principles” issued that\nSeptember, the intention was to maintain the overall size of the Federal Reserve’s balance\nsheet at an elevated level until sometime after the FOMC had begun to raise its target for\nthe federal funds rate. 9 We decided that maintaining a highly accommodative stance of\nmonetary policy remained appropriate because, while the U.S. economy was stronger and\ncloser to meeting our statutory goals, we saw significant room for improvement. In\nparticular, the unemployment rate still stood above our assessment of its longer-run\nnormal level--that is, the unemployment rate that we expect to prevail when the economy\nis operating at maximum employment--and inflation remained below the 2 percent\nobjective.\nBecause my colleagues and I expected that labor market conditions would\ncontinue to improve and that inflation would move back to 2 percent over the medium\n\n9\n\nThe FOMC’s Policy Normalization Principles and Plans are available on the Board’s website at\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/monetary/20140917c.htm.\nSeveral studies support the notion that maintaining the size of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet at an\nelevated level is consistent with keeping a highly accommodative policy stance, particularly when shortterm interest rates are close to zero, as it was the case in 2014--see, for instance, D’Amico and others\n(2012) and many of the references in Engen, Laubach, and Reifschneider (2015). Large Federal Reserve\nholdings of longer-term securities reduce the total amount of such securities available for purchase by the\npublic, exerting upward pressure on their prices and, thus, depressing their yields and contributing to lower\nborrowing costs for American families and businesses.\n\n\f-8term, we anticipated that the time was approaching when the economy would be strong\nenough that we should start to scale back our support. Indeed, the FOMC’s June 2014\nSummary of Economic Projections (SEP) reported that nearly all FOMC participants saw\na higher federal funds rate as appropriate in the next calendar year. In contrast, only two\nparticipants in December 2013 thought that it would be appropriate to start raising that\nrate in the next calendar year.\nUneven Progress in 2015 and into 2016\nIn 2015, the unemployment rate fell significantly faster than we generally had\nanticipated in 2014. However, a series of unanticipated global developments beginning\nin the second half of 2014--including a prolonged decline in oil prices, a sizable\nappreciation of the dollar, and financial market turbulence emanating from abroad--ended\nup having adverse implications for the outlook for inflation and economic activity in the\nUnited States, prompting the FOMC to remove monetary policy accommodation at a\nslower pace than we had anticipated in mid-2014.\nU.S. gross domestic product (GDP) growth generally surprised to the downside in\n2015, reflecting, in part, weak economic activity abroad, the earlier appreciation of the\ndollar, and the effect of falling oil prices on business fixed investment. This\nunanticipated slowing in the pace of the economic recovery caused us to worry about the\nsustainability of ongoing improvements in employment and, thus, of likely progress\ntoward our maximum employment goal. Our worry was reinforced by our assessment\nthat, with the federal funds rate still near zero, there would likely be only limited scope\nfor us to respond by lowering short-term rates if the weakening in economic activity\nturned out to be persistent. In contrast, if the weakening proved transitory and the\n\n\f-9economy instead began to overheat, threatening to push inflation to an undesirably high\nlevel, the FOMC would have ample scope to respond through tighter monetary policy.\nInflation also was lower than expected, with headline PCE prices rising less than\n1 percent over the course of 2015, instead of around 1-3/4 percent as we had anticipated\nin June 2014. Much of this shortfall reflected the effects of falling oil prices and the\nappreciation of the dollar. My colleagues and I typically look through the effects on\ninflation of fluctuations in oil prices and the dollar because these effects tend to be\ntransitory. However, we became concerned in 2015 about the risk that part of the decline\nin inflation could prove to be longer lasting, especially given that inflation had already\nbeen running below our 2 percent objective for quite some time. 10 These various\nconsiderations, along with our reassessment of longer-run economic conditions--which I\nwill discuss shortly--explain why the Committee ended up raising the target range for the\nfederal funds rate only 1/4 percentage point in 2015, substantially less than the full\npercentage point increase suggested by the median projection of FOMC participants\nreported in June 2014.\n2016 also brought some unexpected economic developments that led us to\nproceed cautiously. During the first half of the year, mixed readings on the job market,\nalong with additional disappointing data on real GDP growth, suggested again that\nprogress toward the achievement of our maximum employment goal could be slowing\nmarkedly. Meanwhile, inflation hovered just below 1 percent as dollar appreciation\ncontinued to exert downward pressure on import prices, and financial market turbulence\nemanating from abroad--associated with concerns about the Chinese economy and the\n\n10\n\nThese concerns were reinforced somewhat by a decline in market-based measures of inflation\ncompensation.\n\n\f- 10 Brexit referendum--posed new risks to U.S. economic activity and inflation. Moreover,\neven as payroll gains turned solid again in the second half of 2016, the unemployment\nrate remained relatively flat, suggesting that perhaps there was more room for\nimprovement in the job market than we had previously thought. Those unanticipated\ndevelopments were part of the reason why the Committee again opted to proceed more\nslowly in removing accommodation than had been anticipated at the start of the year. We\nended up increasing the target range for the federal funds rate by only 1/4 percentage\npoint over the course of 2016, rather than the full percentage point suggested by our\nDecember 2015 projections.\nReassessing Longer-Run Conditions\nThe slower-than-anticipated increase in our federal funds rate target in 2015 and\n2016 reflected more than just the inflation, job market, and foreign developments I\nmentioned. During that period, the FOMC and most private forecasters generally\nlowered their assessments of the longer-run neutral level of the real federal funds rate.\nIndeed, at our October 2015 meeting, the FOMC had a comprehensive discussion of\nneutral real interest rates and was impressed by the breadth of evidence suggesting that\nthose rates had declined both here and abroad, and that the decline had been going on for\nsome time. In response to this growing evidence, the median assessment by FOMC\nparticipants of the longer-run level of the real federal funds rate fell from 1-3/4 percent in\nJune 2014 to 1-1/2 percent in December 2015 and then to 1 percent in December 2016.\nThese reassessments reflected, in part, the persistence of surprisingly sluggish\nproductivity growth--both in the United States and abroad--and suggested that fewer\n\n\f- 11 federal funds rate increases would be necessary than previously thought to scale back\naccommodation.\nPartly in response to persistently slow wage growth, FOMC participants and\nprivate forecasters have in recent years lowered their estimates of the normal longer-run\nrate of unemployment. The median projection of FOMC participants of the longer-run\nlevel of the unemployment rate fell from about 5-1/4 percent in June 2014 to\napproximately 4-3/4 percent in December 2016. Other things being equal, a lower\nlonger-run level of the unemployment rate suggests that the economy has greater scope to\ncreate jobs without generating too much inflation. 11 Thus, the downward revisions to\nFOMC participants’ views on the unemployment rate over the longer run contributed to\nour assessment that monetary policy could stay accommodative longer than we had\nanticipated in 2014.\nFurther Progress since Mid-2016\nThe U.S. economy has exhibited remarkable resilience in the face of adverse\nshocks in recent years, and economic developments since mid-2016 have reinforced the\nCommittee’s confidence that the economy is on track to achieve our statutory goals. Job\ngains have remained quite solid, and the unemployment rate, at 4.8 percent in January, is\nnow in line with the median of FOMC participants’ estimates of its longer-run normal\nlevel. On the whole, the prospects for further moderate economic growth look\nencouraging, particularly as risks emanating from abroad appear to have receded\n\n11\n\nThe assessment that there was perhaps more room for improvement in the labor market than previously\nthought was reinforced by data showing that the labor force participation rate remained relatively stable in\n2016, rather than declining as many had expected.\n\n\f- 12 somewhat. The Committee currently assesses that the risks to the outlook are roughly\nbalanced.\nMoreover, after remaining disappointingly low through mid-2016, inflation\nmoved up during the second half of 2016, mainly because of the diminishing effects of\nthe earlier declines in energy prices and import prices. More recently, higher energy\nprices appear to have temporarily boosted inflation, with the total PCE price index rising\nnearly 2 percent in the 12 months ending in January. Core PCE inflation--which\nexcludes volatile energy and food prices and, therefore, tends to be a better indicator of\nfuture inflation--has been running near 1-3/4 percent. Market-based measures of inflation\ncompensation have moved up, on net, in recent months, although they remain low.\nWith the job market strengthening and inflation rising toward our target, the\nmedian assessment of FOMC participants as of last December was that a cumulative 3/4\npercentage point increase in the target range for the federal funds rate would likely be\nappropriate over the course of this year. In light of current economic conditions, such an\nincrease would be consistent with the Committee’s expectation that it will raise the target\nrange for the federal funds rate at a gradual pace and would bring the real federal funds\nrate close to some estimates of its current neutral level. However, partly because my\ncolleagues and I expect the neutral real federal funds rate to rise somewhat over the\nlonger run, we projected additional gradual rate hikes in 2018 and 2019.\nOur individual projections for the appropriate path for the federal funds rate\nreflect economic forecasts that generally envision that economic activity will expand at a\nmoderate pace in coming years, labor market conditions will strengthen somewhat\nfurther, and inflation will be at or near 2 percent over the medium term. In short, we\n\n\f- 13 currently judge that it will be appropriate to gradually increase the federal funds rate if\nthe economic data continue to come in about as we expect. Indeed, at our meeting later\nthis month, the Committee will evaluate whether employment and inflation are\ncontinuing to evolve in line with our expectations, in which case a further adjustment of\nthe federal funds rate would likely be appropriate.\nNonetheless, as we have said many times--and as my discussion today\ndemonstrates--monetary policy cannot be and is not on a preset course. As in 2015 and\n2016, the Committee stands ready to adjust its assessment of the appropriate path for\nmonetary policy if unanticipated developments materially change the economic outlook.\nMonetary Policy Is Not a Panacea\nThe U.S. economy has shown great improvement and is close to meeting our\ncongressionally mandated goals of maximum employment and price stability, but we of\ncourse recognize that important challenges remain. For instance, as we noted in our latest\nMonetary Policy Report to the Congress, the ongoing expansion has been the slowest\nsince World War II, with real GDP growth averaging only about 2 percent per year. 12\nThis subdued pace reflects, in part, slower growth in the labor force in recent years-compared with much of the post-World War II period--and disappointing productivity\ngrowth both in the United States and abroad.\nOur report also noted that, despite a notable pickup in 2015, real incomes for the\nmedian family were still a bit lower than they were prior to the Great Recession, and the\ngains during this economic recovery have been skewed toward the top of the income\ndistribution, as has been the case for quite some time. Families at the 10th percentile of\n\n12\n\nSee Board of Governors (2017).\n\n\f- 14 the income distribution earned about 4 percent less in 2015 than they did in 2007,\nwhereas families at the 90th percentile earned about 4 percent more. In addition, the\neconomic circumstances of blacks and Hispanics, while improved since the depths of the\nrecession, remain worse, on average, that those of whites or Asians.\nThese unwelcome developments unfortunately reflect structural challenges that\nlie substantially beyond the reach of monetary policy. Monetary policy cannot, for\ninstance, generate technological breakthroughs or affect demographic factors that would\nboost real GDP growth over the longer run or address the root causes of income\ninequality. And monetary policy cannot improve the productivity of American workers.\nFiscal and regulatory policies--which are of course the responsibility of the\nAdministration and the Congress--are best suited to address such adverse structural\ntrends.\nConclusion\nTo conclude, we at the Federal Reserve must remain squarely focused on our\ncongressionally mandated goals. The economy has essentially met the employment\nportion of our mandate and inflation is moving closer to our 2 percent objective. This\noutcome suggests that our goal-focused, outlook-dependent approach to scaling back\naccommodation over the past couple of years has served the U.S. economy well.\nThis same approach will continue to drive our policy decisions in the months and\nyears ahead. With that in mind, our policy aims to support continued growth of the\nAmerican economy in pursuit of our congressionally mandated objectives. We do that,\nas I have noted, with an eye always on the risks. To that end, we realize that waiting too\nlong to scale back some of our support could potentially require us to raise rates rapidly\n\n\f- 15 sometime down the road, which in turn could risk disrupting financial markets and\npushing the economy into recession. Having said that, I currently see no evidence that\nthe Federal Reserve has fallen behind the curve, and I therefore continue to have\nconfidence in our judgment that a gradual removal of accommodation is likely to be\nappropriate. However, as I have noted, unless unanticipated developments adversely\naffect the economic outlook, the process of scaling back accommodation likely will not\nbe as slow as it was during the past couple of years.\n\n\f- 16 References\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2017).

        "content": "For release on delivery\n10:00 a.m. EST\nFebruary 14, 2017\n\nStatement by\nJanet L. Yellen\nChair\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nbefore the\nCommittee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs\nU.S. Senate\nFebruary 14, 2017\n\n\fChairman Crapo, Ranking Member Brown, and other members of the Committee, I am\npleased to present the Federal Reserve’s semiannual Monetary Policy Report to the Congress. In\nmy remarks today I will briefly discuss the current economic situation and outlook before turning\nto monetary policy.\nCurrent Economic Situation and Outlook\nSince my appearance before this Committee last June, the economy has continued to\nmake progress toward our dual-mandate objectives of maximum employment and price stability.\nIn the labor market, job gains averaged 190,000 per month over the second half of 2016, and the\nnumber of jobs rose an additional 227,000 in January. Those gains bring the total increase in\nemployment since its trough in early 2010 to nearly 16 million. In addition, the unemployment\nrate, which stood at 4.8 percent in January, is more than 5 percentage points lower than where it\nstood at its peak in 2010 and is now in line with the median of the Federal Open Market\nCommittee (FOMC) participants’ estimates of its longer-run normal level. A broader measure of\nlabor underutilization, which includes those marginally attached to the labor force and people\nwho are working part time but would like a full-time job, has also continued to improve over the\npast year. In addition, the pace of wage growth has picked up relative to its pace of a few years\nago, a further indication that the job market is tightening. Importantly, improvements in the\nlabor market in recent years have been widespread, with large declines in the unemployment\nrates for all major demographic groups, including African Americans and Hispanics. Even so, it\nis discouraging that jobless rates for those minorities remain significantly higher than the rate for\nthe nation overall.\nOngoing gains in the labor market have been accompanied by a further moderate\nexpansion in economic activity. U.S. real gross domestic product is estimated to have risen\n\n\f-21.9 percent last year, the same as in 2015. Consumer spending has continued to rise at a healthy\npace, supported by steady income gains, increases in the value of households’ financial assets\nand homes, favorable levels of consumer sentiment, and low interest rates. Last year’s sales of\nautomobiles and light trucks were the highest annual total on record. In contrast, business\ninvestment was relatively soft for much of last year, though it posted some larger gains toward\nthe end of the year in part reflecting an apparent end to the sharp declines in spending on drilling\nand mining structures; moreover, business sentiment has noticeably improved in the past few\nmonths. In addition, weak foreign growth and the appreciation of the dollar over the past two\nyears have restrained manufacturing output. Meanwhile, housing construction has continued to\ntrend up at only a modest pace in recent quarters. And, while the lean stock of homes for sale\nand ongoing labor market gains should provide some support to housing construction going\nforward, the recent increases in mortgage rates may impart some restraint.\nInflation moved up over the past year, mainly because of the diminishing effects of the\nearlier declines in energy prices and import prices. Total consumer prices as measured by the\npersonal consumption expenditures (PCE) index rose 1.6 percent in the 12 months ending in\nDecember, still below the FOMC’s 2 percent objective but up 1 percentage point from its pace in\n2015. Core PCE inflation, which excludes the volatile energy and food prices, moved up to\nabout 1-3/4 percent.\nMy colleagues on the FOMC and I expect the economy to continue to expand at a\nmoderate pace, with the job market strengthening somewhat further and inflation gradually rising\nto 2 percent. This judgment reflects our view that U.S. monetary policy remains\naccommodative, and that the pace of global economic activity should pick up over time,\nsupported by accommodative monetary policies abroad. Of course, our inflation outlook also\n\n\f-3depends importantly on our assessment that longer-run inflation expectations will remain\nreasonably well anchored. It is reassuring that while market-based measures of inflation\ncompensation remain low, they have risen from the very low levels they reached during the latter\npart of 2015 and first half of 2016. Meanwhile, most survey measures of longer-term inflation\nexpectations have changed little, on balance, in recent months.\nAs always, considerable uncertainty attends the economic outlook. Among the sources of\nuncertainty are possible changes in U.S. fiscal and other policies, the future path of productivity\ngrowth, and developments abroad.\nMonetary Policy\nTurning to monetary policy, the FOMC is committed to promoting maximum\nemployment and price stability, as mandated by the Congress. Against the backdrop of\nheadwinds weighing on the economy over the past year, including financial market stresses that\nemanated from developments abroad, the Committee maintained an unchanged target range for\nthe federal funds rate for most of the year in order to support improvement in the labor market\nand an increase in inflation toward 2 percent. At its December meeting, the Committee raised\nthe target range for the federal funds rate by 1/4 percentage point, to 1/2 to 3/4 percent. In doing\nso, the Committee recognized the considerable progress the economy had made toward the\nFOMC’s dual objectives. The Committee judged that even after this increase in the federal funds\nrate target, monetary policy remains accommodative, thereby supporting some further\nstrengthening in labor market conditions and a return to 2 percent inflation.\nAt its meeting that concluded early this month, the Committee left the target range for the\nfederal funds rate unchanged but reiterated that it expects the evolution of the economy to\nwarrant further gradual increases in the federal funds rate to achieve and maintain its\n\n\f-4employment and inflation objectives. As I noted on previous occasions, waiting too long to\nremove accommodation would be unwise, potentially requiring the FOMC to eventually raise\nrates rapidly, which could risk disrupting financial markets and pushing the economy into\nrecession. Incoming data suggest that labor market conditions continue to strengthen and\ninflation is moving up to 2 percent, consistent with the Committee’s expectations. At our\nupcoming meetings, the Committee will evaluate whether employment and inflation are\ncontinuing to evolve in line with these expectations, in which case a further adjustment of the\nfederal funds rate would likely be appropriate.\nThe Committee’s view that gradual increases in the federal funds rate will likely be\nappropriate reflects the expectation that the neutral federal funds rate--that is, the interest rate\nthat is neither expansionary nor contractionary and that keeps the economy operating on an even\nkeel--will rise somewhat over time. Current estimates of the neutral rate are well below precrisis levels--a phenomenon that may reflect slow productivity growth, subdued economic\ngrowth abroad, strong demand for safe longer-term assets, and other factors. The Committee\nanticipates that the depressing effect of these factors will diminish somewhat over time, raising\nthe neutral funds rate, albeit to levels that are still low by historical standards.\nThat said, the economic outlook is uncertain, and monetary policy is not on a preset\ncourse. FOMC participants will adjust their assessments of the appropriate path for the federal\nfunds rate in response to changes to the economic outlook and associated risks as informed by\nincoming data. Also, changes in fiscal policy or other economic policies could potentially affect\nthe economic outlook. Of course, it is too early to know what policy changes will be put in place\nor how their economic effects will unfold. While it is not my intention to opine on specific tax\nor spending proposals, I would point to the importance of improving the pace of longer-run\n\n\f-5economic growth and raising American living standards with policies aimed at improving\nproductivity. I would also hope that fiscal policy changes will be consistent with putting U.S.\nfiscal accounts on a sustainable trajectory. In any event, it is important to remember that fiscal\npolicy is only one of the many factors that can influence the economic outlook and the\nappropriate course of monetary policy. Overall, the FOMC’s monetary policy decisions will be\ndirected to the attainment of its congressionally mandated objectives of maximum employment\nand price stability.\nFinally, the Committee has continued its policy of reinvesting proceeds from maturing\nTreasury securities and principal payments from agency debt and mortgage-backed securities.\nThis policy, by keeping the Committee’s holdings of longer-term securities at sizable levels, has\nhelped maintain accommodative financial conditions.\nThank you. I would be pleased to take your questions.\n\n\f"

Yellen\nChair\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\nStanford Institute for Economic Policy Research\nStanford University\nStanford, California\n\nJanuary 19, 2017\n\n\fIt is a privilege to be here today to discuss how the Federal Reserve is conducting\nmonetary policy to promote a healthy economy. For more than 30 years, research from\nthe Stanford Institute for Economic Policy Research has informed economic policy, and\nevents such as this one have helped foster debate among scholars, policymakers, business\nleaders, and members of the public on critical economic issues facing our nation. I\nappreciate the opportunity to participate.\nIn my remarks today, I will review the considerable progress the economy has\nmade toward the attainment of the two objectives that the Congress has assigned to the\nFederal Reserve--maximum employment and price stability. The upshot is that labor\nutilization is close to its estimated longer-run normal level, and we are closing in on our\n2 percent inflation objective. I will then discuss the prospects for adjusting monetary\npolicy in the manner needed to sustain a strong job market while maintaining low and\nstable inflation. Determining how best to adjust the federal funds rate over time to\nachieve these objectives will not be easy. For that reason, in the balance of my remarks, I\nwill discuss some considerations that will help inform our decisions, including the\nguidance provided by simple policy rules. I will conclude by touching on some key\nuncertainties affecting the outlook.\nProgress to Date\nMy assessment of progress to date will begin with the labor market. Since the\ndepths of the Great Recession, about 15-1/2 million jobs have been added to the U.S.\neconomy, on net. In 2016, job gains averaged about 180,000 per month, well above the\npace of 75,000 to 125,000 per month that is probably consistent with keeping the\n\n\f-2unemployment rate stable over the longer run. 1 The unemployment rate is now close to\nestimates of its longer-run normal level, and other measures of labor utilization have\nimproved appreciably. As shown in figure 1, a broader measure of labor\nunderutilization--the U-6 measure, which includes not only the unemployed but also\npeople working part time who would like full-time employment and those who would\nlike a job but are not actively looking--has retraced nearly all of the steep run-up that\noccurred as a result of the recession. 2\nOther indicators also support the view that the labor market has largely recovered\nfrom the severe downturn that occurred in the wake of the financial crisis. As illustrated\nby the red dashed line in figure 2, the quits rate--an indicator of workers’ confidence\nabout leaving an existing job to pursue new opportunities--is nearly back to its prerecession level. And some indicators, such as small businesses’ assessments of the\ndifficulty of hiring, shown by the solid black line, as well as the average length of time it\ntakes firms to fill vacancies and the job openings rate, even suggest that the labor market\nis a bit tighter than before the financial crisis. Of course, both the labor force\nparticipation rate and the employment-to-population ratio are still much lower than they\nwere a decade ago. But the cyclical element in these declines looks to have largely\ndisappeared, and what is left seems to mostly reflect the aging of the population and other\nsecular trends. 3 Based on this array of labor market indicators, I judge labor utilization to\nbe reasonably close to its normal longer-run level while also recognizing that estimates of\n1\n\nThe sustainable longer-run pace of payroll employment growth depends on a number of a factors, such as\nthe growth rate of the working-age population, trend movements in labor force participation, and the\nprevalence of self-employment and multiple job holdings, so it cannot be predicted with precision.\n2\nThe normal level of the U-6 measure may now be somewhat higher than it was prior to the financial crisis\nbecause of a trend toward greater reliance on part-time workers in many sectors. See Golden (2016).\n3\nSee Aaronson and others (2014).\n\n\f-3the sustainable levels of the unemployment rate and the employment-to-population ratio\nare inherently imprecise. 4\nIn the coming months, I expect some further strengthening in labor market\nconditions as the economy continues to expand at a moderate pace--a view that is shared\nby most of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC). 5 Overall\neconomic growth has been driven by consumer spending, which has been bolstered by\nsubstantial gains in household income and wealth. Business investment, in contrast, has\nbeen soft. But recent readings on business sentiment and new orders for equipment are\nconsistent with the view that capital spending will likely strengthen modestly this year;\nanother positive factor is that oil drilling, which plummeted after oil prices fell sharply\nback in late 2014, has recently begun to pick up. As we look to broader trends, gross\ndomestic product (GDP) growth has been restrained in recent years by a variety of forces\ndepressing both supply and demand, including slow labor force and productivity growth,\nweak growth abroad, and lingering headwinds from the financial crisis. Although I am\ncautiously optimistic that some of these forces will abate over time, I anticipate that they\nwill continue to restrain overall growth over the medium term, likely holding down the\nlevel of interest rates consistent with stable labor market conditions.\nTurning to inflation, we are now much closer to the FOMC’s 2 percent objective\nthan we were just a year ago. Prices, as measured by the index for personal consumption\nexpenditures (PCE), rose nearly 1-1/2 percent in the 12 months ending in November, as\n\n4\n\nIn addition, a persistently strong labor market could potentially lead some firms to rely less on part-time\nworkers, or might encourage some people to rejoin the labor force who would otherwise sit on the\nsidelines. However, evidence on these sorts of endogenous supply-side effects is rather limited, as I noted\nin a recent speech (see Yellen, 2016).\n5\nA summary of the projections submitted by Committee participants for the December 2016 FOMC\nmeeting can be found at www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomcprojtabl20161214.htm.\n\n\f-4compared with only 1/2 percent during 2015. Moreover, core PCE inflation--a better\nindicator of the underlying inflation trend--picked up 1/4 percentage point, to a little over\n1-1/2 percent. This rise in inflation was anticipated and largely represents a fading of the\neffects of earlier declines in energy prices and the prices of non-energy imports. In\naddition, slack in labor and product markets is no longer placing downward pressure on\ninflation, in contrast to the situation only a few years ago when the unemployment rate\nwas still quite elevated. Barring future major swings in oil prices and the foreign\nexchange value of the dollar, inflation is likely to move up to 2 percent over the next\ncouple of years, aided by a strong labor market.\nIn light of the progress that has been achieved toward our employment and\ninflation objectives and the Committee’s assessment of the outlook, the FOMC raised the\ntarget range for the federal funds rate at its December meeting by 25 basis points, to\nbetween 50 and 75 basis points. The Committee judges, however, that the stance of\nmonetary policy remains modestly accommodative, and so policy should support some\nfurther strengthening in labor market conditions and thus the return of inflation to our 2\npercent goal.\nMaintaining Sustainable Growth in a Context of Price Stability\nWith the unemployment rate near its longer-run normal level and likely to move a\nbit lower this year, a natural question is whether monetary policy has fallen behind the\ncurve. The short answer, I believe, is “no.” It is true that many employers report\ndifficulties in finding qualified workers in selected occupations, and that more workers\nare comfortable quitting jobs to take or look for better positions. But this is to be\n\n\f-5expected in a healthy labor market and not evidence that the economy as a whole is\nexperiencing a serious worker shortage.\nThe recent behavior of wages provides additional evidence pertaining to the\ndegree of labor market slack. As shown in figure 3, increases in average hourly earnings,\nthe employment cost index, and compensation per hour remain subdued, picking up only\nmodestly of late. 6 Again, these data do not seem consistent with an overheated labor\nmarket. Moreover, signs of overheating in the broader economy are also scarce. For\nexample, capacity utilization in the manufacturing sector is well below its historical\naverage. Most importantly, although core inflation is rising gradually from a low level,\nthis increase mainly reflects the waning of the effects of earlier movements in the dollar,\nnot upward pressure from resource utilization.\nOf course, even if the labor market is not overheated currently, one might worry\nthat overheating could rapidly emerge as labor market conditions strengthen further,\ncausing inflation to surge. I consider this unlikely for several reasons. First, the pace of\nlabor market improvement has slowed appreciably in the past couple of years: For\nexample, average payroll gains moderated from 250,000 per month in 2014 to 180,000\nlast year, and the unemployment rate declined 1-3/4 percentage points cumulatively over\n\n6\n\nAn exception to this pattern is the Atlanta Fed’s Wage Growth Tracker (WGT), which does show a\nnoticeable acceleration in hourly wages as self-reported in the Current Population Survey. Like average\nhourly earnings, the WGT excludes benefits costs and so is less comprehensive than the ECI or businesssector compensation per hour (CPH). In addition, the WGT is based on a smaller sample than the measures\nshown in Figure 3 and it only covers a sub-set of the workforce--specifically, employed individuals who\nwere also employed a year ago, and whose earnings are less than $150,000 per year. Finally, because\naverage hourly earnings and business-sector CPH are measured as total wages divided by total hours, an\nincrease in wages for high earners has a larger effect in those measures than a similarly proportioned\nincrease for lower-wage workers, and this is not so for the WGT.\n\n\f-62014 and 2015, compared with only 1/4 percentage point last year. 7 Second, economic\ngrowth more broadly seems unlikely to pick up markedly in the near term given the\nongoing restraint from weak foreign demand and other factors that I mentioned,\nparticularly in an environment in which monetary policy is likely to become gradually\nless accommodative. Finally, figure 4 illustrates the relationship over the past several\ndecades between labor market pressures and core inflation. Note that during periods\nwhen the unemployment rate fell below the Congressional Budget Office’s estimate of its\nnormal long-run level, shown by the yellow shaded regions, core inflation, the solid red\nline, rose little, if at all. This stability is especially marked since inflation expectations\nbecame anchored during the mid-to-late 1990s. 8\nThat said, I think that allowing the economy to run markedly and persistently\n“hot” would be risky and unwise. Waiting too long to remove accommodation could\ncause inflation expectations to begin ratcheting up, driving actual inflation higher and\nmaking it harder to control. The combination of persistently low interest rates and strong\nlabor market conditions could lead to undesirable increases in leverage and other\nfinancial imbalances, although such risks would likely take time to emerge. 9 Finally,\n\n7\n\nMany other labor market indicators also improved more slowly in 2016 relative to the pace seen in the\nprior two years, including the U-6 measure of labor utilization, the rates of job openings, hiring and quits,\nsurvey readings on net hiring plans and the difficulty of filling vacancies, and the average duration of\nunemployment. A notable exception to this general pattern is the labor force participation rate, which\ndeclined fairly steadily from 2007 through 2015 but then flattened out last year despite continuing\ndownward pressure from the aging of the population and other factors. However, improvements in labor\nmarket conditions along this dimension arguably reflect an increase in potential output, and so they are\nprobably not a source of inflationary pressures.\n8\nDuring the late 1960s through the 1970s, however, inflation did rise noticeably whenever the\nunemployment rate moved below its longer-run normal level, primarily because the Federal Reserve did\nnot adequately check persistent movements in inflation by tightening monetary policy, thereby allowing\ninflation expectations to drift. This experience illustrates the importance of keeping inflation expectations\nanchored through systematic policy actions.\n9\nThe Federal Reserve closely monitors a wide range of indicators of financial stability, which currently\nprovide little evidence of significant increases in leverage or rapid growth in credit. However, some asset\n\n\f-7waiting too long to tighten policy could require the FOMC to eventually raise interest\nrates rapidly, which could risk disrupting financial markets and pushing the economy into\nrecession. For these reasons, I consider it prudent to adjust the stance of monetary policy\ngradually over time--a strategy that should improve the prospects that the economy will\nachieve sustainable growth with the labor market operating at full employment and\ninflation running at about 2 percent.\nEvaluating the Appropriate Stance of Monetary Policy\nAchieving these goals could prove challenging, however, even if the economy\nmanages to avoid being hit with adverse shocks over the next few years. To sustain a\nstrong job market with inflation at our 2 percent objective, policy must gradually shift\ntoward a neutral stance, where “neutral” is defined as a level of the federal funds rate that\nis neither expansionary nor contractionary when the economy is operating near its\npotential. But what level of the federal funds rate is neutral at the present time? How\nquickly should the funds rate target move up to this neutral level? And how will the\nneutral rate itself evolve over time?\nTo help answer such questions, the FOMC considers a voluminous amount of\ninformation concerning many factors, including financial markets and credit availability,\nlabor market conditions and overall economic activity, wages and prices, and foreign\neconomic developments. The FOMC also evaluates forecasts from a range of economic\nmodels, assessments of key risks to the outlook, and detailed analyses of how different\nmonetary policy strategies would affect projected outcomes and risks. Among the\n\nvaluations, particularly for commercial real estate, are high. With regard to the linkages between labor\nutilization and financial stability, my interpretation of the historical evidence is that undesirable increases in\nleverage or the emergence of asset bubbles are not the inevitable consequence of tight labor markets per se.\n\n\f-8strategies routinely considered by the Committee are the recommendations of a variety of\nsimple monetary policy rules. In addition, FOMC participants prepare individual\nprojections on a quarterly basis of the most likely paths of key macroeconomic variables\nunder their own assessments of “appropriate monetary policy,” together with their\nestimates of the normal longer-run values of the federal funds rate, the unemployment\nrate, and GDP growth. 10 Armed with this wealth of information, the Committee as a\nwhole then decides on the most appropriate policy action to adopt at each of its meetings.\nSuch a comprehensive, forward-looking approach to policymaking is similar to that\nemployed at other central banks. 11\nFigure 5 shows a plot of FOMC participants’ most recent assessments of the\nappropriate path for the federal funds rate through 2019. The black solid lines show the\nmedian value of the federal funds rate at the end of each year. To understand the\nconsiderations that likely underlay these judgments, I will contrast participants’\nassessments with the recommendations of some simple policy rules commonly used to\nhelp gauge the appropriate stance of policy. As I noted, the Committee routinely reviews\npolicy recommendations from a variety of benchmark rules, and I believe that their\nprescriptions can be helpful in providing broad guidance about how the federal funds rate\nshould be adjusted over time in response to movements in real activity and inflation.\nThat said, I will emphasize that the use and interpretation of such prescriptions require\n\n10\n\nThese individual projections are published quarterly in the Summary of Economic Projections that\naccompanies the release of the minutes from the March, June, September and December meetings of the\nFOMC.\n11\nThe FOMC’s procedures share many of the features of forecast targeting, an approach to monetary\npolicymaking advocated by Svensson (2005), among others. However, while the Committee publishes\nparticipants’ projections--including policy paths--in the SEP, it does not publish a “consensus” forecast, in\ncontrast to some other central banks.\n\n\f-9careful judgments about both the measurement of the inputs to these rules and the\nimplications of the many considerations the rules do not take into account.\nConsider first the well-known Taylor rule, which embodies key principles of good\nmonetary policy. The rule calls for systematic adjustments in the federal funds rate\nrelative to its expected longer-run neutral level in response to movements in inflation and\nthe output gap, defined as the percentage difference between actual output and the\neconomy’s productive potential. 12 To implement the rule, one must decide on the\nappropriate definition and measurement of its inputs. Should inflation be defined using\nthe latest noisy quarterly reading on headline PCE inflation or a measure intended to\nsmooth through transitory price movements? What technique should be used to\napproximate the output gap, given that different approaches often yield materially\ndifferent estimates? And what assumption should be made about the neutral value of the\nfederal funds rate in the longer run?\nThe Taylor rule is often implemented by assuming that the real, or inflationadjusted, value of the longer-run neutral interest rate--which I will call R* for\n\nFormally, the rule originally published by Taylor (1993) can be written as 𝑅𝑅𝑡𝑡 = 𝑅𝑅 ∗ + 𝜋𝜋𝑡𝑡 +\n0.5(𝜋𝜋𝑡𝑡 − 𝜋𝜋 ∗ ) + 0.5𝑌𝑌𝑡𝑡 , where R is the federal funds rate, R* is the level of the real federal funds rate that on\naverage is expected to be consistent with sustaining maximum employment and stable inflation in the\nlonger run, π is current inflation, π* is the central bank’s inflation objective (2 percent, in the case of the\nFederal Reserve), and Y is the output gap, defined as the difference between the current level of real GDP\nand what it would be if the economy was operating at maximum employment. Importantly, the rule\nembodies three key principles that central banks take into account when setting policy to stabilize inflation\nand the overall economy. First, a persistent movement in inflation requires a more than one-for-one\nresponse of the policy rate to stabilize inflation. Second, monetary policy should raise real interest rates\nabove their normal longer-run level whenever inflation is above its desired level and resource utilization is\nhigher than normal, and lower them when the opposite holds. (Note that implementing this latter principle\nrequires estimates of both the economy’s productive potential and the longer-run level of the real policy\nrate that would be consistent with keeping the economy operating on an even keel.) And, finally,\npolicymakers should respond in a systematic manner to changes in economic conditions in order to help\nfinancial market participants and others better understand how policy is likely to respond over time to\ncurrent and future events, thereby influencing expectations in a way that promotes economic stability.\n12\n\n\f- 10 convenience--is equal to 2 percent, roughly the average historical value of the real federal\nfunds rate prior to the financial crisis. For inflation, we can use the 12-month change in\ncore PCE prices, a measure of the current underlying rate of inflation. And the output\ngap can be reasonably approximated as twice the difference between the estimated\nlonger-run normal rate of unemployment and the actual unemployment rate. 13 The\ndashed red line in figure 5 shows the resulting recommendations for policy over the\nmedium term, based on the medians of the unemployment and inflation projections\nsubmitted by FOMC participants in December but assuming--in contrast to the median of\nparticipants’ December assessments--that R* equals 2 percent. As figure 5 shows, this\nversion of the Taylor rule prescribes a much higher path for the federal funds rate than\nthe median of participants’ assessments of appropriate policy.\nOne important factor explaining this divergence is the FOMC’s growing\nrecognition that the longer-run neutral level of the real federal funds rate has likely\ndeclined below 2 percent, contrary to what is often assumed in implementations of the\nTaylor rule. As illustrated by the left-hand panel of figure 6, since 2000, both FOMC\nparticipants and respondents to the Blue Chip survey have markedly reduced their\nprojections of the level of real short-term interest rates expected to prevail in the longer\nrun. Presumably, these revisions were made in response to accumulating evidence that\nlower real interest rates than those seen on average in the past would be needed\npermanently to keep the economy operating on an even keel. In addition, the right-hand\npanel shows considerable changes over time in estimates of the normal longer-run rate of\n\n13\n\nHistorically, percent deviations of real GDP from statistical estimates of its long-run trend are roughly\ntwice as large on average as deviations of the unemployment rate from its estimated long-run value--a\nrelationship known as Okun’s law.\n\n\f- 11 unemployment, with corresponding implications for estimates of the economy’s\nproductive potential and the output gap. Such revisions would imply shifts in the level of\nthe Taylor rule’s prescriptions by as much as 1-1/4 percentage points, holding other\nfactors constant. 14 Clearly, sensible implementation of policy rules requires adjustments\nto take such changes into account, as a failure to do so would result in poor monetary\npolicy decisions and poor economic outcomes. 15\nFigure 7 illustrates the policy implications of alternative revised assessments of\nthe longer-run neutral real rate of interest. As before, the short-dashed red line shows the\nprescriptions of the Taylor rule using the standard 2 percent assumption for R*. The\nsolid red line, however, shows the rule’s prescriptions with R* equal to 1 percent, the\nmedian of the longer-run projections of the real federal funds rate made by FOMC\nparticipants last month. This adjustment appreciably reduces the rule’s policy\nprescriptions.\nEven with this downward adjustment of the longer-run neutral rate, however, the\nTaylor rule’s prescriptions are arguably still too restrictive. The problem is that the rule\nignores the likelihood that it will likely take many years before the forces now restraining\n\n14\n\nAdditional complications arise in the measurement of economic slack because the difference between the\nunemployment rate and its estimated normal level is not always a complete gauge of overall labor\nutilization. Such was the case in the current expansion until recently because the labor force participation\nrate was unusually low and involuntary part-time employment unusually high, given the level of the\nunemployment rate. Moreover, although movements in resource utilization for the economy as a whole are\ngenerally proportional to changes in labor utilization, the relationship varies somewhat over time. Partly as\na result, contemporaneous estimates of the output gap can deviate markedly from subsequent estimates for\nthe same period calculated using revised data. For example, in early 2010, the Congressional Budget\nOffice (CBO) estimated that the output gap in 2009:Q2 was negative 7.7 percent, but the CBO has since\nlowered it to negative 6.3 percent--a large revision with important implications for assessments of the\ndeviation of actual policy from the prescriptions of simple policy rules.\n15\nIf monetary policy persistently followed the prescriptions of a Taylor rule that assumed that R* was\n2 percent when it was in fact 1 percent, then employment would run persistently below its maximum\nsustainable level and inflation would run persistently below 2 percent. Under such circumstances, inflation\nexpectations might begin to fall, creating a risk of deflation.\n\n\f- 12 the economy dissipate to the degree envisioned in participants’ estimates of the longerrun normal level of the real federal funds rate. Because overall growth has been quite\nmoderate over the past few years despite an accommodative stance of monetary policy,\nsome recent estimates of the current value of the neutral real federal funds rate stand\nclose to zero. 16 If the neutral rate were to remain quite low over the medium term, as\nwould be expected if the global economy does not materially strengthen and productivity\ngrowth remains anemic, then the appropriate setting for R* in the Taylor rule would\narguably be zero, yielding a yet lower path for the federal funds rate, as shown by the\nlong-dashed red line. These considerations illustrate that there is now no obvious “right”\nsetting for R* because we do not know how rapidly the forces restraining the economy\nwill abate, and there is a significant risk that it could be very slow. When the economy\nhas been hit with unusually persistent shocks, the Taylor rule, for this reason, provides a\nproblematic benchmark.\nSimple policy rules also typically neglect information with potentially important\nimplications for the economic outlook because they focus only on where conditions are\ntoday. For example, simple rules ignore such important factors as fiscal policy, trends\naffecting global growth, structural developments influencing the supply of credit, and\noverall financial conditions. One special factor at the moment pertains to the Federal\nReserve’s balance sheet. The downward pressure on longer-term interest rates that the\nFed’s asset holdings exert is expected to diminish over time--a development that amounts\n\n16\n\nFor example, see Holston, Laubach, and Williams (2016).\n\n\f- 13 to a “passive” removal of monetary policy accommodation. Other things being equal,\nthis factor argues for a more gradual approach to raising short-term rates. 17\nLastly, simple rules ignore important risk-management considerations that have\ninfluenced the Committee’s decisions in recent years. With the federal funds rate still\nnear zero, the Committee recognizes that, should the economy unexpectedly weaken in\nthe next year or two, there would likely be only limited scope to respond by lowering\nshort-term rates. But if the economy instead began to overheat, threatening to push\ninflation to an undesirably high level, the FOMC would have ample scope to respond\nthrough tighter monetary policy. Such asymmetric risks arguably call for a more gradual\npath of rate increases than indicated by the prescriptions of a simple policy rule.\nThe academic literature on policy rules has studied many alternatives to the\nTaylor rule, and the FOMC regularly reviews a number of them. 18 These rules embed\ndiffering but valuable perspectives, and there is no consensus among central bankers or\nacademics about the relative utility of various rules. One such alternative is the\n“balanced approach” rule, illustrated by the purple short-dashed line in figure 8. This\nrule differs from the Taylor rule by being twice as responsive to movements in resource\n\n17\n\nBased on estimates generated using the term-structure model developed by Li and Wei (2013) and the\nprocedure discussed in Ihrig and others (2012) and extended by Engen, Laubach, and Reifschneider (2015),\nthe Federal Reserve’s holdings of Treasury securities and agency mortgage-backed securities continue to\nput considerable downward pressure on longer-term interest rates. However, this pressure is estimated to\nbe gradually easing as the average maturity of the portfolio declines and the end-date for reinvestment\ndraws closer. Over the course of 2017, this easing could increase the yield on the 10-year Treasury note by\nabout 15 basis points, all else being equal. Based on the estimated co-movement of short-term and longterm interest rates, such a change in longer-term yields would be similar to that which, on average, has\nhistorically accompanied two 25 basis point hikes in the federal funds rate.\n18\nFor example, prescriptions from seven different rules, calculated using forecasts of economic activity and\ninflation from different sources, are regularly posted by the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland at\nhttps://www.clevelandfed.org/our-research/indicators-and-data/simple-monetary-policy-rules.aspx.\n\n\f- 14 utilization. 19 The prescriptions of the balanced-approach rule in this figure, as with the\nsolid red Taylor-rule plot, assume that R* equals 1 percent, consistent with the medians\nof the latest FOMC projections. Because participants on average anticipate a modest\nundershooting of the unemployment rate below its estimated longer-run level, the\nbalanced-approach rule calls for a slightly faster pace of tightening over the next several\nyears than the Taylor rule.\nFigure 8 also reports results for a “change” rule, shown as the green long-dashed\nline. As its name implies, this rule does not prescribe a particular level of the federal\nfunds rate at a given time but rather how the existing rate should change from quarter to\nquarter based on two gaps--the difference between inflation and its desired level as well\nas the difference between the unemployment rate and its longer-run normal level. 20 In\ncontrast to the other two rules, the change rule does not take a stand on the value of the\nlonger-run neutral level of the real federal funds rate, thus avoiding a potential source of\nerror. Instead, it moves interest rates up and down until both gaps close, an approach that\nin theory enables it to perform well when the true value of R* is unknown. Because both\ngaps are relatively modest at the moment and are projected to remain so, the change rule\ncalls for fairly gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary policy over the next few\nyears given the current outlook.\n\nThe balanced-approach rule is 𝑅𝑅𝑡𝑡 = 𝑅𝑅 ∗ + 𝜋𝜋𝑡𝑡 + 0.5(𝜋𝜋𝑡𝑡 − 𝜋𝜋 ∗ ) + 1.0𝑌𝑌𝑡𝑡 , where all terms are defined as in\nthe Taylor rule. (See note 12 for details.) As noted by Taylor (1999), research suggests that this rule may\ndo a better job than the Taylor rule in stabilizing real activity and inflation.\n20\nThe change rule is 𝑅𝑅𝑡𝑡 = 𝑅𝑅𝑡𝑡−1 + 1.2(𝜋𝜋𝑡𝑡 − 2) + 2.0(𝑈𝑈 ∗ − 𝑈𝑈𝑡𝑡 ), where R is the federal funds rate, π is fourquarter rate of core PCE inflation, U* is the projected longer-run unemployment rate, and U is the current\nunemployment rate. In computing the prescriptions for the change rule shown in figure 8, the midpoint of\nthe target range for the federal funds rate prior to the December 2016 FOMC meeting, 0.38 percent, is used\nas the starting point. For a discussion of this rule (and of policy rules in general), see Taylor and Williams\n(2010).\n19\n\n\f- 15 The FOMC, for reasons that I have discussed, does not base its decisions on the\nprescriptions of any specific policy rule. Nevertheless, the three benchmarks I have\ndescribed--the Taylor rule, the balanced-approach rule, and the change rule, appropriately\ncalibrated--have historically provided useful guidance about appropriate adjustments in\nthe general direction of monetary policy over time. This guidance is illustrated by\nfigure 9, which compares the path of the federal funds rate since 2000 with the\nprescriptions of the three rules, based on the actual rates of inflation and unemployment\nobserved at each point in time, along with contemporaneous Blue Chip projections of the\nlonger-run unemployment rate and R*.\nAs the figure shows, the rules clearly signaled that a major reduction in the\nfederal funds rate was appropriate in 2008 given the marked deterioration in economic\nconditions. In addition, all three rules signaled that monetary policy needed to provide\nmore stimulus during the recession and the subsequent recovery than could be provided\nby keeping short-term interest rates near zero. For this reason, the Committee turned to\nasset purchases to help make up for the shortfall by putting additional downward pressure\non longer-term interest rates. The FOMC also sought to compensate for its inability to\npush the federal funds rate below zero by indicating that the funds rate would need to stay\nunusually low for longer than would otherwise be expected and simple policy rules\nwould prescribe. 21 Under this “make up” strategy, and taking into account the reasons\nfor deviating from the Taylor rule that I discussed a moment ago, the Committee kept the\n\n21\n\nFor example, the FOMC advised in the statement released after its December 2012 meeting that\nconditions would likely warrant keeping the funds rate near zero at least as long as the unemployment rate\nwas above 6-1/2 percent--a threshold that was not passed until mid-2014. As discussed by Reifschneider\nand Williams (2000), Werning (2012), and Woodford (2012), this type of lower-for-longer guidance can\nhelp compensate for the constraint on monetary policy created by the zero lower bound on nominal interest\nrates. Engen, Laubach, and Reifschneider (2015) find that the FOMC’s guidance, together with its asset\npurchases, provided significant economic stimulus in the years following the financial crisis.\n\n\f- 16 federal funds rate near zero for longer than two of the rules would have prescribed. But\nas labor market conditions continued to improve over time, the rising trajectories for the\nfederal funds rate prescribed by all three rules signaled that the time was drawing near to\nbegin gradually reducing monetary accommodation. Consistent with this advice, the\nFOMC suspended its asset purchase program in mid-2014 and began raising the federal\nfunds rate in late 2015. 22\nTo sum up, simple policy rules can serve as useful benchmarks to help assess how\nmonetary policy should be adjusted over time. However, their prescriptions must be\ninterpreted carefully, both because estimates of some of their key inputs can vary\nsignificantly and because the rules often do not take into account important\nconsiderations and information pertaining to the outlook. For these reasons, the rules\nshould not be followed mechanically, since doing so could have adverse consequences\nfor the economy.\nConclusion\nMy remarks have focused on the policy trajectory that the Committee now\nconsiders likely to be appropriate to sustain the economic expansion while keeping\ninflation close to our 2 percent goal. In concluding, it is important to emphasize the\nconsiderable uncertainty that attaches to such assessments and the need to constantly\nupdate them.\nIn particular, the path of the neutral federal funds rate, which plays an important\nrole in determining the appropriate policy path, is highly uncertain. For example,\nproductivity growth is a key determinant of the neutral rate, and while most forecasters\n\n22\n\nFor a closer look at the FOMC’s policy actions in 2016 and their relationship to previous forecasts and\nsubsequent changes in economic conditions, see Nechio and Rudebusch (2016).\n\n\f- 17 expect productivity growth to pick up from its recent unusually slow pace, the timing of\nsuch a pickup is highly uncertain. Indeed, there is little consensus among researchers\nabout the causes of the recent slowdown in productivity growth that has occurred both at\nhome and abroad. 23 The strength of global growth will also have an important bearing on\nthe neutral rate through both trade and financial channels, and here, too, the scope for\nsurprises is considerable. Finally, I would mention the potential for changes in fiscal\npolicy to affect the economic outlook and the appropriate policy path. At this point,\nhowever, the size, timing, and composition of such changes remain uncertain. 24\nHowever, as this discussion highlights, the course of monetary policy over the next few\nyears will depend on many different factors, of which fiscal policy is just one.\n\n23\n\nTo sample some of the different views about the sources of the recent slowdown in productivity growth\nand the prospects for faster growth in the future, see Gordon (2016), Fernald and Wang (2015),\nBrynjolfsson and McAfee (2014), and Decker and others (2016, forthcoming).\n24\nA related source of uncertainty is the limited ability of economists to predict the effects of specific\nchanges in tax policy or government spending on the overall economy. In part, this uncertainty arises\nbecause the net effect depends to some extent on the response of financial markets; in addition, estimates\nvary considerably on the economic effects of changes in marginal tax rates or different types of spending.\n\n\f- 18 References\nAaronson, Stephanie, Tomaz Cajner, Bruce Fallick, Felix Galbis-Reig, Christopher\nSmith, and William Wascher (2014). “Labor Force Participation: Recent\nDevelopments and Future Prospects,” Brookings Papers on Economic Activity,\nFall, pp. 197-255, www.brookings.edu/wpcontent/uploads/2016/07/Fall2014BPEA_Aaronson_et_al.pdf.\nBrynjolfsson, Erik, and Andrew McAfee (2014).

Yellen\nChair\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\nThe Commonwealth Club\nSan Francisco, California\n\nJanuary 18, 2017\n\n\fGood afternoon. It is a pleasure to join all of you at the Commonwealth Club\ntoday, not the least because the club and the Federal Reserve have a few things in\ncommon. Both organizations, as it happens, have a board of governors and a chair. And\nboth the club’s and the Fed’s histories extend back more than a century. The club, as\nmany here know, was founded in 1903, and the Federal Reserve a decade later. Perhaps\nbecause of our shared origins in the Progressive Era, a period of reform in American life,\nwe hold certain values in common. According to your website, the club is nonpartisan\nand dedicated to the impartial discussion of issues important to your community and the\nnation. At the Fed, we too are nonpartisan and focused squarely on the public interest.\nWe strive to conduct our deliberations impartially and base our decisions on factual\nevidence and objective analysis. This afternoon I will discuss some challenges we’ve\nfaced in our recent deliberations and may face in the next few years.\nPerhaps, though, it is best to start by stepping back and asking, what is--and,\nimportantly, what isn’t--our job as the nation’s central bank? And how do we go about\ntrying to accomplish it? The Federal Reserve has an array of responsibilities. I’ll\nmention our principal duties and then focus on one--monetary policy, the responsibility\nthat gets the most public attention.\nIn addition to monetary policy, we--in collaboration with other regulatory\nagencies at both the federal and state levels--oversee banks and some other financial\ninstitutions to ensure they operate safely and soundly and treat their customers fairly. We\nmonitor the financial system as a whole and promote its stability to help avoid financial\ncrises that could choke off credit to consumers and businesses. We also reliably and\nsafely process trillions of dollars of payments for the nation’s banks and the federal\n\n\f-2government and ensure that banks have an ample supply of currency and coin to meet the\ndemands of their depositors. And we work with communities, nonprofit organizations,\nlenders, educators, and others to encourage financial and economic literacy, promote\nequal access to credit, and advance economic and community development.\nBut, as I noted, monetary policy draws the most headlines. What is monetary\npolicy, exactly? Simply put, it consists of central bank actions aimed at influencing\ninterest rates and financial conditions more generally. Its purpose is to help foster a\nhealthy economy. But monetary policy cannot, by itself, create a healthy economy. It\ncannot, for instance, educate young people, generate technological breakthroughs, make\nworkers and businesses more productive, or address the root causes of inequality.\nFundamentally, the energy, ingenuity, and know-how of American workers and\nentrepreneurs, along with our natural resources, create prosperity. Regulatory policy and\nfiscal policy--the decisions by the Administration and the Congress about how much and\nhow the government spends, taxes, and borrows--can influence these more fundamental\neconomic pillars.\nI’ve said what monetary policy cannot do. But what can it do? It can lean against\ndamaging fluctuations in the economy. Nearly 40 years ago, the Congress set two main\nguideposts for that task--maximum employment and price stability. We refer to these\nassigned goals as our dual mandate. When the economy is weak and unemployment is on\nthe rise, we encourage spending and investing by pushing short-term interest rates lower.\nAs you may know, the interest rate that we target is the federal funds rate, the rate banks\ncharge each other for overnight loans. Lowering short-term rates in turn puts downward\npressure on longer-term interest rates, making credit more affordable--for families, for\n\n\f-3instance, to buy a house or for businesses to expand. Similarly, when the economy is\nthreatening to push inflation too high down the road, we increase interest rates to keep the\neconomy on a sustainable path and lean against its tendency to boom and then bust.\nBut what exactly do the terms “maximum employment” and “price stability”\nmean? Does maximum employment mean that every single person who wants a job has a\njob? No. There are always a certain number of people who are temporarily between jobs\nafter having recently lost a job or having left one voluntarily to pursue better\nopportunities. Others may have just graduated and have started looking for a job or have\ndecided to return to working--for instance, when their child starts school. This so-called\nfrictional unemployment is evident even in the healthiest of economies.\nThen there is structural unemployment--a difficult problem both for the people\naffected and for policymakers trying to address it. Sometimes people are ready and\nwilling to work, but their skills, perhaps because of technological advances, are not a\ngood fit for the jobs that are available. Or suitable jobs may be available but are not close\nto where they and their families live. These are factors over which monetary policy has\nlittle influence. Other measures--such as job training and other workforce development\nprograms--are better suited to address structural unemployment.\nAfter taking account of both frictional and structural unemployment, what\nunemployment rate is roughly equivalent to the maximum level of employment that can\nbe sustained in the longer run? The rate can change over time as the economy evolves,\nbut, for now, many economists, including my colleagues at the Fed and me, judge that it\nis around 4-3/4 percent. It’s important to try to estimate the unemployment rate that is\n\n\f-4equivalent to maximum employment because persistently operating below it pushes\ninflation higher, which brings me to our price stability mandate.\nDoes price stability mean having no inflation whatsoever? Again, the answer is\nno. By “price stability,” we mean a level of inflation that is low and stable enough that it\ndoesn’t need to figure prominently into people’s and businesses’ economic decisions.\nBased on research and decades of experience, we define that level as 2 percent a year--an\ninflation objective similar to that adopted by most other major central banks. 1 Individual\nprices, of course, move up and down by more than 2 percent all the time. Such\nmovements are essential to a well-functioning economy. They allow supply and demand\nto adjust for various goods and services. By “inflation,” we mean price changes as a\nwhole for all of the various goods and services that households consume.\nNo one likes high inflation, and it is easy to understand why. Although wages\nand prices tend to move in tandem over long periods, inflation erodes household\npurchasing power if it is not matched with similar increases in wages, and it eats away\nthe value of households’ savings. So, then, why don’t we and other central banks aim for\nzero inflation? There are several technical reasons, but a more fundamental reason is to\ncreate a buffer against the opposite of inflation--that is, deflation. Deflation is a general\nand persistent decline in the level of prices, a phenomenon Americans last experienced\nduring the Great Depression of the 1930s and one that Japan has confronted for most of\nthe past two decades. Deflation can feed on itself, leading to economic stagnation or\nworse. It puts pressure on employers to either cut wages or cut jobs. And it can be very\nhard on borrowers, who find themselves repaying their loans with dollars that are worth\n\n1\n\nOur objective is 2 percent inflation as measured by the annual change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures published by the Commerce Department’s Bureau of Economic Analysis.\n\n\f-5more than the dollars they originally borrowed. I am sure we all remember learning in\nschool about farm families in the Great Depression who couldn’t pay their mortgages and\nlost their homes and their livelihoods when crop prices fell persistently.\nAnother important reason to maintain a modest inflation buffer is that too low\ninflation impairs the ability of monetary policy to counter economic downturns. When\ninflation is very low, interest rates tend to be very low also, even in good times. And\nwhen interest rates are generally very low, the Fed has only limited room to cut them to\nhelp the economy in bad times.\nIn a nutshell, the Fed’s goal is to promote financial conditions conducive to\nmaximum employment and price stability. And I have offered broad-brush definitions of\neach of those objectives. So where is the economy now, in relationship to them? The\nshort answer is, we think it’s close. The economy has come a long way since the\nfinancial crisis. As you know, the crisis marked the start of a very deep recession. It\ndestroyed nearly 9 million jobs, and it’s been a long, slow slog to recover from it.\nUnemployment peaked at 10 percent late in 2009, a level unseen for more than 25 years,\nand didn’t move below 8 percent for nearly three years. Falling home prices put millions\nof homeowners “underwater,” meaning they owed more on their mortgages than their\nhomes were worth. And the stock market plunged, slashing the value of 401(k)\nretirement nest eggs.\nThe extraordinarily severe recession required an extraordinary response from\nmonetary policy, both to support the job market and prevent deflation. We cut our shortterm interest rate target to near zero at the end of 2008 and kept it there for seven years.\nTo provide further support to American households and businesses, we pressed down on\n\n\f-6longer-term interest rates by purchasing large amounts of longer-term Treasury securities\nand government-guaranteed mortgage securities. And we communicated our intent to\nkeep short-term interest rates low for a long time, thus increasing the downward pressure\non longer-term interest rates, which are influenced by expectations about short-term rates.\nNow, it’s fair to say, the economy is near maximum employment and inflation is\nmoving toward our goal. The unemployment rate is less than 5 percent, roughly back to\nwhere it was before the recession. And, over the past seven years, the economy has\nadded about 15-1/2 million net new jobs. Although inflation has been running below our\n2 percent objective for quite some time, we have seen it start inching back toward\n2 percent last year as the job market continued to improve and as the effects of a big drop\nin oil prices faded. Last month, at our most recent meeting, we took account of the\nconsiderable progress the economy has made by modestly increasing our short-term\ninterest rate target by 1/4 percentage point to a range of 1/2 to 3/4 percent. It was the\nsecond such step--the first came a year earlier--and reflects our confidence the economy\nwill continue to improve.\nNow, many of you would love to know exactly when the next rate increase is\ncoming and how high rates will rise. The simple truth is, I can’t tell you because it will\ndepend on how the economy actually evolves over coming months. The economy is vast\nand vastly complex, and its path can take surprising twists and turns. What I can tell you\nis what we expect--along with a very large caveat that our interest rate expectations will\nchange as our outlook for the economy changes. That said, as of last month, I and most\nof my colleagues--the other members of the Fed Board in Washington and the presidents\nof the 12 regional Federal Reserve Banks--were expecting to increase our federal funds\n\n\f-7rate target a few times a year until, by the end of 2019, it is close to our estimate of its\nlonger-run neutral rate of 3 percent.\nThe term “neutral rate” requires some explaining. It is the rate that, once the\neconomy has reached our objectives, will keep the economy on an even keel. It is neither\npressing on the gas pedal to make the car go faster nor easing off so much that the car\nslows down. Right now our foot is still pressing on the gas pedal, though, as I noted, we\nhave eased back a bit. Our foot remains on the pedal in part because we want to make\nsure the economic expansion remains strong enough to withstand an unexpected shock,\ngiven that we don’t have much room to cut interest rates. In addition, inflation is still\nrunning below our 2 percent objective, and, by some measures, there may still be some\nroom for progress in the job market. For instance, wage growth has only recently begun\nto pick up and remains fairly low. A broader measure of unemployment isn’t quite back\nto its pre-recession level. It includes people who would like a job but have been too\ndiscouraged to look for one and people who are working part time but would rather work\nfull time.\nNevertheless, as the economy approaches our objectives, it makes sense to\ngradually reduce the level of monetary policy support. Changes in monetary policy take\ntime to work their way into the economy. Waiting too long to begin moving toward the\nneutral rate could risk a nasty surprise down the road--either too much inflation, financial\ninstability, or both. In that scenario, we could be forced to raise interest rates rapidly,\nwhich in turn could push the economy into a new recession.\nThe factors I have just discussed are the usual sort that central bankers consider as\neconomies move through a recovery. But a longer-term trend--slow productivity\n\n\f-8growth--helps explain why we don’t think dramatic interest rate increases are required to\nmove our federal funds rate target back to neutral. Labor productivity--that is, the output\nof goods and services per hour of work--has increased by only about 1/2 percent a year,\non average, over the past six years or so and only 1-1/4 percent a year over the past\ndecade. That contrasts with the previous 30 years when productivity grew a bit more\nthan 2 percent a year. This productivity slowdown matters enormously because\nAmericans’ standard of living depends on productivity growth. With productivity growth\nof 2 percent a year, the average standard of living will double roughly every 35 years.\nThat means our children can reasonably hope to be better off economically than we are\nnow. But productivity growth of 1 percent a year means the average standard of living\nwill double only every 70 years.\nEconomists do not fully understand the causes of the productivity slowdown.\nSome emphasize that technological progress and its diffusion throughout the economy\nseem to be slower over the past decade or so. Others look at college graduation rates,\nwhich have flattened out after rising rapidly in previous generations. And still others\nfocus on a dramatic slowing in the creation of new businesses, which are often more\ninnovative than established firms. While each of these factors has likely played a role in\nslowing productivity growth, the extent to which they will continue to do so is an open\nquestion. 2\nWhy does slow productivity growth, if it persists, imply a lower neutral interest\nrate? First, it implies that the economy’s usual rate of output growth, when employment\n\n2\n\nOther factors depressing the neutral rate include housing construction and lackluster exports. Housing\nstill hasn’t fully recovered from the financial crisis, in part because mortgage-qualification standards\nremain tight. Weak growth abroad in Europe, China, and elsewhere, some of which is related to their own\nproductivity challenges, has hurt sales of U.S. goods.\n\n\f-9is at its maximum and prices are stable, will be significantly slower than the post-World\nWar II average. Slower economic growth, in turn, implies businesses will see less need\nto invest in expansion. And it implies families and individuals will feel the need to save\nmore and spend less. Because interest rates are the mechanism that brings the supply of\nsavings and the demand for investment funds into balance, more saving and less\ninvestment imply a lower neutral interest rate. Although we can’t directly measure the\nneutral interest rate, it is something that can be estimated in retrospect. And, as we have\nincreasingly realized, it has probably been trending down for a while now. Our current 3\npercent estimate of the longer-run neutral rate, for instance, is a full percentage point\nlower than our estimate just three years ago.\nYou might be thinking, what does this discussion of rather esoteric concepts such\nas the neutral rate mean to me? If you are a borrower, it means that, although the interest\nrates you pay on, say, your auto loan or mortgage or credit card likely will creep higher,\nthey probably will not increase dramatically. Likewise, if you are a saver, the rates you\nearn could inch higher after a while, but probably not by a lot. For some years, I’ve\nheard from savers who want higher rates, and now I’m beginning to hear from borrowers\nwho want lower rates. I can’t emphasize strongly enough, though, that we are not trying\nto help one of those groups at the expense of the other. We’re focused very much on that\ndual mandate I keep mentioning. At the end of the day, we all benefit from plentiful jobs\nand stable prices, whether we are savers or borrowers--and many of us, of course, are\nboth.\nEconomics and monetary policy are, at best, inexact sciences. Figuring out what\nthe neutral interest rate is and setting the right path toward it is not like setting the\n\n\f- 10 thermostat in a house: You can’t just set the temperature at 68 degrees and walk away.\nAnd, because changes in monetary policy affect the economy with long lags sometimes,\nwe must base our decisions on our best forecasts of an uncertain future. Thus, we must\ncontinually reassess and adjust our policies based on what we learn.\nThat point leads me to repeat what I said when I began: Like the Commonwealth\nClub, the Federal Reserve was created more than a century ago during an era of\ngovernment reform to serve the public interest. The structure established for the Federal\nReserve back then intentionally insulates us from short-term political pressures so we can\nfocus on what’s best for the American economy in the longer run. I promise you, with\nthe sometimes imperfect information and evidence we have available, we will do just that\nby making the best decisions we can, as objectively as we can.\nThank you. I welcome your questions.\n\n\f"

Yellen\nChair\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat a\nConversation with the Chair: A Teacher Town Hall Meeting\nWashington, D.C.\n(And via video link to Federal Reserve Banks)\n\nJanuary 12, 2017\n\n\fThank you, and thank you to all the educators who have come to the Board this\nevening or travelled to one of the Fed’s regional Reserve Banks to watch and listen via\nthe webcast.\nI am very much looking forward to hearing from you about teaching economics,\nand I am eager to respond to your questions. For that reason, and also because I expect\nthat school starts very early tomorrow for many of you, I will try to keep my remarks\nbrief. But I do have a message to impart about the work you do, which is vitally\nimportant not only to your students, but also, I believe, to the world they will soon inherit\nand even to the mission of the Federal Reserve.\nFirst and foremost, of course, like all teachers, you are helping prepare your\nstudents for successful and rewarding lives. The knowledge you impart and the intellect\nand talents you help develop are powerful tools your students can use to build those lives.\nLike some other subjects students encounter in school, economics teaches analytical and\ncritical thinking skills that can aid in the development and success of anyone. Part of\nsuccess for your students is economic success--as capable, creative, and productive\nmembers of the workforce and as consumers adept at managing their finances.\nEconomics provides knowledge and skills of practical use in college and in the\nworkplace, and it also provides skills to plan and make wise financial decisions, which\nare some of the most important and consequential that we face in life.\nYour students benefit very directly from this education, but so does everyone else\nin society. Everyone is engaged in and depends on the economy, and nothing is more\ncritical to a healthy and growing economy than the capability, creativity, and\nproductiveness of its workforce. Whenever I am asked what policies and initiatives could\n\n\f-2do the most to spur economic growth and raise living standards, improving education is\nat the top of my list.\nIn addition to the role you play in preparing students for jobs and careers, you also\nhelp prepare them to be responsible consumers. The economy needs productive workers,\nand it also depends on consumers, whose individual spending decisions, as most of you\nsurely have taught in class, collectively account for two-thirds of economic activity.\nConsumers skilled in managing their finances are better prepared to weather bad times,\nand stronger household finances overall can help sustain growth, stabilize the economy,\nand mitigate an economic downturn.\nStabilizing the economy and mitigating a downturn, of course, also happen to be\namong the Federal Reserve’s primary responsibilities. When successful, monetary policy\ncan be a powerful and effective tool to these ends, but its capabilities are dwarfed by\nlarger factors such as the productivity of the workforce and the strength of household\nfinances. By educating students and directly supporting their contributions to the\neconomy as producers and consumers, all teachers, especially teachers of economics, are\neffectively furthering our mission at the Fed, so let me offer my thanks for making that\njob a little easier.\nTo help support your important work as teachers, the Federal Reserve Board and\nthe 12 Reserve Banks conduct programs, organize events, and publish books and other\nmaterials to spread knowledge of the role of the Fed--and economics in general--and to\npromote financial literacy. Before I get to those events and programs, let me say a word\nabout what is probably the most important pedagogical aid that the Fed produces--the\n182-page book called The Federal Reserve System: Purposes and Functions. The 10th\n\n\f-3edition of Purposes and Functions, published in October of last year, offers a detailed\nand comprehensive account of what, why, and how the Fed carries out its different\nresponsibilities. I think it is a wonderful resource for teaching about the Fed, and copies\nare available via the Board’s website. 1\nEach of the Fed’s Reserve Banks has community outreach and educational\ninitiatives in the areas of the country they serve, and the outreach to economics teachers\nis coordinated by the group chaired by Amy Hennessy, the Federal Reserve System\nEconomic Education Group.\nAt the Board, we have for some years operated a program called FedEd, which\nsends Fed employees into schools throughout the Washington, D.C., metropolitan area\nand sponsors events for students here at the Eccles Building. 2 FedEd’s outreach to\nschools depends on the time and sacrifice of several dozen research assistants, who are\ntypically recent college graduates who work for two or three years at the Board.\nResearch assistants who volunteer for FedEd visit schools; help teach about the Fed,\neconomics, and finance; and answer questions about work opportunities at the Board.\nThe Federal Reserve is committed to promoting diversity in our ranks and in the\neconomics profession, and FedEd has furthered these goals by making sure to include\nschools with significant numbers of minority students.\nThis past school year, FedEd sent research assistants into nine different schools\nand FedEd volunteers have visited 38 different schools since 2012. FedEd was back in\nschools last fall, drawing from 48 research assistants who volunteered to participate.\n\n1\n\nPurposes and Functions is available on the Board’s website at https://www.federalreserve.gov/pf/pf.htm.\nMore information about FedEd is available on the Board’s website at\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/educational-tools/fed-education.htm.\n\n2\n\n\f-4FedEd also sponsors several speaker events a year that bring students into this Board\nRoom. Students recently heard a presentation from Scott Alvarez, who oversees the\nBoard’s Legal Division, and, in February, Vice Chairman Stanley Fischer will speak to\nstudents at another event. FedEd is overseen by two research assistants, Caroline Shinkle\nand Jamie Lenney, along with Karen Pence, who is an economist at the Board. All three\nare with us this evening and prepared to answer further questions about the program.\nOnline resources for teachers can be found on the Board’s website at\nfederalreserve.gov, and additional resources available throughout the System are at\nfederalreserveeducation.org. The websites include videos in which policymakers and the\nstaff describe the Fed’s functions. Also, the sites include historical materials and a\nwealth of information related to the financial crisis and the Fed’s response.\nLet me leave it there, and again thank teachers for participating in this town hall,\nand offer my thanks, on behalf of the Board of Governors, for the valuable work you do\nevery day. I would be very happy to respond to your questions.\n\n\f"
