            "content": "Getting It Right: Meeting Uncertainty with Conditionality\nMary C. Daly, President and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of San Francisco\nCommonwealth Club World Affairs of California\nSan Francisco, CA\nJune 24, 2024\n11 AM PT\nRemarks as prepared for delivery.\nINTRODUCTION\nThank you, Alex for that kind introduction. And thank you to the Commonwealth Club World\nAffairs of California and the San Francisco Press Club for hosting this event. I’m really looking\nforward to a lively discussion.\nNow, the last time I was here, the world looked considerably different. It was November 2021,\nand we were still struggling to come out of the pandemic. Inflation was high, the labor market\nwas rebounding, and the federal funds rate, the Federal Reserve’s primary interest rate tool,\nwas near zero.\nThings have clearly changed. The federal funds rate is now above 5 percent, inflation has\nreceded, although not completely, and the labor market has more than recovered and is now\nslowly moving towards a more sustainable level.\nThat’s a lot of improvement and we should acknowledge it. But we are not there yet. So, we\nmust continue the work of fully restoring price stability without a painful disruption to the\neconomy.\nToday, I will review where we stand and discuss what it will take to finish the job.1\nAs always, the views I will express are my own and do not necessarily reflect those of anyone\nelse in the Federal Reserve System.\n\n1\n\nBoard of Governors (2020).\n\n1\n\n\fCLOSING IN\nSo, where are we? Well, we are still in the fight to bring inflation to our 2 percent target. We’ve\nmade a lot of progress, but there is still work to do.\nAs this figure (Figure 1) shows, since March of 2022, when the Federal Open Market Committee\n(FOMC) began raising interest rates, inflation has come down substantially, from a bit over 7\npercent at its peak to just under 3 percent in the most recent readings. Importantly, as actual\ninflation has fallen, inflation expectations—what we all believe about the future—have followed\nsuit, confirming that households, businesses, and markets know that the Federal Reserve is\ncommitted to reaching its inflation goal.2\nFigure 1: Inflation and unemployment since March 2022\nPercent\nPCE inflation\n7\n\n6\n\n5\nSEP u* = 4.2%\n4\nMay\n3\n\nUnemployment rate\nApril\n\n2\n2% inflation goal\n1\n\n0\nMar‐22\n\nJun‐22\n\nSep‐22\n\nDec‐22\n\nMar‐23\n\nJun‐23\n\nSep‐23\n\nDec‐23\n\nMar‐24\n\nJun‐24\n\nSource: Bureau of Economic Analysis and Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n\nThe decline in inflation owes to many factors, including improvements in supply chains,\nproductivity, and labor force growth.3 Indeed, research by the San Francisco Fed shows that\nthese supply factors were a key reason inflation fell, especially early in the period.4\n\n2\n\nBundick and Smith (2024), Powell (2024).\nThese improvements include spanned both goods and labor supply. Bernanke and Blanchard (2023, 2024), Guerrieri, et al. (2023), Shapiro\n(2024).\n4\nIn the 12 months following the first policy rate adjustment in March 2022, about two thirds of the decline in overall personal consumption\nexpenditures (PCE) inflation was from supply‐driven inflation (based on the framework from Shapiro 2024). This share has fallen as demand\nfactors have risen in importance.\n3\n\n2\n\n\fAs higher interest rates have taken hold, however, demand factors have become more\nimportant. Since the second half of last year, demand, rather than supply, has been the key\ndriver of falling inflation.5\nOf course, as demand has slowed, so has the labor market. And this has translated into slightly\nhigher unemployment as the blue line indicates. So far, however, the rise in unemployment has\nbeen modest compared with the decline in inflation. The unemployment rate currently sits just\nbelow what many judge as its longer‐run value, the level that reflects full employment.6\nIn other words, so far, so good. Both supply and demand have contributed to the decline in\ninflation. And progress has come without a significant disruption to the labor market.\nMonetary policy is working, but we need to finish the job.\nBALANCED GOALS\nAnd this will take balance.\nThe bumpiness of inflation data so far this year has not inspired confidence.7 Recent readings\nare more encouraging, but it is hard to know if we are truly on track to sustainable price\nstability.\nAnd we can’t count on all the supply factors that helped us last year. Now that supply chains\nare largely mended, and domestic labor force participation has fully recovered, we are unlikely\nto get as much help from those forces. We have to remain open to positive supply\ndevelopments, but increasingly, restrained demand, rather than improved supply, will likely be\nneeded to get inflation down to target.\nAnd that brings the labor market into the conversation. As I showed earlier, so far, the labor\nmarket has adjusted slowly, and the unemployment rate has only edged up. But we are getting\nnearer to a point where that benign outcome could be less likely.\nAlthough job growth remains strong, most other measures of labor market conditions have\nreturned to their pre‐pandemic levels. In particular, the balance between the demand and\nsupply of workers has largely normalized.\n\n5\n\nFrom March 2023 to April 2024, supply‐driven inflation only accounted for one‐fourth of the decline in overall PCE inflation.\nSee the FOMC’s June 2024 Summary of Economic Projections (SEP)\n(https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomcprojtabl20240612.htm).\n7\nResearch offers many reasons why progress on reducing inflation might be uneven. These include: the long and variable lags of the effects of\nmonetary policy on economic activity (Dupor 2023, Bengali and Arnaut 2024); changes in the relative importance of persistent versus transitory\nshocks to inflation (Stock and Watson 2007, Lansing 2022, Almuzara, Kocaoglu, and Sbordone 2023); and changes in the slope of the Phillips\ncurve that governs the responsiveness of inflation to changes in economic slack (Ball, Leigh, and Mishra 2022, Harding, Lindé, and Trabandt\n2023, Benigno and Eggertsson 2023, and Crust, Lansing, and Petrosky‐Nadeau 2023).\n6\n\n3\n\n\fAn easy way to see this is in something called the Beveridge curve (Figure 2), a curve that’s\nreceived a lot of attention of late. It captures the relationship between job vacancies (demand\nfor workers) and unemployment (supply of workers).8\nThe black line in the figure is the historical path of the curve.9 The dots show the history in gray\nand the more recent experience in red.\n\nFigure 2: Beveridge curve (unemployment and job vacancies)\n\nSource: Bureau of Labor Statistics and FRBSF Staff calculations.\n\nLooking at the top of the red dots, you can see that in the aftermath of pandemic lockdowns,\nfirms posted historically large numbers of job vacancies. Firms were scrambling, if you\nremember, trying to manage hiring and turnover to meet ever‐surging consumer demand.\nVacancies rose rapidly, firms chased a limited pool of workers, and the labor market felt\nfrenzied. In Beveridge curve terms, we moved up the steep portion of the curve.\nThen, as interest rates rose and things became less frenzied, vacancies reversed. Firms settled\ndown, posted fewer jobs, and we moved back down the Beveridge curve. All of this occurred\n\n8\n9\n\nUpdated from Bok, et al. (2022).\nThe model is fitted on January 1999 through February 2020 data.\n\n4\n\n\fwithout a significant increase in unemployment—as shown by the lower red dots.10 At this\npoint, we have a good labor market, but not a frothy one.\nGoing forward, this tradeoff may not be as favorable. The latest job market data, the large red\ndot (April 2024), shows that we are getting very near the flatter portion of the Beveridge curve.\nThis means that future labor market slowing could translate into higher unemployment, as firms\nneed to adjust not just vacancies but actual jobs.11\nAll this is to say that at this point, inflation is not the only risk we face. We will need to keep our\neyes on both sides of our mandate—inflation and full employment—as we work to achieve our\ngoals.\nSCENARIO PLANNING\nSo, what does this mean for policy? Simply put, we need to be vigilant and open.\nWe have two goals, one tool, and a lot of uncertainty. So, being definitive and predetermined is\nnot that helpful.\nWhat is helpful, is planning. Evaluating scenarios that could play out and understanding how\npolicy should respond.\nIn other words, to be appropriate, policy has to be conditional. And we have to think in\nscenarios.\nFor example, if inflation turns out to fall more slowly than projected, then holding the federal\nfunds rate higher for longer would be appropriate. If instead, inflation falls rapidly, or the labor\nmarket softens more than expected, then lowering the policy rate would be necessary. Finally,\nif we continue to see gradual declines in inflation and a slow rebalancing in the labor market,\nthen we can normalize policy over time, as many expect.\nThe truth is any of these scenarios are in the realm of reasonable—they are all possible.\nAnd we need to be ready to respond to however the economy evolves.\n\n10\n\nThe possibility of this adjustment via vacancy reductions rather than unemployment increases was discussed in Figura and Waller (2022) and\nBok, et al. (2022).\n11\nMoreover, the economy may also be moving onto a flatter portion of the Phillips curve, implying it will take a larger upward movement in\nlabor market slack to achieve further downward movements in the inflation rate. See Ball, Leigh, and Mishra (2022), Harding, Lindé, and\nTrabandt (2023), Benigno and Eggertsson (2023), Crust, Lansing, and Petrosky‐Nadeau (2023), and Furman (2024).\n\n5\n\n\fPEOPLE WANT BOTH\nLet me end where I started. This is not 2021, or 2022, or even 2023. We are in a very different\nplace. Inflation has come down, the labor market is solid, and businesses and households\nbelieve that we can finish the job.\nBut we’re not there yet.\nWhether you call it the final mile, completing the work, or simply delivering fully on our dual\nmandate goals, there is more to do.\nBut we will need to exhibit care. To really thrive, people need both price stability and jobs.\nI know this from my own experience. I grew up in Ballwin, Missouri in the 1970s, the last period\nof high inflation. In my world, many people struggled. Inflation imposed a corrosive tax,\neroding earnings, making it hard to pay bills or invest in anything other than the day to day.\nWorst of all, there was no end in sight.12\nThe Volcker disinflation remedied that. But the medicine was harsh. And my family, and\nmillions of other American families, went from being constrained by high inflation to hampered\nby job loss.\nLooking back, that medicine seemed necessary, reflecting the specific circumstances of the\ntime.\nBut we are not in that world. The Federal Reserve has credibility that it didn’t back then.13\nPeople know the Fed will bring inflation down.\nAll of this means that our journey today can be different. Not just avoiding a painful recession,\nbut balancing policy to protect full employment while restoring price stability.\nThat is the economy we are striving for, and that is the one we are working to deliver.\n\n12\n\nInflation expectations in advance of the Volcker disinflation were unanchored, moving up nearly one to one with actual inflation. This tight\nconnection meant inflation was self‐reinforcing, hence there was no end in sight. See Daly (2022) for discussion.\n13\nAs noted earlier, longer‐run inflation expectations are well‐anchored.\n\n6\n\n\fREFERENCES\nAlmuzara, Martin, Babur Kocaoglu, and Argia Sbordone. 2023. “Where Is Inflation Persistence Coming\nFrom?” Liberty Street Economics, Federal Reserve Bank of New York, July 6.\nBall, Laurence, Daniel Leigh, and Prachi Mishra. 2022. “Understanding U.S. Inflation During the COVID\nEra.” Brookings Papers on Economic Activity (Fall), pp. 1–54.\nBengali, Leila, and Zoë Arnaut. 2024. “How Quickly Do Prices Respond to Monetary Policy?” FRBSF\nEconomic Letter 2024‐10 (April 8).\nBenigno, Pierpaolo, and Gauti B.

Daly, President and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of San Francisco\nUniversity of San Francisco School of Management Commencement\nSan Francisco, CA\nMay 17, 2024\n9:15 a.m. PT\nRemarks as prepared for delivery.\nThis speech is dedicated to Gene and Jane Wagner and everyone who ever helped someone find\ntheir way.\n\nThank you for your kind introduction. And thank you, Father Fitzgerald, for the invitation to\nspeak here today. It is truly my honor.\nNow before I begin, I want to ask, how many of you missed your high school graduation\nceremony because of the pandemic? Raise your hands.\nI see a lot of hands.\nSo, the very first thing I want you to do is to take a moment to really appreciate that you’re here\nnow, in person, celebrating what you have achieved. You are resilient, and we are so proud of\nyou.\nAnd to all the family, friends, faculty, and everyone else who helped make this day possible.\nThank you. You have done an amazing service for us all.\nToday, I’d like to share two stories. Actually, one story told two ways.\nHere is version 1.\nWhen I was 15, I dropped out of high school to help support my family. I had odd jobs, and my\ngoal was to be a bus driver, because it came with union wages and good benefits. But I got\n\n\flucky. I met a mentor, and she encouraged me to think bigger. To get a GED and go to college.\nSo, I did. I got a degree in economics and philosophy and went on to get a Ph.D. In 1996, I got a\njob as a staff economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco. Now, 28 years later, I’m\nstanding in front of you as President and CEO of that very institution.\nThat story is true. It’s meaningful. And it’s comfortable.\nIt’s also incomplete.\nSo, let me try again. And give you version 2.\nWhen I was 15, my family stumbled. My siblings moved in with my grandparents and I moved in\nwith friends. I left high school and got a job—three, actually. I drove a donut truck, worked at a\ndeli, and worked at a Target. I wanted to be a bus driver so I could have one job instead of\nthree.\nI was struggling.\nSo, a friend introduced me to a woman named Betsy. Betsy was kind and practical. She\nencouraged me to get a GED. As it turns out, you can’t be a bus driver without one.\nSo, I said yes.\nBut when I went to take the test, I was nervous, terrified really. I kept sweating on my test\npaper and breaking my pencil lead.\nAll I could think about was failing. Disappointing Betsy. Not being a bus driver. Not being\nanything close to a success.\nI wanted to quit, leave the test. Fortunately, I didn’t.\nNow, I’d like to tell you that with age and experience, fears of failing, disappointing, and\nchanging course go away. But that’s not how life works.\nAfter college, I went straight to graduate school, at the University of Illinois. I didn’t even think,\nI just went. I’d graduated at the top of my economics class and it seemed expected, natural.\nBut after a year, I felt unsure. Unsure if I wanted a Ph.D. Unsure if I wanted to be an economist.\nUnsure if I wanted to be a researcher.\nEvery day, I thought about changing. Switching programs, getting a job, doing anything\ndifferent than what I’d signed up for. Starting again.\nBut the stakes seemed high.\n2\n\n\fAfter all, the University of Illinois was Betsy’s alma mater. My undergraduate economics\nprofessors were so proud that I had followed in their footsteps to get a Ph.D. And my friends\nseemed confident, on track, and on their way to success.\nChanging my mind, changing course, felt weighty, irreversible, definitely like going backwards.\nBut I pivoted anyway.\nI moved to Chicago. I went to work for a theater and a dance company. I did accounting,\nbusiness, and even some prop and set design. I loved it.\nThen about a year into my new life, I realized it wasn’t perfect. I missed economics. I missed\nresearch and working with others to solve hard problems. I missed gathering evidence and\nevaluating it to inform policy. I missed everything. Because economics, as it turned out, was my\ncalling, my vocation. And I wanted to go back.\nBut that’s where things got really hard. I needed help. And I needed it from the very same\npeople, professors, who had helped me the first time.\nMy heart pounded as I dialed the phone. Gene Wagner, my undergraduate professor and\nmentor, answered. I immediately blurted out my news, stumbled through my explanation,\napologized, twice, and then I waited.\nI heard the rumbling of his voice before he shouted, and then it came: “Jane, come to the\nphone, Mary wants be an economist!”\nYou can imagine how I felt.\nNow, we spent the next hour talking, me, Gene, and his wife Jane. He told me that when he\nwas finding his path, he felt unsure too.\nHe never thought he could get a Ph.D. He worked construction, came from a working‐class\nfamily, and the whole idea felt foreign. But he loved being an economist, loved the direct\nconnection to people and to practice. Every day he went to work he felt joy, and he knew I\nwould feel the same.\nThat day, my professor, and someone I admired, told me version 2 of his story, and it changed\nme.\nThat’s why on this day, your graduation, I’m sharing version 2 of my story with you.\nTo tell you that I’ve been unsure, changed my mind, and thought I couldn’t do it.\n3\n\n\fBut I have done it. And so can you.\nThe truth is, no one gets to where they are smoothly. Everyone detours, doubts, and pivots.\nThat is human and part of finding your way.\nIt can be hard to know this when you are right in it. It can feel like friends are surging forward,\nand you are falling behind.\nBut that’s just noise.\nYour job, as you move forward in your journey, is to acknowledge the fears, and the\nuncertainty, and then listen.\nWe all have a voice inside of ourselves, telling us what’s next. The challenge is to hear it and\nthen be brave enough to follow its guidance.\nBecause in the end, there are no crooked paths, only your path. So, be yourself. Find your own\nway. And be proud of your version 2.\nThat’s the story, your story, that will change lives and change worlds.\nYou are ready. And we are all looking forward to what you will do.\nCongratulations, Class of 2024!\n\n4\n\n\f"

Before highlighting priorities for this week, I want to address\nthe unprecedented attack on Israel this past weekend by Iran and its proxies. Treasury will not\nhesitate to work with our allies to use our sanctions authority to continue disrupting the\nIranian regimeʼs malign and destabilizing activity.\n\nI. GLOB AL ECONOMIC OUT LOOK AND U.S. ECONOMIC\nPOLICY\nLet me now turn to the global economic outlook, which remains resilient. Global growth has\nconsistently exceeded the predictions of many forecasters and the IMF projects it will\ncontinue at 3.2 percent this year and 3.1 percent next year.\nGlobal economic performance has in part been powered by a strong U.S. economy. While even\none year ago, many forecasted much weaker U.S. economic performance, U.S. GDP growth is\nstrong and expectations have been revised upward since January. The labor market is also\nremarkably healthy. Inflation has come down significantly since its peak, though we have more\nwork to do. Weʼre also focused on building on our historically fast and inclusive recovery by\ninvesting for the medium- and long-term, including through President Bidenʼs Investing in\nAmerica agenda.\nWe of course recognize that the recovery has been uneven across and within many countries\nand that there remain risks to the global outlook. And from the start of the Administration,\nPresident Biden has made clear that American isolationism was over. So while we expect that\nAmericaʼs economic strength will continue to underpin global growth, weʼve also been\nengaging with the world to mitigate short-term risks and support sustainable long-term\ngrowth. Weʼll continue doing so this week.\n\nhttps://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy2255\n\n1/5\n\n\f4/17/2024\n\nII.\n\nRemarks by Secretary of the Treasury Janet L. Yellen at Press Conference Ahead of the 2024 Spring Meetings of the In…\n\nB ILAT ERAL ENGAGEMENTS\n\nAs Treasury Secretary, Iʼve focused on deepening economic ties with both our longstanding\nallies and partners and emerging markets. President Biden and I believe that promoting peace\nand prosperity abroad leads to stronger markets that can benefit American workers and firms\nthrough trade and investment. And deepening ties helps us build resilient supply chains—an\napproach Iʼve called friendshoring—which bolsters our nationʼs economic security and brings\nbenefits to other economies.\nThis week, Iʼll meet with South Korea and Japan for the first Trilateral Finance Ministers\nmeeting to coordinate on issues from sanctions to climate and financial resilience in the\nPacific Islands. Iʼll participate in a Trilateral Principal Level Exercise with the United Kingdom\nand European Banking Union to help fortify our systems for rapid coordination and\ncommunication during times of financial stress. And Iʼll continue working with Brazil on\npriorities for its G20 Presidency—as we worked with India last year and will work with South\nAfrica next year.\nIʼll also remain focused on our relationship with China. While in China last week, I emphasized\nthat a healthy U.S.-China economic relationship with a level playing field can bring significant\nbenefits for American firms and workers. And I raised concerns the United States shares with\nmany other countries about overcapacity, which poses risks to America and to the global\neconomy. The U.S. and China also announced that we are increasing cooperation in our shared\nwork against anti-money laundering; engaging in exchanges on balanced growth in the\ndomestic and global economies; and expanding ongoing technical exchanges on financial\nregulation and financial stability.\nWeʼll sustain momentum this week by holding in-person the fourth meetings of the\nEconomic and Financial Working Groups, which allow us to share information, identify\npotential areas of cooperation, and, when we disagree, frankly communicate concerns. These\nmeetings will include important discussions on anti-money laundering and balanced growth.\n\nIII.\n\nINT ERNAT IONAL F INANCIAL ARCHIT ECT URE\n\nAlongside bilateral engagements, weʼre focused this week on continuing our e orts to\nstrengthen the international financial architecture. Heightened vulnerabilities from challenges\nincluding climate change, pandemics, and fragility and conflict pose risks to global growth and\n\nhttps://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy2255\n\n2/5\n\n\f4/17/2024\n\nRemarks by Secretary of the Treasury Janet L. Yellen at Press Conference Ahead of the 2024 Spring Meetings of the In…\n\ndevelopment. No one country can tackle these issues alone, nor is bilateral action su icient,\nso weʼve pushed for decisive and coordinated action.\nSince I called for MDB evolution, World Bank President Ajay Banga and leaders across the\nMDB system have enabled significant progress toward building better, bigger, and more\ne ective MDBs that help uphold the rules-based international order and are positioned to\ndrive tangible impact. Weʼve generated nearly $250 billion in new lending capacity over the\nnext decade: $200 billion from responsibly stretching balance sheets and pursuing innovative\nmeasures and almost $50 billion from capital increases we successfully negotiated at the\nEuropean Bank for Reconstruction and Development and the Inter-American Development\nBank.\nLooking ahead, we hope to agree on a callable capital increase for the African Development\nBank next month. And weʼre focused on achieving a robust IDA replenishment that provides\ncrucial resources to the worldʼs poorest and most vulnerable countries, as well as on ongoing\nwork to incentivize projects with cross-border impacts, mobilize private capital, and bolster\nclimate financing. The MDBs invested nearly $100 billion in climate finance in 2022, of which\n$60 billion went to low- and middle-income countries. Weʼre now working with Brazil to\nfacilitate increased access to climate finance through a review of the climate finance\narchitecture.\nWeʼre also urging the MDBs to increase their focus on fragility and conflict, which can reverse\nhard-won development gains, undermine the impact of new investments, and have farranging spillover e ects such as increasing food insecurity. We see current challenges in Haiti,\nAfrica, the Middle East, and elsewhere, and know more needs to be done, as Iʼll discuss this\nweek with President Banga and leaders from IDA countries facing these challenges directly.\nAt the IMF, weʼre focused on further strengthening the institutionʼs ability to serve at the\ncenter of the global financial safety net and play a crucial crisis response function. The U.S.\nand other countries achieved a landmark 50 percent increase in IMF quota resources. At home,\nCongress authorized $21 billion in lending to the Poverty Reduction and Growth Trust, which\nis key to enabling low-income countries to restore macroeconomic stability and address debt\nsustainability risks, and extended our participation in the IMFʼs New Arrangements to Borrow\nthrough 2030, helping shore up a critical second line of defense in the IMFʼs resources. As we\nhead into Managing Director Kristalina Georgievaʼs second term, weʼll push for strong IMF\nprograms that incorporate robust policy conditionality to enable countries to restore stability\nand exit from IMF lending and weʼll seek greater collaboration across the IMF and MDBs.\nhttps://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy2255\n\n3/5\n\n\f4/17/2024\n\nRemarks by Secretary of the Treasury Janet L. Yellen at Press Conference Ahead of the 2024 Spring Meetings of the In…\n\nWe also continue to urge progress in particular debt restructuring cases, as weʼve achieved in\nZambia, and to advance general reforms through the Global Sovereign Debt Roundtable,\nwhich will meet this week. Many countries that are solvent are also facing increasing\nchallenges. In 2022, net inflows to developing countries dropped to their lowest level since\n2009. This means too much money flowing out in the form of debt service relative to how\nmuch finance is flowing in. We need to examine debt service where itʼs a binding constraint on\nnecessary investments related to climate and development; channel even more resources to\ncountries making reforms; and deploy all our tools in a coordinated way to support these\ncountries in making key investments.\n\nIV.\n\nONGOING CONF LICTS\n\nFinally, weʼre focused this week on advancing our work to protect human lives and the global\neconomy in the context of ongoing conflicts.\nAs Russiaʼs invasion of Ukraine continues in its third year, we remain committed to standing\nas part of a global coalition to support Ukraine and constrict Russiaʼs ability to wage its brutal\nwar. This is a humanitarian and moral imperative and also an economic one given the warʼs\nsignificant negative impacts on economies around the world. Iʼm glad that the IMF recently\na irmed Ukraineʼs strong performance on its program and is providing financing and expertise\nto support economic growth and a robust reform agenda. And I urge the U.S. House of\nRepresentatives to provide critical support for our allies, including Ukraine. We announced\nadditional sanctions on Russiaʼs National Payment Card System and on Russian regional\nfinancial institutions in February. And we are continuing to work with our international\npartners to unlock the economic value of immobilized Russian sovereign assets and ensure\nthat Russia pays for the damage it has caused.\nWeʼre also responding to challenges in the Middle East. The attack by Iran and its proxies\nunderscores the importance of Treasuryʼs work to use our economic tools to counter Iranʼs\nmalign activity. Weʼve targeted over 500 individuals and entities connected to terrorism and\nterrorist financing by the Iranian regime and its proxies since the start of the Administration,\nincluding targeting Iranʼs drone and missile programs and its financing of Hamas, the Houthis,\nHizballah, and Iraqi militia groups. From this weekendʼs attack to the Houthi attacks in the\nRed Sea, Iranʼs actions threaten the regionʼs stability and could cause economic spillovers.\nAs we continue to use economic tools, including against Hamas, we have emphasized\nTreasuryʼs humanitarian-related authorizations to ensure sanctions do not impede life-saving\nhttps://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy2255\n\n4/5\n\n\f4/17/2024\n\nRemarks by Secretary of the Treasury Janet L.

In Gaza, the entire population—over two million people—faces acute food insecurity and\nmost of the population has been displaced. It is incumbent on all of us here at these meetings\nto do everything in our power to end this su ering. Finally, to support stability in the West\nBank and Gaza, Israel, and the broader Middle East region, we are targeting perpetrators of\nextremist settler violence in the West Bank, working to ensure a functioning banking system\nthere, and supporting the IMF programs in Jordan and Egypt.\nWith that, Iʼll now take your questions.\n###\n\nhttps://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy2255\n\n5/5\n\n\f"

Yellen Ahead of\nMeeting with the U.S.-China Economic and Financial Working\nGroups\nApril 16, 2024\n\nAs Prepared for Delivery\nVice Minister Liao and Deputy Governor Xuan, thank you for joining us here in Washington. It is\na pleasure to host you, and to see you both so soon a er my recent trip to China.\nI am greatly appreciative of you, the Vice Premier, and the Premier for your warm welcomes in\nGuangzhou and Beijing.\nOver the past year, we have taken major steps to put the U.S.-China economic relationship on\nstronger footing.\nAt President Bidenʼs direction, I have focused on intensifying communication. Iʼve met with\nVice Premier He three times in the past ten months: last July in Beijing; in November in the San\nFrancisco Bay Area; and earlier this month in Guangzhou. And weʼve established the Economic\nand Financial Working Groups, which Iʼm very glad are holding their fourth meetings here in\nperson this week.\nThrough our discussions to date, the U.S. and China have made progress on areas of common\ninterest. This includes e orts to protect financial stability, combat money laundering, and\naddress climate change, including through climate finance. As the worldʼs two biggest\neconomies, we must lead in these areas for the benefit of our peoples and the world.\nWe have also had important discussions on areas where we disagree. While in Guangzhou and\nBeijing this month, I was able to have frank discussions with senior Chinese o icials regarding\nChinaʼs industrial policy practices and the negative spillovers that overcapacity can create for\nthe global economy. These are concerns I hear not only from American firms, but from many\nothers as well. And I continue to believe that addressing overcapacity and broader\nmacroeconomic imbalances can help Chinaʼs own economy.\nDuring my trip, Vice Premier He and I also agreed to two significant initiatives, which I believe\nwill let us continue advancing work on areas where our cooperation is necessary, and to\nhttps://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy2256\n\n1/2\n\n\f4/17/2024\n\nRemarks by Secretary of the Treasury Janet L.

This exchange allows us to continue to discuss and address a broad range\nof issues, including economic policies that can contribute to addressing domestic and\nexternal imbalances. We are also holding our first meeting of the Joint Treasury-PBOC\nCooperation and Exchange on Anti-Money Laundering, where the teams will discuss the\nregulation of virtual assets and beneficial ownership, among other issues.\nWeʼll continue to move both initiatives forward in the context of these Working Groups.\nAs we look to the months ahead, I look forward to advancing collaboration on shared goals\nand addressing misunderstandings. Despite the challenges that the U.S.-China relationship\nmay endure in the weeks and months ahead, President Biden and I are firmly committed to\nresponsibly managing this relationship. Our continued communication and shared work\nmatter for our people and for people around the world.\n###\n\nhttps://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy2256\n\n2/2\n\n\f"

Earlier this week in Guangzhou, Vice Premier He and\nI announced important steps that will contribute to addressing challenges in our economic\nrelationship—including making sure that our workers and firms compete on a level playing\nfield—as we also deepen cooperation on shared concerns like illicit finance.\nI look forward to building on this progress today by discussing areas both where we have\nshared interests and where we have di erences of opinion, in the spirit of continuing to\nresponsibly manage our relationship.\n###\n\nhttps://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy2233\n\n1/1\n\n\f"

Yellen at American\nChamber of Commerce Event in Guangzhou, the People’s\nRepublic of China\nApril 5, 2024\n\nAs Prepared for Delivery\nThank you to the American Chamber of Commerce for hosting this event. Iʼm glad to have this\nopportunity to speak to American businesses here in Guangzhou at the start of my visit.\nThis city holds a unique position in Chinese economic history. It was key to Chinese trade for\ncenturies, and in fact to the start of U.S.-China trade, with the first ship from the newly\nindependent United States docking at Guangzhou in 1784. Then Guangzhou was at the heart\nof the market-oriented reforms and industrial development that drove Chinaʼs tremendous\ngrowth. And it was a key stop on Deng Xiaopingʼs 1992 Southern Tour, when he renewed\nChinaʼs commitment to these reforms. Today, as all of you know well, Guangzhou remains the\ntop destination for foreign investment in China, including from Fortune Global 500 companies.\nItʼs a fitting place for me to emphasize the strong economic ties between the United States\nand China, and the benefits these ties can bring for both the U.S. and Chinese economies. Iʼd\nalso like to touch on concerns that Iʼve heard from American businesses, which I intend to\ndiscuss with my Chinese counterparts this week.\n\nA HEALT HY U.S.-CHINA ECONOMIC RELAT IONSHIP\nLet me start with the importance of the U.S.-China economic relationship.\nOne year ago, I laid out our Administrationʼs approach to China, outlining three key objectives.\nThe United States will pursue a healthy economic relationship with China. We will seek to\ncooperate with China on global challenges. And we will deploy our economic tools when\nneeded and in a narrowly targeted manner to protect our national security and that of our\nallies, as well as human rights.\nPresident Biden and I firmly reject the idea that the United States should decouple from\nChina. A full economic separation is neither practical nor desirable, as both the U.S. and China\nhttps://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy2227\n\n1/4\n\n\f4/5/2024\n\nRemarks by Secretary of the Treasury Janet L. Yellen at American Chamber of Commerce Event in Guangzhou, the Peo…\n\nhave a irmed in public statements following our high-level bilateral meetings.\nIndeed, Americaʼs economic strategy is centered around investing in our economic strength.\nOver the past three years, our Administrationʼs policies have helped drive a historic economic\nrecovery and laid the foundation for long-term economic growth. We are also deepening our\nties with allies and partners around the world, while continuing to pursue the broad swathe of\neconomic activities between the U.S. and China that can benefit both countries.\nOur conviction in the importance of a healthy economic relationship is rooted in an\nunderstanding of the roles that the United States and China play in the global economy.\nTogether, the U.S. and China represent 40 percent of global GDP. We have the worldʼs largest\nfinancial systems. Countries around the world watch both of our economies, but also our\ninteractions, as they are crucial to global growth.\nThe U.S. is Chinaʼs largest trading partner, and China is the United Statesʼ third-largest\ntrading partner, following Canada and Mexico. With a large and growing middle class, China\nrepresents a huge market for American manufacturers and other firms, including those\nrepresented in this room. Exports to China—from transportation equipment to integrated\ncircuits—support over 700,000 American jobs, and Chinese companies employ additional\nAmerican workers.\nPut simply, the U.S.-China bilateral economic relationship is among the most important in the\nworld. Responsibly managing it is essential.\nAt President Bidenʼs direction, weʼve taken steps over the last two years that have put the\nU.S.-China economic relationship on much surer footing. One of my key priorities has been to\nestablish resilient communication channels between the U.S. and China—which Iʼve done\nthrough engagements with my counterparts at home and in China. We launched and held\nregular meetings of the Economic and Financial Working Groups, bringing together policy\nteams from both our countries to discuss key aspects of our relationship, from monitoring\neconomic and financial risks to identifying and pursuing areas of potential cooperation. For\nareas where we disagree, communication helps prevent misunderstanding from leading to\nunintended escalation and allows us to frankly convey concerns.\n\nCONCERNS\nIt is in this spirt of continuing to move the U.S.-China relationship in a constructive direction\nthat Iʼd like to share my concerns about the business environment in China and the ability of\nhttps://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy2227\n\n2/4\n\n\f4/5/2024\n\nRemarks by Secretary of the Treasury Janet L. Yellen at American Chamber of Commerce Event in Guangzhou, the Peo…\n\nAmerican firms to compete on a level playing field.\nIʼve heard from many American business executives that operating in China can be challenging.\nI understand that the Chamberʼs recent survey found that one third of American firms in China\nreport experiencing unfair treatment compared to local competitors. Weʼve seen the PRC\npursue unfair economic practices, including imposing barriers to access for foreign firms and\ntaking coercive actions against American companies. I strongly believe that this doesnʼt only\nhurt these American firms: ending these unfair practices would benefit China by improving the\nbusiness climate here. I intend to raise these issues in meetings this week.\nI know that American businesses are also concerned about the impacts of Chinaʼs shi away\nfrom a market approach on the U.S. and global economy. Iʼm especially concerned about\novercapacity, which members of the Chamber identified as a concern in the Chamberʼs recent\nsurvey as well. Overcapacity isnʼt a new problem, but it has intensified, and weʼre seeing\nemerging risks in new sectors.\nSpecifically, direct and indirect government support is currently leading to production capacity\nthat significantly exceeds Chinaʼs domestic demand, as well as what the global market can\nbear. I understand these policies may be driven by domestic development objectives. But\novercapacity can lead to large volumes of exports at depressed prices. This can undercut the\nbusiness of American firms and workers, as well as of firms around the world, including in\nIndia and Mexico. And it can lead to overconcentration of supply chains, posing a risk to global\neconomic resilience. This will be a key topic in discussions with counterparts in the coming\ndays.\nOvercapacity also poses challenges for Chinese firms and industries and can impact Chinaʼs\nproductivity and growth. I believe addressing overcapacity—and more generally considering\nmarket-based reforms—is in Chinaʼs interest. As Iʼve said before, China is too large to export\nits way to rapid growth. And if policies are oriented only at generating supply and not also at\ngenerating demand, global spillovers will result.\nChinaʼs implementation of market reforms generated one of the most significant economic\nsuccess stories of our lifetimes, li ing hundreds of millions of people from poverty. Thereʼs\npotential for significant gains from reform now as well.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nhttps://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy2227\n\n3/4\n\n\f4/5/2024\n\nRemarks by Secretary of the Treasury Janet L. Yellen at American Chamber of Commerce Event in Guangzhou, the Peo…\n\nI see todayʼs event as an opportunity to deepen my understanding of whatʼs needed by\nhearing from you—American businesses—about the successes youʼve had and the challenges\nyou face.\nThroughout this week, I intend to communicate our commitment to a healthy U.S.-China\neconomic relationship. Iʼll also raise concerns—as part of further stabilizing the relationship\nand in order to realize greater benefits for the United States, for China, and for the global\neconomy.\nThe Biden Administrationʼs e orts over the past year to build a resilient foundation for the\nU.S.-China economic relationship have made the constructive exchanges I hope to have\npossible. As I said when I spoke at the U.S.-China Business Council in December, I am\nconvinced that the course we are charting is not just pragmatic. It will lead to building a\nhealthy economic relationship that benefits American firms and workers. And itʼs whatʼs\nrequired of the worldʼs two largest economies if we hope to achieve the best outcomes for\nour people and for people around the world.\nThank you for being here today, and I look forward to the discussion.\n###\n\nhttps://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy2227\n\n4/4\n\n\f"

Yellen at Suniva in Norcross, Georgia | U.S. Department of the Treasury\n\nU.S. DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY\nRemarks by Secretary of the Treasury Janet L. Yellen at Suniva in\nNorcross, Georgia\nMarch 27, 2024\n\nAs Prepared for Delivery\nThank you, Matt, for the introduction. Iʼm glad to be in Georgia today to visit Suniva.\nIʼd like to begin with the companyʼs story. Suniva opened its doors seventeen years ago, as\none of the very first solar cell manufacturers in North America. Over the next decade, it drew\non American tech and talent to grow and gain a toehold in a highly competitive market. But a\nflood of solar imports at artificially low prices due to heavy foreign government subsidies\nmade it too hard to compete, and Suniva filed for bankruptcy in 2017. It wasnʼt alone. Before\nthis Administration, solar companies across the United States were struggling. Between 2016\nand 2020, nearly 20 percent of solar manufacturing jobs were lost.\nNow, though there remain significant challenges, Inflation Reduction Act tax credits are\nhelping change the game. Suniva plans to restart manufacturing this spring, having secured\nover $100 million in financing. And just today, Suniva announced that it has concluded a threeyear sourcing contract that will lead to the first crystalline solar modules with U.S.-made solar\ncells.\nWhatʼs happening here is just one example of what I want to focus on today: how President\nBidenʼs economic agenda, including the Inflation Reduction Act, is lowering energy costs for\nAmerican consumers and powering growth in strategic industries, bolstering our countryʼs\neconomic security and creating economic opportunity as we accelerate toward our climate\ngoals. Iʼll also highlight the obstacles that weʼll have to navigate.\n\nI. PRESIDENT B IDENʼS ECONOMIC AGENDA\nLet me step back. Since the start of this Administration, President Biden and I have focused\non creating opportunity for the middle class in America. We believe that our countryʼs growth\nisnʼt meaningful if it doesnʼt improve the lives of middle-class Americans, including those\nwithout college degrees and in places that historically havenʼt attracted the investment they\ndeserve. And we believe middle-class Americans will continue to lead our countryʼs economic\nhttps://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy2214\n\n1/5\n\n\f3/28/2024\n\nRemarks by Secretary of the Treasury Janet L. Yellen at Suniva in Norcross, Georgia | U.S. Department of the Treasury\n\nfuture. As President Biden said in the State of the Union, when the middle class does well,\n“we all do well.”\nWe started with the American Rescue Plan, which helped drive a recovery that was both\nhistorically fast and fair. Today, GDP growth is strong, inflation has come down significantly,\nand the labor market is remarkably healthy. Of course, the President and I recognize that the\ncosts of key household expenses like energy and health care are still too high, so we remain\ncommitted to taking additional action to bring them down. This is our top economic priority.\nWeʼre also focused on driving growth and opportunity for the medium- and long-term. Our\nstrategy is to expand the economyʼs capacity to produce and create good jobs, including\nthrough strengthening high-growth industries. This strategy has shaped a trifecta of historic\nlegislation: the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, the CHIPS and Science Act, and the Inflation\nReduction Act. Itʼs the IRA—and its impact on economic security and opportunity—that Iʼll\nturn to now.\n\nII. T HE INF LAT ION REDUCT ION ACT AND HOUSEHOLD\nENERGY COSTS\nEnergy costs pose challenges for American families. In the a ermath of Russiaʼs invasion of\nUkraine, global oil prices skyrocketed, putting significant strain on pocketbooks. The\nAdministration released 180 million barrels from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve and\nimplemented a price cap on Russian oil. Record domestic oil and natural gas production also\nhelped address our immediate needs. We navigated the short-term crisis, but it was a\npowerful reminder that relying on oil and gas can be expensive and unpredictable. The burden\nfrom unexpected costs can be even greater for lower-income and middle-class families, for\nwhom energy accounts for a larger share of their monthly budgets.\nNow, our Administrationʼs tax credits are helping address these costs for the long-term. The\nlaw we passed makes it cheaper for families to install solar on their roo ops. It saves them\nmoney on the front end and then on household energy payments for years to come. You can\nuse credits when putting batteries in your garage to store the energy the panels produce. You\ncan use them when installing a heat pump, or energy-e icient windows, doors, insulation, and\nother improvements. And there are credits for home energy audits too—to help you\ndetermine where youʼll see the highest rate of return on those kinds of investments. Clean\nenergy and energy-e iciency investments donʼt just cut energy costs; they reduce month-tomonth fluctuations in price, bringing energy security to American households.\nhttps://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy2214\n\n2/5\n\n\f3/28/2024\n\nRemarks by Secretary of the Treasury Janet L. Yellen at Suniva in Norcross, Georgia | U.S. Department of the Treasury\n\nAnd as the physical and economic costs of climate change continue to mount each day, at\nhome in the U.S. and around the world, reaching a clean-energy future only becomes more and\nmore urgent. As families install roo op solar or use other credits to purchase electric vehicles,\nwe also move our country, household by household, toward this future. And because itʼs now\ncheaper to produce clean energy, production will increase and costs will drop over time,\nshrinking utility bills even more for American consumers.\nOur Administrationʼs work to lower costs doesnʼt end with energy. Weʼre pursuing wideranging e orts to give families more breathing room. The Presidentʼs Budget proposes\ncutting taxes for middle- and low-income Americans. And weʼre especially focused on health\ncare costs. The IRA extended the American Rescue Planʼs low premiums, capped the cost of\ninsulin at $35 for Medicare beneficiaries, and allows Medicare to negotiate prices for key\nprescription drugs. The President plans to do even more—for example, calling on Congress to\ncap out-of-pocket costs for prescription drugs for Americans with private insurance.\n\nIII. T HE INF LAT ION REDUCT ION ACT AND PRIVAT E\nSECTOR INVEST MENTS\nAlongside tax credits for households, the Inflation Reduction Act provides tax credits for\nproducing and investing in clean energy. These credits change the economics of clean energy\ninvestment across the United States—making it more profitable and more predictable to build\nfactories here at home. Thanks to the IRA, investing in clean energy is a good value\nproposition—today, and for the future.\nAs we see with Suniva, the private sector is responding. Companies have announced over $675\nbillion in clean energy and manufacturing investments since the start of this Administration.\nAnd companies arenʼt just investing; theyʼre innovating to stay ahead in this highly\ncompetitive global market.\nInvestments are already noticeably impacting energy production. In 2023, more than half of\nnew generation capacity added to the U.S. grid came from solar. This is the first time in 80\nyears that renewable energy comprised the majority of new capacity. It means greater energy\nsecurity and economic security. And itʼs a huge step forward on the path to achieving our\nclimate goals.\nAs companies invest across the United States, theyʼre also fostering economic opportunity.\nThe IRA provides additional tax credits to incentivize companies to pay prevailing wages, use\nregistered apprentices, and locate projects in low-income communities or energy\nhttps://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy2214\n\n3/5\n\n\f3/28/2024\n\nRemarks by Secretary of the Treasury Janet L. Yellen at Suniva in Norcross, Georgia | U.S. Department of the Treasury\n\ncommunities—places that have traditionally relied on industries like coal. Other parts of\nthe Biden Administrationʼs economic agenda, such as investments in workforce development\nenabled by the American Rescue Plan, are helping build pathways to these good opportunities.\nLast month, Treasury Deputy Secretary Wally Adeyemo and Senator Osso were in Cobb\nCounty, Georgia to see a new ARP-funded workforce development center. These programs\ntrain workers for the jobs of the future like those created by the CHIPS and Science Act and\nthe IRA.\nAs a result, the growth weʼre seeing in clean-energy technologies is happening across the\ncountry in places that havenʼt previously had much opportunity. Treasury analysis has shown\nthat the vast majority of announced clean-energy investments since the IRA was passed have\nbeen in counties where college graduation rates and median incomes are below the national\naverages. And greater amounts are being announced in energy communities, where\nopportunity has dwindled in recent decades.\nIʼve traveled to see these investments firsthand. This fall, I was in North Carolina, where\nLivent has expanded its U.S. lithium hydroxide manufacturing capacity by 50 percent, citing\nthe IRA as a key driver of its investments. Earlier this month, I traveled to Kentucky to see an\nAdvanced Nano Products facility that will be producing parts for EV batteries. This is part of\nthe EV battery belt emerging across the Midwest and South, thanks to IRA incentives and\nstate and local leadership. These investments mean new well-paying jobs, including as many\nas 5,000 at what will be one of the largest EV battery manufacturing facilities in the world in\nGlendale, Kentucky.\n\nIV. CHALLENGES\nIʼm optimistic about the progress weʼve made in spurring growth. But the Biden\nAdministration also recognizes that these investments are new. It will take e ort, ingenuity,\nand time for them to reach their full potential. Weʼre also keeping our eye on pressures abroad\nthat pose risks not only to America but also to the global economy. President Biden is\ncommitted to doing what we can to protect our industries from unfair competition.\nIn particular, I am concerned about global spillovers from the excess capacity that we are\nseeing in China. In the past, in industries like steel and aluminum, Chinese government support\nled to substantial overinvestment and excess capacity that Chinese firms looked to export\nabroad at depressed prices. This maintained production and employment in China but forced\n\nhttps://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy2214\n\n4/5\n\n\f3/28/2024\n\nRemarks by Secretary of the Treasury Janet L. Yellen at Suniva in Norcross, Georgia | U.S. Department of the Treasury\n\nindustry in the rest of the world to contract. Now, we see excess capacity building in “new”\nindustries like solar, EVs, and lithium-ion batteries.\nChinaʼs overcapacity distorts global prices and production patterns and hurts American firms\nand workers, as well as firms and workers around the world. Challenges for individual firms\ncan lead to concentrated supply chains, negatively impacting global economic resilience.\nThese are concerns that I increasingly hear from government counterparts in industrialized\ncountries and emerging markets, as well as from the business community globally.\nIt is important to the President and me that American firms and workers can compete on a\nlevel playing field. We have raised overcapacity in previous discussions with China and I plan to\nmake it a key issue in discussions during my next trip there. I will convey my belief that excess\ncapacity poses risks not only to American workers and firms and to the global economy, but\nalso to productivity and growth in the Chinese economy, as China itself acknowledged in its\nNational Peopleʼs Congress this month. And I will press my Chinese counterparts to take\nnecessary steps to address this issue.\n\nV. CONCLUSION\nAs we look ahead, American companies will be able to continue to take advantage of\nPresident Bidenʼs economic agenda to invest and help build our new economic future. Success\nis not preordained. American companies will have to put in hard work and innovate, and weʼll\nhave to navigate challenges to come. Weʼll need to work to ensure thereʼs a level playing field\non which companies around the world can compete.\nBut it was an American inventor who created the first solar cell in the 1880s. In the 1950s, Bell\nLaboratories created the silicon solar cell, changing the game again. With the IRA, weʼre\nbuilding on this history and ushering in a new stage of American innovation and\nmanufacturing to increase economic security, broaden economic opportunity, and achieve our\nclimate goals.\nThank you for having me here today.\n###\n\nhttps://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy2214\n\n5/5\n\n\f"

And our coalition has continued to advance our\ngoals of reducing Russia’s revenue while keeping Russian oil markets stable.\nAt the same time, we need to remain vigilant to ensure that Russia cannot acquire the sensitive\ngoods it needs to continue its war efforts. It is imperative that we work with our industry—and\nour financial sectors—to clamp down on these goods making their way to Russia. We need to\nenforce our sanctions and export controls at home while we close down transshipment through\npermissive third countries.\nAs Congress gathers for the President’s State of the Union address tonight, I once again urge\nSpeaker Johnson to swiftly to pass the Senate’s bipartisan national security supplemental to\nprovide Ukraine with vital military and economic assistance.\nAs the House continues to stall, Russia is gaining ground and Ukraine is being forced to ration\nammunition and supplies.\nLast week, we witnessed the courage of thousands of Russian people who stood up to Putin and\ntook to the streets to mourn the death of Alexei Navalny. The House must act and show the\nstrength of the U.S support for Ukraine in the face of Putin’s aggression.\n\n\fCongressional inaction is nothing short of a gift to Putin, Iran and other adversaries that stand\nagainst America and its allies.\nAs I’ve said before, U.S. direct budget support for Ukraine benefits from an unprecedented level\nof robust oversight and transparency—an issue of great importance to Congress and the\nAdministration—and additional support would be conditioned on Ukraine making essential\nreforms.\nI will end with this: our transatlantic bonds are stronger than ever. Our collective response to\nRussia’s aggression has demonstrated the strength of our coalition. The NATO Alliance is\nstronger and more united than it’s ever been and we are committed to working with Germany\nand Europe to advance our collective security and prosperity.\n###\n\n\f"

Daly\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of San Francisco\n\n2024 National lnteragency Community Reinvestment Conference\nPortland, OR\nMarch 6, 2024\n9:00AM PT\n\nRemarks as prepared for delivery.\n\nGood morning. Thank you, Laura for that kind introduction. And thank you to all of you in the\naudience who do such important work for families, communities, and the economy. It is my\ndistinct honor to be here and I look forward to our conversation.\n\nBut before we turn to our dialogue, I thought I would offer some opening remarks.\n\nNo matter where I go or who I talk to these days, I hear a similar refrain: \"housing, will it get\nbetter?\" Concerns span generations, geographies, income levels, and all races and\nethnicities.1 Indeed, according to a recent poll by the Cato Institute, 87 percent of Americans\nworry about the cost of housing, and nearly 70 percent worry their kids and grandkids won't\nb e able to buy a home.2\n\n1\n\nJoint Center for Housing Studies (2023, 2024).\n\n2 Ekins a nd\n\nGygi (2 022).\n\n1\n\n\f•\nAffordable housing shortages are not new. What's different today is how many people are\naffected-a large and growing number, more than at any other time in our living history.\n\nYou don't have to go too far to see this. As people regularly in the field, this is your day to day.\nIn our travels at the San Francisco Fed, we find it everywhere. In communities that have\nstruggled for decades, like urban centers and rural areas, to ones newer to the issues like\nBoise, Idaho, Solt Lake City, Phoenix, Los Vegas, the list goes on.\n\nThis culminates in the sentiment that housing is broken. That it's falling short of our collective\nexpectations, not only to provide shelter, but also to support growth, community, and an\neconomy that works for all.\n\nToday, I will discuss how we got here, and what it will take to change the equation. My\nmessage is clear: collective problems require collective efforts, and it will toke all of uscommunity development, nonprofits, government, and business-working together to achieve\ngreater access to housing.\n\nBut before I get started, let me remind you that the remarks I make today are mine and do not\nnecessarily reflect the views of anyone else in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nLONG-STANDING, WORSE NOW\n\nSo, why ore so many Americans worried about housing costs? The affordability data tell the\nstory. The figure (Figure l) shows median home values relative to median family income for the\npast six decades. This calculation allows us to track affordability without undue influence of\ninterest rotes or business cycles.\n\n2\n\n\f•\n3.5\nQ)\n\nE\n0\nu\n\nE\n\n3.0\n\n~\n[\nro\nu.\nC:\n\n\"'\n\n\"O\n\n2.5\n\nQ)\n\n:;:\nQ)\n\n:,\n\n~\nQ)\n\n2.0\n\nE\n0\n\nI\n\n1.5\n1960\n\n19'70\n\n1980\n\n1990\n\n20),J\n\n2010\n\n2020\n\nSou re~: :~n&Us and ACS\n\nFigure 1: Housing affordability over time\n\nBy this measure, housing has become increasingly more expensive. In 1960, the typical home\nwas worth about 1.7 times the median family's income.3 By 2022, that ratio had risen to well\nover three. Almost double. While the affordability gap has been accumulating for 50 years,\nit's widened considerably in the past 20.\n\nMany things contribute to this decline in affordability, but one key variable is supply. Again,\nthe data tell the story. The next figure (Figure 2) shows housing starts relative to the overall\npopulation.4 Focusing on the green line, which smooths through the year-to-year fluctuations\nin the series, housing supply has dropped precipitously since the 2008 financial crisis and now\nis near its recent historical low.5\n\n3 The\n\nsource for this figure is decennial Census data for 1960-2000 and American Community Survey (ACS) data for\n\n2010, 2020, and 2022. This plotted ratio of median home values relative to median family inco me provides a\nstraightforward measure of overall national home affordability. Th e plot shows that home affordability is th e worst\nit has been in at least 60 years.\n4\n\nSee Bernstein et al. (2021) for an earlier version of this figure and related analysis.\n\n3\n\n\f•\n1.4%\n\n,___ ___, ..--\n\n1.2%\n\n-\n\nI lousil\n\nstarts as a st-are of pop ation\n\n10 yea 11cvir£ average\n1%\n\n0_8%\n\nO.G%\n0.4%\n\n0%\n\n196,)\n\n1979\n\n1999\n\n1939\n\n2009\n\n2019\n\nSourc~: E~.

With so few homes available to meet demand, the value of\nhomes has soared.\n\nAnd this transmits through the economy. Limiting affordability not only fo r home buyers but for\nrenters as well. The latest data show that about half of all renter households are experiencing\na cost burden-spending more than 30 percent of their income o n rent and utilities, a notable\nincrease over previous years.6\n\nPutting these facts together, it's no wonder that so many Americans are talking a bo ut\nhousing.7\n\nEVERYONE'S PROBLEM\n\nBut this is not a proble m just for those who are looking for a home. Whether we know it or not,\nit affects our collective well-being. When people are stressed about their housing situatio n,\n\n5\n\nJoint Center for Housing Studies (2024).\n\n6\n\nEkins and Gygi (2022).\n\n4\n\n\f•\ntheir health and productivity suffer.8 It also affects their decision-making, about where to\nwork, reside, and how to participate in their community.9- 10\n\nThis point was brought home to me during a visit to Orange County, California. I was meeting\nwith a group of local restaurant owners. We were talking about the challenges of finding and\nkeeping workers. When I asked about housing, the room changed. Everyone had stories of\nloss. Loss of longtime employees who couldn't afford the ever-increasing commute distances,\nloss of interested applicants who departed when they found out the cost of housing, and loss\nof opportunities to serve their customers and grow their businesses due to lack of staff. To\nthem, housing was failing, and no one was winning.\n\nThis story is not unique. I am sure each of you has heard many. Together, they remind us that\nhousing is more than a basic need. It is an essential part of well-being, and w e ll-being is an\nessential part of a thriving community and a healthy economy.71 If we miss on something so\nfundamental, everyone feels it, and we are collectively worse off.\n\nGETTING OUR HOUSING IN ORDER\n\nSo, what should we do?\n\nAs I said, collective problems call for collective solutions. So, we will all have to participate.\n\nLet's first start with what the Fed can do.\n\n7 See\n\nSingh et al. (2019) regarding impacts of housing disadvantage on mental health, Pribesh and Downey (1999)\n\nregarding impact on schooling outcomes, and Collinson et a l. (2024) regard ing impacts of evictions.\n8 See\n\nBlumenberg and Siddiq (2023) regarding impact on commuting decisions, Plantiga et al. (2013) regarding\n\nimpact on location decisions.\n9\n\nSee https://www.frbsf.org/research-and-insights/blog/beyond-the-numbers/2022/10/13/beyond- the-numbers-\n\ninflation-concerns-persist-in- federal-reserves- twelfth-district/ for San Francisco Fed example;\nhttp://c levelandfed.org/publications/multimedia-storytellinq/storytelling-affordable-housinq fo r Cleveland Fed\nexample; https://fedcommunities.org/articles/housing/ for Federal Reserve System examples.\nl()See, for example, Ramakrishnan, et al. (2021).\n\n5\n\n\f•\nOne lever that we and other regulatory agencies have is the CRA, which has brought you all\ntogether this week. The CRA has played a significant role in driving investment into low- and\nmoderate-income communities,12 and it is an important tool for ongoing housing solutions.\n\nThe Federal Reserve also contributes through our core monetary policy responsibilities, to\ncreate a stable and healthy economy with price stability and full employment.13 These goals\nwere given to us by Congress and are the foundation of a sustainable economy that works for\nall.\n\nAs you know, we have been missing on our price stability mandate for the past two years.\nRising housing costs have been a key driver of these misses, boosting inflation and worsening\naffordability. 74 This burden has fallen especially harshly on those least able to afford it.15 That\nis why the Federal Reserve has been so focused and resolute on getting inflation down.\n\nOf course, I recognize that higher interest rates also raise housing costs. But these adjustments\nare temporary and needed to bring down inflation. History has taught us that price stability is\nthe single best mechanism to ensure sustainable growth. Without this condition, the economy,\nthe labor market, and the housing market all falter. That is why we are committed to finishing\nthe job.\n\nUltimately, however, the tools of the Fed are limited. We can create the economic conditions\nfor housing, but our efforts will not be sufficient to rebalance the housing equation. This will\nrequire other important players in the economy.\n\nFortunately, many have already taken up the charge. Governments, businesses, and\ncommunities are recognizing the problems, forging partnerships, and creating solutions. Often\ntaking on third rails of policy to do it.\n\n11\n\nAccording to Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (2023) data, CRA data from banks in 2022 reported\n\nmore than $150 billion in community development lending and nearly $284.6 billion in small b usiness lending. These\nfigures do not reflect all mortgages issued by banks subject to CRA to low- and moderate-income households.\n12\n\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed.htm\n\n13 House price\n\nindexes were growing at historically high rates but have since slowed with the increases in interest\n\nrates. See Kmetz, Louie, and Mondragon (2023).\n14\n\nJoint Center for Housing Studies (2024).\n\n6\n\n\f•\nToke governments. Many ore tackling longstanding barriers to development, like land use\nrules, zoning lows, and planning policies.76 The idea is to change t he way space is used, to\nallow for more housing, sometimes denser housing, and ultimately create greater affordability.\nStates as diverse as Oregon, Maine, and Utah and cities like Minneapolis are engaged in\nactivities like these.17\n\nBusinesses and business organizations are also actively working on housing, recognizing that\nto grow their businesses, employees need a secure place to live. In my home state of\nCalifornia, the Santa Rosa Metro Chamber of Commerce is partnering to finance the\nconstruction of more homes.18 And just down the road from here, in Donald, Oregon, GK\nMachine is building a housing development to support its manufacturing employees.\nImportantly, these efforts ore not limited to coastal states or urban centers. In Spencer,\nIndiana, a town of roughly 2,500 people, a medical d evice manufacturer is b uilding homes for\nemployees.19 The point is, challenges are everywhere, and businesses are rising to meet the\noccasion.\n\nFinally, there are communities, the ones you've been working with for decades. They're\nexpanding their partner networks and building alliances across a wide range of sectors\nincluding public, private, and nonprofit. With this new breadth of partners comes the potential\nfor new scale.\n\nWe're seeing this play out in places like Riverside County, California, where a largely\nagricultural community aims to build 10,000 new units of affordable housing over the next 10\n\n15\n\nAddressing these ba rriers allows for greater density and aims to promote greater affordability. See Terner Center\n\nfor Housing Innovation (2019) and Minot (2023) for local government examples of local land use policy refo rms. See\nManji et al. (2023) for a review of 144 state laws passed in 20 states over several decades to support housing\nproduction, whether by requiring jurisdictions to plan for new housing, setting state standards for local land use\nand planning policies, offering incentives to advance housing-related goals, and/or imposing penalties for fai ling\nto carry out housing -related obligations.\n16\n\nSee State of Moine (2022) regard ing Maine's 2022 legislation a nd Treskon et al. (2023) regarding O regon's 2019\n\nlegislation. See Liang, Stoveski, and Horowitz (2024) regard ing Minneapolis' la nd use reforms adopted in 2020. See\nManji et al. (2023) regarding Utah's 2019 legislation requiring cities to show how they will address moderate-income\nhousing needs in their General Plans. The law also allows the state to withhold funds from its t ransportation grant\nprograms if cities fail to do so.\n17\n\nis\n\nSanta Rosa Metro Chamber of Commerce (2021).\nLudden and Penaloza (2023).\n\n7\n\n\f•\nyears. They're doing this through partnerships with many players, importantly led by\ncommunity.20 Here in Portland, we already see an outcome of such efforts. Community\npartners joined forces to turn a blighted property with no future into a four-story, multifamily,\naffordable housing development.21 These are examples of collective efforts leading to\nsolutions that scale to the problem.\n\nI see the fact that governments, businesses, and communities ore joining with all of you as the\ntype of focus and scale we need to change the equation on housing. The problems have\ngotten bigger than any single action. And none of us will be as strong alone. Good work done\nindependently is good. Good work done together is great.\n\nHOME TRUTHS\n\nIn the end, what we are really talking about is not housing, it's home.\n\nThe dignity people deserve is a place to call their own and the freedom to choose it. When\nthese things are constrained, lives are affected.\n\nA few years back, I was driving from Boise, Idaho, to Twin Falls. I pulled into a highway gas\nstation and found myself in a conversation with a young couple moving across the state. They\nwere ready, but not excited. They told me they had to move. They were expecting a new\nbaby and could no longer afford to live where they had grown up. So, they were venturing\naway from home and family for more affordable housing.\n\nThey will likely make it. Forge a new path. But is this what we really want?\n\nThat's the conversation we need to have about housing.\n\n19\n\nIn Riverside County, California, the Lift to Rise Housing Catalyst Fund has started to bring together capital from\n\npublic, private, and nonprofit partners to create 10,000 additional units of affordable housing over the next four\nyears.\n20\n\nThe Las Adelitas project is the public investment in the Portland, Oregon, Cully community. In addition to units of\n\naffordable housing, th e d evelopment includes a community space and a new outdoor plaza.\n\n8\n\n\f•\nAnd you are the people to carry this forward.\n\nThank you.\n\n9\n\n\f•\nREFERENCES\n\nBernstein, Jared, Jeffery Zhang, Ryan Cummings, and Matthew Maury. 2021. \"Alleviating\nSupply Constraints in the Housing Market.\" Council of Economic Advisers blog, September 1.\nBlumenberg, Evelyn, and Fariba Siddiq. 2023. \"Commute Distance and Jobs-Housing Fit.\"\nTransportation 50 {June), pp. 869-891.\nCohen, Rachel M. 2024. \"What If Public Housing Were for Everyone?\" Vox, February 70.\nCollinson, Robert, John Eric Humphries, Nicholas Mader, Davin Reed, Daniel Tannenbaum, and\nWinnie van Dijk. 2024. \"Eviction and Poverty in American Cities.\" Quarterly Journal of\nEconomics 139(1, February), pp. 57-120.\nEkins, Emily, and Jordan Gygi. 2022. \"Survey Report: Coto Institute 2022 Housing Affordability\nNational Survey.\" December 14.\nFederal Financial Institutions Examination Council. 2023. \"Findings from Analysis of Nationwide\nSummary Statistics for 2022 Community Reinvestment Act Data Fact Sheet.\" Last modified\nDecember 20.\nJoint Center for Housing Studies. 2023.

Daly\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of San Francisco\nNational Association for Business Economics\nWashington, DC\nFebruary 16, 2024\n12:45 PM ET, 9:45 AM PT\nRemarks as prepared for delivery.\n\nThe day after the December Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting, just a few\nmonths back, a man came up to me in the dry cleaner. He told me that he and his wife had\ngone to dinner the night before, partly to celebrate the end of the Fed’s rate tightening cycle,\nbut mostly to mark the end of the long, hard battle to bring inflation down. He felt the worst\nwas behind us, and that he and his family could finally take a breath.\nThe relief he described is not unique. I hear it everywhere. Businesses, communities, and\nfamilies exhaling, just a bit, as they see inflation falling without the economy breaking.\nThere is no doubt things are better. But progress is not victory, and we, the FOMC, need to\ndeliver more than a few fleeting moments of relief.\nOur goals are sustainable price stability and full employment, working together in a balance\nthat will last. There is more work to do to deliver on that commitment.\nToday, I will discuss the progress we have made, the risks we face, and what we will need to\ndo to finish the job.\n\n1\n\n\fAs always, let me remind you that the views I express are my own and do not necessarily\nreflect those of anyone else in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nSignificant Progress\nSo, let’s start with progress. Relative to a year ago, the economy is in a very good place.\nInflation is heading down, the labor market is rebalancing, and many of the post-pandemic\ndisruptions are dissipating.\nThe inflation progress has been remarkable. In the latest personal consumption expenditures\n(PCE) inflation release, 1 prices were up just 2.6 percent compared to a year ago. Still not price\nstability, but a lot of improvement from its peak of 7.1 percent back in June of 2022.\nA big part of the story on inflation has been supply. Global production, warehousing, and\ndistribution networks have largely returned to normal. Bottlenecks, wait times, and price\npressures have followed. 2\nThese things aren’t surprising. They’ve just finally happened. And they’ve helped ease goods\nprice inflation substantially, bringing it back to near pre-pandemic levels.\nThe supply-side “surprise,” if you will, has been the positive news on labor and productivity.\nDefying all the pessimists, U.S. workers in the prime of their working age came back to work\nlast year, including women and mothers. This drove prime-age participation to its highest level\nin two decades. 3 At the same time, we saw a surge in immigration. 4 Both of these\ndevelopments boosted labor availability.\nBut we didn’t just have more workers, these workers also became more productive.\nProductivity growth picked up notably last year, surpassing its pre-pandemic trend. 5\nTogether, these supply developments eased labor market tightness and helped to bring wage\ninflation closer to a level consistent with our 2 percent inflation target. 6\nAs of December 2023.\nSee the New York Fed’s Global Supply Chain Pressure Index for the latest data, and Liu and Nguyen (2023) for\nanalysis.\n3\nSee, for example, Prabhakar and Valletta (2024). Labor force participation surged for prime-age workers through\nmid-2023, reaching a historical high for women and reattaining the pre-pandemic peak for men.\n4\nThe share of foreign-born people in the U.S. labor force reached a new high in 2022, at 18.1 percent (Bureau of\nLabor Statistics 2023).\n5\nProductivity growth in 2023 was 2.7 percent. By comparison, estimated trend productivity growth prior to the\npandemic was between 1 and 1¼ percent (Fernald and Li 2019).\n6\nThat level is estimated to be about 3½ percent. See, for example, Almuzara, Audoly, and Melcangi (2023).\n1\n\n2\n\n2\n\n\fBut perhaps the best news about the decline in inflation is that supply wasn’t the only story.\nImprovement also has come from a gradual slowing in demand, the portion that monetary\npolicy directly affects.\nWe hear this from our contacts and see it in surveys, but we can also quantify it using analysis\ndeveloped at the San Francisco Fed. 7 The researchers focus on the PCE index and separate\nindividual price changes into those driven by demand, where prices and quantities move in\nthe same direction, from those driven by supply, where prices and quantities move in opposite\ndirections. Their analysis shows that about two-thirds of the decline in core inflation in 2023\ncame from the demand side. Demand played less of a role for headline PCE, where supplies of\nfood and energy drive a lot of the inflation dynamic. 8\nPutting all of this together, it is clear that things changed in 2023. Supply bounced back, tighter\nmonetary policy gained traction, and inflation came down rapidly. For households and\nbusinesses, the treadmill of persistently high and rising inflation slowed down. All without a\nsignificant decline in growth or employment.\nThis is unequivocally good news, and real progress.\n\nMinding the Risks\nThe question is, should we expect it to continue. The modal outlook of many professional\nforecasters seems to say yes. 9 The median of the December FOMC Summary of Economic\nProjections portrayed a similar view. 10\nMost striking perhaps is the confidence that households, businesses, and markets show for\ncontinued progress on inflation. Among households, once elevated year-ahead inflation\nexpectations have fallen substantially and are now near pre-pandemic levels. 11 Business\ninflation expectations have also improved. According to the Atlanta Fed Inflation Project,\nbusinesses see prices in the coming year rising just slightly above 2 percent, about the norm for\nShapiro (2022a, b).\nFor the full analysis and regularly updated series see Supply- and Demand-Driven PCE Inflation. See also Shapiro\n(2022a, b). Similarly, Guerrieri et al. (2023) argue that the rise and fall of energy prices in both the United States and\nthe euro area played an important role in shaping observed inflation patterns after the pandemic.\n9\nSee, for example, the February 2024 Blue Chip Economic Indicators.\n10\nBoard of Governors (2023).\n11\nIn the Michigan survey, year-ahead inflation expectations eased to 2.9 percent in January, the lowest value since\nDecember 2020 and within the 2.3 to 3.0 percent range reported during the two years prior to the pandemic. In the\nNew York Fed’s Survey of Consumer Expectations, one-year inflation expectations were 3.0 percent in January,\nsimilar to their level in 2018 through early 2019.\n7\n\n8\n\n3\n\n\fthat series. 12 Financial markets have similar expectations—inflation around 2 percent at the\nend of the year. 13\nOf course, projections and expectations are just that: views about what we think will happen.\nWe need more time and data to be sure that they will be realized. And we need to monitor\nrisks that could get in the way, especially since uncertainty is so high.\nThere is a myriad of risks to consider, but I will focus on two: slower inflation progress and\nfragilities in the labor market.\nOn inflation, there is a risk that the positive supply developments we saw last year might be\nhard to sustain. Labor force participation for prime-age workers is close to historical highs,\nand with the labor market cooling and wage gains slowing, we might not see additional\noutsized contributions coming from this group.14 The large influx of foreign-born workers also\nmay slow, further limiting labor force growth. 15 I always bet on workers, but at this point, it is\nhard to predict, and it does pose a risk to further rapid reductions in inflation.\nThe same is true of productivity growth. It’s highly uncertain whether we will continue to see\nthe strong numbers of last year. There are many reasons to be optimistic, but productivity\ntrends are notoriously hard to forecast, and at this point, we just can’t be sure.\nAnd of course, we live in a dynamic world, and there are always new shocks, like disruptions in\nthe Red Sea and Panama Canal, to disrupt supply. I know this was a concern you mentioned in\nthe NABE survey. 16 Although not currently binding, these challenges may impair goods\ndistribution and push up costs in the future.\nOn the demand side, momentum remains a risk, especially among consumers. We’ve\nrepeatedly expected spending to slow, only to be wrong. Ongoing economic momentum that\noutstrips available supply remains a risk to the inflation outlook.\nBut slower progress on inflation is not the only risk we face. On the other side of our mandate,\nthe labor market could falter.\n\nSee the Atlanta Fed’s Business Inflation Expectations survey.\nBased on updated analysis from Mertens and Zhang (2023).\n14\nPrabhakar and Valletta (2024).\n15\nFor example, the Congressional Budget Office (2024) expects immigration flows to be little changed in 2024 and\nthen decline somewhat in 2025-26, returning to historic averages after that.\n16\nSee NABE Economic Policy Survey: February 2024.\n12\n\n13\n\n4\n\n\fLet me be clear. We do not see that right now. So far, labor market conditions have eased\nwithout a rise in unemployment. In technical terms, we’ve been sliding down the steep portion\nof the Beveridge curve, where changes in labor demand reduce vacancies without reducing\njobs and pushing up unemployment. 17 As the vacancy rate gets closer to its pre-pandemic\naverage, these favorable conditions could end, and the tradeoff between falling labor\ndemand and unemployment could be more stark.\nOf course, with employment growth as strong as it has been, this seems like a distant risk. But\ngiven the speed at which labor market pivots historically occur, it’s a risk we must keep in mind.\n\nFinishing the Job\nSo that’s the landscape. The economy is healthy. Price stability is within sight. But there is\nmore work to do.\nTo finish the job will take fortitude. We will need to resist the temptation to act quickly when\npatience is needed and be prepared to respond agilely as the economy evolves.\nThis is not a new situation for the Fed or any central bank. Uncertainty is a fact of life. The\neconomy rarely signals exactly where it is headed.\nThe constant in our changing environment is our goals. They are always sustainable price\nstability and full employment for a healthy economy.\nAnd these are more than just words, a fact I’m reminded of nearly every day.\nAfter the dry cleaner last December, I went to the hardware store. I was standing in line\nbehind a dad and his college-age daughter. When the total rang up, the dad asked the\ncashier why it was so high. Without hesitation, the cashier said, inflation—everything costs\nmore.\nAs the two walked out of the store, the daughter said, “I never heard about inflation before the\npandemic.” Her dad responded, “I hope you never do again.”\n\nFigura and Waller (2022) and Bok et al. (2022). Crust, Lansing, and Petrosky-Nadeau (2023) link analysis of the\nBeveridge curve to the Phillips curve tradeoff between unemployment and inflation, reinforcing the view that\ninflation can fall without a sharp increase in unemployment.\n\n17\n\n5\n\n\fThat is really what we are after. An economy unburdened by inflation, where people can step\noff the treadmill and make decisions about their lives and livelihoods without worrying about\nrapidly changing prices. We want price stability built to last.\nThank you.\n\n6\n\n\fReferences\nAlmuzara, Martin, Richard Audoly, and Davide Melcangi. 2023. “A Turning Point in Wage Growth?”\nLiberty Street Economics, Federal Reserve Bank of New York, February 23.\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. 2023. “Summary of Economic Projections.” December\n13.\nBok, Brandyn, Nicolas Petrosky-Nadeau, Robert G.

And we’re honored to have Mary Daly, the distinguished president and\nCEO of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco here to enlighten us on her\nexpertise. Alongside her is Daniel Enemark, the chief economist of SD PIC,\nengaging in a fireside chat about the future of our economy. In 2024, we stand at a\npivotal moment. Now is the time for business, government, and community leaders\nto unite, uplifting all San Diegans and constructing an equitable, resilient\nworkforce. Our focus is clear access to skills, jobs, and careers that promote selfsufficiency. Over the past six months, the San Diego Workforce Partnership has\nprioritized cultivating partnerships between employers, educators, and job\ntraining professionals, securing more than $9 million to invest in sustainable\nemployment opportunities for more than 30,000 San Diego residents that we\n\n\fserve annually. Yet over 200,000 residents still unemployed or walking the streets\nevery day. Our work is far from finished.\nWhen we support one another, our economy thrives, and San Diego succeeds.\nAnd I’m delighted to welcome Daniel Enemark and Mary Daly for a captivating\nconversation about the economic future that lies ahead. Your presence here\ntoday reflects the commitment needed to drive this change, and thank you very\nmuch for you being here. Let’s start this journey together toward a more\nprosperous San Diego for everyone, and as a representative from the Workforce\nPartnership, I appreciate all of you all as we move forward today.\nThank you.\nDaniel Enemark:\nThank you.\nMary Daly:\nThanks, Dan.\nDaniel:\nMary, thank you so much for being here.\nMove this.\nCan everybody hear me?\nAudience:\nYes.\nDaniel:\nI could go on and on about Mary Daly, but I’ll just say this. A year ago, Lauren and I\nwere talking and I said, “You know who my absolute dream guest for the 40th\nAnnual Economic Roundtable would be is Mary Daly.” And this feels like a dream\n\n\fcome true and I’m just so thrilled to be sitting here with you and having this\nopportunity to talk with you.\nMary:\nWell, thank you so much. That’s extremely flattering. I really appreciate it and I\nactually feel like, “Oh, wow, I’ve already accomplished part of my bucket list, make\na dream come true and it’s only January.” So, I’m already in.\nDaniel:\nChecked.\nMary:\nSo, I’m checked. I’m in good shape. Hopefully, the year goes well.\nDaniel:\nAll right. Let’s just jump into it.\nMary:\nSure, absolutely.\nDaniel:\nFirst, I’d love to hear and I think we’d all love to hear your outlook for the economy.\nWhat are the key takeaways from 2023? What’s your forecast for 2024?\nMary:\nAbsolutely. Let me start with 2023. Remember, we began the year last year with\nhigh inflation and a booming labor market, and we were tightening policy at a\nrapid clip, and the conversation then was, will the Fed’s tightening cycle fail and\ninflation will just completely never come back down or will we have a recession?\nThat was the context and the sentiment was pretty low, despite the fact that the\neconomy was booming. And I would go out and do CEO Roundtables, community\ntalks, and what I’d hear is it’s too frothy. It’s unsustainable. I had visuals given to me.\n\n\fOne gentleman said, “I feel like I’m riding a bike when I was a kid and I’ve lost the\npedals, those bikes where you lose the pedals and it’s just going down the hill and\nthere’s nothing you can do and you just hope for the best and hang on.”\nAnd then, another young man who I met at a local retail outlet, he was there with\nhis wife and two kids and they were on a Sunday shopping. And I’m asking him\nquestions, don’t identify what I do for a living, but I told him I was an economist\nand I’m interested in how people are experiencing the economy. And he said, “I\nfeel like I’m on a treadmill. I’m on a treadmill because I’m making more money than\nI’ve ever made. I’m working two or three jobs. I have no more hours in the day. And\nwhen I come here to buy groceries, there’s less and less in my cart and I’m\nspending more and more of my income.” And he said, “I can’t keep this up. I want to\ndo better. What can I do?” And I told this young man, which was a heartfelt\nrendering he was giving me about his life, I said, “I’m working on it. It’s going to take\nsome time. Keep at it.”\nNow, I don’t know what happened to that young man, but I do know what\nhappened to the economy. Throughout 2023, even with the banking stresses,\nwhich gave us another negative we had to work through, we end the year, ends\n’23 with inflation much, much lower. We’re not there yet and I’ll talk about that in a\nmoment, but it’s much, much lower in American families and businesses, and\ncommunities are feeling a relief from that high inflation stress. We also end it with\nthe economy starting to slow, so it looks like that froth is gone, and that froth being\ngone actually helps people feel like, “Okay. Now, I can get a foothold and I get a\nplan.”\nSo, now, where are we today in 2024 and where do I see us going? Well, I’m going\nto start with a couple of things. The economy is in a really good place. If you saw\nthe sentiment numbers, the confidence numbers this week that come from the\nvarious surveys, people feel better. There was last month a Vibecession. That was\nthe last thing I was hearing about. Kyla Scanlon taught me this. She’s an influencer,\na journalistic person who does a lot of TikTok and things and she tells me, “Oh, it’s\na Vibecession. People feel bad. The data are good. It’s a bad vibe.” That was six\nmonths ago, and I think, “Okay, I’m listening.” But now, I’m seeing sentiment data\nand confidence data be better.\n\n\fWhen I had a Business Roundtable here in San Diego this morning, what did I\nhear? Cautious optimism. I’m seeing an economy that is responding to monetary\npolicy and coming into balance and inflation coming down, but not falling off the\ncliff and making a worrisome situation, and that’s good. The second thing that I\nfeel is in a good place is policy. Policy is in a good place. We got policy rate\nadjusted so it can do its work. We see that it is having an influence. So, now, we’re\nin a great place in the following situation. We know that policy’s in a good place,\nthe economy’s in a good place, and we can start to be more patient to see what\nwe need as a Fed to do next.\nThe other thing that we can do is we can take a deep breath and we can say,\nwhat are the important work we need to do as communities, as people, as\nbusinesses to plan for our future? That’s the second thing I heard in the roundtable\nthis morning that I really wanted to share is that we had a lot of conversations\nabout things that we were going to do to build our future forward.\nWhen I was at CEO Roundtables last year, I only heard about inflation and how\nhard it was to hire anybody. Now I’m hearing, what about workforce housing?\nWhat about education? What about making our communities strong and vibrant\nand building an ecosystem? So, I’m optimistic by nature, but I always tether myself\nto evidence. I’m an evidence-based optimist, and I would say that the economy in\nthe situation looks brighter than it did at the beginning of last year. There is a lot of\nwork to do. There is no denying it, and I’m going to do my part at the Fed, but it’s a\nlot of work to do for all of us to really get to where we want to be, but we’re\nstarting from a better place for sure. I hope that helps.\nDaniel:\nThat helps a lot. For those who might not be familiar, President Daly, in addition to\nbeing president of the San Francisco Fed, is also one of 12 voting members of the\nFederal Open Market Committee, which arguably makes her one of the 12 most\ninfluential economic policymakers in the world. The FOMC kind of sets interest\nrates, so that has a huge impact on our economy. And you as part of that, have a\nkind of dual mandate, right? One is to keep inflation low and the other is to\nmaintain full employment or to keep unemployment low. When you look at the\n\n\fyear ahead, which one of those seems more daunting or which one seems more\nlike a risk, which clearly in 2023 your focus was inflation? What do you see when\nyou seeMary:\nThat’s a great question. You’re right. We have what we call the dual mandate. If\nyou follow the Fed, you’ve heard about the dual mandate, full employment, price\nstability. If you’re ever talking to people in your friends and family, we explain it this\nway, when people aren’t fed followers necessarily, is that everyone who wants a\njob can have one. That’s full employment. And the dollar in your pocket or your\nwallet holds its value. That’s price stability. So, for us last year, inflation was so far\nabove our target and the labor market was booming. As I said, firms were telling\nus they couldn’t find workers and workers were telling us they could have every\njob they wanted, so that was an economy where our only focus to achieve our\ngoals needed to be inflation. So, we had that in mind, vigilance and resolute\ncommitment to getting inflation down.\nAt this point with the economy in a good place, the risk is more balanced and the\npolicy in a good place, what’s happened is that dual mandate is back in a\ncollective lens, right? I’m looking at both because what I want to do is I want to\nmake sure that we deliver on low inflation, but do it without taking jobs by making\nthe unemployment rate rise. So, I would say that we’re balancing those goals at\nthis point. The risks to the economy are balanced and the risks to both sides of our\nmandate are balanced. So, we don’t want to loosen policy too quickly only to find\nthat inflation gets stuck way above target. That would be a miss. That would be a\nvery scarring miss. And we don’t want to try to get to two so quickly overnight just\nto get that squeezed out, that we end up having this big run-up in the\nunemployment rate, and then we’ve solved one problem for people. We’ve\nbrought inflation down, but we’ve given them another problem. We’ve taken their\njobs.\nThat is not a soft landing in case you’re wondering, and we want definitely to…\nJust in case you don’t know. But we definitely want… Because a soft landing is\nmore. I mean, the reason I used to spend so much time talking to people is\n\n\fbecause you really understand what a soft landing means. You have to look at the\neyes of people who want two things. You have to think of that gentleman I met in\nWalmart. Well, I shouldn’t have said that. That gentleman at the large retail outlet,\nyou have to think about that and you have to think about that gentleman. And if\nwe end up having an economy that delivers on 2% inflation and takes away jobs,\nwe haven’t made him any better off. In fact, maybe worse off. So, that’s the\ncommitment to the dual mandate, and I think both of those goals are in balance.\nDaniel:\nYeah. Speaking of the soft landing, that’s all we heard last year was are they going\nto achieve the soft landing? The window for a soft landing is getting narrower and\nnarrower. And then, all of a sudden, people are saying, “It’s immaculate\ndisinflation. You pulled it off. You did this incredibly. You did the impossible.” Do you\nfeel like you’ve achieved the soft landing or is there a continuing riskMary:\nNo. No. No. No. If anybody asks, the golden chalice is not yet ours, right? We do not\ndeclare victory. I think it’s very important, and I mean this with all seriousness,\nthere’s a cost to declaring victory too soon. There’s so many costs. But say that we\nsay there’s victory. Well, then what we could end up with is inflation getting stuck\nat 3.9%, which is what is just printed, right? That’s not price stability. 3.9% is not price\nstability. 2% is our target for price stability, so there’s a gap. That’s a 1.9 percentage\npoint gap. There’s a lot of work to do there. That doesn’t mean that we don’t have\nthe tools or not getting closer. We are definitely getting closer. Look at all the\nprogress we made last year. It just means we have to stick with it. We have to\ncontinue to work on it, and we have to do that in a different way than we did last\nyear because this year, we also have to keep our eyes on the labor market, which\nis starting to slow.\nSo, we have to calibrate very carefully to ensure that we continue to bring\ninflation down and we ensure that we do it as gently as we possibly can. So, I say\nthat the job is really one about calibration this year. What does it take? It takes\npatience. It takes gradualism. There’s this term used in monetary policy. Ben\nBernanke wrote a speech about it called Gradualism, and the gradualism just\n\n\fmeans you take the time to look. You’re facing a lot of uncertainty. You make sure\nyou really get a look at the data. You look at it. You study it. You do it twice, three\ntimes. And then, you take action. Because if you’re quick to act, you can actually\nmake mistakes, and mistakes aren’t just things that they’ll write about in history\nbooks. They’re things that affect people, their lives, and livelihoods.\nDaniel:\nYou mentioned that we haven’t yet achieved that 2% price stability or 2% inflation\nrate. What’s keeping it elevated right now? Why is it 3.9% versus 2%?\nMary:\nThat’s a great question and I love detailed questions like that. I’m an economist by\ntrade, so who doesn’t want to talk about the composition of inflation? Probably\nyou. Probably you. But I’m going to talk about it anyway. We’re going to make it\nfun. You can tell me. I’ll ask for a show of hands, is it really fun? Okay. Really, it’s\nactually very interesting and extraordinarily useful in the post pandemic\nmanagement of the high inflation. It’s quite a bit different than how it’s historically\nmeant. Pandemic comes as we all know, and it basically shuts down the economy,\nand when it shuts down the economy, it simply destroys supply chains across the\nglobe. It stymies demand, but then quickly, two things happen.\nFederal relief comes in and supports families who didn’t have incomes, and the\nrest of us who did have incomes because we kept our jobs, just went home and\nworked. And then, we masked up in piles of savings that we didn’t ordinarily have\nbecause we had nowhere to go. And we did drain off some of those savings by\ngoing online and spending an enormous amount of time buying things, physical\nthings, bicycles, stationary bikes, TVs, headphones. So, when we’re all fighting over\nthe TV, everybody has their own headphones. Zoom equipment. I mean, in my\nfamily, we bought a lot of stuff, as did every other American family. Right?\nEverybody bought a lot of stuff, and what was interesting is the switch of our\nspending as Americans. The pattern of our spending, it shifted quite dramatically\naway from services in two things, to goods. That is very unusual. Two-thirds of\nspending is on services and only a third on goods. That shifted half-and-half.\n\n\fOkay. So, then, what does that mean? Well, that means that demand for goods\nand things is growing rapidly while supply of things is completely faltered, and\nthat’s inflationary. So, goods price, inflation shot up. We’ve been used to computer\nprices falling, bicycle prices falling, TV prices falling, even car prices falling. Those\nthings all rose in price while all that was happening because that’s thing one. The\nsecond thing that happened… Huh?\nDaniel:\nThe microphone a little closer.\nMary:\nOh, sorry guys. Second thing that happened… I couldn’t tell. I have no idea what I’m\ndoing with the microphone. With the microphone. I’m very, very capable with\nmonetary policy. Just being clear. Okay. Back to it. So, goods price inflation rises\nrapidly. The second thing that happens is that, and this is really important, people\nwant bigger houses. They want a lot of housing. Now, they have money, so they go\nout and they’re buying houses hand over fist. Housing prices are going up, so that\nboosts housing price inflation and rental price inflation, as people move out of\ncities and they move into bigger areas where they feel like they have more\noutdoor space or just bigger environments because it’s the pandemic. So, that’s\nhappening.\nAnd then, the third thing that happens is that labor, people working, especially inperson settings, people are afraid. They don’t want to come to work and it’s\nchallenging, so all of those workers, many of them just simply leave the labor force.\nThey retire if they’re older. They simply leave and go home if they’re not. And that\nleaves a big hole in the labor force. That happens at the same time that demand\nfor lower wage workers has gone up because we have all these need for Amazon\ndrivers, and all the delivery services that we’re getting to our home, food delivery,\ngoods delivery.\nSo, this is just a big imbalance between demand and supply, and both of those\nthings in housing and in services other than housing, that completely boosts core\nservices inflation. So, then we end up with core services inflation high, core goods\n\n\finflation high, and an economy that is growing and there’s no sign of relief. So, we\nraise the interest rate, and what happens is while we’re raising the interest rate to\nget the demand side of this back in balance, the supply chains also recover. So,\nnow last year, what we had is goods price inflation came down largely because\nthe supply of goods started to come back through. Shipping improved. Factories\nopened. The supply chains recovered. Goods price inflation come down.\nAt the same time, demand for goods started to wane and people shifted back\nover to services, and what’s happening is more workers are coming to work now.\nWages have been rising. Tracks people into the labor market, and the Feds raised\ninterest rates. So, people are and just demand is in general slowing. So, right now,\ntwo things are happening. Goods price inflation’s coming down and services price\ninflation’s coming down, both for housing and also for these other services. And\nwhile others may call it an immaculate disinflation, I call it a purposeful march\ntowards the normalization that comes from the post pandemic supply chain\nrecovery and the normal way that Fed policy rates work. Raise interest rates.\nDemand slows.\nDaniel:\nNot quite as catchy of a name as immaculate disinflation.\nMary:\nWell, you’re a policymaker. If you look for a catchy name, you’re typically going to\nbe too narrow in your thinking and you’re going to be wrong, so I’ll leave that to\nthe media guys who dream those things up. But it is catchy, immaculate\ndisinflation. It just isn’t immaculate. It was purposeful.\nDaniel:\nYou wrote a great paper called The Economic Gains from Equity, and for the nerds\nin the audience, I encourage you to go read this paper. I’d love to hear from you,\nwhy should we care about racial equity and what can we do to address it?\nMary:\n\n\fLet me say that when gaps in groups, whether it’s race, ethnicity, gender, rural,\nurban, any location, you can look at gaps between people who are first\ngeneration college students and other college graduates, you can think of so\nmany places where there’s gaps in opportunity. Why does that matter? Because\ntalent is distributed evenly across the population, in all likelihood. Why wouldn’t it\nbe, right? And if talent’s evenly distributed and you see gaps in opportunity, that\nmeans we’re maybe missing the best coder ever to walk the earth, that might be\nliving in rural Idaho and we don’t even know that person’s there because they\nhave never been given an opportunity to touch a keyboard or to give it a try.\nSo, the concept of equity, the gains from equity is that we’re leaving talent on the\ntable. When opportunities aren’t even, talent is regularly left on the table and we\ncan’t afford that. We’re a nation that needs growing in higher quality labor force.\nWe need to increase productivity to ensure that the pie for the next generation,\nthe economic pie, is larger than the one we inherited. So, the point of writing that\npaper is to say, closing these gaps is not simply about fairness. Closing those gaps\nis about the economic well-being of our society, and that is something that is easy\nI think for all of us to commit to. We need to do that. It’s our responsibility to the\nnext generation.\nDaniel:\nYeah, I appreciate that. By manyMary:\nThank you.\nDaniel:\nBy many traditional measures, GDP and unemployment, the economy is doing\nwell. You talked about vibe earlier, right? There’s still a sense among many people,\nthough maybe consumer sentiment is improving. There’s still a sense among many\nof us that the economy doesn’t work for all of us. Housing and childcare\nunaffordable. Middle class jobs are often inaccessible without a very expensive\ncollege education. How do you reconcile those two views of the economy? Is the\neconomy booming? Is the economy busting? What’s-\n\n\fMary:\nSure. One thing that I think I find helpful, and when you talked with people and\nyou dig in, you can see this. Last year, it didn’t feel like it was working anywhere.\nRight? Even in the basic thing like my gentleman who was at the retail outlet, he’s\nworking his jobs. He’s making better money, and he still doesn’t get to do what he\nwants to do, and he still feels like he’s on that treadmill. Right now, I do feel like\npeople are stepping off the treadmill a little bit and just as they walk, they gain\nground. They’re not on that treadmill, but it doesn’t mean… That’s what we call the\ncyclical part of the economy. Right. Cyclically, we’re getting at a better place. The\ninflation rate’s coming down. Things are getting better. We’re better off.\nWhat’s still hard though is we face these structural things about how the economy\nworks that needs treatment, and we spent a lot of time at the roundtable that I\nhad this morning with business leaders talking about things like how do we create\nan ecosystem? These are things that business leaders brought up to me, the\necosystem that says, “Okay, I can offer a job. I can offer training. Where’s the\nworkforce housing that makes that equation complete?” So, if my hiring barrier\nisn’t how much I can pay or is a worker skilled, it’s can they afford to live near the\nplace that I’m offering the work? Well, then that’s a barrier that will take a public,\nprivate community partnership to create the bright ecosystem.\nThose are challenges that we haven’t had to… Well, they were there before the\npandemic, but now, the pandemic and the post pandemic recovery has put a\nbright spotlight on them, and that’s not something that’s just here in San Diego.\nThat’s anywhere you go, in the 12th district. I have nine states in the Western United\nStates, and I travel across the world and across the United States. I see the same\nproblems in same places. Communities everywhere are struggling with how do we\nmake sure we have enough housing for our populations? How do we make sure\nthat housing is at price points where various parts of the workforce can afford it?\nHow do we get the right skills to the right places?\nThe reason I focus so… Well, these are the jobs I have. I have one tool, the interest\nrate, and I have two responsibilities, full employment and price stability. It’s a\nnarrow lane, but it’s an important lane. The reason it’s so important is that none of\n\n\fthose things you just mentioned and we just talked about that solve people’s\nfeeling the economy doesn’t work for them, are even on the radar when inflation’s\n7%, that just aren’t even talked about. They get swept aside while people\nfrantically try to keep up. Now, as inflation’s coming down, we can start to bring\nthose things back to the forefront, and I can turn the job then back to you all who\nare working in localities and communities and states, and our fiscal agent, folks in\nCongress, and state legislatures to really take on this other work, which is we’re\nthrough the pandemic. The worst of the inflation surges behind us. Okay. Now,\nwhat do we do next?\nDaniel:\nSpeaking of what we can do next and what we can do locally, as Chairwoman\nVargas mentioned, San Diego’s really big. It’s the fifth-largest county in America. 1%\nexactly of all Americans live here in San Diego County and it’s incredibly diverse.\nWhat can we do here to make our economy stronger, more resilient, more\nequitable? What can policymakers, businesses, educational institutions,\nnonprofits, what can we all do locally to improve our economy?\nMary:\nOne thing that I see and I see this all over when I travel the district, is just what\nwe’re doing here. Come together. Talk. Learn from each other. You have an\nopportunity to meet people who don’t work in your industry or business because\nultimately, what I see in any of the successful communities that solve problems is\nyou get right to the heart. It takes partnerships. It is very challenging for the\ngovernment alone to do something, whether it’s the local state or federal\ngovernment or just businesses alone to do something or community groups alone\nto do something. You have to build these partnerships and say, “Collectively, what\ndo we do?”\nThe second thing that I think is really important, and I learned this in my own\norganization, I have a lot of ideas. I’ve stopped saying I have a lot of good ideas. I\njust say, I have a lot of ideas about what we can do. But what really important is\nyou have to pick two or three to all swim in the same direction to say, “Okay, what\nare we going to accomplish?” And I think we probably don’t do enough of that in\n\n\four communities to say, “Oh, we have all these leaders here. What two or three\nthings are we going to put all of our weight behind collectively because they’re\nthe most pressing things to do?” Those are just some basic things.\nI will say this though, and I told you this when we were having a chat before this\nevent, I live in Oakland, California. I love Oakland, California. I moved there in 1996,\nand I’ll be honest with you, I came from Missouri. Missouri’s great, but I walked into\nOakland and I turned to my wife and I said, “Oh, my gosh, I’m home.” Why did I love\nit? I loved it because it’s diverse. It’s vibrant. You can meet different kinds of people,\net cetera, and they have one thing in common. They love Oakland, and their love\nof Oakland means they’re going to try. Now, we get a beating in the press and\nsome of it is probably relevant and deserved, but I still love it. But when I want to\nthink about how to make Oakland better, you know where I come? San Diego.\nI’m not kidding. I come to San Diego and I meet with people who are doing\nworkforce housing, or I met with someone who’s working with the criminal justice\nsystem in there for my Zip Code Economies podcast to move people as they move\nout of incarceration into jobs. And I said, “How do we do that? How do we think\nabout that?” So, I talk to people here in San Diego because you do have that same\nthing. You have that thing where people who live in San Diego are proud to live in\nSan Diego. You recognize all the problems you have and you want to make it\nbetter. You did it, guys. I mean, you’re proud, right? So, I think capitalize on that. Put\nyour things together.\nOne of the things we’re thinking about in the Fed and one of the powers we have\nis to convene, and our community development group and our regional executives\nthat have a footprint all over the nine Western states, we’re meeting people like\nyou all over Salt Lake City, Boise, Idaho, outside of Portland. And everybody’s\nthinking about the same problems, but we can convene all of you to share with\neach other how you’re thinking about things and learning. The lessons are going\nto be the same. Align on some strategic goals and do partnerships with public,\nprivate, and community to really get the job done. So, thank you.\nDaniel:\n\n\fYou mentioned your podcast, Zip Code Economies, which I encourage everybody,\nget out your phone now and subscribe to. If you think I can’t subscribe to a\npodcast by an economist, it’s too arcane, that’s not the way it is. One of the thingsMary:\nThat is how people think about it though, until you saw it.\nDaniel:\nI’m sure that people are afraid, but it really is very accessible. There is one great\nepisode where you interviewed two twins who worked with Reality Changers\nhere inMary:\nYes, here in San Diego.\nDaniel:\nYeah. Cheers for Reality Changers. Yeah. It’s a wonderful podcast. I encourage\npeople to listen to it. You also mentioned having two or three ideas, and back in\nthe green room, you mentioned that you had two or three messages for your\ncolleagues, and I wonder if you could share them with this audience.\nMary:\nWhat happened is every year, we bring in our new board members. We have\nboards of directors in all of our offices. The San Francisco Fed has a head office in\nSan Francisco, a branch office in LA, a branch office in Salt Lake, a branch office in\nPortland, and a branch office in Seattle. That was original from 1913, to ensure that\nwe have these nine Western states, so we have to cover a vast territory. The Salt\nLake branch covers Idaho and parts of Nevada and Arizona, and then LA covers\nthe Nevada and Arizona, and all these different groups are linked together, and\nwe have a Hawaii and Alaska. So, we have then these board of directors\nmembers, and then we also have councils. We have an economic advisory\ncouncil, a community advisory council, and a community depository institution\nadvisory council, which we never say that whole word. We always say CDIAC.\n\n\fAnyway, these folks, these new members all came to the bank this week,\nWednesday and Thursday, and all of our board and council members, the whole\nfull teams came and we introduced them to what we do at the Fed and why their\nservice to us is so important. And I said, “You’re going to hear a lot of things over\nthe next two days, but I want you to remember three things. There’s only three\nthings that are really important when you start your service.” And I think these are\nthree things that I want all of you to remember about what the Fed is like.\nThe first thing is that the economy is about people. We are not simply looking at\nthe data and aggregate numbers and calculating models and looking at\nempirical work. We have that. We absolutely use that, but the thing that you\nalways have to go back to is that the economy is about people and you have to\nbe out talking to people, business leaders, worker groups, community groups, civic\nleaders, if you’re going to understand the lived economy. That’s why I spend time\nat retail outlets asking people questions. While it’s a small data collection project\nthat I do, it actually gives me the lived experience of the people, and that’s why\nyou have teams of people working at the San Francisco Fed who are about\ncollecting this qualitative information that makes such a difference in how we can\ndo our best work.\nThe second thing to remember is the data are plural. Data is not a point. It’s not six\npoints. It is plural, and it’s really like a pointillistic painting. If you think about a\npainting that’s pointillistic if you’ve never seen one, it’s a million dots that make a\npicture that if you back weirdly far away from it, you see only as a painting, but\nwhen you get up close, you realize that painting is made of all those little dots. And\nthe artist had the patience and fortitude and persistence to ensure that all of the\ndots were made well, lined up, and gave the painting the depth that it has when\nyou look at it from afar. The discipline that we need if we work at the Fed is to\nremember, the economy and those data points, that’s a pointillistic painting. And if\nwe miss whole swaths of dot because we think we got it from afar, we will miss\nincluding lenses and voices that matter to us.\nThat brings me to the third thing that’s important. Every voice, every lens, every\nperspective matters, everyone. So, we need to be making sure that we’re out there\ntalking to people. I spend time in Alaska, Hawaii, rural Idaho, San Diego,\n\n\fdowntown Oakland, East Palo Alto. Every state in the district, we are going and\nwe’re going to not just a community, not the fly-in city, but the communities that\nalso make up the fabric of those locations.\nMy colleagues and the beauty of their Federal Reserve system in 1913 is that the\npeople who put this together, they put a group in Washington, the Board of\nGovernors, and then they recognized the importance of knowing information from\nthe communities that were meant to serve, and they said, “We’re going to have 12\nregional Feds and those regional Fed presidents and their teams, apart from their\ndaily responsibilities to do payments and banking and monetary policy, we’re\ngoing to have them out there actually collecting information from the very people\nwho are affected by our policies.” And that has been a durable and important\ncomponent of what the Federal Reserve banks do, and it’s one of the reasons I\nlove my job so much because ultimately, you only make good policy if you’re out\nthere. So, the economy is about people. Data are plural. Every voice, every lens,\nevery perspective matters. You guys are so kind.\nDaniel:\nYou and I are similar in that when we go shopping, we pester people with\nquestions. I do that too. In fact, every restaurant I’ve been to recently, particularly\nfast casual places, I always ask, “Hey, do you mind me asking, what’s the starting\nsalary here?” And the dollars number I always get is $16 and something cents. So,\nthat’s within a dollar of minimum wage. We have this $20 minimum wage in fast\nfood coming, a $25 minimum wage, which you heard about in the Business\nRoundtable this morning for healthcare workers. Have you thought at all about\nwhat kind of impact do you expect that to have? Is that going to contribute to\ninflation here in California? Is it going to reduce overall employment? Do you have\nany thoughts?\nMary:\nThis has been a long, long studied economic topic, and the minimum wages has\nbeen long thought about by economists, and not just policymakers. The\neconomists are trying to figure out what the impact of the minimum wage is. It\nreally depends, when the minimum wage is raised, who it’s raised for, whether the\n\n\fcommunities or the firms can bear it, et cetera. So, I think there is no clear definitive\nanswer about whether it reduces employment or changes inflation. I don’t think\nthere’s definitiveness there. And there’s a big debate about whether it’s better or\nnot as good as just putting an earned income tax credit on. So, if you get to the\neconomics of it, you don’t get a compelling answer.\nThe minimum wage, and I’ll just say it, is a social tool. For most of us, it’s about not\nfinding it very comfortable to think that people work a full-time job and can’t\nafford to buy the gas to get there or feed their families. That’s what ultimately we\nhave to decide as societies. The Fed doesn’t play a role in that. It’s just what we\nhave to decide as societies. What can we bear? And then, what firms have to do\nis decide, okay, at that price point, do I need to hire fewer workers and invest in\nmore technology? Do I need to change the equation? Do I need to hire different\npeople?\nUltimately, those things will work themselves out, but if you look to the economics\nto compel you on the minimum wage, you would find that there’s just a range of\nviews and a range of findings and it depends on what year you studied it. If you\nlook at the reasons people often vote for the minimum wage or in the surveys,\nwhat people say about the minimum wage, it really is that they find it\nextraordinarily uncomfortable to repeatedly be confronted with the fact that\npeople who are doing their jobs and doing everything the way they should\ncannot afford the basic things of living, transportation, housing, and food. And\nthat’s just hard.\nDaniel:\nYeah. Thanks. For those of us who don’t get to go to the Federal Open Market\nCommittee and cast a vote, could you tell us a little bit about how that decisionmaking works? You said something that was kind of surprising when we were\nmeeting with the students earlier.\nMary:\nSure. Sure. It feels like it’s all behind the scenes, right? Because the meetings are\nclosed door. So, let me tell you the things I can. They’re all confidential, so I can’t\n\n\fshare the details of what we do, but I can share the thing that I think was so\nmeaningful to me. The first time I went to the FOMC, I went as a staff person. You’re\nonly allowed a limited staff too as people know. But what is really remarkable, and\nI think it’s one of the reasons, one of the main reasons I love the Fed so much is the\nindependence that we have given to us by Congress is cherished and closely built,\nright? We build it, and the way we build it, there are many ways we build it. There\nare many ways we earn it. It’s basically the right to be independent. The\nimportance of being independent.\nOne of those ways is the FOMC is a big room, and all of us live in society. So, every\nFOMC participant lives in society, lives in their communities. When we cross a\ndoor… It’s much like that door. You open big double doors. You cross a threshold.\nAnd once people cross that threshold, there is never a mention, not one of politics\nof issues that would be politicized. What we talk about is the economy, our goals,\nour mandated goals of full employment, price stability, what we need to do, and\nwe fiercely debate and discuss with big differences in how people see things.\nOne, from the way they bring the information and where their communities are.\nAnd then, we come to a collective decision. So, it really is exactly what you would\nhope for if you were an American, is people are doing the job they were asked to\ndo without the noise of thinking about politics or any other thing that they have on\ntheir minds. And I think that’s a really cool thing.\nThe thing that I told you that is really important is I’ve come on as a voting member\nthis year, and while that is true, I’m a voting member, reserve bank presidents\nrotate, that’s actually not meaningful from the way the FOMC works. The 12\nreserve bank presidents rotate their voting, but every one of us is as meaningful as\na voter or not a voter. It doesn’t matter. We build our influence and our reputation\nbased on evidence, what we bring to the table, how we reason the arguments.\nAnd what that tells you ultimately is that the FOMC is a construct where the best\nidea wins. Right? And the best idea is the product of the collective membership\ndebating, discussing, and deciding what are we going to do for the American\npeople.\nAt the front of our bank in San Francisco at the head office, we have a sign. They\nput it up the day I became president. It’s like a touchstone. That’s why I keep\n\n\fputting my hand up. It says, “Our work serves every American and countless global\ncitizens.” And when the FOMC comes in, I feel like we have that touchstone, even\nthough it’s not there. They have Latin words on the wall. But it really is our work\nserves every American and countless global citizens, and we take that\nresponsibility very seriously, and that’s how we do our business, voting or not.\nDaniel:\nI love that. I am going to be looking at some of the questions that have come in, so\nwhen I look at my phone, don’t think that I’m ignoring you.\nMary:\nI won’t.\nDaniel:\nBut the last question I’ll ask you is whether you could talk about your personal\nprocess for decision-making and particularly those three points.\nMary:\nI can. Yes. Okay. I was saying to the students since… By the way, Rick said it. I’ll just\ngive a big pitch for this. I met some students here this morning. I did the Business\nRoundtable, and then I went to meet with students. Boy, we are lucky because\nthese students, they were impressive. They asked thoughtful questions, very well\nconsidered, just in dialogue. The thing I always like when I meet young people is\nthat I see the hope in their eyes, but what I love even more is when I see the hope\nin the practice, when they have the idealism and the hope, but they put it with the\nskills and the wherewithal and the thought process and asking hard questions\nand challenging. So, if you ever need inspiration, just ask for a meeting with 10 or 15\nstudents here or anywhere probably, but definitely here, and you’ll see what I saw.\nI walked away feeling terrific. But one of the students asked me about how do I\nthink about things? How do I think about policy? And the very first day I became\npresident, I was giving a town hall for the bank, and someone asked me, “Well,\nhow are you going to make policy? That’s really hard.” And I said, “Well…” I have\n\n\fstickers now. I don’t even know if I have any more with me, but I made them into\nstickers because I want everybody to know this is a life thing you could use too.\nBut here’s how I make policy. I’m voraciously curious. I mean, voraciously curious. I\nwant to look at everything, talk to anybody I can, look at the models, read history,\nput it together, figure it out.\nWhen I get to the meeting, I’m confident about the decision I’ve made because\none, it’s so important, I better be thoughtful and confident, but also because I’ve\ndone all the homework. And then, the day I make the decision, I’m humble about\nwhat have I missed, what can I learn tomorrow, and I go back to voraciously\ncurious. And this virtuous cycle of be curious, be confident, be humble is how I\nmake policy, and that’s what I put on the sticker. When I told the students, I said,\n“No matter where you go, if you use those three things, you’re going to be\nsuccessful.”\nDaniel:\nI love that. We’re going to go on to some questions from the audience.\nMary:\nOh, terrific. I love audience questions.\nDaniel:\nOne of the first questions is 2024 may be a critical year for the commercial\nproperty market. To what extent will this affect regional and local economies and\nbanks?\nMary:\nSure. That’s a terrific question, certainly on the mind of many, many people. It is\ntrue, just for those who don’t follow commercial real estate markets, that\ncommercial real estate, much of it is repricing, refinancing this year because when\nleasers, owners, et cetera, found that the interest rates were going to rise, they\nlocked in low interest rates, but many commercial interest rates for commercial\nproperties are on three-year cycles. So, now, the refinancing is coming and you\n\n\fhave to redo it, so you redo it, but now you’re at higher interest rates. So, if you hear\npeople say they’re reckoning, that’s the reckoning, right? That’ll be this reckoning.\nNow, that is going to be something that has to be gone through, so what can you\nsay in the back of your mind to say, “Okay, how bad will that be”? Well, let me offer\nsome things. Commercial real estate is a big word that covers a lot of diverse\nsectors. Not all commercial real estate is the same. You can break it into multifamily\nhousing, warehouse, and storage space, and office space, but even office space\nhas to be broken down into city office space, which is where a lot of the workers\nleft, and suburban office space, which is doctors, lawyers, title insurance\ncompanies, you name it. They’re fully in person, so they’re still there. So, that space\nin the suburbs and in places where you’re really filling it with those kinds of inperson service providers, that’s not at risk. And industrial warehousing is booming,\nand multifamily, we have too few units, so that’s not at risk.\nWhat’s really problematic is this downtown office space. So, then, downtown\noffice space, well, certainly regional banks have some skin in those games, but\nthey’re not the big investors in those spaces. Those are usually conglomerated\ninvestment pools. They have a variety of different investors, and they will have to\nfind another method of funding themselves. So, we had a commercial real estate\nroundtable late last year, and I asked people. We had private equity firms and\ncommercial real estate owners, and leasers, banks, and what we heard in that…\nNow, I’m going to narrow it down to this office property since that’s where the\nworrisome pieces are. Is that these folks have known this. The reckoning is not a\nsurprise. It’s been being planned for. People know it’s coming, and they’ve started\ntriaging.\nSo, there are certain properties, if you’ve got class C office space, then you’re\nprobably trying to figure out how to lease that to doctors, lawyers. Other people\nsay, “Move closer. Class C’s available. We don’t have the competition for it.” If you\nhave class A space, well, it’s beautiful and you can find different people in\ndowntown San Francisco, where people say the end of the world has come,\nespecially if they don’t live there. We did have big companies you’ve heard of\nmove out in the tech space, and then AI is moving in. So, people do come when\nthat space is available and the price point is right.\n\n\fSo, the real piece of the puzzle that’s in trouble is that class B space where it’s not\nnew. It’s not that attractive. It’s not going to attract the new techie people. We use\na lot of investment. And there’s so much class A sitting there. Why would you do it?\nAnd it’s too expensive or big for the smaller office places. So, that will be the place.\nAnd then, some of the owners or leasers are saying, “Well, I’ll just take it to ground.”\nI don’t know that they always mean tear it down. They mean turn the lights off and\nwait for the times to be better, and they can do that. And then, there are other\nprivate equity firms who are like, “At some point, the price point is going to be\nsufficiently good that I can swoop in.”\nSo, from the Fed’s perspective, what I worry about or as a policymaker what I\nworry about or what I think about… I wouldn’t even say worry. I would say what I\nthink about on commercial real estate is I want to understand what the drag on\nthe economy will be. So, I’m focused on that, and I also want to understand what\nthe stress on the banks will be. So, we’re monitoring that, thinking about that,\nregularly talking to all the entities, and everybody knows it’s coming and they’ve\nbeen working and planning for it. So, now, as it starts to go through and digest, it’s\nabout how does it shape up for any particular firm?\nDaniel:\nYeah. That’s helpful. Thanks. You do think that a solution to the economic gaps\nacross the country can be solved by increasing access to higher education. There\nseems to be a shift in employers relying more on soft skills or maybe on a skillsbased hiring, rather than degrees and specific job training.\nMary:\nWe were just having this conversation earlier today in the roundtable, and we\nwere also having this conversation. I’ve been doing various events and outreach\nevents, even in San Francisco when we’re having this exact conversation about\nwhat are firms doing? Firms have known for… I mean, it’s been in conversation for\nthe last four or five years. Do we really need to wait for a person to get a four-year\ndegree only to provide them on-the-job training or ask them to go get the\ncertificate when we need very specialized skills, or could we just take them out of\nhigh school and give them this training? That gets talked about a lot, but nothing\n\n\fgets done much about it, but the shortage of workers has put a highlight on that.\nSo, now, we’re hearing more firms in all kinds of sectors, a wide range of sectors\njust hiring and running people through certificate programs and running through\npeople through training programs. And then, that’s caused a surge in interest\namong community colleges in thinking about how can we provide those training\ncertificates?\nThere’s a college in Utah, The University of Utah, Utah Valley University, where they\nwere a community college, and now they also offer four-year degrees. They’re just\nlooking for, “Okay, what do these need and what skill sets can we get and get\npeople into jobs quickly?” So, I think that what we’re seeing is a transformation.\nThat transformation is far from complete. It’s going to require really a mindset shift.\nEmployers are going to have to not only desire to do skill-based training, but\nactually push it down into the organization, so that people realize you don’t\nalways need the college degree signal if you’ve got the skills. But then you have to\nhave skills-based hiring metrics and other things, and that has a chance to really\nequalize things, but we’re not there yet, but we have to work on it. I’m hearing that.\nFirms are working on that.\nOn the other side, we have to think about how do we get more certificate\nprograms and more training programs, more what I would call divisible\neducational opportunities, where you go and maybe you get a six-month\ncertificate. You work. You say, “Okay, now, I can take a year and I get this yearlong\ntraining program.” But we don’t really have that much infrastructure for this. So,\nright now, I think we’re in that transition period, but it certainly is part of the\nconversation. Much less, I’ve long been a proponent of college because you can\nlook at the data that lifts up. But someone asked me, wouldn’t you be for\napprentice programs? And I said, “Absolutely, if we had them.” But if I tell\ncommunities from who are historically disadvantaged, go get a training program,\nthere’s none available. So, there’s two choices.\nYou can stop at high school or you can go to college, but if we can fill that gap,\nwell, yes. And the important thing and this is something else that I said or that I\nbelieve because I’ve been all over, it won’t just be for people who can’t afford\ncollege. It’ll be for people who don’t want to be in college, and there are a lot of\n\n\fthose people who don’t come from disadvantaged backgrounds. They just want\nto do something different. They want to work in different things, and they don’t\nwant four years to get there. So, I think that’s why I say it’s a mindset shift. We have\nto change our mindset to get people what they need and when they need it.\nDaniel:\nYeah. One of the things that you talked about just now, but also earlier in the\nBusiness Roundtable was that it’s not just about at the very top level of a CEO\nsaying, “We’re going to hire people without bachelor’s degrees now.” Employment\nis competitive and there’s two people, and often, it’s just tempting to pick the one\nthat’s got the degree. One of the things that I’ve talked about with businesses,\nparticularly when I was out with the Workforce Partnership was if somebody has\nacquired those skills without the benefit of a degree, often that’s an indicator that\nthey’re more of a self-starter, that there’s somebody who have overcome often\nobstacles to get those skills, and that’s why it’s so important to hire people like that.\nMary:\nWell, I think one of the ways that we make sure that we are doing it effectively\nand in a way that has sticking power, staying power is if we’re saying we’re going\nto do skills-based hiring, then let’s have skills-based metrics. And that’s what I’m\nseeing missing in many organizations. They say, “Okay, we’re going to go do skillsbased hiring,” and it doesn’t last beyond a tight labor market. But if it is embedded\ninto the hiring manual, into the assessment papers, and you basically have the\ninterviewers asking skill-based questions, then you actually have a chance for\nthat living past just the tight labor market. So, these are things that…\nAgain, I just want to be very clear. The Fed plays no role in these things. I don’t have\nany tools for these types of things. So, why do I talk about them? Why am I even\nwilling to talk about them? It’s because we have a mandate of full employment,\nand in order to achieve full employment and really think about what that means,\nwe have to have a workforce. And in order for the workforce needs, the demand\nfor workers to be met without being inflationary, we have to have a workforce\nthat could match it. So, when people ask me, what do you think we need to have\ndemand and supply come together? Well, I can say we can keep raising the\n\n\finterest rate to make sure demand doesn’t outstrip supply, but we can also work\non the supply part. I can’t control that, but I can definitely identify where the gaps\nare.\nDaniel:\nThat’s great. I’ll ask you one last question, and then we’ll send people off to break.\nYou’ve talked about your vision of the San Francisco Fed as a public service\norganization, and I just wanted to know if there was any examples you’d like to\nshare or how you realize that vision of the San Francisco Federal Reserve Bank\nbeing a public service organization.\nMary:\nActually, it’s a premier public service organization. The reason I say that is we are\nin public service, and I think everyone who works at the Federal Reserve Bank of\nSan Francisco or any Federal Reserve in the system understands we are in public\nservice. But you’re absolutely right. When I took the job as president and in my\nmany interviews to get the job, they asked me, “What’s your vision? Why do you\nwant this job?” And I said, “The Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco and Federal\nReserves across the system, we have all the tools and capabilities. We’re missiondriven. We’re earnest. We are sophisticated. We’re well-trained. We want to put all\nof that to being really a premier public service organization, the best in public\nservice. And what that means is not simply doing our job well. It’s actually figuring\nout how to continually do it better and to serve more people and to meet people\nwhere they are and source more information and build trust.”\nUltimately, someone asked me, “What’s your most important tool?” And I think they\nwanted me to say the Fed funds rate, but I said, trust. Public trust in our ability to\ndo our work and our willingness to meet our commitments is our most important\ntool. I’ll give you an example of that from this year or last year. If people believe\nwhen we say we are going to bring inflation down to 2% and they believe it, well,\nthen they buy into it. And then, they say, “Okay, inflation is going to come down.”\nAnd if you look at inflation expectations for consumers, you see the more as we\nspeak and then they get the data, they see inflation expectations have just come\ndown.\n\n\fSo, that’s a measure of our credibility, and our credibility can only thrive when trust\nis high. So, that’s what being a premier public service organization means to me.\nIt’s ensuring that we build as much trust as possible. We talk to people who don’t\nunderstand or even agree with us, and we do it with openness, transparency, and\nrespect for their views and their questions, and that’s what my team and I strive to\ndo every day.\nDaniel:\nPresident Mary Daly, thank you very much.

Daly\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of San Francisco\nThe Economic Club of New York\nNew York, NY\nOctober 5, 2023, 12 PM EDT\nRemarks as prepared for delivery.\n\nGood afternoon. It’s terrific to be here and be speaking once again to the Economic Club of New York.\nSo, thank you very much for the invitation, and I look forward to a great discussion.\nBefore we get started, I would like to take a few minutes to describe how I see the current economic\nenvironment and the uncertainties and tradeoffs we face as we calibrate policy. The key takeaway is\nthat the moment calls for optionality. We must keep our minds open so that we can respond to\nconditions as they evolve. Vigilance and agility are paramount to finishing the job—the job being, of\ncourse, to restore price stability as gently as we can.\nThe good news is—at this point—we have time to get it right. The economy and policy are in a much\nbetter place. Growth and inflation are gradually slowing and the risks to the outlook are largely\nbalanced. Monetary policy is restrictive and financial conditions are tight. So, we don’t have to rush to\nany decisions.\nBut progress isn’t victory. And we must remain resolute to finish the job. A gradual return to 2 percent\ninflation is in our sights, but it is not yet in our grasp. That is the final mile.\nBut before I go further, let me say that the views I express today are my own and do not necessarily\nreflect those of my colleagues or anyone else within the Federal Reserve System.\nProgress to Date\nI mentioned that the economy and policy are in a better place. So, let me begin by taking stock of where\nwe have been and how far we have come.\n\n1\n\n\fAs you may remember, in March 2022—just 18 months ago—the Federal Open Market Committee\n(FOMC) had a problem. Headline and core inflation had risen to multidecade highs and were projected\nto keep rising. Inflation expectations, especially at the short end, were close behind. 1 And there were\nconcerns that this could generate a more worrisome increase in medium- and longer-run inflation\nexpectations.\nSo, the FOMC began to rapidly adjust monetary policy. 2\nSince that time, we have raised the federal funds rate by 525 basis points to its highest level in 22 years. 3\nThese cumulative increases have moved policy into restrictive territory. Indeed, the real federal funds\nrate, as measured by the nominal funds rate less one-year-ahead inflation expectations, exceeds almost\nall measures of its neutral value. 4\nWe are seeing the effects of this tightening on the economy. Headline and core inflation have both\ndeclined significantly, bringing us much closer to our 2 percent target. 5 As my contacts in the Twelfth\nDistrict tell me, this is having an immediate positive effect on households, businesses, and communities\nwho have been struggling on the treadmill of constantly rising prices and falling purchasing power. The\nrelief they’re seeing in their wallets is translating directly into more positive views about future inflation.\nWe see this nationally in short-run inflation expectations, which have been falling almost one for one\nwith the declines in inflation. 6\nPerhaps most encouragingly, the welcomed decline in inflation has come without significant\ndeterioration in economic growth or the labor market. The economy and labor market are slowing, but\nnot severely or abruptly. These developments have led market participants, businesses, and households\nto replace fears of recession with hopes for a soft landing, a sea change from earlier this year. 7\nThis is unequivocally good news. But to ensure that we fully achieve the outcomes we want—sustainable\nprice stability and a healthy and balanced labor market—we need to finish the job.\nSo, what will this require?\n\n1\nHousehold expectations of near-term inflation began rising following a surge in commodity prices in 2021. For more information, see Glick et\nal. (2021).\n2 The FOMC first signaled that policy would need to be tightened in November 2021. It started the tightening cycle in its March 2022 meeting.\n3 The current range of the federal funds rate is 5.25 to 5.5 percent.\n4 A range of common measures for business and consumer inflation expectations currently puts one-year-ahead inflation expectations between\n2.5 percent and 3.6 percent, leading to a real funds rate between 1.8 percent and 2.9 percent. This is notably above the median Summary of\nEconomic Projections (SEP) estimate of the neutral rate of 0.50 percent.\n5 Federal Open Market Committee (2023) specifies the 2 percent target as measured by the personal consumption expenditures price index\n(PCEPI). As of August 2023, the 12-month change in overall PCEPI moderated to 3.5 percent from a high of 7.1 percent in June 2022. Similarly,\ncore PCEPI, which excludes volatile food and energy categories, fell from a peak of 5.6 percent to 3.9 percent.\n6 Business and consumer short-term inflation expectations have fallen notably since the beginning of the current tightening cycle. For example,\nthe Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta’s Business Inflation Expectations shows one-year-ahead expected inflation moderating from 3.8 percent in\nMarch 2022 to 2.5 percent in the latest reading. Similarly, the University of Michigan’s Surveys of Consumers show a moderation in one-yearahead expected inflation from 5.4 percent in March 2022 to 3.2 percent in the latest reading.\n7 For example, the University of Michigan’s Surveys of Consumers’ index for expected business conditions, which measures household sentiment\nfor economic growth in the coming year, improved notably since earlier this year and reached its highest value since the beginning of the\ncurrent tightening cycle as of September 2023. Additionally, the latest Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia’s Survey of Professional Forecasters\nshows respondents placing less probability on a downturn in real GDP in the second half of 2023 relative to earlier in the year.\n\n2\n\n\fA Balanced Approach\nVigilance and agility.\nLet’s start with vigilance. We need to be vigilant in assessing the odds that the good data we’ve been\nseeing is a new trend, rather than just a temporary relief that will stall out too early, leaving us short of\nour goals. Either is possible.\nI’ve discussed the recent positive data and the progress we’ve made. But why might these positive\ndevelopments plateau? Put simply, the economy still has considerable momentum and a ways to go to\ncome back into balance.\nHeadline data tell the story. In the labor market, even with the recent slowing, job growth remains well\nabove what is needed to keep pace with labor force growth, and other indicators point to ongoing\nstrength. 8 Inflation is similar. While overall inflation has fallen a lot, it continues to be almost 2\npercentage points higher than our target.\nNow, it’s possible that the slowing we are seeing will translate into a steady march toward our goals. But\nin the case of inflation, there are real risks to this projection. Many components are coming down just as\nexpected and should continue to slow. But nonhousing core services, often called supercore, has been\nrelatively sticky and remains far above its pre-pandemic level. 9 Although it often lags other inflation, we\nwill need to see some progress in this category to be fully confident we are on the path back to price\nstability. 10, 11\nWhat does this mean for policy? Well, this is where agility comes in. We need to be positioned and\nprepared for however the economy evolves. We need to have options.\nIf we continue to see a cooling labor market and inflation heading back to our target, we can hold\ninterest rates steady and let the effects of policy continue to work. Importantly, even if we hold rates\nwhere they are today, policy will grow increasingly restrictive as inflation and inflation expectations fall.\nSo, holding rates steady is an active policy action. 12\nLikewise, if financial conditions, which have tightened considerably in the past 90 days, remain tight, the\nneed for us to take further action is diminished.\nIn contrast, if the deceleration of growth and inflation stalls, activity begins to reaccelerate, or financial\nconditions loosen too much, we can react to those data and raise rates further until we are confident\nthat monetary policy is sufficiently restrictive to complete the job.\n\nAbout 100,000 new jobs per month are needed to keep the unemployment rate at its current level of 3.8 percent over the next year, according\nto the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta’s Jobs Calculator. The U.S. economy added an average of 150,000 jobs over the three months ending in\nAugust 2023.\n9 The 12-month change in the price index for core nonhousing services has been above 4 percent since April 2021.\n10 In August 2023, consumer spending on core nonhousing services was about 50 percent of total spending. Moreover, this category contributed\naround 2.1 percentage points, or 60 percent, to the 12-month change in overall PCEPI inflation.\n11\nIf the contribution of core nonhousing services to the 12-month change in overall PCEPI inflation remained at its current level and\ncontributions from all other categories returned to their pre-pandemic (2016–2019) averages, overall inflation would only moderate to\napproximately 2.6 percent.\n12 The restrictiveness of policy is measured by the real interest rate, which is the nominal federal funds rate less one-year-ahead expected\ninflation. If the nominal funds rate is held steady while inflation and inflation expectations continue to moderate, the real interest rate will rise,\nmaking monetary policy more restrictive.\n8\n\n3\n\n\fIn other words, rather than a prejudged path of what policy will be, we need an open mind and\noptionality.\nThe Final Mile\nWhen I travel around my District and across the nation, I see the progress we’ve made in the past year.\nAnd that is worth acknowledging.\nBut as I said at the start, progress alone is not victory. And it will take vigilance and agility to complete\nthe final mile.\nThank you.\nReferences\nFederal Open Market Committee. 2023. “Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy.”\nAdopted effective January 24, 2012; as reaffirmed effective January 31, 2023.\nGlick, Reuven, Noah Kouchekinia, Sylvain Leduc, and Zheng Liu. 2021. “Do Households Expect Inflation\nWhen Commodities Surge?” FRBSF Economic Letter 2021-19, (July 12).\n\n4\n\n\f"

            "content": "U.S. DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY\nRemarks by Secretary of the Treasury Janet L. Yellen at Press\nBriefing Ahead of G20\nSeptember 8, 2023\n\nAs Prepared for Delivery\nHello everyone. Thank you for being here. I’d like to share a few introductory thoughts about the\npriorities we will be focused on throughout this week.\nFirst, we are committed to supporting emerging markets and developing countries and to\naddressing global challenges. This includes our ongoing work on evolving the multilateral\ndevelopment banks.\nOne year since my call to action to the MDBs, we have worked with a growing coalition of partners\nto make significant progress on reforms related to the World Bank’s mission and vision, incentives,\noperational model, and financing capacity. We are glad to have Ajay Banga as our partner in this\nwork. And we look forward to more work with the regional development banks and on how to\nachieve greater collaboration across the MDB system, including to increase access to climate\nfinance.\nWe have already made significant progress in expanding the MDBs’ financial capacity. The\nrecommendations that are currently being implemented or under consideration across the MDBs\ncould unlock an additional $200 billion over the next decade. Those are crucial additional\nresources for reducing poverty, advancing global health security, and combatting climate change. I\nsaw firsthand the impact this funding can have during my last trip to India just over a month ago,\nwhen Ajay Banga and I visited an education data hub supported by the World Bank and met the\nstudents whose lives were being improved.\nThere is scope to do even more on financial capacity, including through some of the more mediumterm recommendations of the G20 Capital Adequacy Framework review, particularly with respect\nto callable capital. We are also asking Congress for $2.25 billion to boost the World Bank’s\nconcessional finance for global challenges and for crisis response. And we have requested\nauthorization for a loan of up to $21 billion for the IMF, including for the Poverty Reduction and\nGrowth Trust (PRGT), which desperately needs more resources. We also hope to build support for\nan equi-proportional increase in quotas during meetings this week.\n\n\fThis week also provides an opportunity to discuss debt relief. We continue to support efforts to\nprovide predictable, orderly, and timely debt relief to countries, including under the Common\nFramework for Debt Treatment, where progress has been too slow.\nAs a second priority area, we remain committed to extensive and strategic multilateral action in\nresponse to Russia’s war on Ukraine. The price cap and sanctions – both the result of\nunprecedented global collaboration – are having powerful impacts on Russia’s ability to wage its\nbrutal and unjust war. We also remain committed to support for Ukraine and recently put forward a\nsupplemental funding request. There has been bipartisan support for this funding to date and it’s\ncritical that we continue to provide timely economic assistance. During my visit to Kyiv earlier this\nyear, I saw firsthand the importance of this assistance in enabling Ukraine’s resistance on the\nfrontlines. We are also grateful for the involvement of our partners, including the 50 billion euro\npackage proposed by the European Union and the $15 billion International Monetary Fund\nprogram, which has been essential to Ukraine’s efforts to implement reforms and stabilize the\neconomy.\nAnd we need to remain focused on addressing the devastating consequences of the war, including\nits impact on food security. Russia’s withdrawal from the Black Sea Grain Initiative is deeply\nconcerning and is particularly being felt by low- and middle-income countries. In response, we\nhope to move forward on efforts such as supporting the Global Agriculture and Food Security\nProgram and working toward a successful replenishment of the International Fund for Agricultural\nDevelopment.\nLast but not least, continuing to advance the U.S.-India relationship will be a priority this week. We\nhighly value our bilateral relationship with India. This is my fourth time in India over the last year,\nmaking it the country I’ve visited most frequently as Treasury Secretary. We also welcomed Prime\nMinister Modi to the U.S. in June. The U.S. is home to the largest Indian diaspora outside of Asia\nand is India’s largest export market. Expanding our bilateral economic ties and our cooperation on\nglobal challenges is crucially important to us.\nWith that, I look forward to your questions.\n###\n\n\f"

            "content": "U.S. DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY\nRemarks by Secretary of the Treasury Janet L. Yellen on Press Call\nwith Vice President Kamala Harris on Benefits of Unions to the U.S.\nEconomy\nAugust 28, 2023\n\nAs Prepared for Delivery\nThank you, Madam Vice President. You’ve been an advocate for workers throughout your time in\nCalifornia and in this Administration, especially through your leadership of the Task Force on\nWorker Organizing and Empowerment.\nThe Biden-Harris Administration is focused on investing in our economic strength, and supporting\nAmerican workers is at the heart of that effort.\nThe President, Vice President, and I understand that jobs provide both a paycheck and a sense of\ndignity. Since January 2021, we have seen a historically strong jobs recovery from the pandemic.\nAnd we are dedicated to creating a fairer, stronger labor market for the long haul.\nWhile we’ve emerged quickly from the pandemic and there have been many positive trends over\nthe past decades, there have also been persistent challenges. Middle-class wages and household\nincomes have stagnated in recent decades. Both renting and owning a home have become more\nexpensive. So have education and healthcare.\nWith today’s call, we are releasing a Treasury Department report which presents the case that\nunions can play a role in addressing the challenges faced by the middle class. This report is the\nAdministration’s latest action to strengthen the important role of labor unions in our economy and\nit is the Treasury Department’s first major effort to lay out the rationale for why we think this is so\nimportant.\nThe Treasury Department’s report finds that unions raise the wages of their members by around 10\nto 15 percent. We also observe that union workers have greater access to critical fringe benefits,\nsuch as retirement benefits, medical benefits, and life insurance.\nUnions also impact personnel practices, bringing about better workplace grievance systems and\nimproved workplace safety. I began my career as a labor economist, and I’ve found in my own\n\n\facademic work that these non-monetary factors are a key driver of job satisfaction. They are also\ncritically important to workers’ well-being.\nUnionization also has spillover effects. Competition means workers at nonunionized firms may see\nincreased wages too. Heightened workplace safety norms can pull up whole industries. Benefits\nalso spill over to workers’ families and communities.\nImportantly, our research also finds that unions fuel equality. Today’s unions benefit all\ndemographic groups. Unions reduce race and gender wage gaps by encouraging explicit antidiscrimination measures and egalitarian wage practices. Working parents, including mothers,\nbenefit from more scheduling predictability, which is more likely in unionized workplaces. And\nBlack men, who have the highest union membership rates of any demographic groups, have also\nbeen particularly hit by the trends experienced by the middle class as a whole. They therefore may\nbe particularly poised to benefit from unionization.\nTaken together, these findings challenge arguments that unions hold back growth. Unions could\ncontribute to reversing the stark increase in inequality we’ve seen in recent decades, promoting\neconomy-wide growth. There are also many cases of unions improving productivity.\nPresident Biden’s Executive Order on Worker Organizing and Empowerment called on each federal\nagency to take steps to improve opportunities for building worker power. I am proud the Treasury\nDepartment is contributing to this effort, including through this report and through a report we\nreleased in March of 2022, on uneven bargaining power between employers and employees.\nOur ongoing implementation of the Inflation Reduction Act is also crucial. Earlier this month, I\ntraveled to Las Vegas to tour the IBEW 357 Training Center, which is preparing workers for the Act’s\nclean energy jobs.\nGoing forward, I hope research like this report supports continued efforts to build worker power\nand bring about much-needed gains for the middle class and for the economy as a whole.\n###\n\n\f"

Yellen on the\nEconomy Ahead of Inflation Reduction Act Anniversary in Las\nVegas, Nevada\nAugust 14, 2023\n\nAs Prepared for Delivery\nThank you. It’s great to be here in Las Vegas with all of you. I want to especially thank Lamar for\nyour introduction and for your team’s hospitality. And I’m grateful to everyone from the IBEW and\nbuilding trades unions for your very warm welcome.\nMany of you may not know that I began my career as a labor economist. I studied the labor market:\nhow workers and companies interact, and when it works well and when it doesn’t. Since then,\nmuch of my life has been dedicated to creating an economy that lifts workers and families up,\nrather than weighing them down. If I’ve learned one lesson from my time in economics, it’s this:\nAmerican workers are central to our nation’s economic progress. What you are doing here in Vegas\n– and across the country – demonstrates every day how skilled workers are literally building our\nnew economic future. I couldn’t be more pleased to join you.\nJust shy of a year ago, I delivered a major economic speech in Michigan that laid out the case for\nour Administration’s economic plan. At the time, we had just witnessed a historic economic\nrecovery from the depths of the pandemic downturn. An unprecedented pace of job creation had\nbrought the U.S. labor market back in record time. Yet, we were still in the early stages of executing\nPresident Biden’s long-term economic agenda. We had just completed the enactment of our\ntrifecta of historic investments: the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, CHIPS and Science Act, and\nInflation Reduction Act.\nDuring my speech last year, I also explained the principles that guided our economic agenda. I\noutlined a framework called “modern supply-side economics” – an economic philosophy that\nanimates much of Bidenomics. It focuses on how government can help spur long-term growth\nthrough investments on the supply side – such as in our workforce and its productivity. Unlike\ntraditional supply-side economics, this approach cares not only about growth – but also creating a\nfairer and more sustainable economy. President Biden has advanced a significant core of the\nmodern supply-side agenda through the passage of these three generational laws.\n\n\fToday, I want to discuss what we have accomplished since last summer. I’ll first speak about the\nstate of our economy. Then, I’ll turn to the clean energy provisions of the Inflation Reduction Act.\nIt’s a historic law that Treasury plays the chief role in implementing. This week, we mark one year\nsince the President signed the IRA into law. I want to speak about the progress we’ve made not\nonly in driving the climate benefits of the law – during a summer when Americans are feeling the\nharsh realities of climate change. I’d also like to discuss the economic benefits that we are already\nbeginning to see across the country for American workers and families. Powered by the IRA, the\nPresident’s agenda has helped drive a massive boom that is touching every corner of the country.\nSince January 2021, companies have committed over $500 billion in manufacturing and clean\nenergy investments. The explosion in U.S. factory construction is a uniquely American story: one\nthat we do not see replicated in other peer countries.\nLet me start by speaking about the state of the economy.\n\nSTATE OF THE U.S. ECONOMY\nOver the past year, our task has been to transition the economy from rapid recovery to stable\ngrowth. Our path so far shows that we are on the right track, even as we remain vigilant about\npotential challenges and uncertainties.\nTake our labor market: Americans are back to work. Our historically rapid jobs recovery has been a\nsource of strength as we made our way back from the pandemic recession. This recovery was\ndriven in large part by the decisive economic measures that President Biden took to provide\nassistance to households, businesses, and state and local governments. Since President Biden\nentered office, over 13 million jobs have been created. Last month, our unemployment rate was at\na near record low of 3.5 percent. That’s less than a quarter of the unemployment rate recorded in\nApril 2020.\nImportantly, we’ve also seen a significant recovery in the share of Americans participating in our\nworkforce. This rebound in labor supply has brought the jobs market into better balance. The\noverall labor force participation rate is now back in line with pre-pandemic trends. The share of\nprime-age Americans currently employed – those between the ages of 25 and 54 – has reached its\nhighest level in over 20 years. In fact, the share of prime-age female workers currently employed is\nthe highest it has ever been. Notably, the labor market recovery has been strong for workers across\na broad set of communities. The rates of unemployment for Black and Hispanic Americans are at\namong their lowest on record.\n\n\fThese are not abstract statistics. These are real Americans back at work – able to put food on the\ntable, support their families, and save for retirement. As President Biden says, a job is “about a lot\nmore than a paycheck. It’s about dignity. It’s about respect. It’s about your place in your\ncommunity.” The people in this room know that very well.\nThe continued strength of our labor market is particularly impressive given our fight against\ninflation. Last July, I gave a speech about the remarkable resilience of the American economy and\nworkers in the face of global challenges. There were many who questioned whether that could last.\nBut that’s precisely what we've seen over the past year, even as we remain attuned to the\nsignificant risks ahead. Annual headline inflation is now nearly 6 percentage points below its June\n2022 peak. Today, overall inflation and the unemployment rate both sit below 4 percent. And our\neconomy continues to expand. Workers are better off than they were last year. Real average hourly\nearnings have grown over the past year – meaning that wage gains are outpacing inflation. In fact –\nin 9 out of 14 major sectors – real wages are growing faster than they were in the decade before the\npandemic. This has had a sizable impact on reducing inequality: one working paper estimates that\nwage gains for lower-income workers in recent years have reversed a quarter of the wage\ninequality that had accumulated over the past 40 years.[1]\nThe Administration remains committed to taking actions to lower prices for Americans where we\ncan. And we continue to monitor developments, particularly those abroad, that may affect prices\nand growth. We know that progress rarely moves in a straight line. But I still believe that there is a\npath to continue reducing inflation while maintaining a healthy labor market. While there are risks,\nthe evidence we’ve seen so far suggests that we are on such a path. Americans are reflecting this\noptimism: consumer sentiment is at its highest level in almost two years. I expect the important\ngains that we’ve made over the past two and a half years to serve as a source of resilience in the\nweeks and months to come, even if we see further cooling in our economy.\n\nOUR ECONOMIC PLAN\nAs we continue to navigate through short-term challenges, the President has been clear that we\ncannot just make quick fixes. Over the past few decades, we have seen growing pressures on our\neconomy. Many workers and families have felt them personally. They include slowing productivity\ngrowth, rising economic inequality, concerns about our energy and national security, and a\nworsening climate crisis that, if unmitigated, presents an existential threat to us all.\nOur Administration is taking decisive action against these persistent challenges by investing in\nAmerica. We have mobilized public and private investments in three strategic sectors as part of our\n“modern supply-side” agenda. We passed the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law – a generational\n\n\finvestment in our physical and digital infrastructure. This law is already delivering tens of\nthousands of new projects across the country that are increasing our productivity and growth\npotential. They are also strengthening our competitiveness and supply chain resilience. We also\nenacted the CHIPS and Science Act – a major investment that is boosting semiconductor\nmanufacturing and incentivizing investments in cutting-edge R&D. A strong semiconductor\nindustrial base at home will help bolster our nation’s resilience to global shocks. Finally, we are\nimplementing the Inflation Reduction Act. It’s our nation’s boldest-ever climate action. And it is\nbeginning to spark an economic renaissance in communities that had been left behind.\n\nINFLATION REDUCTION ACT IMPLEMENTATION\nI’d like to focus specifically on the Inflation Reduction Act as we mark its one-year anniversary. Last\nyear, I identified three goals for this law: tackling climate change, expanding economic\nopportunity, and strengthening our economic resilience and energy security.\nLet me speak about how we’ve made progress against each of these goals.\nFirst, tackling climate change.\nOver the past month, we have again seen incontrovertible evidence that climate change is here. We\nhave also seen how it has compounded the effects of unusual weather patterns like El Niño.\nExtreme heat has scorched communities across the United States. There have been recordbreaking temperatures from Phoenix to Miami. Here in Las Vegas, you’ve similarly not been spared\nby the waves of crippling extreme heat. In fact, scientists estimate that July was the hottest month\nin the Earth’s modern history. Beyond the heat, a large part of the East Coast and Midwest have\nbeen repeatedly shrouded in smoke from wildfires in Canada. Floods have devastated Vermont\nand other parts of the East Coast, while the Midwest and other regions continue to battle a severe\ndrought.\nThese climate events have real economic impacts on Americans – even if they are spared from the\nphysical impacts. As an example, home insurers are hiking rates or pulling back entirely from\nhighly vulnerable areas in states like California and Florida. These developments are having a\nsignificant economic impact on homeownership – which has long been the cornerstone of the\nAmerican Dream and a primary driver of household wealth.\nPresident Biden has identified this decade as the “decisive decade” to combat climate change. The\nUnited States has committed to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions by at least half from 2005\nlevels by 2030. And we have committed to a net-zero economy by 2050. Tackling climate change\nrequires global action. But the United States must do our part, and a clear signal from the world’s\n\n\flargest economy can mobilize action by other nations. While more is needed, scientific studies\nconclude that the IRA – and other Administration actions – are moving us well toward achieving\nour commitments under the Paris Agreement.\nOur climate strategy is based on a simple premise: targeted public investments can help mobilize\nprivate capital toward compelling public policy objectives. This is an old strategy that we’ve\nsuccessfully utilized in the past – like in the development of new technologies like the Internet.\nThe IRA invests in both demand- and supply-side incentives to build the clean energy economy. On\nthe supply side, the IRA expands and extends the existing foundation of tax incentives. These\nincentives provide long-term certainty for investors in pursuing clean energy projects. With the IRA,\ninvestors have greater confidence to scale-up deployment of established technologies like solar\nenergy. The IRA also helps develop nascent technologies like clean hydrogen and sustainable\naviation fuel. These are essential to reducing emissions from harder-to-abate sectors. Expansions\non the supply side are also matched by IRA tax credits and rebates to drive up demand for\nconsumer goods like electric vehicles, heat pumps, and energy-efficient appliances.\nTogether, these incentives spur greater innovation and competition in the clean energy industry.\nAnd they drive down the cost curves of these technologies. Lower costs mean greater adoption.\nThis will not only help the United States mitigate our greenhouse gas emissions. It will help the rest\nof the world as well. Thanks to the IRA, one study estimates that for every ton of carbon dioxide\nreduced within our country, 2-3 tons of reductions will be achieved outside the United States.[2]\nSecond, as we reap the IRA’s climate benefits, we are also expanding economic opportunity to\ncommunities across America.\nThe climate transition is one of the biggest economic transitions of our lifetimes. Today, over $1\ntrillion in new capital each year is being invested in clean energy around the globe. But for far too\nlong, economic opportunity in the United States has been concentrated on the coasts. That must\nchange. We must not only create clean energy jobs in the aggregate – but the employment and\nother benefits of this transition must accrue broadly across all communities. A core goal of the IRA\nis to revitalize communities that have suffered industrial decline or been left behind. We are\nputting American workers and American jobs at the center of our clean energy transition, making\nsure Americans in every part of our country benefit from the rising global demand for low-carbon\nproducts.\nThe early results are in. Through my travels, I’ve seen how the clean energy industry is expanding\nacross the country. I’ve visited solar companies in North Carolina and Louisiana. I’ve toured an EV\nbattery plant in Tennessee. And I see the difference that the IRA is making in Nevada as well. In the\n\n\fMidwest and the South, there are now so many shovels in the ground for new EV battery factories\nthat many are dubbing these regions the new “Battery Belt.” Treasury’s analysis indicates that\ninvestments in clean energy, EVs, and batteries since the President took office have been\nconcentrated in counties that need them the most – that is, those that had lagged the country in\nearnings, college graduation rates, and child poverty rates.\nThis progress has not occurred by happenstance. The Inflation Reduction Act provides place-based\nincentives that bolster the business case to invest in certain communities. There is a bonus\nincentive for companies to invest in solar and wind projects in low-income communities,\ncomplementing Treasury’s other work to bolster capital access in these places. It’s also important\nthat cities and towns that have served as the backbone of our nation’s traditional energy\nproduction are not left behind. The IRA provides a bonus for companies that invest in areas with\nclosed coal mines or coal-fired power plants, and other communities that have relied on jobs in\nfossil fuel industries. This is a major pillar in our Administration’s broader effort to renew the\neconomic potential of our nation’s energy communities.\nImportantly, the workers that are driving the clean energy transition – like those in this room –\nmust benefit from it. So, the law requires companies to adhere to strong wage standards and\napprenticeship requirements to claim the full value of many incentives.\nEarlier this summer, Treasury also released proposed guidance that would make it easier for these\ntax credits to reach a broad range of institutions. We are implementing innovative tools that will\nenable states, cities, towns, and tax-exempt organizations – like schools and hospitals – to directly\naccess these credits. These measures serve as a force multiplier for the IRA. And they allow clean\nenergy projects to be built more quickly, affordably, and by more entities. As a result of this\nprovision, we expect the massive benefits of the IRA to be felt more rapidly and more broadly.\nInvesting in underserved communities is not just an important moral imperative. It’s also smart\neconomics. One study indicates that boosting employment in “distressed” regions results in at\nleast 60 percent greater economic benefits than those in “booming” ones.[3] Put simply, it gives us\na bigger bang for our buck. All of us benefit when we bring people back into the workforce and\nprovide them and others with access to good-paying, high-quality jobs in the industries of the\nfuture.\nThe third goal we laid out for the IRA is bolstering resilience and energy security.\nThe Bipartisan Infrastructure Law provides significant investment to adapt to climate change. That\nincludes protecting our infrastructure against droughts, floods, and extreme heat. But beyond\nclimate adaptation, we must also mitigate our vulnerabilities to shocks emanating from our\n\n\freliance on fossil fuels. Over the past couple of years, we have seen how huge swings in the price of\noil can put tremendous pressure on the pocketbooks of American families. We have also witnessed\nRussia weaponize its energy exports against our European allies and partners.\nEnergy is the lifeblood of our economy. A clean energy transition will enable us to depend more on\nthe wind and the sun – and less on fossil fuels and the whims of those who control those resources.\nIt will make a difference to ordinary Americans, who will have greater stability and predictability in\ntheir energy costs. This means greater certainty in their budgets – and less time looking at the price\nboards outside of gas stations.\nBut we must do more. As we move away from fossil fuels, we remain concerned about the risks of\nover-concentration in clean energy supply chains. Today, the production of critical clean energy\ninputs – from batteries to solar panels to critical minerals – is concentrated in a handful of\ncountries. It’s important that we build resilient and diversified critical global supply chains that can\nreduce chokepoints, mitigate disruptions, and protect our economic security.\nThat starts by investing here at home. The IRA is helping re-shore some of the production that is\ncritical to our clean energy economy. Looking beyond our shores, we are also working hard to\naccelerate the clean energy transition in other countries. Accelerating these transitions can mean\ngreater demand for U.S. clean energy technologies produced by American workers. It can also\nbolster global clean energy supply chains.\nAs we look forward to the fall and beyond: it’s remarkable to consider how far we’ve come. Our\nAdministration is laser-focused on continuing to provide clarity on the law so that its benefits can\ncontinue to be felt as soon as possible by American workers and families. We are also providing\nimportant guardrails so taxpayer resources are effectively spent. The IRS plays a major role in\nadministering the IRA’s clean energy incentives. We believe that the IRS modernization initiative is\nessential to the law’s successful implementation. We will continue our efforts to build a tax\nadministration system that is fit for the 21st century.\n\nCLOSING\nTwenty-five years ago, I gave my first major speech warning about the economic dangers of\nclimate change. Since that time, we have seen climate impacts intensify. But while the world had\nlong recognized the need for decisive action, the federal government had been missing in action.\nNo longer. Over the past year, we have seen the early results of bold federal action through the IRA\nand the Administration’s broader climate agenda. Importantly, we have seen how climate action\nadvances our nation’s economic priorities. The IRA is driving economic growth, expanding\n\n\feconomic opportunity, and bolstering our resilience. This is good for the American workers in this\nroom – and so many others across the United States.\nI am excited about the future we are building together. And I hope you are too. Thank you for\nhaving me today.\n\n[1] https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w31010/w31010.pdf\n[2] https://rhg.com/research/emerging-climate-technology-ira/\n[3] https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/jep.34.3.99\n\n\f"

Mary Daly,\nwho is an economist, joined the San Francisco Fed in 1996, and she worked on a\nnumber of issues, labor, market dynamics, income inequality. Rose to be the\nDirector of Research, and she became president in 2018. Now she’s one of 12\nreserve bank presidents, and except for New York, the other 11 are considered the\nsame. But Mary Daly has the distinction that her district, because we drew the\nlines in 1913, represents a fifth of the nation’s population. But unfortunately for her,\nthey don’t do population weighting when you vote on the FOMC.\nMary Daly:\nNo, but maybe they should. We could propose that.\nDavid Wessel:\n\n\fPresident Daly, I wanted to start by talking a little bit about how you read the\neconomy right today. And there seems to be a sense of the Federal Open Market\nCommittee, that we need to raise interest rates at least a couple more times in\norder to bring inflation down to the 2% target. And I wonder how you think about\nthat?\nMary Daly:\nSure, absolutely. And thanks everyone for being here, and thanks for having me.\nLet me start with the economy. One of the surprising things about the economy, is\njust how much momentum it continues to have. What’s been notable is if you\nstarted the beginning and you ended last year, December, if you looked at the\nsummary of economic projections that the FOMC put out in December, it was\nforecasting slower growth than we have now, higher increase in the\nunemployment rate, and more slowing in inflation than we see. The data have\ncome in and a surprising strength with inflation persistently printing too high.\nAgainst that backdrop, you think, well, there’s more that we need to do. We need\nto continue to raise rates in order to bridle the economy more, so that demand\ncomes back in line with supply. But in that context, we also had the banking\nstresses in March. And those banking stresses can act like a credit shock, and they\ncan themselves restrain. We’re balancing the risk to the economy going forward,\nagainst the incoming information, which is about strength. And I was very\nsupportive, in fact, a proponent of slowing the pace of tightening, and doing that\nby standing pat at the June meeting. But also recognizing, like the median of the\nSEP projections does, that we’re likely to need a couple more rate hikes over the\ncourse of this year to really bring inflation back into a path that’s along a\nsustainable 2% path. The important thing about all of this though, is the word in\nprojections is projections. Those are things that you suspect could be true, but we\nhave to be data dependent right now to really understand how to make policy.\nDavid Wessel:\nWhen interest rates were at zero, and inflation was at 9%, and unemployment was\nhistoric lows, I don’t think you needed a PhD to decide that interest rates probably\nhad to go up. But the Fed has raised interest rates quite a bit, five percentage\n\n\fpoints in a relatively short period of time. And as you’ve said in public, the\ndecisions get harder as you get closer to your destination. I wonder when you look\nat the economy today, do you worry more about the Fed doing too much and\nunnecessarily causing a deep recession? Or do you worry about the Fed doing\ntoo little, and failing to get inflation down towards the 2% target?\nMary Daly:\nThat’s a great question. And in my mind, the risks have become more balanced. If\nyou look to even last year, the risks were decidedly, and I said this publicly, a lot of\nmy attention was on doing too little. That we could really run the risk of doing too\nlittle, and then we would end up with persistently high inflation. Which we know is\na tax on everyone, but especially a tax on those least able to bear it. That was\nwhere my focus was.\nOver the course of time, as the economy has started to show signs of slowing, and\nimportantly we have put in over 500 basis points of tightening already, well then I\nsee the risk as more balanced. But today, right now with the labor market still\nbeing very strong, with GDP growth coming in above what we think we need to\ndo to get demand and supply back in balance, and inflation persistently high, yes,\nit’s coming down, but it’s still not 2%, it’s not our target, then I still am waiting on\ndoing… the risks of doing too little are outweighing the risks of doing too much, but\nthat gap is getting narrower and narrower.\nThat’s why the decisions get harder. And it’s why I was completely supportive, and\nthink it was appropriate to turn back the dial on the speed at which we adjust.\nAnd standing pat in the June meeting is just slowing the pace, so we have more\ntime to assess the economy and determine that. Ultimately you don’t want to make\nany error. You don’t want to go too far, you don’t want to go too little. But it’s a\ntough problem, so more time to evaluate is really what we took in June.\nDavid Wessel:\nMore time to evaluate, but looking at everything we know today, you still think we\nneed at least a couple more rate hikes?\nMary Daly:\n\n\fI think it’s a very reasonable projection to say a couple of rate hikes will be\nnecessary. But I’m also holding myself to what I think my team calls extreme data\ndependence, where I’m going to be watching and looking. And people ask me this\nquestion, I think it’s really an important one, well, how many more public data\nreleases will we get before the meeting? Can’t you decide today? And I said, well,\nif data just meant public data releases, well, probably we could decide the last\none that comes out will make the decision. But that’s actually not what we mean\nby data. We need talking to firms, and households, and worker groups and\ncommunity groups. And you can do that all the way up to the meeting. And then of\ncourse, you have the debates and conversation at the meeting, which help us\nmake the best decisions.\nDavid Wessel:\nBesides looking at all the data that comes in, and all the economists who work for\nyou, parsing the different ways to slice and dice inflation and labor market data,\nhow else do you go about getting information about what’s going on in the\neconomy?\nMary Daly:\nThe regional reserve banks are very well-equipped to do this. And it’s one of the\nthings that if you’re president of a reserve bank, you take quite seriously, and have\nteams of people helping you with. There’s some very formal ways we do it.\nThrough the Beige Book, many of you have heard of the Beige Book, we have a\nformal survey that the banks do and put together. Another way we do this is\nthrough our, we have boards of directors. We have boards of directors for the\nhead offices of each of the 12 reserve banks, but also the branches. We have\ncouncils. I have a community advisory council, an economic advisory council, a\ncommunity depository and institution council. And we’re looking at those councils\nregularly, meeting regularly to understand what the economy’s doing and what\nthey see in the economy.\nI also have CEO roundtables, and worker group roundtables. We have teams out\nin the field each month doing focus groups to collect this information. And then as\nyou might imagine, I enjoy talking to people. I’m out in my communities, and I travel\n\n\fall over my district. I have nine states, a big portion of the population and the\ngeography. And I spend a lot of time just talking with people.\nDavid Wessel:\nTalk about your Sunday afternoons.\nMary Daly:\nOkay, my Sunday afternoons, I will do that. On Sunday afternoons, I like to go to\nfairly sizable retail outlets. And it can be retail outlets that you buy lots of goods at,\nor it can be ones you buy home improvement things at. But I like to go to retail\noutlets, and I like to just wander around and talk to people. And I’ve managed to\ndo this without getting thrown out of the store. That’s the first thing. But I just go up\nto talk to people. And I tell them, “Look, I’m an economist and I’m really interested in\nhow you’re feeling about the trade-offs between jobs and price increases.” And\ninterestingly, what I keep hearing… and I like to go to areas where those margins\nwill be more binding for people. If I go to the wealthiest areas, they’ll say, “Well,\nneither one is affecting me.” It’s really the low and moderate income communities\nwhere they’re going to be least able to bear any of these trade-offs, that I go.\nAnd I keep hearing the same thing, and I have been hearing this for well over a\nyear: “Inflation is our number one problem.” And one young man, and this was\nseveral months back, probably earlier this year, late last year, I can’t actually\nremember, but it was so striking to me. He has a daughter, wife, and he tells me, I\nsaid, “What’s problematic for you, or what’s challenging to you? What do you\nworry about?” He said, “I have more job opportunities than I can take, because\nthere’s only 24 hours in a day and seven days in a week. And I’m working already\nthree jobs and I can’t do any more jobs. But every time I come to the store, I can\nafford less in my cart.” And then he picks up the eggs, and he picks up the milk, and\nhe says, “I can’t afford this. And so, I’m making trade-offs. I’m making more money\nthan I’ve ever made in my life, and I’m falling behind.” And he said it was a\ntreadmill.\nAnd in my mind, it’s a treadmill of indignity. Because inflation, you work hard, you\ndo everything you’re supposed to do, and inflation erodes. People ask me, why are\n\n\fyou so determined to get inflation down? And one of the key reasons is because\npeople like that young man, and then all the other Americans whose trade-offs\nmight be less severe, but believe in the Fed, that our job is to have price stability,\nand the current inflation rate is not the definition of price stability.\nThat’s how I spend my Sunday afternoons. But it really informs me as a policy\nmaker, because being resolute is something we need to do. You’ve heard all of the\npolicymakers say it. But being thoughtful about how we carry that out is also\nimportant. I don’t want to take that young man’s job, nor do I want him to have to\nworry about the price of eggs doubling every time he goes to the market. Those\nare the kinds of things that I learn on Sunday afternoon.\nDavid Wessel:\nAnd people don’t look at you like, “What are you, some kind of nut?”\nMary Daly:\nWell, I have that Midwestern personality, that I get away with a lot of stuff. I don’t\nthink I’m very threatening. I think one of the things you have to have as a\npolicymaker… and it’s such an interesting thing. I’m an economist by training, so\npeople don’t thinkDavid Wessel:\nThey don’t think you have a personality, because you’re an economist by trade?\nMary Daly:\nA personality, or an emotion, emotions, what are they good for? Kind of mentality.\nBut truthfully, people want to tell their stories about how they’re faring in the\nworld. But you have to be willing to listen and not say, “Well, here’s how I think\nyou’re feeling. Do you agree?” It’s really, “How are you feeling in the world? What\nare your struggles?” And so I don’t ever ask, “Do you care more about inflation or\nemployment?” I say, “You’re here at the place, how’s the job going for you? How are\nyou fairing in terms of this basket of goods you’re purchasing?” And those\nquestions tend to invite people to speak without thinking I’m crazy. I think if I was\n\n\fjust walking around with, and I never take a book. But if I was walking around with\na book and saying, “Okay, one on inflation, two on employment,” then I might get\nthrown out of the store.\nDavid Wessel:\nHow do you make sense of where we are in the economy now? I think most of us\nthought if you raised interest rates by five percentage points, that the labor\nmarket in particular would be at least, if not screeching to a halt, we wouldn’t be…\nwe have 200,000 jobs last month and people say, wow, we finally got it down. But\nfrom what you’ve said, that’s about twice what we need to keep up with growing\npopulation. Why do you think the economy has been so resilient, given the amount\nof tightening that you’ve done?\nMary Daly:\nI think that’s going to be a question that many economists and lots of young\nresearchers study. How did this happen? And so there’s many theories, but let me\nstart with things that I think must be material. First, we put a lot of support into the\neconomy. The Fed did. We had interest rates moved to zero very rapidly, with lots\nof support through the balance sheet and forward guidance. That was one piece\nof support. The fiscal agents also gave lots of support to the economy. We were\nfighting a pandemic. And the desire, I think of all policymakers, monetary or fiscal,\ncertainly of mine, was to not let something that nobody had created, nobody had\ndone this to themselves, derail lives and livelihoods for long periods of time. There’s\na pouring in of resources to support, to get people through the pandemic.\nBut then that support, coupled with the fact that for many people they’re just\nstuck at home, you can’t do anything. So you start saving money, saving money,\naccidentally, because you can’t use the money. The job market for many people\nremained strong. We know of the people who got laid off en masse and were\ngiven support, but if you’re a tech worker, you’re living well. You’re working at\nhome, you don’t pay any commuting costs, your salaries are going up and you\nhave lots of demand for your services. Those are all money in people’s pockets.\n\n\fYou get a stacking up of lots of support for the next part of the puzzle, which is we\ndon’t like to be locked down as a people. I have learned that. And so we got\nlocked down for good reasons, for health reasons, and then we came out with a\nvengeance in spending. We end up with lots of money to spend, and a great\ndesire to do so. And supply did not cooperate. And that’s true, national supply\nchains were not cooperating, global supply chains weren’t cooperating. COVID\nleft its wake in different ways at different times across the world. It just took for a\nlong time for global supply chains to get back to where they were. Meanwhile,\ndemand recovered very rapidly, and it doesn’t matter what country you’re in. All\ncountries’ demand recovered rapidly once the restraints on were lifted for health\nreasons. And people had income, so then we miss it.\nI think when I look back, you get three reasons why the economy hasn’t slowed\nmore given what we’ve done. One is that there’s just longer lags than we assumed.\nTwo is that the monetary policy transmission mechanism just is weaker than it\nused to be. And three is the economy had more underlying momentum than we\nhave really understood. And I think all of those could be true, and we should study\nall of them. But I really do see again and again and again, this idea that the\neconomy has a lot of momentum. And it takes a while, and we do have lags, so\nthat’s why we have to be so data dependent. But you just reflect on your own way\nof being, we really want to get back out and participate. And so does everyone\nelse on the globe, and we have the income to do it so far.\nDavid Wessel:\nAnd so what do you look at to know, when you say you’re data dependent, what\ndata are you talking about?\nMary Daly:\nI look at a wide range of data, as many of you may know, but I think it’s useful to\nremind everybody of, we have a lot of data that we can… a lot of it you see in the\nnewspapers on inflation, employment, dashboards underlying each of those\nthings. It’s not like we look at a single data point and say, okay, now we know\nwhat’s going on with inflation and employment. We have a labor market\ndashboard looking at all kinds of things, geographic, collection of real time data,\n\n\fdata that looks behind. All these are publicly available published data, and those\nare rich. And then we have our models and things that understand how they’re\nbehaving relative to history.\nAnd the first thing you learn when you go to school, is data’s a plural term. And so\ndata, plural, is also qualitative and quantitative data, and systematically\ncollected. Both of those pieces of data are important. And so we learn a lot from\nour conversations. Not just the Sunday conversations, but all the conversations\nthat my colleagues at the FOMC are having, when we’re out in the communities,\nwe’re talking to firms, and we put that together. And really they’re important\nbecause the data we get from published sources, there are a few leading\nindicators, but by and large, they’re telling us about what happened last month, or\nthe last six months. But even if they’re real time, they’re just as of today.\nBut what we really need to know to make policy well and reduce the chances\nwe’ll make over or under correction errors, is to look forward. And so, we have\nsurveys about what are people planning to do? Are they planning to hire more?\nAre you planning to quit? Are you planning to raise wages? Are you planning to\nask for a wage increase? These are all things that help us fill out the picture, and I\nbelieve make better policy for us.\nDavid Wessel:\nWhat do those tell you, those latter category, what do they tell you now about\nwhat’s happening to the pace of the economy?\nMary Daly:\nWhat I hear, and we just had our Economic Advisory Council meeting, and so\nthat’s people who have businesses from all over the nine western states. And\nthere’s a very diverse set of states. I have the Intermountain States, I have the\ncoastal states, and then I have Alaska and Hawai’i. This is a very diverse group of\nbusinesses and firms. And what I’m hearing is that there are signs the economy is\nslowing. Here’s an example: it’s easier to find workers than it was last year. And\nthen right after that they say, but it’s still hard.” But input prices aren’t rising as fast\nas they were last year, but they’re still rising. It’s not as easy for me to pass along\n\n\fcost increases to final goods or my sales, but I still can. What I’m hearing is things\nare getting better, in terms of the sustainability we’re trying to get between supply\nand demand, but we’re not there yet. It’s too early to declare victory. And that’s\nwhy if you look at the SEP projections from the FOMC for JuneDavid Wessel:\nSummary of Economic Projections.\nMary Daly:\nYeah, Summary of Economic Projections, sorry. The Summary of Economic\nProjections that we released where it said the median was two additional rate\nhikes this year. I consider that a reasonable projection, with a great deal of data\ndependence around that. We may end up doing less because we need to do less,\nwe may end up doing just that, we could end up doing more. The data will tell us,\nand it’s data like these.\nDavid Wessel:\nI’d say that when you look back over the last three years, how the Fed handled the\npandemic, how we got this unwelcome, unanticipated burst of inflation, how the\neconomy performed differently than many of us, including those at the Fed\nforecast, what are the two or three lessons you think you’ve learned about making\nmonetary policy from the past three years?\nMary Daly:\nThat’s a great question. And I will start by saying we’ll continue to learn these\nlessons. We’re just really at the beginnings of learning the things we will need to\nlearn. And we’ll have another framework review coming up, and that’s one of the\nthings I hope we will dig into, is what have we learned from the last five years that\nwill help us inform the next five years? But when I think back to what I’ve learned,\nI’ve learned this: that it’s really challenging, and it is challenging, hindsight’s always\nyour friend in these regards, but it’s challenging to just know how long the impact\nwill be of a seismic shock like a pandemic.\n\n\fI had the same experience when we came through the financial crisis. The\nfinancial crisis was a big shock. And economic models are not built to understand\nexactly how long that tail will be from that shock. And what we’ve found here in\nthe pandemic, is things just persisted for longer. It took longer than we imagined\nfor supply to come back. It’s been taking longer than we imagined for people to\nget past the idea that they’re revenge spending. It’s just been a learning period,\nthat we have to bring a lot of humility when a big shock occurs. Our models don’t\nusually incorporate how that’s going to play out in the economy. I think that’s a\nlesson.\nAnother lesson I’ve learned, and definitely I’m thinking about it as we go through\nthe next framework, is we came out of the financial crisis with a whole suite of\ntools. We have the balance sheet tool, we have forward guidance, and we were\nusing that to some extent before that. But we have all these tools, forward\nguidance, the funds rate, the balance sheet, and they were all very, very helpful.\nEssential, I would say. But one of the things you learn from them is that they’re not\nall equally agile. And so forward guidance, that’s a fairly easy and agile tool. We\ncan change what we say. The Fed funds rate turns out to be a pretty agile tool.\nThe balance sheet, that’s not such an agile tool. You get that thing going, and it\ntakes a while to change its direction, because abrupt changes could influence or\ndislocate financial markets.\nWhen you think of that, we’ve got to be very thoughtful about how we\ncommunicate the stance of policy, and how we don’t make all those tools work\nexactly the same way at exactly the same time. I’ve learned to have a lot more\ncomfort with raising the funds rate, while we’re still tapering asset purchases, and\nfiguring out how to communicate that well. So that people understand we’re\nnormalizing, we’re starting to normalize, but we can’t wait to raise the funds rate\nuntil the balance sheet, we can get that tapering the assets, because it could be\nlater than we would like. And forward guidance can’t solve all of the problems we\nhave. I think that’s another lesson.\nAnd then the third lesson is that it’s true of, I think, most institutions, whether you’re\nin private sector or you’re a public sector institution, we’re often fighting the last\nwar. The last war in this case was inflation. We couldn’t get inflation up to our\n\n\ftarget, no matter what we did. We keep working, working, working. Remember\n2019, we were trying to get it up to a 2%. And so you go into any next piece saying,\nokay, the same features are going to be with us. And so the transitory blip in\ninflation will be pulled down by the gravitational force of inflation’s going back to\n1.8. And that didn’t turn out to be true.\nAnd so, I think this discipline of not always fighting the last war, having an eye on\nthe last war and the lessons we learned, and having an eye on the future so that\nyou can say, okay, where are we headed and what features might make that?\nJust makes us more agile, and more able to move forward. The thing you have to\nlearn though, if you’re a central banker, perhaps any public servant, is it’s a\nhumbling experience. Because you do your very best work, you’re as earnest as\nyou can be, you try as hard as you can, and you still have to find that you didn’t do\neverything as you wish you would do if you had the benefit of hindsight. But we\nhave the benefit of learning. I think we have to take those lessons in, and use them\nfor going forward.\nDavid Wessel:\nLet’s see, make sure I understand. Lesson one is these big shocks have longer\nlasting effects than we anticipate. That it’s true of the global financial crisis, it’s true\nof the pandemic. Secondly, the Fed had said we’re not going to raise interest rates\nuntil we get done with the tapering of the quantitative easing, or the quantitative\ntightening, and that linking those, we wouldn’t do that again. You wouldn’t do that\nagain.\nMary Daly:\nI wouldn’t do it again. I don’t want to speak for anybody else. I don’t think linking\nthem has served us well.\nDavid Wessel:\nRight. And then the third thing is sort of a mindset thing. We were so used to\nhaving too little inflation, that it was hard to conceive that we needed to deal with\nthe other, the opposite.\n\n\fMary Daly:\nRight, yeah. Those are my three things. But again, I think [inaudible 00:23:28] young\nresearchers or older researchers, any researcher, this is ripe for study and I’m open\nto whatever you want to point me to.\nDavid Wessel:\nGreat. All right, I’m going to turn to the banking situation. Just to review, we had a\ncouple of bank failures. For historical reasons, we have many different bank\nregulators in the U.S. The Federal Reserve is responsible for the overall financial\nstability, and has responsibility assigned by law for the very biggest banks. But the\nsmaller and mid-sized banks, it kind of depends how they’re organized. Some of\nthe banks that failed were not quote, members of the Federal Reserve System, so\nyou don’t have to take the blame for their failure. But probably the most\nspectacular one, Silicon Valley Bank, was in the San Francisco district. First of all,\ncould you talk a little bit about, exactly how does this bank supervision work?\nWhat is the responsibility of the Board of Governors in Washington, and what is\nthe responsibility of the supervisors who are on your payroll in San Francisco?\nMary Daly:\nSure, absolutely. Happy to take that question, and unpack the supervisory efforts\nof the Fed. As the Vice Chair of Supervision, Michael Barr, and the Chair of the Fed,\nJ. Powell, Jerome Powell have said, supervision is a system-wide activity. But\ndifferent parts of the system have different roles and responsibilities. Let me walk\nthrough what those roles and responsibilities are, because they’re very welldefined and definitive, and often given to us by Congress. At the very top, I’ll start\nwith regulatory policy. The regulatory framework, as we call it. That is the\nresponsibility of the Vice Chair of Supervision. In this case Michael Barr, it was\nRandy Quarles and before that, Dan Tarullo. There are different vice chairs of\nsupervision, and those individuals hold the decision rights and the responsibility to\nset the regulatory framework.\nBut as David mentioned, we have a complex regulatory system in the United\nStates, and there’s regulators internationally. So the Vice Chair of Supervision\n\n\fwould work in that ecosystem, not just by himself, but work on that. But he sets the\nregulatory agenda. He just spoke this morning talking about that. And then if\nthere’s a vote required, that would be a Board of Governors vote in Washington,\nthat the governors would vote on this. The reserve banks don’t play any role in\npolicy. That’s the very first thing to know. We don’t have a voice in policy, we don’t\nhave a pen in policy, we don’t have a vote in policy.\nThe second piece of the supervisory system, is once the regulatory framework’s in\nplace… and it evolves and changes, it’s not a static framework. But once that’s\nthere, then there’s the second thing, which is the supervisory framework. And that’s\nhow are we going to take the regulatory policies in place and apply them to the\nbanks, in this case, in the fed’s purview? And that, again, is the responsibility of the\nVice Chair of Supervision, done at the Board of Governors. In this case, Michael\nBarr would set the supervisory framework. And that’s going to be everything from\nhow many exams are performed for banks of different sizes, what’s the intensity of\nexams, what’s in the stress test? How do we do those stress tests? That’s all the\npurview of the Vice Chair of Supervision.\nAnd then this third thing, and this is where reserve banks will come in, is the\nexecution of supervision. Once the regulatory framework and the supervisory\nframework are set, then you have to go out and actually do the day-to-day work\nto supervise the institutions in the Fed system. And there it’s a joint process, it’s a\njoint effort. It’s the effort of the teams in each of the reserve banks, so San\nFrancisco has a team, and so do all the other 11 banks in the Federal Reserve\nSystem, and the Board of Governors has a team. And those teams work together\nto supervise the institutions across the country.\nNow, you asked specifically what is the responsibility of the team in San\nFrancisco? And here’s something that many know, some may not. The team in San\nFrancisco, they work for the San Francisco Fed, as any… if you worked in Kansas\nCity, you worked for the Kansas City Fed. But the supervisory activities that those\nindividuals do, report up to the Board of Governors. And the reason you want that\nto be the case, is because you want supervision to be executed homogeneously,\nsimilarly across the country. You want to bank in North Dakota to have the same\nexperience as a bank in New York, as a bank in Florida, a bank in Texas or a bank\n\n\fin California. You don’t want variation depending on which regional Fed you’re at,\nor who’s the president.\nPresidents play an important role in the following way: the most important thing to\ntake away, is it’s a support role. My job is to support the supervision that the Vice\nChair of Supervision has set out. How do I do that? How do all regional Fed\npresidents do that? We staff the bank with people who can do the job, and do the\njob well. We ensure that they are being the best in public service, doing what’s\nrequired of them as supervisors. We’re interacting on a regular basis with the\nboard, because the board oversees these teams. And when gaps are exposed,\nwe work collectively to fix them. Or if we see gaps, we raise them to the Vice Chair\nof Supervision, and the supervisory staff so that we can get better.\nThe second role that a regional bank president would play, that I play, is banks in\nour system, they don’t work in a vacuum. They work in an ecosystem of the\neconomy. And so, one of the things that I take responsibility for is saying, here’s\nwhat’s going on in the economy in the district, and here’s what I see happening in\nthe banks. We talk to banks all the time about their experiences in the economy.\nThey can influence the economy, and the economy can influence them. And they\nreport that back. It’s some of the input for monetary policy, but it’s also the input for\nMichael Barr in supervision.\nI’ll conclude, because I want to make sure that you’ll ask me more questions,\nwherever clarification is needed, but I want to conclude with this. The thing about\nwhat Vice Chair Barr and Chair Powell said, and I want to just reemphasize, is that\nsupervision in the Fed is a system effort. And while many of us do not own the\ndecisions, those rest solely with the Board of Governors, or Michael Barr, the Vice\nChair, we all own the outcomes. And so, when the outcomes aren’t what we want\nthem to be, we collectively work to make them better going forward.\nDavid Wessel:\nAll right. Roughly how many supervisors work for the San Francisco Fed? Do you\nknow?\nMary Daly:\n\n\fOur tally, roughly, is a little bit under 400.\nDavid Wessel:\nAnd they work for you in that you’re their boss, but what they do is dictated or\noverseen by the Board of Governors?\nMary Daly:\nYep, that’s absolutely correct. As we say, they’re badged to the San Francisco Fed.\nWhen the badge that they have to get in would be to the San Francisco Fed, they\nwould be an employee of the San Francisco Fed. They’d participate in all the\naspects of being a San Francisco Fed employee, holding up to the values and\nthings that we espouse. But their work would be dictated and overseen by the\nBoard of Governors. And again, I just want to add because it’s so important, this is\na feature of the system that’s built in to get continuity. And it’s also because\nCongress gave the Board of Governors the responsibility of supervising and\nregulating banks, not the reserve banks.\nDavid Wessel:\nRight. It’s often said that the Federal Reserve Board in Washington has delegated\ncertain responsibilities to reserve banks.\nMary Daly:\nThat’s correct.\nDavid Wessel:\nOkay. This was not a great example of excellent supervision. I know there’s lots of\nissues with the management of Silicon Valley Bank, but Michael Barr’s report has\nsaid things like, the supervisory approach at Silicon Valley was too deliberative,\nfocused on the continued accumulation of supporting evidence before you did\nanything, and stuff. I’m curious, what lessons have you learned from this recent\nexperience, and what’s changing as a result?\nMary Daly:\n\n\fSure. One of the reasons that we do reviews, and I was very supportive of the\nreview that Michael Barr did, the GAO also did a review, there’s another GAO\nreport coming out in the fall, and an OIG report. And these reports and reviews\nare essential to us, learning from people outside of the exact system where they\nthink that we could have lessons. But the Vice Chair’s report has already identified\nseveral areas, and I want to pull on one of them that you mentioned specifically.\nAnd that is the deliberative nature of things, which is another piece of language to\nsay that there’s a slowness between when things are spotted, and when their\nenforcement actions or other things are taken.\nAnd that pipeline of speed is… well, that pipeline’s not very speedy at any juncture.\nOne of the things that we can do exactly at the San Francisco Fed with the teams,\nis not make everything perfect before you raise your hand. They’re raising their\nhands. You see it clearly in the report, identifying issues, but at every juncture if\nyou’re identifying issues, but then there’s another level of vetting, then you\nsometimes can be slower than you need to be.\nAnd I think that’s one of the things that the report has pulled out. That’s not just a\nSan Francisco thing, or a Board of Governors thing. That’s a way in which you can\nimprove the supervisory process by just making it… we’re spotting things, we’re\nraising our hands. You don’t have to be absolutely sure, because we are capable\npeople. We can raise this, and by we I mean the system, not me, because again, I\ndon’t play an active role in supervision, but raise issues and have deliberations,\nand see. I think the bias has to be raise issues, as opposed to wait until you have\nevery shred of evidence. And that’s what being too deliberative, I think, has meant.\nThat’s a lesson.\nThe other lesson that I got from this, and it’s something we can use, so you say, well\nMary, do you not have the strength at all there? And I would say absolutely not.\nWe have a lot of strength in this area. We know from periods of banking stress, or\nfrom periods where it’s an all hands on deck moment like the pandemic, where\nthere wasn’t really banking stress, but we needed the banks to intermediate, we\nare really good at moving things speedily. Look at the agility with which the Fed,\nthe FDIC, backed by Treasury, acted after Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank\nfailed. It was a weekend. And we have a new facility open, we have banks that\n\n\fwere caught up in any spillovers, getting the kind of liquidity they needed. That’s a\nrapidity that is obvious.\nThe question is, how do we bring that same sense of agileness, I would call this\nagility, how do we bring that to our everyday work, so that we continue to do\nthings as well, and as studiously, and as carefully as we’re used to, and we still can\nmove agilely through them so that we don’t end up with a finding of it’s too\ndeliberative?\nI’ll conclude though, with a lesson is that… and I want to use a specific example,\nbut the lessons can be broader than this specific example. And I already\nmentioned, we’re always fighting the last war. If you think about the financial\nstability report, you think about all the things we do after the financial crisis, we\nhave lots of study going out looking at vulnerabilities and things, but we also have\nto really have an eye at what’s going on around the corner.\nAn example is the difference between uninsured and insured deposits. The\nstickiness factor that we believed we had on in uninsured deposits, I think banks\nbelieved they had it, but we as regulators, supervisors, not just here in the United\nStates but across the globe, thought that these were near neighbors. And they\nturned out not to be. When people can move money quickly, and you have people\nwho know each other, you can have runs on institutions, and when they’re not\ninsured up to the… when they’re past the limit, those runs are easy to think about\ndoing. When you have, oh, my money not may be safe, I’m moving. I think we have\nto look around the corner and ask ourselves, how can we see things that could be\noccurring more quickly? But ultimately, we won’t know everything. We don’t have\na crystal ball. And so, that’s why having a well-capitalized banking system is\ncritical to having a healthy banking system.\nDavid Wessel:\nHave you changed anything in supervision at the San Francisco Fed as a result of\nthis?\nMary Daly:\n\n\fWe’re working actively with Michael Barr, and I would say it’s not just San\nFrancisco. This is one aspect of the Fed I hope you all will take away. The way we\nwork is as a system. The Vice Chair is working on, how do we think about revising\nthe supervisory framework writ large? How do we use all of us to do that? How do\nwe work together, and things, so it’s not just the San Francisco Fed, it’s supervision\nin general? Because ultimately, yes, it happened in San Francisco. But when a\nbank fails in another district, the thing I have in my mind is what do we learn from\nthat?\nBecause ultimately it’s a system, and it could have happened anywhere. It\nhappened in San Francisco, the lessons for me are very direct. I’m owning them, I’m\ntaking account of them and making sure that my teams… I tell my teams all the\ntime, our job is really simple. We learn from what happened, we take on the\nfeedback very, very seriously, and we get better right away. And so, one of the\nways we do that is we raise our hands, and we go in there. We were always\nraising our hands, but maybe you raise them higher. Or you say, what’s the\nescalation pattern for that? And I think that’s what is desired of us.\nDavid Wessel:\nDoes your staff feel that their concerns weren’t heard loudly enough in\nWashington?\nMary Daly:\nI don’t think I could say that, no. In fact, well, let me just be very clear: I cannot say\nthat. This is not a failure of a specific group in the Fed system. This is, and I think the\nVice Chair’s report really detailed. This is a step back, let’s look at the process, and\nlet’s find that the process of deliberation… and just when we think about\ndeliberation, I want to be very clear. Why are supervisors deliberative? Because\nthey want to be careful. They want to be right. These are private sector companies\ndoing jobs. They want to make sure that they’re not back to over and under\ncorrecting. You don’t want to ratchet down the financial system out of fear, so you\nwant to be careful, but you can easily move yourself one way or another. I think\nthis is a delicate balance, and my teams are going to work with the teams across\nthe system and do their best work.\n\n\fDavid Wessel:\nLet me ask you one final question on this before I turn to the audience. Each\nFederal Reserve Bank has a nine member board of directors. Three of the directors\nare banks, bankers elected by the bankers in the district. Three are not bankers\nelected by the bankers in the district. And three are appointed by the Federal\nReserve Board of Governors from Washington. Of the bankers on your board, one\nof them was the CEO of Silicon Valley Bank. And that leads, of course, to\nspeculation that somehow the supervisors went easy on SVB because the\npresident was on the board of directors. When people tell you that, I know I’m not\nthe first person to say that, what do you tell them?\nMary Daly:\nIt’s not true, but let me tell you why. Because I think when you look at it, you\nwonder. Let me tell you why that isn’t happening, what the mitigants in place are,\nwhat the ring fences are to protect that from happening. The very first thing to\nknow is supervision and the board of directors are completely separate from one\nanother. Remember when we started the conversation about banks, we talked\nabout how supervision is done in the United States, it’s done through the Board of\nGovernors. My teams in San Francisco work for the Board of Governors on the\nsupervisory role. And those issues are never, ever discussed at the board of\ndirectors meetings. The board of directors meetings are about managing the\nother aspects of the bank, and about learning about the economy, and getting\nthe votes on the discount rate for monetary policy.\nWe never talk about supervisory issues at board meetings. We never talk about\nbank supervision at board meetings. We’re focused on the economy writ large,\nand also the aspects of running the bank more generally. That ring fence is critical,\nand it’s what allows us to have, by statute, bankers on the system. Another fact\nthat people don’t know is that bankers are recused from any decisions around\nappointing bank presidents. They don’t get to choose, they don’t get to be\ninvolved, they don’t get to do any interviews. They’re just completely separated.\nAnd I see all of these checks and balances in place as the right things to do, given\nthat you want to get information from the banking system, it’s part of collecting\n\n\finformation from about the economy, but you definitely don’t want to blur those\nlines. While I understand that optics would be such to ask the question, I can\nabsolutely say that the protections in place prevent those types of things from\nhappening.\nDavid Wessel:\nJust to clarify, I believe it’s since Dodd Frank that when new bank presidents are\nchosen, it’s the six members of the board of directors who are not bankers, who\nhave that authority to recommend a choice to the board of directors.\nMary Daly:\nThat’s correct. Bankers are not participators in that process.\nDavid Wessel:\nOkay, I think we have time for some questions. Here’s what I recommend. The mic\ncoming over here. Stand up so we can see you, tell us who you are. And try not to\ngive a speech, or I’ll cut you off.\nWilliam Arnone:\nHi, Bill Arnone with the National Academy of Social Insurance. You mentioned,\nMary, in the beginning, your focus on data. Could you talk about the extent to\nwhich you feel the Fed has access to high quality, granular racial and ethnic data\nso that you can look at impacts of monetary policy on different groups from a\ndisparity perspective?\nMary Daly:\nSure. As I think many of you in the audience know, and you would certainly know,\nthere’s a lot more information available now, and a lot more attention paid to\ndisaggregating the data, if you will. So that we understand what’s happening not\nonly in different geographic areas, but also in different ethnicities, racial groups,\nby gender, by skill. And we do have a lot of information about that. The limits to\nunderstanding that more completely are about the data that are collected, which\nis why we have to go out and talk to our communities as well, to augment that. We\n\n\fcouldn’t just look at the current population survey data, do the cuts, and feel like…\nbecause the sample sizes aren’t sufficient to look in communities like that, and get\nreal time information, information you can make policy on.\nIt’s why we have a Community Advisory Council. It’s why we meet with groups\nregularly to ask how they’re experiencing the economy. It’s why we’ve added, in\nSan Francisco and many other districts, a community insights or community\nperspective section to the Beige Book. That was a recent edition over the last\ncouple of years, where we’re actually going into communities, largely communities\nof color or different ethnicities, where we had not as much information. I feel like\nwe are, relative to when I started at the Fed in 1996, we are eons further along. But\nthis is always a journey. And it’s also true that you think you have insight into one\ngroup, a pretty good handle on it, but it’s a pretty diverse world out there, where\nthe aggregates don’t really reflect the experience of anyone. And so, we have to\nkeep digging and finding those types of information.\nDavid Wessel:\nGentleman in the middle, and then Pedro in the back. Yeah, start there.\nSam:\nHey, I’m Sam. I’m just representing 20/20 Vision DC. I was wondering, you spoke a\nbit about the FSOC guidance, it’s undergoing a comment period right now. And I\nknow that they’re moving away potentially from a required cost benefit analyses\nfor potential non-banks to be designated as non-banks under FSOC guidance.\nAre there other quantitative ways you have of designating companies as formal\nnon-banks, to come under increased scrutiny through Barr’s FSOC evaluation?\nMary Daly:\nLet me start by, this is an example of where a Federal Reserve Bank president\ndoesn’t have policy… I don’t have any in inputs into the policy process, so I can’t\nreally speak to what you’re asking directly. But I can say that there are processes\nin place to designate the different groups, banks, non-banks, et cetera. And part\nof the public comment, and part of getting the information is understanding how\n\n\fpeople feel about those distinctions. But I can’t really comment on the specifics,\nbecause that’s the Vice Chair.\nDavid Wessel:\nPedro?\nPedro da Costa:\nThank you. Thanks, President Daly. Pedro da Costa for market news. I was\nwondering, how much credit tightening have you actually seen or heard about\nsince the SVB crisis? And is there any concern that the rebound and bond yields\nback to the levels that we saw in March, could lead to another wave of regional\nbank issues? Thanks.\nMary Daly:\nLet me start back in March, and this will be, again, just reflecting my views. There is\nno, as far as I know, precise way to calculate this. You’re thinking about what’s\nhappened to loan volumes, what’s happened to lending standards, and is that\nmore or less than we would expect given the slowing of the economy? Back in\nMarch, I actually, and I’ve said this publicly back then, I was thinking that the\ncredit tightening that could come from the banking stresses, not just the failure of\nSilicon Valley Bank, but the Signature, First Republic, the other banks that were on\nrisk lists from investors, that could end up with maybe a 25 to 50 basis point\nequivalent rate hike. At this point, it seems to be less than that so far. And in fact, if\nyou plot aggregate lending, you would see that it’s not really different than what\nyou’d expect, given the projected slowing of the economy. And when you look at\nthe SLOOS, you look at lending standardsDavid Wessel:\nSLOOS.\nMary Daly:\nYes, SLOOS.\n\n\fDavid Wessel:\nSenior Loan Officer Survey.\nMary Daly:\nSenior Loan Officer Survey.\nDavid Wessel:\nWe have an acronym-free zone up here.\nMary Daly:\nWell, luckily I have an interpreter. That’s really important to me, because\nsometimes I remember the acronym but forget what it stands for. Because it’s\nembedded, it’s in my DNA now. But if you look at all of those indicators, what you\nsee is they were starting to show tightening and slowing loan growth before the\nbank stresses. And that’s consistent with what we would expect. We’re raising\ninterest rates. You want banks to look at their balance sheets, understand that the\neconomy’s going to slow, and start positioning for interest rate risk and other\nthings. And this is exactly how we would want them to behave.\nAt this juncture, here’s my sense of things. If you look at history, it takes a while,\ncredit shocks have a little bit of, they have a lag. I don’t think we can declare there\nis no credit shock from the banking stresses. I think we still could see it coming in\nthe next number of months. I have an open mind about what that’s going to be.\nAnd it’s another reason I was very supportive of standing pat in June, and waiting\nfor more data to come out.\nThe other thing I will say about them, is that we’re seeing a lot of difference\ndepending on what size the bank is. The big banks, and even the pretty large\nregionals, they seem to be just in line with the slowing in the economy. But I still\nhear from my community banks that they are definitely tightening more, out of a\nconcern about larger banking stresses. But how much more, is hard to say at this\npoint.\n\n\fAnd then the final thing, is that ultimately what I walk away with is that the\nbanking sector is sound and resilient. And that’s partly because of the swift and\ndecisive action that the Fed, and this would be the Board of Governors, the Board\nof Governors with the FDIC and the Treasury took. And the backstop facility we\nhave, the BTFP, the…\nBank Term Lending Facility. It’s really hard to do it when you’re on stage, actually. If\nI was in my office, I’d be rattling off these words.\nDavid Wessel:\nI think the problem is that there should be like some regulation: no acronyms\nwithout vowels.\nMary Daly:\nThat would be helpful. That would be really helpful. But you’re doing it on a\nweekend, and so it’s hard to come up with a name. I think that’s another part that’s\nhard. But you have thisDavid Wessel:\nThat’s what GPT is for.\nMary Daly:\nBut you have the swift action, which has calmed the stresses quite considerably.\nAnd so, now it’s about understanding, banks are getting their balance sheets in\norder. They’re responding to the fact that investors and consumers have a new line\nof sight into balance sheets of their institutions, and managing through that. And\nour job, and my job as a policymaker, is to understand that that can still have a\npotential impact on the economy. And be watchful for that, as we do the very\nhard job of trying to get to the last part of our rate hiking cycle before we can\n[inaudible 00:48:40].\nDavid Wessel:\n\n\fAnd I think the other part of his question was, as bond yields have gone up, that\nmeans that the bank’s losses on their portfolios haveMary Daly:\nSure. But that’s just recently happened, and so I guess I try to hold myself to not a\nweek’s worth of market data, not a month’s worth of employment data. We’ll come\nback to that if it should stick.\nDavid Wessel:\nMary, the economics profession has a problem with diversity. It has a problem that\nit has been seen as hostile to women and to people of color. It has become very\nmuch physics-like on the math. I think that that may turn off some people, because\nit seems so unconnected to their lives. I wonder if you could think for a minute, as if\nthe audience here were first and second year students in economics, about why\nyou think it has been rewarding for you, and how you dealt with the fact that you\ndidn’t look like most of the other people who were getting PhDs when you got\nyours?\nMary Daly:\nYeah, absolutely. Here’s the thing about economics: in order to do economics well,\nyou have to know a lot about human behavior. You have to be a student of\npsychology, and a student of psychology in the masses. And economics, I love my\nprofession. Why do I love it? Because every day I do something, it matters for lots\nand lots of people. And I don’t think that responsibility lightly. But I like that I get up\nevery morning thinking what I study, what I say, how I think about the world,\nmatters for people I will never meet, and I better do my job well. And when I don’t\ndo it as well as I’d like, I’d better do it again and try harder the next time.\nThere are a few professions for me that I’ve found, that had that kind of rewarding\nthing, that you have to deeply understand human behavior. You have to go on\nSunday afternoons, and ask people what they’re thinking. And you have to\ncombine that with an adeptness at using models and using history. You have to be\na great student of history as well. And you have to put all that together, and you\nhave to combine the science of that, with the art of understanding that the data\n\n\fwon’t fit together today the same way they fit together just a year ago or two\nyears ago. And figuring out what that picture is, so you can get the best policy\noutcome is extremely rewarding.\nAnd when I, like many young people when I said, well, not too many people\naround here look like me, or think like me, or want to do what I want to do, is this\nthe right profession to me? One of my early mentors said, “Well, if not you, then\nwho? The world needs you, Mary, to do this.” And so, my response to each and\nevery one of you who might get a little wiggly and say, “I don’t know, it’s not that\nwelcoming,” well, our job is to make it more welcoming. My job is to make it more\nwelcoming than what was welcomed me, and that will pass on to you, and then\nyou’ll come.\nBut my bottom line for inviting you to be dedicated to the profession like I have, is\nit’s extremely rewarding, and we need you. Look at the world we live in. It needs a\nlot of support from people who have a great empathy for humans, a great\nunderstanding of the data, and a dedication to history and doing better. You put\nall those things together, and every young person I meet, I’m like, I’m an\nambassador for economics. And the thing I say is, if you ever get, you’re on a dark\nnight and it doesn’t feel like you belong, just call me. And a lot of people have my\ntext, by the way, but luckily they text me instead of calling me at three in the\nmorning.\nDavid Wessel:\nGreat. Please join me in thanking President Daly. Thank you. And if I can ask a\nfavor for the people in the room, just stay in your seats until President Daly leaves,\nand then you’re free to go about the rest of your day. Again, thank you all for\ncoming.\nMary Daly:\nAnd I’ve been told I-\n\nSummary\n\n\fPresident Mary C.

            "content": "U.S. DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY\nRemarks by Secretary of the Treasury Janet L. Yellen at\nIndependent Community Bankers of America (ICBA) 2023 Capital\nSummit\nMay 16, 2023\n\nAs Prepared for Delivery\nGood morning, everyone. It’s great to be back at ICBA. And it’s wonderful to see so many familiar\nfaces. I’d like to first thank Derek and Rebeca for their leadership of this important organization.\nAs some of you know, this is not my first time speaking at ICBA. One of my first major speeches as\nChair of the Federal Reserve was at your 2014 Washington Policy Summit. Our nation has seen\nsignificant economic and technological change since then. But my conviction remains as firm as it\nwas nearly a decade ago: that a broad and diverse banking system is at the core of a strong U.S.\nfinancial system. Our community banks are vital to the health of the American economy and the\nfinancial wellbeing of American families and businesses.\nToday, I’d like to share my views about the strength of our community banks, the recent\ndevelopments in the regional banking system, and the debt limit situation.\n\nCOMMUNITY BANKS IN OUR ECONOMY\nAmerica’s community banks have always served as a cornerstone of many cities and towns across\nour country. But your role has proved even more important in recent years.\nOver the past two years, the United States has mounted a historic economic recovery from the\npandemic. Take the labor market. The data is clear: our country is back to work. Over 12 million\njobs have been created since President Biden took office. In 2020, our unemployment rate surged\nto nearly 15 percent as the world economy came to a standstill. It has now dropped to a historic 3.4\npercent. That’s a more than 50-year low. This resurgence has been inclusive and broad-based. The\nHispanic unemployment rate hit a record low last September. And the Black unemployment rate\ndid the same earlier this year.\nBut this historic economic progress was not preordained. It was made possible by the partnership\nbetween the federal government and many institutions in this room.\n\n\fCommunity banks served as a pillar of economic stability for their local communities during the\npandemic. Large banks hold most of the assets in the banking sector. But smaller banks like yours\nhave long played an outsized role in the provision of traditional financial services. As an example,\ncommunity banks provide around 40 percent of small business loans. And they provide over 60\npercent of farm loans. Strong client relationships and specialized knowledge of your communities\nenabled you to extend loans to American businesses under trying circumstances. These actions\nhelped them stay open and expand. And your work helped us achieve a remarkable feat: many\nAmerican households emerged from the pandemic in a stronger financial position than they were\ngoing into it.\nYou take your responsibility to your communities very seriously. According to one survey, over a\nthird of community banks reduced or eliminated late-payment penalties on loans or credit cards\nduring the pandemic. And a similar percentage did the same for fees on deposit accounts.\nI’ve felt your impact firsthand through our relief efforts. In the middle of the pandemic, Treasury\ncollaborated with banks across the country to deliver economic impact payments to millions of\nfamilies. Our support helped Americans put food on the table and keep a roof over their heads.\nWith your help, we deployed assistance to hundreds of thousands of homeowners facing\nforeclosure. And we worked together to deliver enhanced Child Tax Credit payments that helped\ncut child poverty nearly in half in 2021. We are continuing to partner to inject much-needed capital\ninto underserved communities through programs like the State Small Business Credit Initiative\nand the Emergency Capital Investment Program. In the prior iteration of the Initiative, lenders with\nless than $10 billion in assets accounted for 95 percent of all program-supported loans. Your banks\nare playing an equally important role in our current program.\nAs our nation has recovered, I’m pleased to say that the health and financial performance of our\ncommunity banks have gotten stronger as well. In 2020, community banks – like all banks –\nreported pressures from the pandemic. Those pressures have largely been addressed over the past\ntwo years. Earnings have improved: community banks reported higher net income in 2022 than\nbefore the pandemic began. Loan growth has been strong and broad-based. And according to the\nlatest reports from regulators, capital ratios remain robust. Asset quality is favorable. And\ncommunity banks have ample liquidity to serve their customers. Their performance is a testament\nto the good management of many community banks across the country.\n\nRECENT DEVELOPMENTS IN THE REGIONAL BANKING\nSYSTEM\n\n\fLet me turn to a topic that is on the minds of everyone in this room: the recent developments in\nthe regional banking system.\nIn March, the federal government took forceful actions to strengthen public confidence in the\nbanking system – following the failures of two large regional banks. The situation has stabilized\nsince then. Aggregate deposit outflows have steadied. And the Fed’s Bank Term Funding Program\nand discount window are working as intended. Like our community banks, the U.S. banking\nsystem remains sound. There is strong liquidity and capital in the system.\nI believe that the decisive actions that we took in March to protect depositors and provide\nadditional liquidity to the system mitigated the very serious risk of broader financial contagion in\nthe banking system. Let me be clear: we did not take these steps to aid specific institutions or\nclasses of institutions. These actions were necessary to prevent the difficulties facing two specific\nbanks from spilling over to other banks – including banks on Main Streets across the country.\nOur actions in March were narrowly targeted. Management, shareholders, and debtholders were\nnot protected by the government. Taxpayers did not bear any costs in the resolution of the two\nfailed banks. And I believe that our actions reduced the risk of further bank failures that would\nhave imposed losses on the Deposit Insurance Fund, which is paid for through fees on insured\nbanks. To be sure, there have been some aftershocks of the March developments, including the\nresolution of First Republic. But I do not believe that these developments are a sign of any shift in\nthe fundamental health of the banking system.\nWe remain vigilant and continue to closely monitor conditions. As I’ve said, we have a set of\neffective tools at our disposal. We are prepared to take further actions if needed – including if\nsmaller institutions suffer deposit runs that pose the risk of contagion. Americans should rest\nassured that their deposits are safe. Their deposits will be there when they need them.\nLooking forward, President Biden has said that we must make sure “we are not in this position\nagain.” He has urged the federal banking agencies to consider a set of common-sense reforms that\nwould strengthen the oversight of regional banks. President Biden and I are committed to do so\nwhile minimizing regulatory burden particularly on our nation’s smallest banks, which we know\nface unique challenges. Indeed, the President’s proposals would impose no additional regulations\non traditional community banks.\nFor example, the President has suggested exempting community banks from the costs of\nreplenishing the Deposit Insurance Fund resulting from the two bank failures in March. Last week,\nthe FDIC issued its proposal for a special assessment as required by law. I was encouraged that the\nproposed assessment would not apply to any banking organizations with $5 billion or less in\n\n\funinsured deposits. In practice, this means that nearly all of the assessment would be paid by large\nbanks.\n\nDEBT LIMIT\nIt’s important for me to use our remaining time to speak about one specific decision in front of\nCongress that will have significant implications for your businesses – and for the broader domestic\nand global economy.\nThat’s the debt limit.\nYesterday, I told Congress that we still estimate that Treasury will likely no longer be able to satisfy\nall of the government’s obligations if Congress has not acted to address the debt limit by early\nJune – and potentially as early as June 1. It is impossible to predict with certainty the exact date\nwhen Treasury will be unable to pay all of the government’s bills. And I will provide an additional\nupdate to Congress next week as more information becomes available.\nNonetheless, our current best estimate underscores the urgency of this moment: it is essential that\nCongress act as soon as possible.\nIn my assessment – and that of economists across the board – a U.S. default would generate an\neconomic and financial catastrophe. Over the past few years, American families and businesses –\nincluding many of yours – have worked hard to mount a historic economic recovery. A default\nwould reverse all of the hard-earned progress that we’ve made. And it would set us back even\nfurther.\nOur economy would suddenly find itself in an unprecedented economic and financial storm.\nMillions of American families that rely on payments from the federal government would likely go\nunpaid. This ranges from 66 million Social Security beneficiaries to millions of veterans and\nmilitary families who have served our country honorably. A default could cause widespread\nsuffering as Americans lose the income that they need to get by. And the resulting income shock\ncould lead to a recession that destroys many American jobs and businesses.\nThe economic crisis would be exacerbated by possible disruptions to the federal government’s\noperations. Essential services that enable global commerce rely on the work of federal employees\nand contractors. That includes air traffic control and law enforcement, border security and\nnational defense, and food safety and our telecommunications systems. But federal agencies\nwould be unable to pay all of their bills. It is unclear if, and how, critical government services would\ncontinue to function.\n\n\fAnd of course, the financial crisis that accompanies a default on our debt could multiply the\nseverity of the downturn. The U.S. Treasury market serves as the very bedrock of the global\nfinancial system. There’s a reason for that: the world has never doubted that America will pay the\nprincipal and interest on its bonds – in full and on time. That’s a fundamental principle of modern\nfinance. A default would crack open the foundations upon which our financial system is built. It is\nvery conceivable that we’d see a number of financial markets break – with worldwide panic\ntriggering margin calls, runs, and fire sales.\nWhat could all of this add up to?\nThe White House Council of Economic Advisers has simulated the impact of a protracted default. It\nfinds that it could lead to a downturn as severe as the Great Recession. In its simulation, over 8\nmillion Americans lose their jobs. Business and consumer confidence take a substantial hit. The\nvalue of the stock market is slashed by about 45 percent – wiping out years of retirement and other\nhousehold savings. Moody’s Analytics used a different model to project the effects of a default. But\nit reached a similar conclusion. In its study, more than 7 million Americans lose their jobs. The\nunemployment rate surges to over 8 percent. And $10 trillion in household wealth is wiped out.\nIf that sounds catastrophic – that’s because it is.\nNow, this crisis is entirely preventable. The solution is simple. Since 1960, Congress has raised or\nsuspended the debt limit about 80 times – under both Republican and Democratic\nadministrations. Congress should simply do so again. Raising or suspending the debt limit does\nnot authorize new federal spending. It simply allows the government to make good on its existing\ncommitments. Let me be clear: if Congress does not address the debt limit, there are no good\noptions that Treasury or the government can use to save us from catastrophe.\nWe are a country that keeps its word. Generations of Americans have protected the full faith and\ncredit of the United States. That has been a bedrock of our global economic leadership. There is no\ngood reason to squander that reputation now – and to trigger a manufactured crisis of our own\ncreation.\nTime is running out. Every single day that Congress does not act, we are experiencing increased\neconomic costs that could slow down the U.S. economy. In 2011, we resolved the debt ceiling crisis\nright before the government had to stop making payments. But that eleventh-hour brinksmanship\nled to the first-ever downgrade of our credit rating in history. Consumer confidence fell by over 20\npercent. The S&P 500 plummeted by about 17 percent. Spreads for mortgages and auto loans\nwidened, which generally makes it harder for households to afford houses and cars.\n\n\fWe are already seeing the impacts of brinksmanship: investors have become more reluctant to\nhold government debt that matures in early June. And the impasse has already increased the debt\nburden to American taxpayers – as the leaders of the Treasury Borrowing Advisory Committee said\nlast week.\nToo many businesses – including yours – are having to spend your time planning around the\npotential risk of U.S. default, instead of thinking about longer-term investments that will grow your\nenterprises and boost the economy. And too many households are having to worry about how they\nwill get by without the payments that the government has promised them – and that these\nAmerican families have earned.\nThe U.S. economy hangs in the balance. The livelihoods of millions of Americans do too. There is\nno time to waste. Congress should address the debt limit as soon as possible.\n\nCLOSING\nTo close, I’d like to return to where I began. The economic progress that we have made over the\npast two years has been premised on the fact that communities are able to access the credit they\nneed. Community banks have been at the forefront of this effort – as they have been for decades.\nI look forward to working with you to promote a strong banking system and advance the economic\nwellbeing of the communities we serve.\nThank you.\n####\n\n\f"

One year ago\nat the G7 Finance Ministers meeting, we collectively had our first conversations about the G7 price cap.\nToday, there is already clear evidence that it is achieving our goals of hurting Russia's ability to prosecute its\nillegal war and helping the global economy.\nLooking ahead, we are redoubling our efforts to choke off sanctions evasion and combat Russian military\nprocurement in key jurisdictions. Our teams are traveling around the world and conducting joint\nengagements to identify and disrupt evasion networks. Russia's increasing reliance on these channels is a\nsign of its growing desperation.\nWe will also discuss support for Ukraine’s economy. As President Biden has said, the United States will stand\nwith Ukraine for as long as it takes. The United Kingdom is a close partner of ours in this effort.\nSecond, we will discuss reforms to evolve the multilateral development banks to better meet the challenges\nwe face in an interconnected world, like climate change, pandemics, and fragility and conflict.\nThese challenges disproportionately impact the poorest and most vulnerable, and better addressing them is\nvital to boosting resilience and enabling progress on poverty reduction and inclusive and sustainable\ngrowth.\n\n\fThird, we will discuss ways to strengthen the global economy and engage with lower-income countries. I\nappreciate Chancellor Hunt’s partnership in bolstering our economic security and resilience and supporting\nlow- and middle-income countries, which can become critical parts of a robust global supply chain.\nWe will also continue our work together to address debt challenges faced by many lower and middle-income\ncountries, lower global energy prices while meeting our climate commitments, and diversify our supply\nchains in critical sectors.\n\nThank you very much.\n\n###\n\n\f"

At the G7 and beyond, we\nneed to address pressing issues around the world, such as debt vulnerabilities in emerging market\nand developing economies and evolving the multilateral development banks.\nI am deeply proud of the strong relationship between the United States and Japan, which is based\non trust, respect, and deep ties.\nThe U.S.-Japan Alliance is a pillar of global stability and of our shared commitment to a free and\nopen Indo-Pacific. I look forward to continuing to build on the strong foundation of our\nrelationship as we discuss new areas of bilateral and multilateral cooperation.\n\n\f\f"

Yellen in Kyiv, Ukraine | U.S. Department of the Treasury\n\nU.S. DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY\nRemarks by Secretary of the Treasury Janet L. Yellen in Kyiv,\nUkraine\nFebruary 27, 2023\n\nAs Prepared for Delivery\nThank you, everyone.\nFor over a year now, I have witnessed the heroic resistance of the Ukrainian people from afar.\nToday, I see it in person.\nThe strength of the Ukrainian military. The resilience of Ukraineʼs government. The courage of\nthe people of Ukraine. Faced with a brutal and unprovoked invasion, you are standing strong.\nOne year ago, some believed that Russia would secure a quick and decisive victory over Kyiv.\nRussian forces had advanced within sight of this very school. But today, Ukraine still stands.\nThe victory that Putin expected has turned into a strategic failure. Putinʼs troops have faced\ndefeats on the battlefield. The Russian economy is weaker and more isolated. And NATO and\nour global coalition stand united behind Ukraine.\nThe foundation of Ukraineʼs successful resistance has been the remarkable resolve and\nresilience of the Ukrainian people. We see that here at this school – where students and\nteachers came together to resist the Russian advance.\nI know that this fight has come at great cost to all of you. Many of you have lost family\nmembers and close friends. Across Kyiv and Ukraine, we see evidence of the brutality of\nPutinʼs military. The bombing of hospitals. The destruction of cultural sites. Deliberate attacks\non civilian energy grids designed to cause widespread su ering in the middle of winter.\nBut you have fought on despite it all. As you do, I want you to know this: you are not alone.\nWe are with you. The United States has your back – and we will stand with you for as long as\nit takes.\nFrom the start, we have been proud to support you. Not only with words, but with actions. We\nhave a basic moral duty to stand by you in your darkest hour. But as President Zelenskyy has\nsaid, our support is not “charity.” Itʼs an investment in “global security and democracy.” It is in\nhttps://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy1305\n\n1/5\n\n\f3/2/2023\n\nRemarks by Secretary of the Treasury Janet L. Yellen in Kyiv, Ukraine | U.S. Department of the Treasury\n\nour vital interests to see a free and stable Europe. And it is critical that we deter any other\nwould-be aggressors who may be emboldened to otherwise seize territory.\nToday, Iʼd like to focus on the importance of two pillars of our support for Ukraine. First, we\nare providing direct assistance that is critical for Ukraineʼs resistance – including economic\nsupport to shore up its government and economy. And second, we are leading an\nunprecedented multilateral sanctions coalition to impose severe economic costs on Russia for\nits war.\n\n1. ASSISTANCE F OR UKRAINE\nThe United States is proud to be Ukraineʼs largest bilateral donor. Over the past year, we have\nprovided close to $50 billion in security, economic, and humanitarian assistance. Weʼre also\nproud to be joined by an international coalition of partners, including the European Union and\nother members of the G7.\nMuch of the public focus has been on the critical security support we are providing for\nUkraineʼs brave military: tanks, air defense systems, ammunition, and more. But my visit to\nKyiv today underscores the importance of our economic support.\nThe United States has provided $13 billion in economic assistance to Ukraine. Today, I am\nproud to announce the transfer of an additional amount of over $1.2 billion. Thatʼs the first\ntranche of about $10 billion in direct budget support that the United States will provide in the\ncoming months.\nOur economic support is helping keep the Ukrainian government and critical service providers\noperational under extraordinary circumstances. Just as security assistance bolsters the front\nlines, I believe that this economic assistance is fortifying the home front – thereby\nstrengthening Ukraineʼs resistance.\nFirst, our funds are helping keep government civil servants on the job. Ukraineʼs military\nsuccesses are first and foremost the product of the bravery and skill of Ukrainian soldiers. But\na sustained military e ort cannot succeed without an e ective government at home. The\nUkrainian government serves as a bedrock of stability for the nation at a time of war.\nMaintaining an e ective government is indispensable to Ukraineʼs capacity to respond to\nRussian attacks and other emergencies.\nSecond, our economic support is keeping essential public services running. These services help\nmaintain economic and social stability for Ukrainians. They help mitigate the emergence of an\nhttps://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy1305\n\n2/5\n\n\f3/2/2023\n\nRemarks by Secretary of the Treasury Janet L. Yellen in Kyiv, Ukraine | U.S. Department of the Treasury\n\neven greater humanitarian crisis. Our funds help pay for emergency personnel: from\nfirefighters who answer the call when missiles strike to medical professionals who treat sick\nand wounded civilians. They help fund teachers – at this school and many others – so they can\ncontinue to educate Ukraineʼs youth. Our assistance also helps provide aid to Ukrainians who\nare bearing the biggest brunt of the war, such as those internally displaced.\nThird, we are working with our partners through the European Bank for Reconstruction and\nDevelopment to keep basic infrastructure and supply chains working. A functioning Ukrainian\neconomy is vital to its ability to finance a robust defense e ort. We are providing access to\nworking capital for businesses in critical sectors like agriculture, energy, and transportation.\nFor example, our funds are helping repair civilian power grids damaged by Russiaʼs barbaric\nmissile strikes. They also enable the continued export of grain.\nWe welcome President Zelenskyyʼs ardent commitment to handling these funds in the “most\nresponsible way.” Our delivery partners at the World Bank have instituted robust safeguards\nfor transparency and accountability. And the U.S. government has deployed independent,\nthird-party monitors to bolster oversight. Even before the war, President Zelenskyy pursued\nan agenda to strengthen good governance. We share his recognition that these standards are\njust as important in wartime as in peacetime. These standards enable vital assistance to reach\npeople in need. They bolster Ukraineʼs European Union ambitions. Transparency and\naccountability will become even more important as Ukraine rebuilds its infrastructure and\nrecovers from the impacts of the war.\nAs the U.S. continues to support Ukraine economically, we will press for more action by our\nallies and partners. We expect to see the IMF move speedily toward establishing an ambitious\nand fully financed program. And we are ready to support Ukraine in making sure this happens\nin a timely way. We are also committed to supporting Ukraine in its eventual reconstruction\ne ort. In preparation, Ukraine, the United States, the European Commission, and the rest of\nthe G7 have established an inclusive platform to mobilize donors from across the globe and\ncoordinate assistance flows.\n\n2. ECONOMIC SANCT IONS AGAINST RUSSIA\nAs heroic Ukrainian soldiers repel Russian attacks, we are also leading a multilateral coalition\nto impose heavy costs on Russia for its barbaric war. We have one objective: to help end\nRussiaʼs war. Toward this aim, our coalition of over 30 countries has mounted the swi est,\nmost unified, and most ambitious sanctions regime in modern history.\nhttps://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy1305\n\n3/5\n\n\f3/2/2023\n\nRemarks by Secretary of the Treasury Janet L. Yellen in Kyiv, Ukraine | U.S. Department of the Treasury\n\nWe have taken coordinated actions to degrade Russiaʼs military-industrial complex and deny\nRussia the revenue to fund its war. We are systematically disrupting Russiaʼs military supply\nchains. This is making it harder for Russia to replace the over 9,000 military vehicles, artillery,\nand other pieces of equipment it has lost on the battlefield. We are going a er Iranian drone\ncompanies and facilitators that have supplied weapons to Russia. We have also enacted\nexport controls to restrict Russiaʼs access to cutting-edge technology. These measures are\nparticularly powerful because the U.S. and our allies are the main producers – or in some\ncases, the only producers – of many critical military inputs. In the past year, Russia has\nsu ered production shutdowns at key defense-industrial facilities. And itʼs struggling amid\nshortages of inputs for tanks, aircra , and submarines.\nThe United States and our partners have also taken a range of innovative actions to reduce\nthe revenues that the Kremlin can use to fund its war. We have cut o major parts of the\nRussian financial system from the global economy. Our coalition has also immobilized vast\ncentral bank reserves that Russia was counting on to fuel its war e ort. We have implemented\nprice caps on Russian seaborne exports of crude oil and refined products. These caps have\nhelped drive Russian government oil revenues nearly 60 percent lower last month than they\nwere immediately a er the invasion.\nAs you saw with our new actions last week, we will not rest until the war ends. A central piece\nof our strategy in 2023 will be to disrupt Russiaʼs attempts to evade our sanctions. We will\nimprove coordination with our allies. We will target dual-use inputs that Russia has been\nrepurposing for its war e ort. And we will raise the pressure on companies and jurisdictions\nthat are backfilling or facilitating sanctions evasion. Let me be clear: the United States will\nnot hesitate to use our authorities to disrupt entities that help the Kremlin evade our\nsanctions.\n\n3. CLOSING\nUkraine has now entered the second year of a full-scale war it did not choose. It is engaged in\na battle – not to dominate, but to defend. To defend not only Ukrainian lives and territory –\nbut freedom and the free world itself.\nThe great Ukrainian poet Taras Shevchenko once wrote: “the history of my life is a part of the\nhistory of my homeland.” That was true in 1991, 2004, and 2014. It is especially true now. The\ngrief of Bucha, the resistance in Mariupol, and the countero ensives in Kherson and Kharkiv – I\nknow these are events seared into your and your nationʼs consciousness.\nhttps://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy1305\n\n4/5\n\n\f3/2/2023\n\nRemarks by Secretary of the Treasury Janet L. Yellen in Kyiv, Ukraine | U.S. Department of the Treasury\n\nI am honored to stand in Kyiv today with you. There will be di icult days ahead. Many of you\nhave endured more su ering in the past year than most people do in their entire lifetimes. And\nyet, you have told me that what youʼve been through only hardens your resolve.\nJust as your life is a part of the history of Ukraine – I believe that Ukraine is a central part of\nthe history of the free world. And you are writing our history right now. As you do, I hope you\nknow this: America stands with you in this fight for freedom. And we will be by your side to\nhelp you rebuild.\nThank you.\n\nhttps://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy1305\n\n5/5\n\n\f"

Yellen at Wreath\nLaying Ceremony in Kyiv, Ukraine\nFebruary 27, 2023\n\nAs Prepared for Delivery\nI am honored to gather with you today. St. Michaelʼs Square reminds us of the deep history of\nthis city – a history tracing back around 1,500 years. And yet we are also reminded today that\nthe future is not preordained. People who stand up with courage have the capacity to shape\nthe course of history.\nOver the past year, Ukraine has been writing the next chapter of its history – with its heroic\nfight for freedom. Today, I am witnessing firsthand the devastating toll of Putinʼs brutal war. I\nknow that what Iʼm seeing here in Kyiv reflects just a small fraction of the hardship that\nUkrainians have faced over the past year. Thousands of innocent civilians have been killed; so\nmany more livelihoods shattered.\nAnd yet, Ukraine still stands strong. The Ukrainian resistance has inspired millions of people\nacross the globe. In the face of trying circumstances, the Ukrainian military has fought\nvaliantly in defense of the Ukrainian homeland and the universal principles of freedom and\ndignity. More broadly, the Ukrainian peopleʼs strength and resilience have captivated the\nglobe. Ukraineʼs blue-and-yellow flag hangs down the hall from my o ice at the Treasury\nDepartment in Washington. That is only one example of how Ukraineʼs fight for justice has\ninspired the world.\nWe have pledged to do our part to support the Ukrainian people. Not only with words, but\nwith actions. We will continue to work with our international coalition to provide military,\neconomic, and humanitarian assistance to Ukraine. And we will continue to impose severe\ncosts on the Kremlin for its illegal war. As President Biden has said, we will stand by Ukraine\nfor as long as it takes.\nUkrainian courage takes di erent forms. Last December, during Russiaʼs brutal assault, you lit\na Christmas tree in the middle of Old Kyiv, just a few hundred feet away. It had not been\n\nhttps://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy1306\n\n1/2\n\n\f3/2/2023\n\nRemarks by Secretary of the Treasury Janet L.

But as Kyivʼs mayor said, “we wouldnʼt let Russia steal the celebration…from our\nchildren.” You called this tree – “the Tree of Invincibility.”\nHistory will note the brutality of this war. It will also remember the heroes – some sung and\nmany more unsung – who fought for human dignity, self-determination, and freedom in\nUkraineʼs darkest hour. It is an honor for me to stand with the people of Ukraine in this fight.\nThank you.\n###\n\nhttps://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy1306\n\n2/2\n\n\f"

Yellen at\nRoundtable with U.S. and Indian Tech Business Leaders\nFebruary 25, 2023\n\nAs Prepared for Delivery\nThank you very much for joining me. One of the most rewarding parts of my job is meeting\nwith innovators, entrepreneurs, and business leaders across the globe.\nThat is especially true in India, which has one of the most dynamic economies in the world.\nAs President Biden has said, India is an indispensable partner to the United States. I was able\nto see the strength of our economic ties firsthand in November when I visited Delhi for the\nU.S.-India Economic and Financial Partnership. And Iʼm glad to be back in India to build on my\nprevious trip.\nThe U.S. is Indiaʼs biggest trading partner. In 2021, our bilateral trade was over $150 billion.\nOur people-to-people ties a irm the closeness of our relationship. 200,000 Indians are\nstudying in America and enriching our schools and universities. We depend on each other on a\ndaily basis: Indians use WhatsApp to communicate and many American companies rely on\nInfosys to operate.\nAs we look towards the future, I am eager to deepen our ties in the technology sector. The\nUnited States is advancing an approach called “friendshoring” to bolster the resilience of our\nsupply chains. We are doing this by strengthening integration with our many trusted trading\npartners – including India. We are seeing progress; as an example, technology companies like\nApple and Google have expanded their phone production in India.\nThrough the Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment, or PGII, we are investing in\ndigital technologies that will drive inclusive, resilient growth in India. Under PGII, the United\nStates has announced investments in agri-tech to enable climate-smart agricultural\nproduction, and in digital payments systems for microentrepreneurs. These stand alongside\ninvestments in renewable energy, health, and other infrastructure sectors in India.

Yellen During\nPress Pool Spray with UK Chancellor Jeremy Hunt\nFebruary 24, 2023\n\nAs Prepared to Delivery\nI welcome my first in-person meeting with Chancellor Hunt.\nThe U.S.-UK relationship is extremely strong, and our Treasuries are working closely together\nto advance a number of shared objectives.\nIn particular, weʼve worked hand-in-hand over the last year to respond to Russiaʼs unprovoked\ninvasion of Ukraine.\nWe are continuing to impose significant costs on Russia for its illegal war against Ukraine,\nincluding through additional sanctions measures. Our global coalition is working relentlessly\nto disrupt Russian military supply chains, limit the Kremlinʼs revenue, and make it harder for\nthem to use the money they have to source military equipment from abroad.\nIn the year ahead, weʼll redouble our e orts at disrupting Russian sanctions evasion e orts.\nThat includes by sharing intelligence, identifying and eliminating specific networks, and\nmaking it harder for companies and jurisdictions to serve as evasion channels.\nOur work together also includes the price cap on Russian crude oil and refined products. While\nit is still early, we are seeing progress towards its twin goals of reducing Russian revenue and\npromoting stability in global oil markets.\nRussian tax revenue from energy and gas was down 46% in January. That means we are\ne ectively hitting their most important source of revenue.\nGlobal energy markets have remained well-supplied.\nWe are also collaborating closely to support Ukraine, including through bilateral and\nmultilateral economic support that is bolstering the Ukrainian home front and their valiant\nresistance on the battlefield.\n\nhttps://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy1295\n\n1/2\n\n\f3/2/2023\n\nRemarks by Secretary of the Treasury Janet L.

Yellen at National Association of Counties 2023 Legislative Conference | …\n\nU.S. DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY\nRemarks by Secretary of the Treasury Janet L. Yellen at National\nAssociation of Counties 2023 Legislative Conference\nFebruary 14, 2023\n\nAs Prepared for Delivery\nThank you for that introduction. Itʼs a privilege to be here with so many great county leaders.\nMany jobs in public service are di icult. But there are very few jobs where you are more tested\non your ability to deliver — day in and day out — than leading a local government. Thatʼs\ncertainly been true over the past three years. So, thank you for your tireless work.\nI also want to thank NACo for its strong partnership. We have worked hand-in-hand at every\nstep of our recovery over the past two years. President Winfrey, thank you for your leadership\n— both at NACo and Will County. Thank you to Past President Johnson. Iʼm also grateful to\nMatt Chase and the whole NACo team for their stewardship of this organization. Without the\nvoices of our counties, the American Rescue Plan would have undoubtedly looked quite\ndi erent. As a result, our recovery would have looked quite di erent, too.\nTwo years ago, I spoke to local leaders ahead of the passage of the Rescue Plan. My hope, I\nsaid, was that the law would “finally allow us to do what most of us came to government for\n— not simply to fight fires and resolve crises, but to build a better country.” Today, I can\nunequivocally say that we have done just that. The Rescue Plan provided critical relief and\nhelped drive a historic recovery. Just as importantly, it has strengthened the future of our\ncounties and our country.\nSpecifically, the Rescue Plan has been transformative in tackling some of the persistent\nchallenges facing our counties — from child poverty to housing security. And it has set the\nstage for the passage and successful implementation of our Administrationʼs historic longterm investments. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, CHIPS and Science Act, and Inflation\nReduction Act will position us for economic success in the coming decades.\nLet me first take us back two years ago — when the Rescue Plan was still being debated in the\nhalls of Congress. Our country was in the middle of a public health crisis. We were losing more\nAmerican lives a week to the virus than at any other point since the pandemic began. And the\nhttps://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy1271\n\n1/7\n\n\f3/2/2023\n\nRemarks by Secretary of the Treasury Janet L. Yellen at National Association of Counties 2023 Legislative Conference | …\n\npublic health catastrophe had triggered an economic calamity. Millions of jobs had been lost.\nMore Americans were applying for unemployment insurance each week than during the worst\nweek of the Great Recession. And all of us were haunted by the fresh memories of Americans\nin long lines outside of food banks and unemployment o ices. Iʼm sure you remember this\nvividly — because many of you were there, helping your residents.\nYou also knew of the growing crisis facing your governments during the pandemic. Counties\nacross the country vary in their needs. But they play a major role in providing critical services\nto Americans — from managing public health and safety to maintaining public infrastructure.\nIn mid-2020, over 70 percent of counties were estimated to had cut or delayed capital\ninvestments. And over two-thirds had cut or delayed their county services. In other words,\nyou were facing the profound challenge of responding to a once-in-a-century crisis with very\nfew resources.\nThen, thanks to our joint e ort, came the American Rescue Plan and our vaccination campaign.\nThe Rescue Plan initiated bold and timely action — delivered at a moment when we faced\ngrave uncertainty about the direction of our economy. We knew it was important to provide\ndirect and flexible aid to state and local governments. Critically, we had to avoid the mistakes\nof the Great Recession, when state and local austerity was a drag on GDP growth for the first\n14 quarters of the recovery. So, we did what had never been done at this scale: deliver relief\nto over 3,000 counties in the United States. We also provided our recipients with sustained\nand flexible funding. It was clear that this crisis would evolve with new variants, and that it\nwould a ect each jurisdiction di erently. A one-size-fits-all approach would not have su iced.\nOur plan worked. Our economic recovery has been one of the strongest in modern history. The\npast two years have seen the largest jobs gains on record. Weʼve also seen the creation of 10\nmillion new businesses. Thatʼs the strongest two years in history. And real GDP per capita is at\nan all-time high. Our recovery has also been historically inclusive. The unemployment rate has\nbeen near record lows for Black and Hispanic Americans. And it reached an all-time low for\npeople with disabilities in December. Of course, we still face significant global headwinds. But\nthe American economy is more resilient today because of our robust recovery.\nImportantly, we placed a deliberate focus on preventing the “scarring” that weʼve seen in past\nrecessions. The Great Recession cast a long shadow on the 2010s. In that crisis, the long-term\nunemployment rate — the share of those long-term unemployed among all unemployed —\npeaked in April 2010 and never fully recovered for the rest of the decade. This time, the rate\nreturned to pre-pandemic levels less than a year and a half a er its peak. Our recovery saved\nhttps://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy1271\n\n2/7\n\n\f3/2/2023\n\nRemarks by Secretary of the Treasury Janet L. Yellen at National Association of Counties 2023 Legislative Conference | …\n\nmany Americans from long-term unemployment — a crippling fate that results in severe\nfinancial stress on those out of work and their families.\nAnd thanks to you, our counties have returned to normal operations. Soon a er the Rescue\nPlanʼs passage, we saw state and local governments cancelling planned layo s and furloughs\nof their workers. Many have gone further and invested in new sta with Rescue Plan dollars.\nWe have also provided additional revenue support to counties with federal public lands —\nabout two-thirds of all counties in the United States. Some of these counties have long\nsu ered from inconsistent receipts.\nTypically, the a ermath of recessions leaves more pain: more child poverty, more hunger, more\nhousing instability. Not only did the Rescue Plan alleviate that pain — it also made bold\nprogress on some of the greatest challenges we faced.\nEconomists have long understood the importance of financial support for families with\nchildren. Itʼs associated with significant improvements in long-term health, higher school\nenrollment and graduation rates, and a reduction in poverty-related stress. Support was\nparticularly vital in the middle of a pandemic, which had swept millions of households into\npoverty. So, the President signed into the law the most significant Child Tax Credit ever. This\nincluded monthly advance payments to more than 37 million households. Crucially, the Credit\nwas fully refundable. This meant that lower-income families could reap its full benefits.\nThe results were extraordinary — particularly when combined with our other policy\ninterventions. In 2021, child poverty was cut nearly in half — to a record low of 5.2 percent.\nThis was possible not only because of the law but because of its implementation. We\ndisbursed payments automatically to those we could. For those we couldnʼt, we made it\nsimple for families to file a claim. Importantly, we relied on our counties to get the word out.\nAnd you did — ensuring that these benefits reached every single corner of America. As you\nheard from the President at the State of the Union last week, our Administration is fighting\nvery hard to restore this enhanced Child Tax Credit.\nJust as we faced the prospect of a spike in child poverty, the pandemic also posed the very\nreal possibility of a tsunami of evictions. So, our emergency rental assistance program did\nwhat had never been done before: it created the first nationwide infrastructure for eviction\nprevention. We delivered federal relief to millions of households across the country — through\nclose partnership with states, localities, and organizations like NACo. Over 80 percent of that\nassistance has gone to very low-income households.\nhttps://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy1271\n\n3/7\n\n\f3/2/2023\n\nRemarks by Secretary of the Treasury Janet L. Yellen at National Association of Counties 2023 Legislative Conference | …\n\nBut the legacy of our program extends far beyond the immediate lifeline it gave to renters. By\nour count, 180 jurisdictions across 36 states have now created or enhanced structures and\npolicies for eviction prevention — much of which will last beyond the expiration of federal\nfunds. Jurisdictions are taking their own actions to continue this work. Memphis and Shelby\nCounty, Tennessee are helping provide legal services to tenants facing evictions. They are also\nestablishing a data-sharing relationship with the local court system with the goal of diverting\npotential evictions. Eviction Lab founder Matt Desmond has said that the Administrationʼs\nactions have “formed the most important federal housing policy in the last decade” and\ntogether represent “the most important eviction prevention policy in American history.”\nWe advanced economic security for Americans in many other ways. One of the most\nunderappreciated achievements of the Rescue Plan was securing pension benefits for millions\nof workers and retirees. Prior to the law, over 200 multiemployer pension plans were on pace\nto become insolvent. Millions of Americans were facing the very real threat that their benefits\nwould get slashed. Itʼs a loss that would have permanently degraded the quality of their hardearned retirement. But we intervened — ensuring that these workers will get the benefits\nthat they worked so hard for.\nItʼs also important to me to highlight how counties are taking on some of the greatest\nchallenges facing their rural residents. In doing so, they are setting themselves up for new\neconomic opportunities. Lewis and Clark County, Montana is expanding its water wells and\nupgrading its piping systems. This is helping ensure that its residents have more consistent\naccess to drinking water. Walworth County, Wisconsin funded a public health mobile unit to\nprovide COVID and other health services to its most underserved rural communities. We also\nknow that mental health and substance use challenges too o en devastate families in rural\nareas. So, weʼve seen counties from Idaho to New York use Rescue Plan dollars to pay for\ncrisis hotlines, community response hubs, and sober living programs.\nBy stabilizing our economy and tackling longstanding challenges, the Rescue Plan also laid the\nfoundation for the passage of our Administrationʼs historic long-term investments — in\ninfrastructure, semiconductor manufacturing, and clean energy.\nThe Rescue Plan significantly improved the livelihoods of Americans as we recovered from the\npandemic crisis. Rather than soaring long-term unemployment, we have the lowest\nunemployment rate in more than 50 years. Rather than widespread foreclosures and\nbankruptcies, American households have the funds to pay their bills. Rather than being forced\n\nhttps://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy1271\n\n4/7\n\n\f3/2/2023\n\nRemarks by Secretary of the Treasury Janet L. Yellen at National Association of Counties 2023 Legislative Conference | …\n\ninto budget cuts and layo s, local governments are able to provide services that their\nresidents need to stay on their feet.\nIn short, without the American Rescue Plan, our federal government would likely still be\nfocused squarely on putting out the fire instead of rebuilding our house. And counties might\nstill be struggling with restoring their operations to normal levels — rather than thinking\nabout new investments that will shape the future of their economies. The strong recovery of\nthe past two years has not only meant that Americans are better o today. It has allowed us\nto focus on what our economy will look like in 2030 — not just 2023.\nIndeed, weʼve heard from local o icials that the Rescue Plan was a foundational policy that\nset the stage for the trifecta of legislation we are implementing now: the Bipartisan\nInfrastructure Law, CHIPS and Science Act, and Inflation Reduction Act.\nWe know that laws donʼt implement themselves. Turning a law into action requires close\npartnership between the federal government, state and local governments, workers and\nunions, businesses, and non-profits.\nAcross the country, we are seeing the Rescue Plan contribute to ongoing implementation of\nthese laws. It is helping counties develop their communities into the kinds of places that can\ncreate and attract the jobs of the future — whether the county is an urban center, in the\nsuburbs, or in a rural area. I believe this is particularly important for counties that have\nremarkable promise but have su ered from disinvestment over the years.\nThere are two priority areas where weʼve seen particularly transformative investments. We\nurge counties to continue to focus on these areas with their State and Local Fiscal Recovery\nFunds.\nThe first is workforce. Last summer, our Administration launched a Talent Pipeline Challenge\nto surge our workforce development e orts. The goal was to train a highly skilled, diverse\nworkforce to implement the historic Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. Many state and local\ngovernments answered that call with Rescue Plan investments. Franklin County, Ohio is\nfunding a pre-apprenticeship program to prepare workers for careers in the skilled\nconstruction trades. Rescue Plan dollars are also being spent to train workers in innovative\nindustries like semiconductor manufacturing. And many jurisdictions are supporting programs\nto increase labor-force participation. Weʼve seen expansions of childcare facilities and new job\ntraining programs for underserved populations — like those experiencing homelessness or\nthose formerly incarcerated.\nhttps://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy1271\n\n5/7\n\n\f3/2/2023\n\nRemarks by Secretary of the Treasury Janet L. Yellen at National Association of Counties 2023 Legislative Conference | …\n\nThe second is a ordable housing. Our suite of new legislation is creating new manufacturing\nhubs and economic centers across the country. As it does, itʼs vital that workers are able to\na ord quality housing near their workplace. Yet, according to Moodyʼs, there is a shortfall of\nover 1.5 million homes in the United States. Our Administration is working with many of you\nto implement a Housing Supply Action Plan — which includes calling on Congress to take\nadditional actions. The goal is to close the housing supply shortfall by 2027. As part of this\nAction Plan, we announced a series of steps that would make it easier for our recipients to\nuse State and Local Fiscal Recovery Funds for a ordable housing construction and\npreservation. This includes permitting governments to use these funds to fully finance longterm a ordable housing loans. Many counties have taken advantage of this flexibility. For\nexample, New Hanover County, North Carolina has since announced progress in developing a\n278-unit apartment complex. Itʼs scheduled to break ground this year.\nAs of last year, governments have budgeted over $14 billion of State and Local Fiscal\nRecovery Funds for over 1,800 projects focused on housing. And this is just the beginning.\nLooking forward, Treasury will continue to support jurisdictions as they make investments in\nthese areas. I know our team — led by Chief Recovery O icer Jacob Leibenlu — is looking for\nopportunities to highlight your best practices.\nIʼve spoken today about what weʼve been able to achieve together through the Rescue Plan.\nBut Iʼd be remiss if I did not speak about a pressing issue that could threaten all the progress\nthat weʼve made over the past two years.\nAs many of you know, I have asked Congress to raise or suspend the debt limit. Since 1789, the\nUnited States has paid all of our bills on time. It should stay that way. In my assessment —\nand that of economists across the board — a default on our debt would produce an economic\nand financial catastrophe. Many of your residents could ultimately lose their jobs. Household\npayments on mortgages, auto loans, and credit cards would rise, and American businesses\nwould see credit markets deteriorate. On top of that, it is unlikely that the federal\ngovernment would be able to issue payments to millions of Americans, including our military\nfamilies and seniors who rely on Social Security. In the longer term, a default would raise the\ncost of borrowing into perpetuity. Future investments — including public investments —\nwould become substantially more costly.\nThis economic catastrophe is preventable. The solution is simple: Congress must vote to raise\nor suspend the debt limit. It should do so without conditions. And it should not wait until the\nlast minute. I believe it is a basic responsibility of our nationʼs leaders to get this done.\nhttps://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy1271\n\n6/7\n\n\f3/2/2023\n\nRemarks by Secretary of the Treasury Janet L. Yellen at National Association of Counties 2023 Legislative Conference | …\n\nI want to end by thanking you for the work that you do.\nOver the course of my career, the United States has endured several recessions. The origins\nand nature of these crises have varied. But the responses to all of them have required people\nof good will to work collaboratively, under tremendous pressure, to deliver decisively on\nbehalf of the American people.\nOver the past few years, many of us have been in the trenches together. Weʼve faced down a\ndevastating public health crisis. Weʼve rescued the American economy. And we are now\ninvesting in our future.\nNone of this has been easy. Particularly for you — the county leaders of America. But the\nprogress weʼve made is proof of what we can do when our counties and our federal\ngovernment come together. Not only to fight fires, but to build a better world a er the crisis.\nOf the many legacies that each of us will leave, this is one that all of us should be very proud\nof. I look forward to building on this legacy with you in the months and years to come.\nThank you.\n\nhttps://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy1271\n\n7/7\n\n\f"

Yellen at the Center for Strategic and International Studies | U.S. Depart…\n\nU.S. DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY\nRemarks by Secretary of the Treasury Janet L. Yellen at the\nCenter for Strategic and International Studies\nFebruary 9, 2023\n\nAs prepared for delivery\nThank you for the introduction, Matt. Iʼm pleased to be here at CSIS with all of you.\nLast fall, I issued an urgent call ahead of the World Bank and IMF Annual Meetings — for the\nevolution of the multilateral development bank system. My reasoning was simple: the world\nhas changed, and we need these vital institutions to change along with it. In todayʼs world,\nitʼs important that the MDBs make progress on their core mission of poverty reduction and\ninclusive economic growth. But itʼs also important that they take decisive action on global\nchallenges like climate change, pandemics, and conflict and fragility. These goals are all\nessential, and they are closely linked.\nSince the a ermath of the Second World War, the development banks have played a critical\nrole in alleviating poverty and spurring economic development. Theyʼve done so successfully\nfor a broad range of countries, including those facing persistent poverty and those recovering\nfrom disaster and conflict. Last month, I visited three countries in Africa. I saw first-hand the\nimpact of these banksʼ direct financing of national development projects. Projects like these\nhave connected millions to electricity and clean water. Theyʼve helped farmers get more crops\nto market. And theyʼve funded the construction of modern roads and bridges.\nBut even before the onset of the COVID pandemic, our tremendous progress on poverty\nreduction was beginning to lag. In todayʼs world, sustained progress on poverty alleviation\nand economic development is simply not possible without addressing the global challenges\nthat face us all. The COVID pandemic, for example, led to a rise in extreme poverty for the first\ntime in over 20 years. In Zambia, smallholder farmers told me that extreme weather events\nlike droughts and floods have dampened agricultural yields – exacerbating hunger and food\ninsecurity. Many African leaders have noted to me the impacts of conflict on their economic\ngrowth. These e ects are not just local to countries in conflict. They spill over to neighboring\ncountries.\nhttps://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy1258\n\n1/4\n\n\f3/2/2023\n\nRemarks by Secretary of the Treasury Janet L. Yellen at the Center for Strategic and International Studies | U.S. Depart…\n\nThe costs and benefits of addressing global challenges are di use. They donʼt all accrue to a\nsingle country. The MDBsʼ core model involves countries borrowing to make specific\ninvestments aimed at addressing development constraints in their own countries. That model\nis insu icient to meet the moment. Such a model will always underinvest in addressing global\nchallenges – since the benefits of investments in global challenges stretch far beyond the\nborders of the country where a given project takes place.\nThe costs of failing to address these global challenges may be spread across the world.\nNevertheless, these costs have a serious impact on national and local realities. They are very\nreal for the people who face them. Many times, these are the worldʼs poorest and most\nvulnerable.\n\nA. EVOLUT ION AGENDA\nThatʼs why I – along with other shareholders – called for an evolution of the development\nbanks last fall. Itʼs time for these banks to address global challenges head on – with the\nurgency and scale that is required. We have begun the evolution of the World Bank. Next, we\nexpect to take this agenda to the regional development banks.\nLet me speak specifically about our work on the World Bank. We are focused on evolving its\nvision, incentives, operating model, and financial capacity.\nFirst, the Bank needs to expand its vision to include addressing global challenges as an\nintegral part of achieving its Twin Goals: poverty reduction and shared prosperity. Let me be\nclear: this does not mean shi ing the Bank away from its traditional work. It means expanding\nthe work of the Bank to better include addressing global challenges. These challenges are\nintertwined with alleviating poverty and supporting inclusive and sustainable development.\nSecond, the Bank must create the right incentives for countries to tackle global challenges.\nThat includes lowering investment costs to make these types of projects more economically\nviable. My view is that since the global community benefits from these investments, the global\ncommunity should help bear their cost.\nFor example, we are asking the Bank to identify concessional resources available to countries\nto tackle global challenges. These resources could incentivize the decommissioning of coal\nplants and protect displaced workers during a clean energy transition. They could enhance\nhealth systems to mitigate the spread of disease. Or they could support basic services for\nrefugees and their host communities. The World Bank will also need to develop diagnostic\nhttps://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy1258\n\n2/4\n\n\f3/2/2023\n\nRemarks by Secretary of the Treasury Janet L. Yellen at the Center for Strategic and International Studies | U.S. Depart…\n\ntools to help countries understand how global challenges a ect their development. This will\nhelp guide project and financing decisions.\nThird, the Bank must be bolder and more imaginative in its operational approach. For example,\nwe know that sub-national entities can sometimes have greater expertise and willingness to\nimplement innovative projects. What if we made it easier for cities to gain access to funding\nfor climate-smart urban infrastructure? Operationally, we believe itʼs also important for the\nBank to develop new measures of success – such as clear targets that reflect its e orts to\naddress both traditional goals as well as global challenges.\nFinally, the Bank must boost its financial capacity by responsibly stretching its existing\nfinancial resources. Last yearʼs G20 report on the development banksʼ capital adequacy\nframeworks provides a solid blueprint for this exercise. The United States is strongly\nsupportive of exploring and implementing a range of the reportʼs recommendations – and\ndoing so quickly. Promising ideas for exploration include increased securitization of private\nsector portfolios or piloting the issuance of subordinated debt instruments to boost\nheadroom.\nJust as important as additional financial capacity for the Bank is stronger mobilization of\nprivate capital and domestic resources. International public finance alone will come nowhere\nclose to the level of financing needed to e ectively tackle global challenges and achieve the\nSustainable Development Goals. We expect the evolution agenda to reflect the importance of\nprivate financing and domestic resource mobilization.\n\nB . PROGRESS AND T HE ROAD AHEAD\nWe have made real progress over the past four months – as weʼve worked with the Bank and\nother partners. We have built a robust and growing coalition of borrower and non-borrowing\ncountries that are pressing for the Bank to evolve. That includes my counterparts in Africa,\nwho I saw last month. They share our desire to build a system that is more responsive to the\nchallenges they face. We are coordinating closely with India as it makes MDB evolution a key\npriority of its G20 presidency. And the World Bank has produced an initial evolution roadmap –\nwhich it is now using as a guide for deeper discussions on specific reforms.\nIn the next few months, we expect to see ideas begin to be translated into action. We are\npursuing a staged implementation of this evolution. Not all decisions are equally di icult – so\nletʼs make the more straightforward ones first. The first phase of implementation should\nbegin by the World Bank and IMF Spring Meetings in April. Shareholders are already working to\nhttps://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy1258\n\n3/4\n\n\f3/2/2023\n\nRemarks by Secretary of the Treasury Janet L. Yellen at the Center for Strategic and International Studies | U.S. Depart…\n\ncoalesce around updates to the Bankʼs vision and mission. Management and the Board are in\nrobust discussions about measures to boost financial headroom.\nBut we cannot stop there. Much remains to be done to evolve incentives, reform operational\napproaches, and increase financial capacity. We expect the World Bank to promptly implement\na second phase of work. We are asking for additional reforms to be decided and\nimplementation to begin by the World Bank and IMF Annual Meetings in October. Thatʼs the\none-year mark from when this project began.\nWe know we can succeed. The world has gone through tremendous change in the nearly 80\nyears since the founding of the World Bank. The multilateral development bank system has\nresponded to these changes by evolving. The system has broadened the scope of its work to\ninclude programming on human capital and good governance; expanded its set of instruments\nbeyond project loans; increased its focus on policy and technical assistance; and delivered\nfinancial innovations.\nThe MDBs are a powerful pillar of a broader financial architecture that should be deployed to\naddress 21st century development challenges. But this requires a 21st century strategy. The\nneed is great. The world is asking us to do all we can to combat these complex and growing\nproblems.\nI am confident that we will be able to deliver.\nThank you. And I look forward to our conversation\n\nhttps://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy1258\n\n4/4\n\n\f"

Yellen at Ultium\nCells in Spring Hills, Tennessee\nFebruary 8, 2023\n\nAs Prepared for Delivery\nGood a ernoon, everyone. Thanks for that kind introduction. Iʼm grateful to the leaders and\nworkers of Ultium Cells for having me here today. Construction sites like this give me hope –\nbecause they mean that we are in the process of building something new. In this case, itʼs a\n2.8-million-square foot factory with some of the most advanced battery manufacturing\nprocesses in the world. And itʼs a factory that will support 1,700 high-tech jobs.\nThe good news is that new factories are not just being built in Spring Hill. All over the country,\nwe are seeing a wave of investments in American manufacturing. This is thanks to the hard\nwork of leaders like Representative Steve Cohen from Tennessee. As the President laid out\nlast night, the Biden economic plan is working – and the results are beginning to reveal\nthemselves.\nToday, Iʼd like to speak to you about the Presidentʼs economic plan: the progress weʼve\nachieved and the work that lies ahead. Iʼll first begin with our plan to rescue the economy\nfrom the depths of the pandemic. That was in 2021. Then, Iʼll turn to the historic economic\nlegislation we enacted in 2022. And finally, Iʼll talk about 2023 and beyond: the years when we\nharness the promise of our plan.\n\n2021: A HISTORIC ECONOMIC RECOVERY\nWhen the President took o ice, our country was in the depths of the pandemic. About 400,000\nAmericans had died from COVID. Three thousand more were dying each day. The public health\ncalamity had triggered an economic one. In January 2021, about 800,000 Americans were filing\njobless claims each week. That was higher than the worst moments of the Great Recession.\nThe e ects of this economic catastrophe were not just captured in staggering numbers. They\nwere felt by millions across the country. Two years ago, President Biden said in his first\n\nhttps://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy1254\n\n1/6\n\n\f3/2/2023\n\nRemarks by Secretary of the Treasury Janet L. Yellen at Ultium Cells in Spring Hills, Tennessee | U.S. Department of the…\n\naddress to Congress that: “one of the defining images…of this crisis…has been cars lined\nup…for miles… waiting for a box of food to be put in their trunk.”\nThe truth is: in 2020 and 2021, we faced the tail risk of an economic crisis that could match\nthe Great Depression. Short of that, we faced the possibility of a protracted economic\ndownturn that would cast a long shadow on the rest of the decade – with millions of homes,\nbusinesses, and livelihoods lost, many to never return.\nSo, the President acted decisively. We launched a vaccination campaign to put shots in arms.\nThrough the American Rescue Plan, we provided immediate relief to households, businesses,\nand state and local governments.\nOur plan worked. The past two years have seen a historic recovery. In fact, the pace of our\nrecovery has exceeded many of the more optimistic expectations at the beginning of our\nAdministration. And our economy remains resilient – even as it has been tested by a series of\nback-to-back global shocks.\nTake the labor market. The data is clear: our country is back to work. Weʼve seen historic\nemployment gains in the past two years. As of last weekʼs jobs report, over 12 million new jobs\nhave been created since the President took o ice. Moreover, this resurgence has been\ninclusive and broad-based. The unemployment rate has been near record lows for Black and\nHispanic Americans. And it reached an all-time low for people with disabilities in December.\nMore broadly, across many metrics, Americans are largely in better financial shape than before\nthe pandemic began. The rate of Americans without health insurance reached an all-time low\nin 2022. Foreclosures rates remain below pre-pandemic averages.\nThrough the American Rescue Plan, we also helped small businesses stay afloat. But not only\nthat. Since the beginning of the Administration, Americans have applied to start 10 million\nnew businesses. Thatʼs more than in any other two-year period on record. Our economic\nagenda has jump-started a wave of entrepreneurship that will have lasting e ects in the years\nto come.\nOf course, we still face serious near-term challenges. Our Administrationʼs top economic\npriority has been to tackle inflation. While inflation remains elevated, we are seeing\nencouraging signs that supply-demand mismatches are now easing in many sectors of the\neconomy. Over the past two years, we have worked successfully to ease supply chain\npressures. That includes funding pop-up container yards and moving several ports to 24/7\noperations. The President has helped stabilize energy prices through a historic release of our\nhttps://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy1254\n\n2/6\n\n\f3/2/2023\n\nRemarks by Secretary of the Treasury Janet L. Yellen at Ultium Cells in Spring Hills, Tennessee | U.S. Department of the…\n\nStrategic Petroleum Reserve – as well as the release of millions of barrels from our allies and\npartners. And where we could not expand supply, we delivered cost relief. Our historic laws\nhave helped many Americans save their hard-earned money – from the cost of insulin to the\nprice of high-speed Internet.\nAs you heard last night, the President and I will continue to work hard to support families –\nmany of whom are still feeling the squeeze of high prices.\n\n2022: ENACT ING A HISTORIC SUIT E OF LEGISLAT ION\nAs our economy continues to transition to steady and healthy growth, I believe that the\nUnited States is uniquely positioned to capitalize on the future. Last fall, I toured the country\nto see the early e ects of our transformative suite of legislation. In the past 15 months, we\nhave enacted our generationʼs most ambitious investment in infrastructure; led a major\nexpansion of American advanced manufacturing; and passed the boldest climate action in our\nnationʼs history.\nLet me speak to the three main economic e ects of these laws: increasing our productive\ncapacity, bolstering our economic resilience, and creating a more inclusive economy.\nFirst, the Presidentʼs economic plan is boosting Americaʼs productive capacity. For many years,\neconomists forecasted sluggish growth for the American economy over the next few\ndecades. A countryʼs long-run growth potential depends on, among other things, the size of\nour labor force and the productivity of our workers. Our potential was being weighed down by\nslow productivity growth – along with an aging population that was constraining growth in\nour labor supply.\nFaced with these structural challenges, our Administration is pursuing an economic strategy\ncalled “modern supply-side economics.” With an economy at full employment, we are\nundertaking a supply-side expansion that invests in our workforce and its productivity. These\ninvestments raise the ceiling for what our economy can produce.\nLetʼs take the example of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law.\nSerious economists agree that infrastructure investments can boost productivity and growth.\nAnd yet, for decades, we neglected our roads, bridges, public transit, and ports. Over 40,000\nbridges are in poor condition. Nearly 900 of those are in Tennessee alone. Beyond traditional\ninfrastructure, millions of Americans still have no access to high-speed Internet service. During\nthe pandemic, I heard heartbreaking stories of parents searching for wi-fi signals outside\nhttps://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy1254\n\n3/6\n\n\f3/2/2023\n\nRemarks by Secretary of the Treasury Janet L. Yellen at Ultium Cells in Spring Hills, Tennessee | U.S. Department of the…\n\npublic libraries and co ee shops – just so their children could complete their homework online.\nLet me be clear: no parent or child should ever have to do this.\nSo, we are making a generational investment in our infrastructure. Weʼve announced\nthousands of projects under our economic plan. Better public transit to help get students to\nschool. Port improvements to strengthen supply chains and e iciently transport goods to\nAmerican consumers. Broadband projects to connect millions of unserved and underserved\nhouseholds to high-speed Internet – with much more to come. Airport expansions to help\nreduce delays – like the one announced for Chattanooga Airport just two hours from here.\nInfrastructure is the lifeblood of our economy. And the President and our Administration are\nfinally treating it as such.\nSecond, our plan is strengthening Americaʼs economic resilience.\nThree decades ago, the United States made up 37 percent of global semiconductor\nproduction. Today, we produce only 12 percent. With the most advanced chips, we lack any\nmeaningful manufacturing capacity at all.\nWeʼve seen the acute impacts of a chip shortage on the economy. In 2021, this shortage\nmeant a loss of about $240 billion in U.S. GDP. In Tennessee, companies like Nissan had to\ntemporarily shutter production – and consumers faced skyrocketing prices for cars and other\neveryday goods.\nOur economic plan is investing in economic resilience. The goal is to mitigate shocks like the\nones we experienced to our chip supply. Through grants, loans, and tax credits, we are\nnurturing the growth of a semiconductor ecosystem in the United States. Our investments in\nareas like manufacturing and R&D will help mitigate economic and security risks. We are\nalready seeing how expansions of U.S. manufacturing have reverberating e ects on local\ncommunities. For example, Intel is building a $20 billion semiconductor plant in Ohio – while\nalso investing tens of millions to help train the next generation of chipmakers there.\nThird, our plan is broadening economic opportunity across America. Building a more inclusive\neconomy is a moral imperative. Itʼs also good economics.\nFor too long, the American economy has been characterized by widely divergent economic\nconditions across places. Studies have shown that there are wide gaps in poverty rates,\nmedian household incomes, and even rates of opioid addiction across counties in the United\nStates. Too many places were being le behind. Regions that were once hubs of economic\nactivity have su ered from massive disinvestment.\nhttps://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy1254\n\n4/6\n\n\f3/2/2023\n\nRemarks by Secretary of the Treasury Janet L. Yellen at Ultium Cells in Spring Hills, Tennessee | U.S. Department of the…\n\nWe faced a challenge. The transition to a clean energy economy is one of the most\ntransformative in modern history. How do we make sure that this transition is inclusive – so\nthat all of America can reap its benefits?\nEnter our economic plan. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law is laying the groundwork for clean\ninfrastructure in cities and towns across America. The Inflation Reduction Act is o ering\nmeaningful tax credits to spur clean energy investment and production. Importantly, the law\ndeliberately encourages place-based investments. It o ers additional incentives for\nbusinesses to invest in low-income and historic energy communities. And it also requires\nemployers to pay prevailing wages and employ apprentices to receive full credits. Thatʼs a\nrequirement that went into e ect last month.\nThe early results are clear: the Presidentʼs economic plan is beginning to drive a renewal\nacross the country. For example, weʼve seen a burst of clean energy manufacturing investment\nin the Midwest and the South. Think about where we are today: a new, state-of-the-art\nfactory that will soon deliver batteries for electric vehicles assembled by GM next door. Just\nnorth of us, in Kentucky, Ford and SK On just broke ground on an electric vehicle battery park.\nSouth of us, in Georgia, solar panel firm QCells will build a massive new plant outside of\nAtlanta – which is expected to generate 2,500 jobs. East of that, just outside Charleston,\nRedwood Materials has announced plans to build a multi-billion-dollar facility to recycle and\nrefine battery components. Its investment is the largest economic development\nannouncement in the history of South Carolina. And its facility is estimated to eventually\nemploy 1,500 workers.\nThe Inflation Reduction Act was signed into law a mere six months ago. Since then, clean\nenergy firms up and down the supply chain have announced tens of billions of dollars in\nprojects that will create thousands of high-quality, good-paying jobs. One analysis indicates\nthat 2022 was a record year for EV battery manufacturing in particular. Last year alone, more\nthan $73 billion in planned projects were announced.\n\n2023 AND B EYOND: T URNING T HE PROMISE OF OUR\nECONOMIC PLAN INTO ACT ION\nSo – what comes next?\nNow that these bills have been signed into law, itʼs our task to turn their promise into reality.\nTreasury and other agencies are already hard at work implementing the Biden economic plan.\nFor example, last fall, we announced a series of initiatives to accelerate infrastructure\nhttps://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy1254\n\n5/6\n\n\f3/2/2023\n\nRemarks by Secretary of the Treasury Janet L. Yellen at Ultium Cells in Spring Hills, Tennessee | U.S. Department of the…\n\ndeployment. We are strengthening and accelerating federal permitting reviews. We also\nlaunched a Talent Pipeline Challenge to make sure that we are training a highly skilled, diverse\ninfrastructure workforce – one that will be ready to take advantage of the new opportunities\nin the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law.\nAt Treasury, our focus is on e ective implementation of the Inflation Reduction Act; nearly\nthree-quarters of the lawʼs climate investments are delivered through tax incentives. To do\nso, we are bringing a broad and diverse set of stakeholders to the table. And we are working\nexpeditiously to maximize the economic benefits of the legislation – while making sure we\nenact e ective guardrails so benefits are delivered as intended.\nOver the next year, I suspect that you will see activity accelerate. More ideas turning into\nplans. Plans into construction sites – just like this one. And construction sites into bustling\nfactories. And with it, I hope, a renewed sense of optimism about Americaʼs future.\nLet me close with this: I just returned from my first trip to Africa as Treasury Secretary. I met\nwith a variety of people during this trip: from presidents to farmers to entrepreneurs. In all of\nmy interactions, each of them carried a fundamental sense of confidence about the future of\nthe United States. Those across the world know that the world is better when the United\nStates is strong at home.\nThe President and I could not agree more. There will be challenges to come. And there will be\ndi iculties. But as the President said last night, “The story of America is a story of progress\nand resilience – of always moving forward.”\nFor all that Americans have faced in the last three years, I am convinced now, more than ever,\nthat progress is possible. Together, we can provide a better life for millions of Americans. We\ncan build a country that is more inclusive and resilient. And we can sustain our leadership in\nthe 21st century.\nThank you.\n####\n\nhttps://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy1254\n\n6/6\n\n\f"

Importantly, it is designed\nto mobilize additional money from the private sector and philanthropies, and I will meet with\nrepresentatives from both groups later today.\nThe JETP Investment Plan dra ed by South Africa highlights the need for specific\nprogramming in Mpumalanga Province, the largest coal-producing region in South Africa.\nThe Plan calls for job retraining and reskilling, cash payments to support displaced workers\nwhile they find new employment, redevelopment of former coal mines and coal power plants\nas clean energy production sites and other productive uses.\nAnd it also calls for investment in non-energy infrastructure, including roads, rail, ports, and\ndigital infrastructure that will support new industries.\nThe United Statesʼ commitment to the energy transition being “just” is firm. That is why\nPresident Biden made an additional commitment to President Ramaphosa of $45 million in\ngrant funding to support South Africaʼs e orts.\nThrough our various agencies, including the U.S. Trade and Development Agency, USAID,\nPower Africa, the International Development Finance Corporation, and the Departments of\nState, Energy, and Treasury, we are identifying the highest-value opportunities for investing\nour resources to help achieve these goals.\nOur success also depends on committed South Africans such as yourselves. Your hard work to\nget to where you are, ready and capable of participating fully in the clean energy economy will\nbenefit not only yourselves and your families, but also the whole community of Mpumalanga\nand South Africa.\nI want to applaud you for your achievements thus far in being at the forefront of the economy\nof the future, and also applaud the leadership of Premier Mtweni-Tsipane. I look forward to all\nthat you will accomplish and to learning more during our conversation.\n\n####\nhttps://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy1224\n\n2/3\n\n\f3/2/2023\n\nRemarks by Secretary of the Treasury Janet L.

Yellen at Lunch\nwith Local and International Philanthropies on South Africa’s\nJust Energy Transition Partnership (JETP)\nJanuary 27, 2023\n\nAs Prepared for Delivery\nI want to start by thanking you and your organizations for being here today and for\ndemonstrating your commitment to South Africaʼs just energy transition toward renewable\nsources.\nAn energy transition that is not just will simply not work. Equally important, however, is the\nimperative to seize the new opportunities that the transition will o er, keeping a workercentered perspective in mind at all stages.\nIndeed, I think we all see both the tremendous need and opportunity for reform of the energy\nsector in a way that li s up impacted communities and strengthens sustainable economic\ngrowth. That is, in large part, why we joined international partners in creating the Just Energy\nTransition Partnership or JETP with South Africa.\nThe United States is firmly committed to this engagement. We have pledged to mobilize over\n$1 billion from across our government over the next three to five years to achieve the just\nenergy transition priorities that the South Africans identified in their JETP Investment Plan.\nSouth Africaʼs Just Energy Transition Investment Plan is the result of a yearʼs work. It\nidentifies some $98 billion in necessary investments in clean energy and programming to\nsupport the “just” transition over the long term, as well as investment in green hydrogen\ninfrastructure and electric vehicle manufacturing.\nIt is the “just” element of the transition that I want to focus on today, and where we want to\ncollaborate with you closely. The success of the JETP will not be possible unless we support\nthe coalminers and coal mining communities as they transition to new economic activities.\nOur South African partners have identified “just” investments of over 60 billion rand, or about\n\nhttps://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy1226\n\n1/2\n\n\f3/2/2023\n\nRemarks by Secretary of the Treasury Janet L.

South\nAfrica will need to see concrete action soon to keep up momentum on the JETP.\nIn recognition of this importance, President Biden went beyond our initial JETP commitment\nto pledge an additional $45 million focused specifically on the “just” element of the transition.\nAs the Investment Plan lays out though, much more will be needed.\nAt COP27, many of the organizations represented here today pledged to invest $500 million in\nlow- and middle-income countries with ambitious energy transition plans. South Africa fits\nthat bill perfectly and many of you have long histories investing in these very communities we\nhope to support alongside you.\nWe would like to understand how you are thinking about extending support in the context of\nthe ambitious JETP here in South Africa, where the transition is already at hand and the needs\nare urgent. Iʼll start by asking: how can we work together to achieve the greatest impact for\nthe people of South Africa?\nThank you and Iʼm looking forward to hearing your perspectives.\n\n####\n\nhttps://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy1226\n\n2/2\n\n\f"

            "content": "U.S. DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY\nRemarks by Secretary of the Treasury Janet L. Yellen at Ford\nSilverton Assembly Plant in Pretoria, South Africa\nJanuary 26, 2023\n\nAs Prepared for Delivery\nThank you for that introduction. And thank you for having me here today at Ford. It’s great to be\nat an American business in South Africa. This factory is a strong example of how deepening\neconomic integration between the U.S. and South Africa — and the continent more broadly —\ncan produce good jobs and boost economic growth for both of us.\nI began this trip in Senegal. There, I explained that the United States’ strategy toward Africa is\ncentered around a simple recognition: that Africa will shape the future of the global economy.\nAnd I explained that the United States is ready to work with Africa as an equal partner — defined\nnot by what we can do for each other, but rather what we can do with each other.\nWe know that a thriving Africa is in the interest of the United States. A thriving Africa means a\nlarger market for our goods and services. It means more investment opportunities for our\nbusinesses, like this Ford plant, which can create jobs in Africa and customers for American\nbusinesses. And it means that more Americans can benefit from the dynamism and creativity of\npeople in Africa.\nA key pillar of the U.S. strategy toward Africa is boosting mutually beneficial trade and\ninvestment. The United States is South Africa’s third-largest trading partner and a major\ndestination for South African investment. In turn, South Africa is our largest trading partner in\nAfrica. In the coming years, we intend to build on that strong foundation to promote even\ndeeper economic integration here, as well as with other African countries.\nIndeed, the United States sees tremendous economic potential in Africa. Across the continent,\npeople are becoming more connected to the world than at any other time in history.\nImportantly, Africa is undergoing a significant demographic boom. By 2050, Africans are\nprojected to make up a quarter of the world’s population. Africa’s working-age population is\nrapidly growing at a time when other regions face the challenges of aging populations. This\npresents an extraordinary economic opportunity.\n\n\fOur work to boost trade and investment begins with facilitating business between Americans\nand Africans. For over two decades, under the African Growth and Opportunity Act, the United\nStates has provided eligible Sub-Saharan countries with duty-free access to our market for\nthousands of products. South Africa was the biggest beneficiary of this arrangement last year.\nAnd since 2021, the United States has helped close more than 800 trade and investment deals in\nAfrica — totaling $18 billion.\nSome of America’s biggest companies are doubling down on their commitments in Africa. As\nyou know, Ford recently began production of vehicles made possible by its $1 billion investment\nhere in South Africa. Technology companies like Cisco, manufacturing companies like General\nElectric, and financial firms like Visa have also made new announcements. We believe that\nleadership in the industries of the future requires close partnership with companies and people\nin Africa.\nProsperity in Africa also requires promoting more trade within Africa. As Africa’s middle class\ngrows, the continent will become a bigger market for its own goods and services. Trade between\nAfrican countries has the potential to boost good jobs and economic opportunity. And it enables\nmore Africans to benefit from the innovations of their neighbors. That’s why the United States\nstrongly supports the African Continental Free Trade Area. Estimates indicate that this Free\nTrade Area could boost real income by roughly 9 percent by 2035.\nAs we deepen our economic ties, we believe that sustained trade and investment depends on\ncontinued economic development. Trade requires quality roads and bridges; businesses cannot\noperate in the 21st century without reliable broadband and electricity; and a skilled workforce\nrequires quality education and training.\nAfrica’s infrastructure gap is estimated at over $100 billion annually. To invest in global\ninfrastructure, the G7 has announced a Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment.\nThis initiative aims to mobilize $600 billion into a variety of quality infrastructure projects by\n2027 — including in Africa. Through the Millennium Challenge Corporation and the\nDevelopment Finance Corporation, the United States has over ten billion dollars of active\ncommitments and programs in Africa, in areas from telecommunications to renewable energy\nproduction. And I have personally convened the multilateral development banks to urge them\nto step up policy and technical assistance – as well as financing – in infrastructure.\nLast month, President Biden announced an initiative on digital transformation. We intend to\ninvest over $350 million and facilitate over $450 million in financing for this continent. Funds\nwill go toward expanding Internet access as well as enabling a vibrant digital ecosystem through\n\n\fdigital skills and literacy. Strengthening Africa’s digital economy has the potential to unlock\ninnovation, particularly by leveraging the talents of young workers that are early adopters of\ntechnology.\nLet me be clear: we do not take our investments lightly. Our projects and partnerships are\nmotivated by our mutually beneficial, long-term partnership. That’s why we have rigorous\naccountability, transparency, and technical standards. And that’s why we assist countries with\npolicy reform and capacity building. We believe these steps help attract private sector\ninvestment and deliver better economic returns. We know that people in Africa are interested in\neconomic arrangements that are fair and open – ones that produce projects that are high\nquality and sustainable over the long term. And we also share a recognition of the importance of\nstrong, open, and accountable institutions that deliver well for people and businesses.\nI’ve spoken about why U.S. integration with Africa is important for our economic interests. Let\nme speak briefly about how it furthers our security interests as well.\nOver the past three years, we have seen how disruptions in one part of the world can shake the\nglobal economy. COVID-19 brought the world’s economic activity to a standstill. Russia’s brutal\nwar against Ukraine has raised energy prices and exacerbated food insecurity. These shocks\nhave taught us about the importance of secure and resilient supply chains.\nAs we continue to vigorously promote global economic integration, the United States is\npursuing “friendshoring” policies aimed at mitigating vulnerabilities in supply chains. We are\naddressing the over-concentration of the production of critical goods in certain markets —\nparticularly those that may not share our economic values. To do so, we are deepening\neconomic integration with the many countries that we can count on. That includes our many\ntrusted trading partners on this continent — like South Africa. We believe that this policy can\nhelp increase the resilience of both our economies.\nSuccess in Africa means success for all of us. A thriving Africa helps support a thriving America.\nThe United States is committed to working with you to deepen our ties: not for show, not for the\nshort-term — but for the long haul.\nThank you for having me.\n####\n\n\f"

Let me first thank the rangers who guided our tour around Dinokeng Game\nReserve.\nSeeing so many different animal species in their natural setting reminds us why it is so\nimportant to work together to protect wildlife. I’m concerned to know that this Reserve, like so\nmany other reserves and parks, has experienced poaching.\n\nTo help save wildlife populations from further poaching and disrupt the associated illicit trade,\nwe must “follow the money” in the same way we do with other serious crimes.\nThis includes identifying and seizing the proceeds generated from the illegal wildlife trade and\nimpeding the money laundering and cross-border transactions of the transnational criminal\norganizations often involved in—and who benefit from—corruption.\n\nWildlife traffickers, corrupt officials, and other criminals rely on many of the same vulnerabilities\nin anti-money laundering regulatory regimes, so our efforts to combat wildlife trafficking\nreinforce our efforts to fight corruption, and vice versa.\nI am here today to demonstrate our shared commitment to these two significant goals for both\nof our countries: fighting corruption and combating wildlife trafficking.\n\nOur countries are leaders in combatting wildlife trafficking and my agency is dedicated to\nhelping follow the money associated with this crime.\n\n\fTo date, Treasury has worked to share information associated with wildlife trafficking, including\nby providing financial intelligence for law enforcement partners in the U.S. that investigate\nwildlife trafficking globally.\n\nAlongside South Africa, Treasury also worked with the Financial Action Task Force, the\ninternational standard setting body on combating money laundering and other illicit finance, to\nidentify indicators associated with money laundering and wildlife trafficking.\nThe trends and typologies identified as part of this work are key to raising awareness and\nsupporting key disruptive efforts.\nThere is much more that can be done on this front. Today, I am pleased to speak about a new\ncommitment between the United States and South Africa to combat illicit finance linked to the\nillegal wildlife trade.\n\nThe U.S. Treasury and South Africa’s National Treasury are committing to form a United States –\nSouth Africa Task Force on Combating the Financing of Wildlife Trafficking, which will work to\naddress this critical issue in three key areas.\nFirst, we will increase information sharing between our financial intelligence units to better\nsupport key law enforcement agencies from South Africa and the United States.\n\nSecond, the Task Force will prioritize the sharing of financial red flags and indicators related to\nwildlife trafficking cases, especially those involving the U.S. financial system and those\noverlapping with investigations into high-level corruption, drug trafficking, and transnational\ncriminal organizations.\nFinally, U.S. Treasury and our counterparts at the National Treasury will work to strengthen\ncontrols in our countries and beyond to combat money laundering and terrorist financing\nthrough public-private partnership activities in the region.\n\n\fWe will convene relevant government authorities, regulators, law enforcement, and the private\nsector to improve controls to combat money laundering and the illicit proceeds related to drug\ntrafficking and wildlife trafficking.\n\nThrough closer collaboration to target illicit proceeds linked to wildlife trafficking, as well as\noverlapping criminal activity like corruption, fraud, and drug trafficking, we are taking a step in\nthe right direction today.\nTo make an impact against this harmful crime and the illicit financing that accompanies it, we\nmust use this as an opportunity to build a consistent and durable approach.\n\nI look forward to hearing updates about the progress of our two governments working together.\n\n\f"

            "content": "U.S. DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY\nRemarks by Secretary of the Treasury Janet L. Yellen at Green\nClimate Fund Agriculture Site\nJanuary 24, 2023\n\nAs Prepared for Delivery\nThank you very much. It’s great to be here. This project shows how our countries can partner to\naddress two of the most critical issues facing Zambia and the world: food security and climate\nadaptation.\nToday, hunger and food insecurity are exacting a heavy toll on communities around the world,\nincluding right here in Zambia. The number of people facing acute food insecurity has risen to\n345 million across over 80 countries. In Zambia, around 2 million people face acute food\ninsecurity — and nearly half of the population is unable to meet their minimum caloric intake\nrequirements.\nGlobal food systems have been strained for some time by climate change, regional conflicts, and\nCOVID’s economic disruptions. Nowhere has this been more apparent than in Africa. And this\ndifficult situation has been exacerbated by Russia’s illegal war on Ukraine, which has further\nstressed food, fuel, and fertilizer prices across the world. Russia’s war has cut off significant\nsupplies of wheat, corn, and sunflower oil destined to global markets, including in Africa,\nleading to shortages and price spikes. Higher global energy prices raised shipping costs for food\nand other commodities, squeezing cash-strapped countries. And a surge in the price of fertilizer\nhas hurt agricultural output in communities across Africa.\nThe first to be hit hard are the world’s poor – in the United States as well, but particularly in\ndeveloping countries in Africa and elsewhere. Simply put, Russia’s unprovoked war of\naggression against its neighbor has hurt Africa by exacerbating existing food insecurity and\ncreating an unnecessary drag on the continent’s economy.\nDuring last month’s Africa Leaders Summit in Washington, President Biden and I met with\nAfrican heads of state to discuss how we can redouble our efforts to strengthen food security.\nToday, I want to speak to the actions we are taking to respond to the urgent food security crisis. I\nwould also like to speak to our long-term partnership with African nations to build more\n\n\fresilient food systems. Our goal is to get to a place where the need for humanitarian aid is\nexceptional and rare. And we want to advance a future where Africa participates more fully in\nglobal food and fertilizer markets and supply chains.\nThe United States is taking strong and immediate actions to alleviate hunger. Last year, the\nUnited States committed $13 billion in humanitarian and food security assistance across the\nglobe. This includes President Biden’s announcement last month of $2 billion in emergency,\nlifesaving assistance in Africa.\nWe have also rallied countries and international organizations to avoid export restrictions and\nimpediments to humanitarian aid delivery. It is important that food and other critical supplies\ncan flow more freely. The United States has made sure to exempt food and key agricultural\ncommodity exports from its sanctions programs to further enable their flow onto global\nmarkets.\nAnd we have worked with partners to facilitate Ukrainian food exports through the Black Sea\nGrain Initiative, including shipments bound for Africa.\nAnd with our partners, we are leading efforts to stabilize global energy prices by introducing a\ncap on the price of Russian oil. This policy maintains flows of discounted Russian oil – helping\nmitigate further price shocks on emerging economies while also reducing Russian revenues.\nWhile the policy is in the early stages of implementation, Treasury estimates that it could result\nin around $6 billion in annual savings for the 17 largest net oil-importing African countries.\nWe are also working with international financial institutions to surge and scale their food\nsecurity efforts. Last April, I convened a “call to action” with the heads of these institutions and\nrepresentatives from the G7 and G20 to spur coordinated global action. The World Bank is\nimplementing up to $30 billion in projects — including $12 billion in new programming — to\nrespond to the food security crisis. The African Development Bank continues to advance a $1.5\nbillion facility to address the food crisis in Africa. This facility is projected to benefit 20 million\nAfrican smallholder farmers. With new seeds and fertilizer, these farmers will be better prepared\nto rapidly produce up to 38 million tons of wheat, maize, rice, and soybeans to meet the\ndemands of the continent.\nAs we tackle acute needs now, we must also take a longer view and scale up investment in long\nterm food system resilience. Africa is a perfect example of these dual challenges. It is a continent\nthat faces acute food needs. But it is one that also has the potential not only to feed itself but\n\n\falso to help feed the world – if the right steps are taken. As an example, Zambia’s maize\nproduction has the potential to turn it into a regional food hub.\nUnder President Biden’s leadership, the United States announced a U.S.-Africa strategic\npartnership on food security at the Africa Leaders Summit last month. We will work together to\nimprove Africa’s access to global agricultural commodity markets and meet its growing demand\nfor fertilizer. And we will promote effective agricultural practices and approaches, including\nstrengthening climate resilience.\nLet me speak for a moment specifically on climate. We know that over the last decade, storms,\nfloods, and droughts in Africa have increased in severity and frequency. This has hurt\nagricultural yields. The same is true globally as well. Indeed, farmers – like the ones we work\nwith here – are often the first witnesses of the changing climate and its consequences. They\nknow that climate change is not just a future threat; it is already here.\nWe must take urgent action to adapt agricultural practices and technology to the changing\nclimate. The project we are visiting today helps small-scale farmers better manage the impacts\nof climate change. It’s funded by the Green Climate Fund, which the United States is proud to be\na part of. We are committed to making sure that the Fund has sufficient resources to carry on\nthis important work. We are also advancing climate adaptation through our latest $155 million\ncontribution to the Global Agriculture and Food Security Program. We are prioritizing innovative\nprojects, such as providing farmers with new seeds that are more resilient to droughts, heat,\nand other extreme conditions. Already today, two-thirds of the Program’s projects are climaterelated.\nAfrica’s long-term strategy to address food security also requires developing its infrastructure\nand logistics capabilities. The continent needs a robust capacity not only to grow food, but to\nmake sure it can be cultivated, stored, and efficiently transported. The G7’s Partnership for\nGlobal Infrastructure and Investment will mobilize hundreds of billions of dollars over the next\nfive years into a range of global infrastructure investments. The United States is also advocating\nagainst export bans in the agricultural sector so that food can move more freely. And we are\nstrongly supportive of increased trade between African countries through the implementation\nof the African Continental Free Trade Area.\nAn issue of personal importance to me is the role of women in the economy and society. In\nZambia, women constitute more than half of the agricultural labor force. And yet significant\ngender inequities persist in access to land, capital, seeds, and fertilizer. This suppresses\nagricultural productivity and harms output. I believe that we must advance the cause of women\n\n\ffarmers across Africa. It’s the right thing to do. But it is also crucial for food security and the\neconomy.\nThis is a difficult time for many in Africa and around the globe. But that makes our partnership\neven more important. As President Biden said last month, it’s not just about showing the will to\nwork with Africans. It’s also about doing the hard work of tackling these challenges together. We\nare prepared to do just that.\n\nThank you.\n\n\f"

            "content": "U.S. DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY\nRemarks by Secretary of the Treasury Janet L. Yellen During Visit\nto Gorée Island in Dakar, Senegal\nJanuary 21, 2023\n\nAs Prepared for Delivery\nI want to thank Mayor Senghor and everyone here for welcoming me to this Island. Today’s visit\nholds a special significance.\nHere at Goree Island, I can’t help but think about the unspeakable cruelty of those who engaged\nin the slave trade. I feel an overwhelming sense of sadness and pain thinking about those stolen\nfrom their families, their deadly journey across the Atlantic, and the horrific circumstances\nencountered by those who made it alive.\nUltimately, Gorée Island reminds us that the histories of Africa and America are intimately\nconnected. Gorée and the trans-Atlantic slave trade are not just a part of African history. They\nare a part of American history as well. We know that the tragedy did not stop with the\ngeneration of humans taken from here. Even after slavery was abolished, Black Americans –\nmany of whom can trace their descendance through ports like this across Africa – were denied\nthe rights and freedoms promised to them under our Constitution. In both Africa and the United\nStates, even as we have made tremendous strides, we are still living with the brutal\nconsequences of the trans-Atlantic slave trade.\nI think it is important not only to speak about the transgressions of those who engaged in the\nslave trade, but also to tell the story of the enslaved people. And that story, while full of\nsuffering, is also full of perseverance and hope. In the United States, what is remarkable is how\nmany African American men and women overcame the odds, created better lives for themselves\nand their descendants, and became central to our economy and democracy — building our\ncities, powering our industries, and bending the conscience of the United States and the world\ntoward justice. All of this in the face of systemic social and economic injustice.\nWith remembrance, I believe, can come progress and renewal. And that is what we see here.\nToday, there are signs of vibrant life around Gorée — a prominent art scene, a place of\neducation, and thousands who call this place home. And, inspired by America’s quest for racial\n\n\fjustice, in 2020 the island’s main plaza dropped its colonial roots and changed its name to\nFreedom and Human Dignity Square. Gorée is now emblematic of what we all know well about\nthe African continent itself: a hub of culture and activity, a land with a painful colonial past but a\nhopeful future, and a symbol of the enduring universal value of human dignity.\nWhat I take from this place is the importance of redoubling our commitment to fight for our\nshared values and principles wherever they are threatened – in the United States, in Africa, and\naround the world. We have more work to do.\nThank you.\n\n####\n\n\f"

Yellen at Weldy\nLamont Groundbreaking of Rural Electrification Project\nJanuary 21, 2023\n\nAs Prepared for Delivery\nThank you very much for joining me here today. Breaking ground on this project is an important\nmarker of the progress we are making on electrification across Africa and the world.\nSenegal has among the highest rates of electrification across Sub-Saharan Africa, estimated at\nbetween 70 and 80%. Yet significant disparities between urban and rural access to electricity\nremain.\nThese gaps can hinder opportunity for households and businesses in areas otherwise ripe for\neconomic development.\nExpanding electricity to disconnected areas helps people start new businesses, gives children\naccess to new educational resources, and facilitates residents’ access to basic services.\nSimply put, this groundbreaking will create a higher quality of life in many communities, and it\nwill help Senegal’s economy grow and prosper. It will also help Senegal get one step closer to its\ngoal of universal electricity access by 2025.\nA key focus of my trip to Senegal and two other countries in Africa is to discuss ways in which\nthe U.S. and the continent can partner together to benefit both of our economies.\nIt’s hard to think of a better example than the project we are breaking ground on today.\nThis project includes extending power to households and businesses that ultimately will see\nmore than 350,000 people secure reliable electricity. And it includes an important renewable\nenergy element with a solar grid to power 70 villages.\nThis project demonstrates that we can broaden economic opportunity in Senegal, as well as in\nAmerica. The work being done is supported by an Illinois-based engineering and construction\nfirm – Weldy Lamont Associates – and will help support approximately 500 American jobs in 14\nU.S. states. Congratulations to all the staff here in Senegal and back in the U.S. who have made\nthis milestone today of breaking ground possible.\n\n\fThe United States was pleased to support this important investment in Senegal through\ntechnical assistance from the U.S-led Power Africa initiative, capacity building through the U.S.\nAgency for Trade and Development, and a $91 million loan guarantee from the Export-Import\nBank.\nOur engagement on this project – and indeed on so many projects across Africa – is not\ntransactional, for show, or for the short-term.\nOur goal is to further deepen our economic relationship and to invest in expanding energy\naccess in a way that uses renewable resources spread across the continent.\nWith this approach, Senegal can rely on energy sources that are within its borders, cost effective\nand not prone to volatility in prices. And we are well underway.\nThis project builds upon the legacy of Power Africa which has helped connect 165 million people\nto reliable electricity across Africa.\nSince 2021, the U.S. Government has helped facilitate more than 800 two-way trade and\ninvestment deals across 47 African countries – for a total estimated value of over $18 billion.\nThe U.S. government continues to play a critical role in catalyzing sustainable energy\ninfrastructure investments.\nAlong with our G7 partners, we launched the Partnership for Global Infrastructure and\nInvestment, or PGII, a values-driven, high-impact, and transparent partnership to help meet the\ninfrastructure needs of low- and middle-income countries.\nWith the most acute infrastructure needs of any region, Africa is a priority region for PGII.\nPartners across the U.S. government working on supporting infrastructure development\nthrough the PGII are deeply engaged in the region and announcing new projects and initiatives\non a rolling basis.\nThe United States is here as a partner and friend for the long haul. This project is just one small\n– yet impactful – example of a broad and deep partnership.\nThank you very much.\n\n\f"

Yellen at the\nDélégation Générale à l’Entrepreneuriat Rapide des Femmes et\ndes Jeunes (DER/FJ) in Dakar, Senegal\nJanuary 20, 2023\n\nAs Prepared for Delivery\nGood morning, everyone. And thank you for that kind introduction.\n\nI’m grateful to be here. Senegal is known as a bustling economic center in West Africa and a\nstrong voice for international cooperation on the world stage. But to many visitors, it is also\nknown for the extraordinary warmth and generosity of its people. I’ve personally felt that during\nthis visit. So, thank you for your kind welcome: I now understand first-hand why Senegal is\ncalled the Land of Teranga.\n\nAnd I’m delighted to be here at DER. This organization epitomizes the promise of the young\npeople and women of Senegal. The vibrant spirit that I’ve felt here, and in Senegal more\nbroadly, furthers my belief in the future of this country and the region.\nLast month, I had the opportunity to meet with African heads of state — including President Sall\n— at the Africa Leaders Summit in Washington. President Biden and I conveyed to these leaders\na simple message: the United States is all in on Africa, and all in with Africa. There is much work\nto do to tackle the many challenges facing Africa and the globe. But we believe that Africa will\nshape the future of the global economy. Africa’s demographic boom can create massive\neconomic opportunity. And its talents and resources can grow global industries and drive global\ninnovation.\nIn other words, Africa’s success will mean success for all of us. And the United States is here as a\npartner to help Africa realize its massive economic potential at home and advance its growing\n\n\fleadership abroad.\nAfrica’s incredible promise is why the United States outlined a new Strategy Toward SubSaharan Africa. This strategy seeks to modernize our relationship by focusing on what we can do\ntogether, rather than what we can do for each other. It’s a relationship based on mutual\ncooperation and greater ambition. And it’s why we are taking serious, concerted efforts to\ndeepen and sustain engagement with Africa. In this new year, the President, the Vice President,\nand several of my cabinet counterparts will also travel to a number of African countries.\nOur engagement is not transactional, for show, or for the short-term. We are here to work with\nyou as friends and partners for the long haul — through moments of stress and times of\nopportunity.\nOver the course of my trip, I intend to bring that message of promise and partnership directly to\nthe people of Senegal, Zambia, South Africa, and the continent more broadly. That begins\ntoday. I’ll start by discussing Africa’s tremendous economic opportunity. Then, I’ll turn to our\npartnership on global priorities, including climate, health, and conflict. Finally, I will discuss\nhow success on all of these objectives depends on strong, open, and accountable institutions.\n\nU.S.-AFRICA ECONOMIC RELATIONSHIP\nLet’s start with a fundamental fact: Africa will shape the trajectory of the world economy over\nthe next century.\n\nAfrica’s demographics present massive promise. In less than 30 years, Africans are projected to\nmake up a quarter of the world’s population. But it’s not just a matter of sheer numbers. Across\nthe continent, people are becoming more educated, urbanized, and connected to the world\nthan at any other time in history. And while many other regions face aging populations, Africa\ncontinues to lead as the youngest continent in the world. Here in Senegal, the median age is 19\nyears. 1.7 million Africans now enter the job market every month. And by 2035, the number of\nSub-Saharan Africans reaching working age will exceed that of the rest of the world combined.\n\n\fA rising share of working-age people presents an opportunity for the continent. More workers\ncan drive growth, generating more resources to increase investment, and making educating the\nyoung and supporting the vulnerable easier. Africa’s growing middle class also presents an\nopportunity for the United States. It means a bigger market for products. And it means more\ninvestment opportunities for American firms that are already creating jobs on the continent.\nThis can be a win-win for our economies.\nBut demographics is not destiny. Africa’s demographic momentum can propel economic growth\nif, and only if, adequate investments are made today to create economic opportunity for all.\nSome, however, rightly warn of the opposite danger. Throughout history, young populations\nwithout opportunity can spell greater risk of unrest and conflict.\nThis is Africa’s most daunting and most promising task: to provide broad and inclusive\nopportunity to the next generation of Africans. I believe it is a challenge with enormous\nconsequences for the world as well.\n\nLuckily, Africa holds in its hands the ability to shape this future. And the United States is\ncommitted to working with Africa, knowing that a strong Africa will benefit us as well. This\npartnership begins with two pillars of our engagement: economic development and mutually\nbeneficial trade and investment.\n\nA. Economic Development\nAfricans must determine for themselves how best to drive their economic growth. But there are\nhelpful lessons that Africa can draw from the rest of the world. For example, we know that no\nsustained economic growth can occur without basic infrastructure and services.\n\nThe United States is committed to building on Africa’s significant progress in economic\ndevelopment over the past few decades. This includes investing in Africa’s people through\nimproved access to quality education and healthcare – along with high-quality infrastructure.\nToday, our Development Finance Corporation alone has more than $11 billion in active\ncommitments across the region. The Millennium Challenge Corporation is working in 14 African\ncountries with over $3 billion in active programs, with more in the pipeline. And the G7 aims to\n\n\fmobilize $600 billion into global infrastructure investments over the next five years as part of the\nPartnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment.\nDigital infrastructure has been a key focus. Connectivity provides massive potential: to create\ngood jobs and capitalize on Africa’s growing entrepreneurial ecosystem. As everyone here\nknows, African startups now touch almost every sector of the economy. Last month, President\nBiden announced a new digital initiative with Africa. We intend to invest over $350 million to\nexpand affordable internet access and boost digital skills and entrepreneurship. As Africans\nbuild their digital infrastructure, we are also connecting them with trusted suppliers — those\nwith robust privacy and cybersecurity standards.\n\nAmerica’s investments in Africa are motivated by our mutually beneficial, long-term partnership.\nThe goal is to generate positive economic returns while fostering sustainable debt. So, our\ninvestments prioritize rigorous technical standards. And they reflect high standards for\naccountability and transparency, along with careful consideration of risks to debt sustainability.\n\nB. Mutually Beneficial Trade and Investment\nAs Africa continues to develop, I believe we also have an extraordinary\nopportunity to expand mutually beneficial trade and investment.\nOver the past two years, the United States has helped facilitate more than 800 trade and\ninvestment deals across 47 African countries. Programs like Prosper Africa boost our economic\nintegration by helping U.S. and African businesses and investors identify new partners and\nopportunities for growth. And for over two decades, we have provided Senegal and other\neligible Sub-Saharan African countries with duty-free access to the U.S. market for thousands of\nproducts. We pursue deeper economic integration with Africa because we believe that it is in our\nbest economic interests. Our leadership in the industries of the future depends on our\npartnership with Africa — industries like clean energy, electric vehicles, and cutting-edge\ntechnology.\n\nBut we know that expanding trade beyond the continent is not enough. African products and\ninnovations should be made more readily accessible to Africans themselves. That’s why the\n\n\fUnited States is strongly supportive of the African Continental Free Trade Area. Once fully\nimplemented, this free trade area will encompass over 1.3 billion people with a combined GDP\nof over $3 trillion. Estimates indicate that it could raise real income by roughly 9 percent by\n2035.\n\nC. Immediate Challenges\nAs we deepen our engagement in Africa, we are cognizant that these long-term investments are\ntaking place amid one of the most volatile periods in recent history. Prior to 2020, several\nAfrican countries ranked among the fastest-growing economies in the world. We saw substantial\nalleviation of poverty on the continent. But the COVID pandemic and Russia’s war in Ukraine\nhave led to slower growth and pushed millions of Africans into poverty and hunger.\n\nLet me be clear: the single best thing we can do to help the global economy is to end Russia’s\nillegal and unprovoked war in Ukraine. Russia’s barbaric aggression against its neighbor is\nparticularly being felt by Africa and its people. Russia’s war and weaponization of food has\nexacerbated food insecurity and caused untold suffering. And the global economic headwinds\ncaused by the actions of a single man — President Putin — is creating an unnecessary drag on\nAfrica’s economy.\n\nThe United States is partnering with African leaders to mitigate the damage caused by Russia.\nLast year, we committed around $13 billion in emergency aid and food assistance. And we\nworked to unlock Ukrainian food exports in the Black Sea Grain Initiative, including those\nheaded to Africa. We are now establishing a U.S.-Africa strategic partnership on food security.\nThis partnership will address the short-term needs of upwards of 300 million Africans affected\nby the food crisis. And it will also help build resilient and sustainable food systems for the long\nterm.\nRussia’s brutal war has also threatened energy security around the world. We have worked with\na coalition of countries to implement a cap on the price of Russian crude oil. And we will soon\ndo the same for Russian refined products. The aim is to stabilize global energy prices and reduce\nRussian revenues. While the policy is in the early stages of implementation, Treasury estimates\n\n\fthat it has the potential to result in around $6 billion in annual savings for the 17 largest net oilimporting African countries. We are seeing examples of emerging markets saving even more by\nusing the price cap to negotiate steeper discounts with Russia. And we encourage more\ncountries to do the same.\n\nFinally, we have seen the impacts of global turmoil on debt sustainability. Debt is a critical\ninstrument for development when it is used well — that is, as part of a broader financial strategy\nthat includes effectively mobilizing domestic resources. We support countries putting in place\nstrong debt management and transparency practices. But we know that countries that do so\ncan still fall into debt distress.\n\nWe believe that it is important to provide timely and comprehensive debt treatments. Many\nAfrican economies are suffering from a lack of fiscal space, but they must be able to continue to\nmake important public investments. And many simply have unsustainable debt burdens. We\nbelieve that the international community, including China, needs to provide meaningful debt\nrelief to help countries regain their footing. Timely debt relief is in the interests of both debtors\nand creditors.\n\nPARTNERSHIP WITH AFRICA ON GLOBAL CHALLENGES\nAs Africa unlocks its economic promise, the United States will continue to support its growing\nrole on the world stage. African countries firmly belong at the table. Their communities are\ndisproportionately vulnerable to the effects of global challenges. And any serious solution\nrequires African leadership and African voices. This is one reason why we support the addition\nof the African Union as a permanent member of the G20. Africa’s voice should not be one of an\ninvited guest, but that of a full member.\nLet me speak about three transnational challenges: climate, health, and conflict.\n\nA. Climate\n\n\fAfrica is responsible for only 2 to 4 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions. But the\ncontinent is among the most susceptible to the devastating effects of climate change. African\ncountries include 17 of the world’s top 20 climate-vulnerable countries.\n\nAt the same time, we believe that Africa is uniquely positioned to play a growing role in our\nefforts to adapt to and mitigate climate change. The Congo Basin — the “lungs of Africa” —\nserves as the world’s largest carbon sink. The continent is particularly well placed to take\nadvantage of energy from renewable sources like the wind, sun, and geothermal. And we know\nthat African ingenuity will help pioneer the next generation of clean energy technologies.\n\nOver the coming years, the United States will expand its partnership with Africa on conservation,\nclimate adaptation, and access to clean energy. Since 2021, our Administration has invested and\nintends to provide over $1 billion to support African-led climate efforts. Here in Senegal, we\nhave partnered in the construction of the largest wind farm in West Africa: a 158-megawatt\npower plant near Dakar. This project is helping two million people gain access to power for the\nfirst time — in addition to mitigating the release of greenhouse gases. Later in this trip, I will\nspeak to how we are facilitating a just energy transition in South Africa.\nAs we partner with Africa on clean energy, let me be clear: it is unacceptable that a continent\nwith such rich potential for clean energy is also the one with the greatest energy deficit. Six\nhundred million Africans still lack access to electricity. The United States is committed to\npartnering with African countries to close this gap. Power Africa has already helped connect\nmore than 165 million Africans to electricity — and we believe its work is more important than\never.\n\nB. Health\nAs with the changing climate, we also know that Africa has been disproportionately impacted by\nglobal health challenges. Africa has long been on the world’s front lines against severe diseases\n— from malaria to HIV/AIDS to Ebola.\nHistory demonstrates what we can do together. Together, we have mitigated recurring\noutbreaks of Ebola in Africa. Our largest foreign assistance program, PEPFAR — designed to\n\n\frespond to HIV/AIDS — has saved over 25 million lives over the past two decades. Thanks to our\nsustained partnership, rates of African child and maternal mortality have plummeted, along\nwith the rates of Africans dying from malaria.\n\nU.S.-Africa health cooperation not only saves the lives of people in Africa. It helps mitigate\nhealth security threats to the U.S. and the world. That’s why the United States has committed\nnearly $20 billion to health programs in Africa since 2021. Over the past year, we have worked\nintensely with our partners — including Senegal — to establish and operationalize the $1.6\nbillion Pandemic Fund to prevent, prepare for, and respond to future pandemics, across Africa\nand beyond.\n\nC. Conflict and Fragility\nAnother transnational issue that requires attention is conflict and fragility.\nConflict causes immense human suffering. It also stunts economic growth. Growth in countries\nengaged in intense conflicts is about 2.5 percent lower than countries not engaged in conflict.\nLast fall, I hosted ten African finance ministers for a dinner in Washington; all of them cited\nconflict as a major concern. They discussed the strain that security spending places on\noverstretched budgets at the expense of other public investments like health and education.\nEffective solutions to fragility and conflict must include both short-term security responses as\nwell as long-term investments in broadening economic opportunity. Through the Global\nFragility Act, the United States is partnering with African countries to outline a comprehensive\nstrategy for tackling conflict and promoting stability. This includes empowering those who have\nhistorically been left out.\n\nMaintaining sustained action on these global challenges will require an evolution of our\ninternational institutions. The multilateral development banks already play a strong role in\nsupporting poverty reduction and economic growth across Africa. But these banks should also\ntackle the growing threat of transnational challenges as part of their core work. We believe that\nthese banks can make significant progress on the challenges that I just spoke about: climate,\n\n\fhealth, and conflict. And we believe that doing so reinforces work on poverty and growth. After\nall, global challenges have a disproportionate impact on the poor.\nOur request for this evolution is already underway with the World Bank. Over time, we intend to\nroll this out to other banks, including the African Development Bank. We look forward to\nworking with African nations to shape the trajectory of these reforms.\n\nOpen and Accountable Institutions\nSo, success in the work that I’ve spoken about today requires a reform of international\ninstitutions. Success also requires investment in African institutions themselves. Surveys\nindicate that women and men in Africa are calling for greater accountability and transparency\nfrom their governments. Africans know that these reforms are a prerequisite for effective\ndelivery of basic services and sustainable economic growth.\nAmerica’s own experience demonstrates the power of democratic institutions. Our economic\ndevelopment has been underpinned by institutions that, while imperfect, have enabled us to\nexpand opportunity and grow living standards. We know that the road towards democracy and\nopenness can sometimes be difficult. But our experience shows that it is worth it.\n\nWe pledge to work with African countries to help build institutional capacity. Indeed, our\nengagement with Africa prioritizes adherence to high standards like transparency, good\ngovernance, accountability, and environmental sustainability. In certain cases, we also\ncondition our investments on political reforms. These reforms help enable effective use of funds\nand mobilization of private sector investments.\n\nWhile our approach may be exacting, we believe it delivers lasting results. Countries need to be\nwary of shiny deals that may be opaque and ultimately fail to actually benefit the people they\nwere purportedly designed to help in the first place. This can leave countries with a legacy of\ndebt, diverted resources, and environmental destruction.\n\n\fThe United States has taken a different approach. At Treasury, our technical assistance\nprograms have helped African partners build up their public financial management capacities.\nAnd we have used our tools to combat corruption and illicit finance. Two months ago in South\nAfrica, we hosted a banking dialogue with government and financial sector representatives from\nover a dozen African jurisdictions. Our officials discussed common challenges related to\ncombatting corruption and illicit finance, as well as strengthening financial integration between\nAfrican countries and the United States. We have sanctioned officials in countries from Liberia to\nMali for their involvement in corruption. And as illicit actors exploit weaknesses in the\ninternational financial system, we are working to strengthen global standards to improve\ncorporate transparency and combat money laundering.\n\nClosing\nAfrica’s transformation over the next few decades will reshape the 21st century global economy.\nThe coming decades will see a demographic shift the likes of which we have rarely seen in\nrecent history. If we make the right investments today, this demographic momentum can\ntranslate into economic momentum. And Africa’s transformation will have effects that reach far\nbeyond its borders.\nSome speak about Africa rising over the next few decades. But I see it differently. While it has\nnot always been adequately highlighted, Africa has always been at the center of world history. It\nis, after all, the birthplace of humanity. And over the past few centuries, our histories have been\nintertwined, with our people’s drawing strength and inspiration from each other in our\nrespective struggles for civil rights. Today, the world continues to be enriched by the ingenuity\nand culture of Africa. In this job, I have been fortunate to have had the counsel of an American\nimmigrant born in Nigeria: Wally Adeyemo, who is our Deputy Secretary of the Treasury.\n\nPut simply, the way I see it is that the world is finally catching up to recognizing Africa’s\ncontributions — past and future.\nOur collective work over the coming years can build a continent — and a world — that is more\nprosperous, open, and secure. I look forward to working with you to make that vision a reality.\n\n\fThank you.\n\n####\n\n\f"

The strength of that relationship\nwill be furthered by President Biden and Prime Minister Trudeau at the North American Leaders\nSummit today in Mexico City.\nAs I said when I visited Toronto last year, America seeks to deepen our economic ties with\nCanada, strengthen our supply chains, and mitigate against global challenges through friendshoring.\nWe have a particular opportunity to do so by enhancing our collaboration on clean energy\ntechnologies that will increase our energy security against autocrats like Putin, power our clean\nenergy transition, and create good-paying jobs.\nI also want to thank you for your unwavering support for the people of Ukraine in the face of\nRussia’s unprovoked and barbaric invasion. Together, the United States and Canada have\nworked with a global coalition to impose on Russia some of the toughest sanctions in history.\nOur goal has been to disrupt military supply chains and deny Russia the weapons they need to\nwage their illegal war, and to limit the revenue they’re using to pay for it. We’ve seen significant\nprogress on both fronts with Russia’s fiscal outlook becoming increasingly grim, and with\nRussian soldiers being forced to rely on outdated technology and suppliers of last resort like\nNorth Korea and Iran.\nWe have also worked closely together on the G7’s price cap on Russian oil, which seeks to both\npromote stable global energy markets while limiting the Kremlin’s most important source of\nrevenue. While the crude oil price cap has only been in effect for around a month, we have\nalready seen early progress towards both of those goals – with senior Russian officials having\n\n\fadmitted that the price cap is cutting into Russia’s energy revenue. Global energy markets have\nalso remained well-supplied, and public reports indicate that countries are using the price cap\nto drive steep bargains on the price of Russian oil imports.\nWe have much more to discuss today and I look forward to our conversation. With that, I invite\nDeputy Prime Minister Freeland to provide opening remarks.\n###\n\n\f"

I am pleased to welcome you today to a discussion with President Biden\nand other Leaders on the food security crisis impacting Africa and the rest of the world.\nA strengthened U.S. partnership with Africa is vitally important to enhance food security in\nthe immediate term, as well as to promote the long-term resilience of food systems, in Africa\nand globally.\nAs we know, our food systems have been under stress due to climate change, conflict, and\nCOVID-19ʼs economic disruptions. Russiaʼs illegal war in Ukraine has only magnified these\nchallenges.\nWe heard from President Biden how the United States has—and will continue to—mount a\nrobust and swi� response to food insecurity in Africa. We are doing so through bilateral and\nmultilateral channels, and in partnership with you and other African leaders.\nLast Spring, I called on the international financial institutions to swi�ly surge and scale their\ne�orts to increase food security. They responded by launching an Action Plan to Address\nFood Insecurity and have since made meaningful progress.\nWe also stepped-up support for agile mechanisms that prioritize country-ownership like the\nGlobal Agriculture and Food Security Program. The Program will soon announce new funding\nto help build resilient and sustainable agriculture and food systems, particularly in Africa.\nG20 Leaders recently highlighted the importance of a robust global food security response.\nUnder Indiaʼs G20 presidency, we will be mapping the existing policy responses to identify\nany gaps, analyze the spillover e�ects from food and energy insecurity, and consider how\nmacro-policy tools can be used by G20 economies to address these challenges.\n\n\fThese e�orts are making a di�erence for the most vulnerable in Africa. Yet more needs to be\ndone, including on longer-term agricultural and food supply chain development, research\nand development, key logistics and infrastructure.\nThe U.S. is keen to further strengthen our partnership on this vital issue with you. We look\nforward to hearing from you today about how we can all do more—and do so quickly.\n####\n\n\f"

Senegal is a major\neconomic center in West Africa and an important partner to the United States. As Chair of the\nAfrican Union, Senegal also plays a key role as a leader on the continent. We have much to\ndiscuss on how best to meet the challenges we face, including food security and the need for\nsustainable infrastructure investment to boost economic growth and prosperity.\nSenegal, like many other countries, has experienced rising food security challenges, including in\nterms of access and pricing. Russia’s ongoing war in Ukraine has added further stress to the\nsystem, and raised local food and fertilizer costs beyond reach for vulnerable populations.\nPresident Sall and I will discuss how the international community can further work with Senegal\n– and African countries more broadly – to address short-term food security needs and the longterm imperative to promote transformational investments in sustainable and resilient food\nsystems. The International Financial Institutions’ Action Plan to Address Food Insecurity is an\nimportant tool in this regard.\nWe will also speak about the need for sustainable, high-quality, infrastructure investment. By\nworking together, we can make the African economy stronger and more resilient. These\ninvestments are vital for unlocking the enormous economic potential of Africa in the decades to\ncome. And a prosperous continent won’t just benefit Africa – it will make the American and\nglobal economy stronger as well.\nWe have already made progress in this area. As just one example, the U.S. Development Finance\nCorporation supported the construction of the largest wind farm in West Africa – a 158megawatt power plant near Dakar. This project has helped two million people gain access to\npower for the first time – in addition to other economic benefits. President Sall and I will discuss\n\n\fhow Senegal and other countries can explore future investment project ideas in partnership\nwith the U.S..\nIn addition, we will discuss how the multilateral development banks can help countries like\nSenegal tackle traditional development challenges and reduce poverty while also better\naddressing cross-border challenges like climate change, pandemics, and spillovers from\nfragility.\nI greatly appreciate that President Sall was able to travel to Washington for the U.S. – African\nLeaders Summit and for the opportunity to discuss how we strengthen our partnership with\nAfrica, and with Senegal in particular.\n\n####\n\n\f"

Yellen at the\nBureau of Engraving and Printing Facility in Fort Worth, Texas\nDecember 8, 2022\n\nAs Prepared for Delivery\n\nThank you for that kind introduction, Chief Malerba, and for the extraordinary job you are doing\nas our Treasurer. And good morning, everyone. I’m delighted to be in Fort Worth – and at the\nBureau of Engraving and Printing.\nLet me begin by thanking my BEP colleagues here today: for joining us and for all of your hard\nwork. The currency that you produce here touches just about everyone in the United States and\nmillions more across the world. Our currency is essential to the functioning of the financial\nsystem. And its integrity is core to our national security.\nBEP employees have always gone above and beyond. But you’ve done so at a whole new scale\nunder heightened pressure over the past few years. When much of the nation was sheltering at\nhome, most of you reported to work in person to run essential operations during the pandemic.\nYou’ve worked overtime and on weekends to meet the historic demand for U.S. currency. And\nyou did so successfully: on schedule and under budget.\nBut that’s not all. As if these immediate needs weren’t enough of a challenge, many of you have\ndedicated time and energy to position BEP for the coming decades. You’ve made significant\nprogress on our very ambitious plans to expand the Fort Worth facility and to build a new facility\nin Maryland. And most importantly, many of you are spending time to mentor and train the next\ngeneration of highly skilled union workers. Indeed, BEP benefits from over 1,200 dedicated\nunion members.\nI want to thank you for all you are doing. Each of you is taking on so much. I know you take\ntremendous pride in your work. And I hope you know how appreciative I am of your work as\nwell.\n\n\fI want to especially thank Director Len Olijar Director Olijar is set to retire from federal service\nnext month after nearly 35 years at BEP. Director: your dedication to BEP, Treasury, and our\ncountry epitomizes the spirit of public service. We’re grateful for your commitment to this\norganization – from when you were coming up the ranks of the Bureau to your many years at the\nhelm.\n\nIMPORTANCE OF OUR CURRENCY AND COINAGE\nIt’s no surprise why Director Olijar and many of you have spent your careers dedicated to the\nwork of this organization. Currency plays a critical role in our economy. Economists know that\nmoney serves a number of traditional purposes: as a store of value, a medium of exchange, and\na unit of account. Put simply, our currency powers our economic engine. It enables people to\nexchange goods and services with each other more efficiently. But money also has a deeper\nsocial purpose. Currency is something we use and touch every day. When done right, it can tell\nus who we are, what we value, and what is possible.\nSome of the first banknotes issued by the Continental Congress included unifying messages like\n“we are one.” Coins in the 20thcentury featured national heroes like Susan B. Anthony. She was\nthe first woman to appear on a circulating U.S. coin. This year, the Mint has rolled out coinage\nwith the faces of five remarkable American women. That includes trailblazers like Maya Angelou,\npoet and civil rights activist, and Anna May Wong, Hollywood’s first Chinese-American film star.\nBut these coins are just the beginning of our work to ensure our currency and coinage reflect the\nfull fabric of our nation. With your hard work, we will be introducing new currency designs in the\ncoming years – including placing Harriet Tubman’s portrait on the $20 bill.\nIt’s customary that Treasury Secretaries provide their signature to be featured on our nation’s\ncurrency. You’d think this would be a straightforward process. But the founding fathers did not\naccount for what seems to be a common attribute for Treasury Secretaries: terrible handwriting.\nMy friend Tim Geithner famously had to change his signature in order to make it legible. In an\ninterview back in 2012, he described that the change was made not for “elegance” but simply\nfor “clarity.” President Obama joked during Jack Lew’s nomination as Secretary that he should\ntry to make “at least one letter legible” in his signature. The good news is that President Biden\ndid not make a similar request when he nominated me. But I’ll admit: I spent some quality time\npracticing my signature before submitting it to Director Olijar.\nIn all seriousness: I’m honored that, thanks to the hard work of this team, the first banknotes\nwith my signature are being delivered this month to the Federal Reserve. They’ll be in\n\n\fcirculation starting in the new year. Some will note that this is the first time the signature of a\nwoman Treasury Secretary will be on a U.S. banknote. And the first time the signatures of two\nwomen will be on our currency.\nBut this is really not about me or Treasurer Malerba. To me, these notes represent the hard,\nongoing work of the Treasury Department to strengthen our economy and advance our\neconomic standing around the world. And it is also a reminder of the contributions of the\nwomen who have worked at Treasury and in the economics profession.\nLet me say a bit about both.\n\nMAJOR TREASURY ACCOMPLISHMENTS\nWhen our Administration first entered office, the economy was in the depths of the COVID\npandemic. The coronavirus was claiming more American lives a week than it had at any other\npoint since the start of the pandemic. Millions of jobs had been lost. And there was tremendous\nuncertainty about the fate of our economy. In 2020 and 2021, we were facing the tail risk of an\neconomic downturn that matched the Great Depression.\nYet over the past two years, our country has seen a historic economic recovery. Treasury has\nbeen at the forefront of these efforts. Through the American Rescue Plan, we provided aid to\nhouseholds, businesses, and state and local governments to help them get through a once-in-acentury pandemic. This assistance saved American lives and kept families in their homes. And it\nprovided critical financial relief to those who were suffering.\nAt the same time, we have also made long-term investments in our economic strength. The\npassage of the CHIPS Act and the Inflation Reduction Act this year will enable the growth of two\nimportant industries of the future: semiconductors and clean energy. Nearly three-quarters – or\n$270 billion – of the Inflation Reduction Act’s climate investments are delivered via tax\nincentives. This puts Treasury at the forefront of implementing the biggest climate action in our\nnation’s history. The law will also position us to capitalize on a wave of economic opportunities\nfor the American people, including in communities often overlooked. As we make these targeted\ninvestments, we are also improving our revenue collection system. We have secured muchneeded long-term funding for the IRS. The surge of new resources will modernize the IRS and\ndramatically improve taxpayer service. And it will enable the agency to make sure that all\nAmericans are playing by the same tax rules.\n\n\fAs we’ve rescued and invested in our economy, we have also strengthened our financial system.\nIn the face of increased market volatility, our financial system remains resilient and continues to\noperate well through uncertainties. Since the beginning of the Administration, Treasury has\nworked with financial regulators to improve the resiliency of the Treasury market. This market\nplays a critical role in supporting the global financial system and financing the federal\ngovernment. We have also worked to reduce risks in financial firms and activities that operate\noutside – but are connected to – the traditionally regulated banking system. And we are\naddressing potential emerging risks to the financial system from climate change and digital\nassets. We will continue this work through 2023 and beyond.\nBeyond addressing our considerable domestic challenges, we’ve also advanced the economic\ninterests of Americans around the world. Some of our biggest economic challenges are global.\nToday, the world economy faces serious headwinds in large part due to Putin’s barbaric war in\nUkraine.\nWhen Russia invaded Ukraine earlier this year, the United States joined partners and allies to\nimplement a historic sanctions regime to hold Russia accountable. Together with over 30\ncountries, we have denied Russia revenue and resources it needs to fight its war. We have also\ndegraded Russia’s military-industrial complex and ability to wage war in the long term. Our\nefforts are working: we have curtailed Russia’s access to semiconductors and other key inputs.\nIn fact, reports indicate that Russia is now forced to turn to outdated Soviet-era equipment and\narms and technology from North Korea and Iran. Now, with our price cap on Russian oil in place,\nwe are targeting Russia’s key source of revenue while aiming to mitigate volatility in global\nenergy markets.\nIn the meantime, the United States is supporting Ukrainians with $13 billion in direct economic\nassistance – in addition to military aid. And we’ve requested that Congress provide an additional\n$14.5 billion in support for the first nine months of 2023. Our support of Ukraine is a moral and\nnational security imperative. And we’re continuing to help mitigate the impacts of Russia’s war\non countries in need. Energy and food security is critical for countries around the world, in\naddition to our continued urgent work on poverty alleviation, pandemic response, and climate\nmitigation and adaptation.\n\nWOMEN IN THE TREASURY DEPARTMENT AND ECONOMICS\nPROFESSION\n\n\fAs I look back on the past year, I’m reminded of the talent and dedication of our Treasury\ncolleagues. Our work is only possible because we are tapping into the potential of people with a\nbroad range of backgrounds and experiences.\nThe truth is that this wasn’t always the case for women in the economics profession. I was the\nonly woman out of a PhD program of a couple dozen students. When I was at the start of my\nacademic career, women made up only 6 percent of faculty in economic departments surveyed\nby the American Economic Association. And this was back in the early 1970s. Women who came\nbefore me – and even more so for those in less forgiving professions – experienced much worse.\nIn fact, Treasury led the first major effort to employ women into the federal government. While\nTreasury hired a few women prior to the 19th century, there was no dedicated effort to do so\nuntil the Civil War. Men were in short supply, and women were cheaper to hire. So, starting in\n1862, Treasury began hiring hundreds of women. The first woman to be hired in that cohort was\nJennie Douglas. The first Black woman was Sophia Holmes. Many of these women were\nresponsible for inspecting banknotes for counterfeits and cutting up sheets of Treasury notes. In\nother words, these women were your predecessors at BEP.\nMany decades later, President Franklin Roosevelt nominated Josephine Roche as the first\nwoman to be Assistant Secretary of the Treasury. Women joined the Treasury workforce in much\nlarger numbers in the 20th century, thanks to the persistent work of activists and women like\nJennie, Sophia, and Josephine. They also did so in other industries and professions. In fact, the\ngrowing participation of women in our labor force was one of the greatest drivers of America’s\neconomic growth in the 20th century.\nToday, women represent around 62 percent of the Treasury workforce. And women are in\npositions of power across our Department – from public affairs to domestic finance to the chief\nof staff’s office. We’ve made progress in providing greater economic opportunity for women at\nTreasury and in the economics profession. But we know that much more needs to be done. I\nhope that today is a reminder of the road we’ve traveled on equity and inclusion. And I hope it\nmotivates us to continue to move forward.\nI’m proud of the work that Treasury is doing. Today is not about me or a new signature on our\ncurrency. It’s about our collective work to create a stronger and more inclusive economy. At the\nend of the day, the field of economics is not about numbers or theory. It’s about improving the\nlives of ordinary people. This is what the Treasury Department has been focused on in 2022. And\nthat will continue to be our North Star over the coming months and years.\n\n\fThank you. I’m grateful for all of your hard work.\n###\n\n\f"

            "content": "U.S. DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY\nRemarks by Secretary of the Treasury Janet L. Yellen at Inaugural\nMeeting of Treasury Advisory Committee on Racial Equity\nDecember 5, 2022\n\nWASHINGTON — Today, Secretary of the Treasury Janet L. Yellen delivered opening remarks at\nthe first meeting of the Treasury Advisory Committee on Racial Equity (TACRE). The first-of-itskind committee aims to provide advice and recommendations to Secretary Yellen and Deputy\nSecretary Wally Adeyemo on efforts to advance racial equity in the economy and address acute\ndisparities for communities of color.\n\nAs Prepared for Delivery\nGood morning, everyone. Welcome to the Treasury Department. And welcome to the first\nmeeting of the Treasury Advisory Committee on Racial Equity.\nI’d like to thank you for being here today, and for the work that you’ve graciously agreed to do.\nThe formation of this committee is a milestone in Treasury’s racial equity agenda. This\ncommittee will bring a wide set of outside perspectives to advise me, the Deputy Secretary, and\nother Treasury officials on how we can bolster our equity efforts.\nThe inaugural members of the committee come from a broad range of backgrounds – from\nacademia to business to local government. But you all share a commitment to building an\neconomy that works for everyone. I want to thank Mayor Nutter for chairing this committee, and\nFelicia Wong for serving as vice chair. And I want to thank Janis Bowdler, my Counselor for\nRacial Equity, and her team for their hard work.\nLet me speak briefly about how the committee fits into our work on racial equity.\nSince taking office, President Biden has made clear that our Administration’s work to recover\nand rebuild must be inclusive and equitable. Even before the coronavirus hit our shores, we\nknew our economy had not worked as well as it should for too many people of color. And we\nknew that this did not just have a negative impact on underserved communities. Economic\ninequality is a drag on our economy as a whole.\n\n\fIn fact, I have spent the last few months on the road to lay out our “modern supply-side”\nagenda. This agenda – reflected in the President’s economic plan – recognizes that some of the\nbest opportunities for growth come from investing in people and places that have been\noverlooked. I believe that investments in disadvantaged communities often result in higher\nrelative returns on investment. And they can boost top-line growth by enabling us to tap all our\nresources.\nAt Treasury, we have been guided by this principle in our work. Our first job was to foster a postpandemic recovery that did not leave any Americans behind. We centered equity in our\nimplementation of the American Rescue Plan – from our housing programs to our aid to state\nand local governments. Today, economic data indicates that our recovery has been the most\nequitable in recent history, with record drops in unemployment for many communities of color.\nWe are also making investments that will drive the future growth of our economy. Over the past\nyear, the Biden Administration has made three historic investments in the long-term strength of\nour economy: the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, the CHIPS and Science Act, and the Inflation\nReduction Act. Treasury is playing a particularly significant role in the implementation of the\nInflation Reduction Act’s historic climate change investments – nearly three-quarters of which\nare estimated to be delivered via tax incentives. You’ll hear an update today from Lily\nBatchelder, our Assistant Secretary for Tax Policy, about our efforts there. And you’ll also hear\nfrom Counselor Natasha Sarin about our efforts to modernize the IRS and ensure that all\nAmericans are playing by the same rules. I believe that these laws provide a transformative\nopportunity to advance economic fairness.\nThe Treasury Advisory Committee on Racial Equity will play a major role in our effort. Over the\ncoming months, you will inform our policymaking in areas from tax fairness and capital delivery\nsystems to Treasury’s internal efforts to reflect America’s diversity in our workforce. And you’ll\nkeep us accountable: to make sure we’re focused on our North Star of fostering an economy that\nunlocks everyone’s economic potential – including people of color, rural communities and those\nmost affected by climate change. Our entire economy benefits when all Americans reach their\nfull potential.\nThe work of this committee will make a difference for many Americans. I’m looking forward to\nhearing your perspectives in this meeting. And I’m looking forward to working together to\nensure communities of color and other underserved communities benefit from – and participate\nin – the economic growth and investments enacted by this Administration.\n\n\fAgain, thank you for all you are doing. Mayor Nutter, I’ll turn it over to you.\n\n\f"

Yellen at the U.S. –\nIndia Business and Investment Opportunities Event in New\nDelhi, India\nNovember 11, 2022\n\nAs Prepared for Delivery\nThank you for that introduction. It’s great to be here with all of you. Let me first express my\nthanks to Minister Sitharaman. I’m grateful for her warm welcome. I’m also appreciative of her\npartnership on a broad range of important issues over the past two years.\nI’m thrilled to be back in India. During this trip, I’ve been reminded of the dynamism of the\nIndian people. The leaders gathered here today are an example of the vitality that makes India\none of the fastest-growing major economies in the world. It’s also been inspiring to witness how\nAmericans and Indians are working together to strengthen our ties and drive economic growth\nfor both of our countries.\nWe’re meeting today at a moment where we see significant challenges for the global economy.\nThe pandemic continues to exert a drag on economies across the globe. Putin’s brutal war has\nclaimed countless Ukrainian lives and livelihoods; it has also exacerbated food and energy\ninsecurity across the world. Climate change continues to devastate communities with greater\nseverity and frequency.\nAs President Biden said earlier this year, India is an indispensable partner to the United States.\nThat’s particularly true today. I believe that these urgent challenges are bringing India and the\nUnited States closer together than ever before. Our partnership is especially crucial as India\nprepares to assume the G20 presidency. Over the next year, we look forward to supporting\nIndia’s presidency and making progress on our shared global priorities.\nBut today, I want to focus on our own bilateral economic relationship. I believe that we should\nstrengthen trade and investment between India and the United States. Deepening our bilateral\nties will reap significant economic benefits for both of our nations. At a time of global turmoil, I\nalso believe that it will bolster our countries’ resilience and national security.\n\n\fThe economic ties between the U.S. and India are stronger than ever before. As you know, the\nUnited States is India’s biggest trading partner. And our bilateral trade recently reached an alltime high of over $150 billion in 2021. Direct investment from India in my country supported\nover 70,000 jobs at the end of 2020. A broad range of American companies – from Whirlpool to\nBoeing to GE – invest in India. And Indian technology firms like Infosys and Mindtree are critical\nto the day-to-day operations of many American corporations.\nOur close ties also extend to the next generation. We’re grateful that 200,000 Indians are\nstudying in America and enriching our schools and universities. As many of you know, our\nstrong educational and research collaboration will lay the groundwork for future economic\ngrowth.\nOur relationship has not only withstood, but thrived, at a time of global volatility. That’s no\nsurprise. Our countries share an economic dynamism that is tied to our democratic traditions:\none that values new ideas while providing stability and predictability through the rule of law.\nAs we look to the future, I believe that the recent disruptions caused by the pandemic and\nRussia’s war are a reason to further deepen our economic ties.\nIndia is one of our trusted trading partners. In a world where supply chain vulnerabilities can\nimpose heavy costs, we believe it’s important to strengthen our trade ties with India and the\nlarge number of countries that share our approach to economic relations. This includes both\ndeveloping and advanced economies. Our goal is to vigorously promote global economic\nintegration while creating greater redundancies in our supply chain to mitigate concentration\nrisks. We also want to diversify away from risky countries like Russia that seek to weaponize\ntrade integration to advance their geopolitical aims.\nWe call this strategy “friendshoring.” Modernizing our trade relationships in this way will pay\ndividends. Increased trade between our two countries can result in economic benefits for our\npeople. It will also provide greater reliability and certainty for consumers and businesses on key\ngoods and inputs. As Prime Minister Modi said, resilient trade in the 21st century requires trust,\ntransparency, and timeliness. Deepening our integration will serve all three of these goals.\nWe are already seeing new supply chains develop in India. This includes manufacturing\ninvestments by American companies. Apple and Google have both announced plans to expand\nphone production in India. Hasbro, an American toy conglomerate, began shifting\nmanufacturing from China to India and Vietnam in 2019. And it plans to continue doing so. We\n\n\fwill continue to build business and commercial ties through meetings like the U.S.-India\nCommercial Dialogue and CEO Forum.\nFurther, our government is partnering with India to grow local industries and connect them to\nglobal supply chains. We believe our investments will benefit both countries. For example, the\nU.S. International Development Finance Corporation has a very active portfolio in India –\ninvesting in projects from microfinance to renewable energy. Last year, it approved up to $500\nmillion in debt financing for America’s largest solar manufacturer to build a solar module\nproduction facility in Tamil Nadu. The loan is the largest single debt financing transaction in the\ninstitution’s history. Once finished, the facility will strengthen global supply chains by\ndiversifying solar panel production. At the same time, it will support Prime Minister Modi’s\nrenewable energy ambitions.\nAs we bolster our relationship, we can do so in a way that sets the standard for innovation and\ncooperation in the 21st century. Earlier this year, India and a dozen other economies joined the\nUnited States in establishing the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework. The Indo-Pacific region is\nprojected to be the largest contributor to global growth over the next few decades. The\ncountries in this Framework will help write rules for our new economy.\nIn all, I believe that the current moment, difficult as it is, will bring our countries even closer\ntogether. We have much to gain: for our economies as well as for our resilience and national\nsecurity.\nAll of us in this room have a critical role to play. We look forward to working with government,\nindustry, and civil society leaders as we deepen the relationship between our two countries.\nThank you.\n###\n\n\f"

            "content": "U.S. DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY\nRemarks by Secretary of the Treasury Janet L. Yellen at Microsoft\nin New Delhi, India\nNovember 11, 2022\n\nAs Prepared Delivery\nGood morning. Let me start by thanking Microsoft for hosting me. I’m appreciative of your warm\nwelcome and the opportunity to meet with private sector executives and engineers this\nmorning. Your work is helping strengthen our countries’ ties and contributing to our economic\ngrowth.\nThis is my first visit to India as Treasury Secretary. I’m delighted to be here as India celebrates its\n75th year of independence and prepares to assume the G20 presidency. As President Biden said\nearlier this year, India is one of America’s indispensable partners. The dynamism I’ve felt at\nMicrosoft today – and in Delhi more broadly – is a testament to the talent of the Indian people\nand the vibrancy of its culture. It’s no surprise that India is among the fastest-growing major\neconomies in the world.\nI’m also here at a pivotal moment for the global economy. We are dealing with a confluence of\nheadwinds: the lingering effects of the pandemic, spillovers from Putin’s barbaric war in\nUkraine, and macroeconomic tightening as many countries grapple with inflation. Emerging\nmarkets and developing countries are particularly under pressure. Tens of millions more people\nface extreme poverty and hunger since Russia’s war in Ukraine began. Prime Minister Modi was\ncorrect when he said that this “is not an era of war.” I believe that ending Russia’s war is a moral\nimperative. It is also the single best thing we can do to help the global economy. This is a view\nthat is broadly shared among policymakers of the world’s major economies.\nDifficult times test us. But I believe the challenges we face are bringing the United States and\nIndia closer together than ever before.\nI’ll begin my remarks today by discussing the strong relationship between our two countries. I’ll\nfocus particularly on efforts to deepen our shared economic interests, including through trade.\nOur collective work is critical to showing the world that democracies can deliver for our people.\n\n\fThen, I’ll turn to our leadership on global priorities. The trajectory of the global economy will be\nshaped by the work that India and the United States undertake together. The same is true for\nthe prosperity and security of the Indo-Pacific. As a lead developing country and the world’s\nlargest economy, we have great opportunity and great responsibility to make progress on the\nworld’s most intractable problems. In fact, I think that our continued partnership is an example\nof how advanced and developing countries can bridge policy differences and move forward on\nmajor policy objectives.\n\nDEEPENING THE U.S.-INDIA RELATIONSHIP\nA. U.S-India Partnership\nI’d like to start by reflecting on the strength of our relationship.\nThe U.S.-India relationship continues to grow through its 75th year. Our ties are stronger than\never before. The United States is home to the largest Indian diaspora outside of Asia. It serves as\nIndia’s largest export market. Bilateral trade between our two countries reached an all-time high\nlast year, and we expect it to grow further in the years to come.\nThe dynamism of our relationship can especially be seen in the technology sector. Our people\nand our companies depend on each other on a daily basis. Indians frequently use WhatsApp to\ncommunicate; many American companies rely on Infosys to operate. Leaders of Indian descent\npopulate the highest ranks of Google, Microsoft, and other valuable American companies.\nThey’re also responsible for starting a third of all immigrant-founded startups in the United\nStates.\nDomestically, both of our countries are pursuing long-term investments in our economic\nstrength. Since the Biden Administration took office last year, we have enacted an agenda that I\ncall “modern supply-side” economics. This agenda pursues investments in human capital,\nphysical capital, and science and technology in order to boost the economy’s productive\ncapacity and reduce inequality. I know that India shares an interest in certain elements of this\nagenda as well. Prime Minister Modi has launched a 100-trillion-rupee infrastructure\ndevelopment plan, just as President Biden is deploying funding from our historic $1.2 trillion\ninfrastructure law. Both of our countries are also growing our domestic semiconductor and\nclean energy industries. The United States welcomes India’s ambition to become a powerhouse\nin the areas of green hydrogen and other renewable technologies like solar.\n\n\fMore broadly, India and the United States are the world’s largest democracies. We are living at a\ncritical time for the cause of freedom around the world. Democracies require our constant\nattention and nurturing. It is important for all democracies to renew our commitment to civil\nliberties and human rights, including for all our minorities, at home and abroad. And we must\ncontinue to cultivate the economic vitality that is tied to our democratic traditions. That’s an\nopen, inclusive, and competitive economy where new ideas can grow and thrive, with the\nstability and reliability accorded by adherence to the rule of law.\nIn the Indo-Pacific region, our shared objective is to advance prosperity and maintain peace and\nsecurity. India and the United States remain committed to upholding the rules-based\ninternational order. We are working with our allies and partners to tackle global challenges\nthrough the Quad and the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework. The United States’ leadership in\nestablishing IPEF demonstrates our commitment to the region. Together, the 14 members of\nIPEF constitute 40 percent of the world’s GDP. We are writing new rules for the 21st-century\neconomy, in areas from climate to anti-corruption to supply chain resilience.\n\nB. Our Approach to Friendshoring\nThis brings me to my next point. The United States and India share an interest in strengthening\nour supply chains in a world where certain governments wield trade as a geopolitical weapon.\nLet me explain an approach that the United States is taking to minimize supply chain\nvulnerabilities. It’s called “friendshoring.”\nLet’s begin with the basics. The United States believes in economic integration. Trade can drive\ngrowth and bring significant economic benefits to all countries involved. Exports enable\ncountries to expand production and provide good-paying jobs in industries where they have a\ncomparative advantage. Imports provide consumers and businesses with cheaper goods and a\nbroader array of choices. Trade also facilitates the cross-pollination of ideas that is vital to\ndiscovery and innovation.\nWe must vigorously promote our global economic integration and continue to reap its benefits.\nAs we do so, I believe that we must also account for the probability of disruptions to trade.\nRecent disruptions have contributed to higher prices in both of our countries and sapped\neconomic output. For too long, countries around the world have been overly dependent on\nrisky countries or a single source for critical inputs.\n\n\fTake Russian energy exports. Russia has long presented itself as a reliable energy partner. But\nfor the better part of this year, Putin has weaponized Russia’s natural gas supply against the\npeople of Europe. It’s an example of how malicious actors can use their market positions to try\nto gain geopolitical leverage or disrupt trade for their own gain.\nThe United States is pursuing an approach called “friendshoring” to diversify away from\ncountries that present geopolitical and security risks to our supply chain. To do so, we are\nproactively deepening economic integration with trusted trading partners like India. Our\nstrategy will also create redundancies in our supply chain to mitigate over-concentration risks.\nAnd we are also addressing our reliance on manufacturers whose approaches clash with our\nhuman rights values.\nTo be very clear, friendshoring is not limited to an exclusive club of countries. We seek\nintegration with the large group of countries that we can count on – developing countries and\nadvanced economies alike. In fact, part of our “friendshoring” approach involves partnering\nwith developing countries to grow local industries and connect them to the global supply chain.\nFor example, our development finance institution is providing America’s largest solar\nmanufacturer with up to $500 million in debt financing to build a facility in Tamil Nadu in India.\nThis facility will boost India’s solar manufacturing capacity. At the same time, it will help\ndiversify supply chains away from China, which currently dominates over 80 percent of global\nsolar panel production. Our investments are also consistent with our values: certain solar panel\nmaterials produced in China – like those from the Xinjiang region – are known to be produced\nwith forced labor.\nWe are already seeing progress. New supply chains are developing across regions from Asia to\nthe European Union. We are also seeing signs that Western firms are diversifying their supply\nchains beyond China. Technology companies like Amazon and Google are investing in India and\nVietnam. Apple recently announced that it was shifting some iPhone manufacturing from China\nto India. The United States will continue to deepen our business and commercial ties with India\nas we pursue our friendshoring agenda.\n\nINDIA’S G20 PRESIDENCY AND PROGRESS ON GLOBAL\nCHALLENGES\nBuilding a truly resilient world also requires multilateral action on pressing global challenges.\nWe know these problems are urgent. And we know how reliant we are on each other. A virus that\n\n\femerges in a city on one side of the world can spread into a pandemic. An unjustified land war in\none region can worsen hunger and poverty for millions around the globe.\nIn three weeks, India will assume the helm of the G20 at an uncertain time for the global\neconomy. We look forward to supporting India’s G20 presidency. A successful Indian presidency\nis indispensable to our global economic recovery and sustained progress on our deepest\nproblems.\nLet me focus on four shared objectives: addressing debt distress, promoting climate action,\nevolving the multilateral development banks, and embracing and shaping our changing\neconomy.\n\nA. Debt Distress\nFirst, the G20 must do better to provide debt relief where necessary.\nEven before the pandemic hit, debt levels were rising in many low- and middle-income\ncountries. Today, nearly 60 percent of low-income countries are at high risk of or are in debt\ndistress. This over-indebtedness poses a risk to stability and growth at a time when financial\npressures are mounting. Without timely and orderly debt relief, we worry that many developing\ncountries may face severe economic fallout.\nIndia’s G20 year is a chance to accelerate global coordination on debt restructuring. Two years\nago, the G20 established the Common Framework to bring all the major bilateral creditors\ntogether to coordinate timely and orderly debt relief for low-income countries. But the Common\nFramework has not delivered on its promise, largely because of lack of cooperation from China.\nAs a consequence, debtor countries in need are hesitant to request Common Framework\ntreatment. This needs to change. All major bilateral creditors, including China, must cooperate\nconstructively to deliver on their G20 commitment to provide meaningful debt relief. We must\nalso improve the speed and predictability of the Common Framework itself.\nBeyond low-income countries, middle-income countries in distress, such as Sri Lanka, will also\nneed a process for receiving timely and orderly debt relief. We welcome India’s leadership in this\narea, whether through an expansion of the Common Framework or another multilateral\nframework\n\nB. Climate Crisis\n\n\fSecond, we must accelerate action on climate.\nAs the world’s second- and third-largest emitters, we have a shared interest and responsibility to\nreduce our greenhouse gas emissions. The United States is taking significant action. At home,\nwe have enacted the Inflation Reduction Act. It’s the most aggressive domestic climate action in\nour history. Our investment puts us on a strong path to meet our goal of reducing our emissions\nto at least half of 2005 levels by the end of this decade. It will also bring down the cost curves of\nclean energy technologies. This will have positive spillovers for the rest of the world.\nAbroad, we are supporting the clean energy transition for developing countries, all while\nrecognizing that energy access remains a challenge for many. We are working with countries to\nstrengthen climate resilience for the most vulnerable communities. And we are facilitating a just\ntransition for those most affected by the shift to a net-zero economy.\nPresident Biden has committed to increasing U.S. international public climate financing to over\n$11 billion by 2024. In partnership with India, the G7 is marshalling a broad mix of public,\nprivate, and philanthropic financing to expedite India’s energy transition in line with its\nambitious climate goals. We will also advance global climate coordination with India in our role\nas co-chair of the G20 working group on sustainable finance. A global challenge like climate\ncannot be solved by any one country. It requires all of us to work together.\n\nC. Multilateral Development Bank Evolution\nThird, we must position our international institutions to more effectively tackle global\nchallenges.\nThe world faces a growing array of increasingly complex and interlinked challenges that do not\nrespect national boundaries. This includes climate change, pandemics, and fragility and\nconflict. Yet, our existing multilateral development finance architecture is currently unable to\nrespond to these global challenges with the necessary speed and scale. Last month, ahead of\nthe Annual Meetings, I called for an evolution of the development banks. I said that these\ninstitutions must devise new approaches to global challenges, while maintaining their existing\nfocus on poverty reduction and the Sustainable Development Goals.\nI am pleased that the World Bank has committed to developing a work program by the end of\nthe year to strengthen its role and capacity to respond to evolving needs. As key World Bank\nshareholders, India and the United States are critical to guiding the institution through this\n\n\fevolution. This effort serves as an important part of our overall strategy to mobilize against our\nglobal challenges.\n\nD. Embracing and Shaping our Changing Economy\nLastly, we need to embrace and shape our changing global economy. This is particularly true in\nthe digital space.\nThe digital revolution has changed the face of communication and commerce in our countries\nover the past three decades. Today, the digital economy provides massive opportunity and\ncontinues to drive economic growth. This is particularly true in India, which has over 560 million\nInternet subscribers and 1.2 billion mobile phone subscribers. Rapid digital adoption has\nenabled India to achieve stunning success on its financial inclusion efforts. Nearly 500 million\nnew bank accounts have been opened in India over the past eight years.\nBut the digital opportunities available to many Indians and Americans today are not readily\navailable for much of the world. Around 3 billion citizens – more than a third of the world’s\npopulation – have never used the Internet. By extension, they are being entirely left out of the\nmodern economy. Over the next five years, the G7 aims to mobilize $600 billion through the\nPartnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment. It has identified digital infrastructure as a\nkey priority alongside climate, health, and gender. The United States is ready to work with India\nand other partners to close the global digital gap. As we do so, it is equally important to combat\nthreats to privacy and cybersecurity and attend to emerging problems like illicit finance.\nIt is also clear that economic integration in the 21st century requires a modern international\npayments system. Cross-border payments should be cheaper than they are today. They should\nalso be faster, more transparent, and easier to access. The G20 has set out a roadmap for\nenhancing cross-border payments. We look forward to working with India to deliver on tangible\noutcomes. This includes reducing frictions to the flow of data. We also look forward to the G20\nadvancing financial inclusion efforts for the unbanked around the world.\n\nCONCLUSION\nIn sum, we live in difficult and complicated times. We face urgent problems that require\nconcerted and collective action. The work of our two countries has never been more vital. I\nbelieve that no significant global issue can be solved without the cooperation of our two\ncountries. Our partnership can shape the lives of millions around the world.\n\n\fThe U.S. and India are “natural allies,” in the words of a former Indian prime minister. We may be\nlocated across the world from each other, but what unites us is far greater than any of our\ndifferences. Our fights for independence were born of the same desire for freedom and dignity.\nAnd today, our democracies, while works in progress, are necessary bulwarks at a time of\nvolatility and war.\nI believe that this moment is an inflection point not only for the global economy but for the\ndemocratic idea itself. People around the world are looking to us and asking: can democracies\nmeet the economic needs of their citizens? Can they stand up to bullies and cooperate on the\nmost intractable global problems? Or are democracies too messy and complex – and turn\ninward when the going gets tough?\nWe have an opportunity to answer the skeptics. Democracy exhibits its greatest promise during\nturbulent times, when it serves not only as a system of governance but also as a reason for hope\nof collective progress. Our actions over the next year and beyond can demonstrate the capacity\nof our democracies to deliver for our people. I am confident that we will succeed.\nThank you.\n###\n\n\f"

            "content": "U.S. DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY\nRemarks by Secretary of the Treasury Janet L. Yellen on the Biden-Harris\nAdministration’s Economic Agenda in Ohio\nOctober 27, 2022\n\nAs prepared for delivery\nHello, everyone. I’d first like to thank Ethan and his team for hosting me. And thank you for letting me take part in the\nopening of your new center today. The work you are doing shows how we can build on our strong manufacturing roots to\ncreate a brighter future in America. With this new space, MAGNET is helping to incubate the next generation of\ninnovators. It’s also exposing thousands of students to the good-paying manufacturing jobs that our economy is\ncreating.\nI’m glad to be in Ohio. It’s a fitting place to discuss our Administration’s efforts to strengthen the American economy and\nthe manufacturing sector. Ohio is a birthplace of new American industries. It’s home to the Wright Brothers, who\ninvented the first airplane. And Charles Kettering, the Dayton resident who created the world’s first automobile electric\nignition. Even Thomas Edison was born just an hour from here.\nDuring my two years as Treasury Secretary, I have been laser focused on two economic priorities. First: rescuing the\neconomy from the depths of the pandemic and stabilizing it amid additional global economic shocks. And second:\nstrengthening the foundations of our post-pandemic economy. Our economic plan – powered by three major laws\nenacted over the past year – constitutes among the most significant investments that we’ve ever made in the long-term\nstrength of our economy.\nToday, I will focus my remarks on President Biden’s economic plan, and how it will create resilient growth and an\neconomy that works for all Americans. I’ll talk specifically about the core role of American manufacturing in our agenda.\nOver the past two years, our Administration has made significant investments in our country’s industrial strength. These\ninvestments will create good-paying jobs, make our economy more productive and resilient, and ensure that economic\nopportunity is shared broadly beyond our country’s coasts.\nBut first, let me speak about the state of the economy when we took office and the progress that we’ve made.\nAt the time of the President’s inauguration in January 2021, the United States was in the depths of the pandemic. The\nvirus was claiming more American lives a week than it had at any other point since the onset of the crisis. The economic\ncalamity was also massive. Over 800,000 new jobless claims were being filed in an average week. Given the severity of\nthe economic downturn, our Administration took action: to support households, businesses, and state and local\ngovernments through a once-in-a-century public health emergency.\nTwo years later, we have experienced one of the quickest economic recoveries in modern history. Since President Biden\ntook office, we have created over 10 million jobs. Manufacturing jobs are growing at their fastest pace since the 1980s.\nNearly 700,000 manufacturing jobs have been added since early last year. And we’ve seen significant investments in\nAmerican manufacturing, including right here in Ohio.\n\n\fWhile these are promising signs, we still face challenges. Today, our economy faces high inflation and significant global\nheadwinds. Americans are rightly concerned that rising prices are eroding their living standards, so our Administration’s\ntop economic priority is to bring inflation down. But even in the face of these challenges, our economy remains resilient,\nbolstered by President Biden’s economic plan. That resilience is evidenced by today’s GDP report, which shows solid real\nGDP growth in our economy in the third quarter. We are seeing ample signs of America’s economic strength, despite\nglobal challenges like the impact of Putin’s illegal war and successive waves of COVID. Our unemployment rate is at its\nlowest point in over 50 years. Household balance sheets remain strong. These signals are consistent with an economy\nthat is shifting from a historically fast recovery to stable and sustained growth.\nAs our Administration continues to tackle our immediate challenges, we have also been focused on strengthening the\nlong-term foundations of the American economy. I will now turn to the three pillars of our economic plan: expanding our\nproductive capacity, bolstering our economic resilience, and creating an economy that works for all.\n\nEXPANDING THE PRODUCTIVE CAPACITY OF OUR ECONOMY\nEarlier this year, I delivered a speech calling for a “modern supply-side” expansion of our economy. With a labor market\nat full employment, I argued that the current moment was well-suited for a supply-side agenda that increases our\neconomy’s productive capacity. A country’s long-term growth potential depends on, among other things, how many\npeople we have working and the productivity of our workers. Concerted investments in both areas increase the ceiling\nfor what our economy can produce.\nLess than a year later, I’m proud to report that we’ve enacted key parts of our “modern supply-side” agenda. There are\nthree major laws powering our growth strategy. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law is modernizing our nation’s physical\nand digital infrastructure. I’ll speak more to that in a moment. The CHIPS Act is growing semiconductor manufacturing\nhere at home. And the Inflation Reduction Act is our nation’s largest-ever investment in clean energy – and will bolster\nAmerica’s leadership in the industries of the future for years to come.\nEconomic research has long established that investment in basic infrastructure increases productivity, attracts business\nactivity, and is associated with higher rates of economic growth. Put simply, good infrastructure makes it easier to make\nthings in America and ship our products to the world. Better freight rail allows goods to move from Point A to Point B\nwith fewer disruptions. Modern roads, bridges, and public transportation help connect workers with training, education,\nand better jobs. Expanding our electric grid and broadband infrastructure help lay the foundations for modern industries\nlike clean energy and digital technology.\nOur economic plan invests in everything I just mentioned. But we also know that it’s not enough just to fund\ninfrastructure. We need to accelerate the pace at which we deploy these projects in order to maximize the economic\nbenefits. This month, our Administration announced an Action Plan to efficiently deliver infrastructure that is “On Time,\nOn Task, and On Budget.”[1] We are advancing our Permitting Action Plan to speed up investments while upholding\nbedrock standards and laws. We are also working with employers, labor unions, and training providers to build a robust\ntalent pipeline of skilled workers in sectors like construction and electrification.\nIn sum, our investments in infrastructure will boost our economic potential. They will help build on the progress we’ve\nmade in American manufacturing. They will also help our economy cope with unexpected shocks – like pandemics or\nclimate disasters.\n\nSTRENGTHENING ECONOMIC RESILIENCE\n\n\fThis brings me to the next pillar of our economic plan: strengthening our economic resilience.\nOver the past few years, we’ve witnessed immense disruptions in our lives. The confluence of the pandemic’s economic\neffects, climate disasters, and Putin’s illegal war in Ukraine have driven food and energy price volatility and created\nshortages in some of our most critical goods. Our Administration is building resilience to such future shocks by\nstrengthening our supply chains and growing critical manufacturing industries in America.\nSemiconductors have been a major area of focus. These microchips power so much of modern life: from phones to cars\nto washing machines. They also power technologies that are crucial to our national defense.\nThe United States is a leader in certain parts of the semiconductor ecosystem – like chip design. But we’ve lost our\nleadership in semiconductor manufacturing. Three decades ago, the United States made 37 percent of semiconductors\nsold globally. Today, we produce only 12 percent. When it comes to the most advanced chips, we have no meaningful\nmanufacturing capacity at all.\nSemiconductors are so critical that China, Japan, South Korea, and the European Union have – or are about to – invest in\ngrowing their domestic manufacturing capacity.[2] The economic stakes are high. The pandemic chip shortage resulted in\na loss of about $240 billion in U.S. GDP last year.[3] Here in Ohio, the shortage caused automakers like Ford to temporarily\nshut down their assembly plants.[4]\nOur economic plan is nurturing the growth of the full semiconductor ecosystem in the United States: from R&D to design\nto fabrication. Tens of billions of dollars will go toward growing domestic semiconductor manufacturing in America. We\nbelieve that this will reduce economic and national security risks. It will provide greater certainty to both businesses and\nconsumers. And it will also build our leadership in areas like R&D; close collaboration between “lab” and “fab” is\nnecessary to directing R&D efforts based on what works on the factory floor.\nThere’s already been progress. Major manufacturers are expanding their U.S. footprint. Just last month, Intel broke\nground on its $20 billion semiconductor plant outside of Columbus.[5] Intel’s project is said to be the single largest private\ninvestment in Ohio’s history. When completed, it will employ thousands of Ohioans and support tens of thousands of\nadditional long-term jobs throughout the ecosystem. We are already seeing reverberating effects of this investment on\nlocal communities. For example, Intel is investing $50 million in Ohio colleges and universities to help train the next\ngeneration of chipmakers.[6]\n\nBUILDING AN ECONOMY THAT WORKS FOR ALL\nOur semiconductor investments demonstrate that government and business can work together to nurture and grow new\nindustries. It also demonstrates that we can work together to broaden economic opportunity and create good-paying\njobs. In fact, a deliberate feature of our “modern supply-side” agenda is the allocation of investments across people and\nplaces – particularly those that are historically underserved.\nFor too long, regions like the Midwest have suffered through decades of underinvestment. Wages for too many working\nfamilies have stagnated. At the same time, providing for basic needs and investing in their kids’ futures have become\nincreasingly expensive. The costs of childcare, healthcare, buying a home, and higher education have risen faster than\nmedian household income over the past three decades.\nThe traditional approach to supply-side economics focuses on generating economic growth through deregulation and\ntax cuts that disproportionately benefit the wealthiest Americans and large corporations. Economic evidence indicates\nthat this strategy has failed to achieve its promised gains. In many cases, it has also exacerbated income and wealth\ninequality.\n\n\fIn contrast, our “modern supply-side” agenda recognizes that investing in underserved communities is not just good for\nthe community itself. It’s good for the whole economy. Given the economic premise of diminishing returns, we believe\nthat investments in underserved communities have higher relative returns on investment. They also help unlock the\npotential of all Americans. That expands our economic capacity.\nA prime example is investing in small manufacturers, including those in underserved communities. Treasury recently\napproved Ohio to receive up to $182 million in small business funding through the State Small Business Credit Initiative.\nThis American Rescue Plan program is expected to mobilize up to ten times the amount of public funding – through\nprivate capital – to support small businesses across the country, including small manufacturers. During the prior version\nof this program, Ohio generated over $28 million in support to small manufacturers.\nWe are beginning to see signs of renewal in places and sectors that have traditionally seen disinvestment. American\nmanufacturing employment had dropped precipitously over the past few decades. In Ohio, people employed in\nmanufacturing jobs fell from a million in 2000 – to less than 700,000 twenty years later – even as Ohio’s population grew.\nBut our Administration’s manufacturing incentives have recently led to a wave of private sector commitments that will\npower our economy and create good-paying jobs. Clean energy industries have been shown to create broad opportunity\nacross the country, including in non-coastal areas and communities traditionally reliant on fossil fuel extraction. In fact,\nthe Inflation Reduction Act provides businesses with bonus tax incentives for investing in low-income and energy\ncommunities. This is a place-based investment strategy designed to broaden economic opportunity across all\ncommunities.\nSince January of last year, companies have announced over $100 billion in EV, battery, and charging investments here in\nAmerica.[7] Honda and LG earlier this month announced a battery plant in Fayette County – right outside Columbus.[8]\nThis plant will create thousands of new jobs. The wave of new battery investments in the Midwest has been so significant\nthat some commentators are dubbing the region as the new “Battery Belt.”[9] We expect to see our economic plan\ncontinue to drive a significant amount of capital into good clean energy and manufacturing jobs over the coming months\nand years.\nAs we create an economy that works for all Americans, we also know economic fairness requires all Americans to play by\nthe same rules. Too often, that has not been the case in our tax system.\nWe currently have a two-tiered tax system: one where average families pay their fair share while large corporations and\nhigh-income earners too often do not. Take the “tax gap.” That’s the amount of taxes owed but not paid to the IRS. In\n2019, the top one percent of Americans was estimated to owe over a fifth of unpaid taxes – a total of around $160 billion.\n[10]\n\nMuch of the disparity stemmed from chronic underinvestment in the IRS. This was unacceptable to the President and\nme. So, we secured $80 billion of new funding for the agency.\nThis funding will enable the IRS to increase audits of taxpayers at the high end who have not paid their full bill. As I’ve\nsaid before, I’ve directed that enforcement resources will not be used to raise audit rates for households making under\n$400,000 a year relative to historical levels. In fact, once the IRS has the right technological infrastructure in place, we\nexpect audit rates for honest taxpayers to decline.\nBy closing the tax gap, we will raise hundreds of billions of dollars in additional revenue over this decade. Our corporate\ntax reforms – like the 15 percent minimum tax on the largest corporations – will raise hundreds of billions more as well.\nThe additional revenue will strengthen our public finances. It can be used to fund additional investments in our\neconomic strength, lower the deficit, or reduce taxes for working families.\n\n\fI believe that these tax reforms reflect the values underpinning our entire economic plan: that economic fairness actually\nadds to, rather than subtracts from, our overall economic strength.\n\nCONCLUSION\nWhen we look back decades from now, I believe that we will view the past two years as a uniquely difficult time for our\ncountry and the world. We’ve gone through so much together: a pandemic, a war in Europe, and an acceleration of\nclimate disasters. There’s much more we must do to ease the strain on working families. But I believe that we will also\nview this period as a time when we renewed America’s economic strength. We are positioning America to build, innovate,\nand lead in the 21st century.\nI look forward to building that future together with you. Congratulations again on the opening of your new center.\nThank you.\n\n[1]\n\n[2]\n\n[3]\n\n[4]\n\n[5]\n\n[6]\n\n[7]\n\nhttps://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Action-Plan-for-Accelerating-Infrastructure-October-2022.pdf\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2022/06/17/us/politics/semiconductors-congress-chips.html\n\nhttps://www.commerce.gov/news/press-releases/2022/04/analysis-chips-act-and-bia-briefing\n\nhttps://fordauthority.com/2022/03/ford-ohio-assembly-plant-idled-for-another-week-due-to-chip-shortage/\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/us-policy/2022/09/09/biden-intel-ohio-chip-factory/\n\nhttps://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/newsroom/news/intel-invests-100m-ohio-national-education.html#gs.frqtfo\n\nhttps://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/10/19/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-driving-u-s-battery-manufacturing-and-good-\n\npaying-jobs/\n[8]\n\nhttps://hondanews.com/en-US/releases/honda-and-lg-energy-solution-announce-ohio-as-home-to-joint-venture-ev-battery-\n\nplant#:~:text=Honda%20and%20LG%20Energy%20Solution%20(LGES%3B%20KRX%3A%20373220),jobs%2C%20pending%20final%20government%20approvals.\n[9]\n\nhttps://www.axios.com/2022/08/17/electric-cars-vehicles-batteries-battery-belt-biden\n\n[10]\n\nhttps://home.treasury.gov/news/featured-stories/the-case-for-a-robust-attack-on-the-tax-gap\n\n\f"

Daly, President and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of San Francisco\nThe Economics of Climate Change Conference\nSan Francisco, CA\nNovember 8, 2019\n8:45AM PT\nRemarks as prepared for delivery.\n\nIntroduction\nGood morning, everyone. Thank you for being here. I’m happy to see\n\nsuch a full room for today’s conference. We’re joined by many more on our\n\nlivestream. To all of you – welcome.\n\nToday, I thought I’d take a few minutes to address a question I’ve heard\n\na lot over the past few months.\n\nWhy is the San Francisco Fed hosting a climate conference?\n\nIt’s a first for us. It’s actually a first for the Federal Reserve System. 1 So\n\nwhy this? Why now?\n\nThe answer is simple. It’s essential to achieving our mission.\n\nThe Federal Reserve’s job is to promote a healthy, stable economy. This\n\nrequires us to consider current and future risks – whether we have a direct\n\ninfluence on them or not. Climate change is one of those risks.\n\nWe are not the first to talk about this. A growing amount of research and discussion has occurred\nthroughout the Federal Reserve System on the impacts of climate change, including Rudebusch\n(2019), Colacito et al. (2018), Fried et al. (2019), Kahn et al. (2019), Kaplan (2019), and Stiroh\n(2019), to cite a few.\n\n1\n\n1\n\n\fFINAL\n\nThe risks to our mission\nSo how does it affect our business? The Fed has three core\n\nresponsibilities: ensuring a safe and sound payment system, regulating and\n\nsupervising the banking system, and conducting monetary policy. We’re also\n\npublic servants, who are responsible to the communities we represent. The\nimpacts of a changing climate will affect each of these roles.\nLet’s first consider the payment system.\n\nExtreme weather events like hurricanes, floods, and wildfires destroy\n\nproperty and disrupt essential services like health care and education. But\n\nthey also impact how people buy things. Without power, electronic payment\n\nmethods – debit cards, credit cards, and mobile services like Apple Pay – don’t\nwork. So you need cash for everything.\n\nWe think about this a lot in the Twelfth District. We manage the Cash\n\nProduct Office for the entire Federal Reserve System. And it’s our job to\n\nensure that people have access to cash when and where they need it – in\n\nnormal times, and particularly in times of crisis when demand spikes.\n\nSo we have to understand and prepare for the increase in severe\n\nweather events – and for the disruptions that they may cause. This is essential\nto ensuring that our cash services remain resilient and dependable for all\nAmericans.\n\nThe Fed’s second core function is the regulation and supervision of the\n\nbanking system. And climate events are becoming an increasing area of risk\nfor many of the financial firms we supervise.\n\nHigher sea levels, heavier rainfalls, dryer conditions, and the associated\n\nfallout can cause catastrophic losses to property and casualty insurers –\n\nespecially if the majority of their clients are geographically concentrated in\n2\n\n\fFINAL\n\nthe affected region. In 2018 alone, it’s estimated that damages from severe\nweather in the United States cost insurers upwards of $50 billion. 2\n\nAnd the impact goes well beyond insurers. Including uninsured\n\ndamages, that $50 billion number nearly doubles. 3 This impacts banks’\n\ncustomers, making it harder for them to satisfy their loan obligations. And this\ncan ultimately stress banks’ balance sheets. So ensuring financial institutions\n\nare regularly evaluating their exposure to climate-related risks is an\nincreasingly important part of our work.\n\nFinally, climate change can also influence our third function: conducting\n\nmonetary policy to achieve our congressionally-mandated goals of full\nemployment and price stability.\n\nEarly research suggests that increased warming has already started to\n\nreduce average output growth in the United States. And future growth may be\ncurtailed even further as temperatures rise. 4 Several of the papers on the\n\nprogram today outline other ways in which the micro- and macro-economic\n\nenvironments may be impacted by climate change. While more work needs to\n\nbe done to clearly understand these effects, there’s little doubt that we need to\nrecognize, examine, and prepare for these risks in order to fulfill our core\n\nresponsibilities.\n\nPerhaps most importantly, we also have to understand climate risks if\n\nwe’re going to effectively serve the public. In the Twelfth District, sea level\n\nchanges are disrupting communities from San Diego to Alaska. Preemptive\nInsurance Information Institute (2019) and Aon (2019).\nNOAA (2019).\n4 See Rudebusch (2019), Tol (2009), Hsiang et al. (2017) and references therein for extensive\nreviews of the literature.\n2\n3\n\n3\n\n\fFINAL\n\npower outages and wildfires in populated areas of California are a new way of\n\nlife. Really, every state in our District is somehow affected.\n\nThe impact of these events go well beyond their immediate disruptions.\n\nThey can destroy wealth, exacerbate existing income inequalities, and – in the\nmost severe cases – displace people permanently. Think of Paradise,\nCalifornia.\n\nAs a community-engaged organization, we need to understand these\n\noutcomes. And we need to work with local governments, businesses, and\nindividuals to increase the resiliency of our communities. 5\nConclusion\n\nWhen you put all these pieces together, it becomes pretty clear: climate\n\nchange is an economic issue we can’t afford to ignore.\n\nThis isn’t just a concern for the Twelfth District. Or even the United\n\nStates. Countries around the world are dealing with the economic impacts of\nclimate change. And conferences like this are essential to understanding the\nchallenges that lie ahead – for all of us.\n\nUltimately, this is our job. The San Francisco Fed is a public service\n\norganization. We’re responsible for the people and the communities we serve.\nSo we have to get out in front of this issue and do what we do best.\n\nConvene the best people and ideas. Study data and conduct research.\n\nTalk to the communities we serve – and really listen when they tell us what\n\nthey need.\n\nSee Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco (2019), Kabel et al. (2017), Dancy (2018), and\nCarpenter (2013).\n\n5\n\n4\n\n\fFINAL\n\nWith that, I would like to thank our Economic Research Department for\n\nplanning today’s event, and the entire support team for executing it so well.\nAnd thanks to all of our distinguished speakers and panelists. I’m really\nlooking forward to your presentations and a robust discussion.\nThank you.\n\n5\n\n\fFINAL\n\nReferences\nAon. 2019.

Daly, President and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of San Francisco\nLos Angeles World Affairs Council & Town Hall\nLos Angeles, CA\nOctober 15, 2019\n12:30PM PT\nRemarks as prepared for delivery.\n\nIntroduction\nThank you so much for the invitation to be here. It’s a real honor.\n\nThe issues of our day require a commitment to dialogue. Allowing\n\ndiverse groups to discuss, debate, and learn raises the best ideas and creates\nbetter outcomes.\n\nThe Los Angeles World Affairs Council and Town Hall Los Angeles have\n\npromoted such dialogue for decades. And now that you’ve joined forces, I\n\nknow your legacy will grow even more. I’m personally delighted to be one of\nthe first speakers of this new partnership.\n\nToday, I’m going to talk about one of the most critical issues of our day:\n\neconomic growth. How we are growing now… growth we’ve experienced in\nthe past… and what factors could temper or spur our growth in the future.\n\nBut before I begin, I need to give the standard disclaimer: the remarks\n\nI’m about to deliver are my own and don’t necessarily reflect the views of\n\nanyone else within the Federal Reserve System.\n1\n\n\fFINAL\n\nCurrent conditions\nSo let’s start with growth today. How’s the economy doing?\n\nHere, the news is largely positive. The economy continues to expand at a\n\nsolid pace. Job growth is strong, unemployment is low, consumer spending is\nhealthy, and households remain confident. These are all really good signs.\n\nOn the other hand, we’ve yet to achieve our inflation goal on a sustained\n\nbasis. And a number of headwinds – such as trade uncertainty and slower\nglobal growth – have started to gust. This has caused manufacturing and\n\nbusiness investment to soften considerably over the course of the year.\n\nTo ensure we sustain the expansion against these headwinds, the Fed\n\nhas adopted a more accommodative monetary policy position – cutting the\n\nfederal funds rate in both July and September. This accommodation should\n\nhelp the economy continue to grow so that we can make further progress on\nour mandated goals of full employment and price stability.\nDrags on future growth\nBut what is the pace of growth we’re trying to hit? What’s sustainable?\n\nThis number has changed dramatically over time. During the 60 years\n\nprior to the Great Recession, GDP growth averaged around 3.5 percent.\n\nDuring the current expansion, growth has averaged only 2.3 percent.\n\nAnd this slower pace, far from being an anomaly, is expected to continue. Most\n\neconomists and forecasters, including me, predict GDP growth will average a\nbit under 2 percent for the foreseeable future.1\n\nBoard of Governors (2019). The median of FOMC member projections of longer-run growth is 1.9\npercent.\n\n1\n\n2\n\n\fFINAL\n\nSo what’s going on? Why is America’s economy expanding at a much\n\nslower pace than it used to?\n\nTo explain, we need to look at the fundamental drivers of economic\n\ngrowth: productivity and the labor force.\n\nLet’s first consider productivity growth. Although it’s fluctuated over\n\ntime, it’s generally contributed a little over 1 percentage point to overall GDP\n\ngrowth since the 1970s. It’s forecast to do about the same going forward. So\n\nthe reason for slower growth likely isn’t productivity. 2\n\nLabor force growth tells a different story. In the 1970s, when the U.S.\n\npopulation was increasing rapidly and women were entering the workforce in\nlarge numbers, labor force growth alone averaged 2.7 percent annually. That\n\nmeans – even if productivity growth had been zero – the economy would have\nexpanded at 2.7 percent. That’s faster than the pace of our current expansion.\nSince that peak, the number has come down substantially. The labor\n\nforce has grown less than 0.5 percentage point annually for the past decade –\n\nand it’s forecast to stay that way for at least another ten years. 3\n\nMuch of this decline in labor force growth is due to simple demographic\n\nchanges. Our population is aging. Fewer babies are being born. This dynamic\nisn’t unique to the United States – countries around the world are\nexperiencing similar trends.\n\nBut there’s something that is different in America. We’ve experienced a\n\ndecline in labor force participation for people between the ages of 25 and 54 –\n\nwhat we often call prime-age workers. And right now, there is a smaller\n2\n3\n\nFernald and Li (2019).\nCongressional Budget Office (2019) and Fernald and Li (2019).\n3\n\n\fFINAL\n\nfraction of this group working or actively seeking work than we had back in\nthe late 1980s and 1990s.\n\nThis raises an important question: why aren’t more prime-age\n\nAmericans working?\n\nThere isn’t a simple answer. There’s a whole host of issues at play.\n\nOn one end of the spectrum, research suggests that some of the drop\n\nmay be attributed to wealthier families choosing to have only one earner. 4 So\n\nfamilies with the financial ability to make these work-life choices may account\nfor some of the lost labor force participation.\n\nOn the other end of the spectrum, many people stay home to take care\n\nof children not out of choice, but out of necessity. Rising childcare costs and\nlack of access to parental leave likely contribute to lower labor force\nparticipation rates, especially among women. 5\n\nThen there’s the changing labor market, which is leaving many people\n\non the sidelines – wanting to work, but not having the skills or education to\n\nkeep pace with the ever-evolving economy. 6\n\nMore jobs currently require a bachelor’s degree than a high school\n\ndiploma. 7 Unfortunately, college completion rates haven’t kept up with\n\ndemand. Recent data tells us only 37 percent of 25- to 29-year-olds have a\n\ncollege education. 8 And we see that much of the decline in prime-age\n\nworkforce participation is concentrated among individuals who lack a college\ndegree. 9\n\nHall and Petrosky-Nadeau (2016).\nDaly et al. (2018) and Blau and Kahn (2013).\n6 Valletta and Barlow (2018) and Charles, Hurst, and Schwartz (2019).\n7 Carnevale, Jayasundera, and Gulish (2016).\n8 National Center for Education Statistics (2018).\n9 See Tuzemen (2018), who focuses on prime-age men.\n4\n5\n\n4\n\n\fFINAL\n\nThese are just a few of the factors driving down labor force participation\n\nin the United States. We could also talk about the talent being lost to opioid\naddiction. Or geographic mismatches that leave rural communities with\n\naffordable housing and few jobs, and urban communities with plentiful jobs\nand skyrocketing housing costs.\n\nWhatever the reason, we have more people sitting on the sidelines than\n\nin the past. This poses obvious problems for individuals and families – but it\n\nalso poses problems for our economy.\n\nAbsent a surge in productivity growth, slow growth in the workforce is\n\ngoing to be a significant structural restraint on America’s economic future.\nThe present doesn’t have to define the future\nSo what can we do? Are we really destined to grow at just 2 percent\n\nmoving forward? The answer is likely yes… unless we make significant\n\nchanges that better engage all that talent we’re leaving on the sidelines. This\n\nwill require a concerted effort from many stakeholders – including the Federal\nReserve.\n\nAt the Fed, our job is to support a healthy economy and achieve the dual\n\nmandate goals of full employment and price stability. The logic of our mandate\n\nis that a strong economy benefits everyone. And we can see this in the current\nexpansion.\n\nTen years of sustained growth have reduced unemployment rates to\n\nnear historic lows and pulled millions of Americans back into the labor force.\n\nThis long and robust expansion has been particularly beneficial to historically\nless-advantaged workers, including African Americans, Hispanics, and those\n\nwith less than a college degree.\n\n5\n\n\fFINAL\n\nThis makes sense. When labor markets are tight, as they are now,\n\nbusinesses have to compete for workers and find new ways to fill jobs. They\n\nrecruit more intensively, adjust hiring standards, and look to a broader pool of\npotential employees. This creates new opportunities for less advantaged\n\nworkers and allows them to get a foothold in the labor force. 10 Indeed, the\ndata tell us that the strength of the current expansion has narrowed longstanding gaps between more and less advantaged groups. 11\n\nBut while these gaps are narrowing, they still persist. And monetary\n\npolicy alone isn’t enough to close them. Reducing the structural barriers that\nlimit workforce participation or keep individuals from reaching their full\n\npotential requires taking a hard look at some of our social and workplace\n\npolicies.\n\nThere are any number of examples we could consider, but I’d like to\n\nfocus on two from recent research.\n\nThe first looks at women. In the mid-1990s, a gap began to form in the\n\nparticipation rates of women in the United States and Canada. By 2017, the\nprime-age participation rate for American women was 8 percentage points\n\nlower than for similar women in Canada. This is a startling difference. It\n\nrepresents about 5 million U.S. women who could be in the labor force. A\n\ngrowing body of work suggests that this difference can be attributed in part to\nCanada’s generous parental leave policies and childcare subsidies, which\nallow women to remain attached to the labor market after child birth. 12\n\nPetrosky-Nadeau and Valletta (2019).\nAaronson et al. (2019).\n12 Daly et al. (2018).\n10\n11\n\n6\n\n\fFINAL\n\nMy second example relates to educational attainment and career\n\nopportunities. African Americans and Hispanics receive four-year degrees at\n\nabout half the rate of whites. 13 And even when they do get degrees, their\n\ncareer paths have a flatter trajectory. 14 In economics parlance, we call this is a\nmisallocation of talent.\n\nBut how costly is this sort of misallocation? It’s hard to know in real\n\ntime, but we can look to history for some indication. Researchers at Stanford\nand the University of Chicago examined growth in U.S. per capita output\n\nbetween 1960 and 2010. They asked how much of that growth was due to the\nremoval of structural barriers, such as direct discrimination, lower school\n\nquality in minority communities, and financial obstacles that kept less-\n\nadvantaged people from pursuing high-paying careers in fields like medicine\nand law. The findings were striking. They estimated that the removal of\n\nstructural barriers accounted for up to 40 percent of the gains in U.S. per\ncapita output. 15\n\nSo talent misallocation affects our bottom line. This suggests that\n\nequalizing educational attainment rates and career opportunities for less\nadvantaged groups could produce a considerable economic boost.\nOne person at a time\nUp until now, I’ve talked about what institutions can do to help get\n\ntalent off the sidelines and into the labor force. But I want to end with what\npeople can do. Because this is what gives me the most hope.\nNational Center for Education Statistics (2018).\nDaly et al. (2017).\n15\nHsieh et al. (2019).\n13\n14\n\n7\n\n\fFINAL\n\nLet me take you to Firebaugh, California, about four hours north of here\n\nin Fresno County. It’s a rural agricultural community. Many of the people\n\nliving there don’t speak English as their first language. It’s one of the poorest\nregions in America.\n\nAnd yet… 97 percent of Firebaugh’s kids graduate from high school.\n\nThat’s 12 percentage points higher than the national average. And most of\nthem go on to college or other post-secondary study. 16\n\nSo how do they do it? The entire community of Firebaugh – from\n\nparents to teachers to students to local leaders – have made education a\n\nsingular priority.\n\nBut they’re not the only one.\n\nBarrio Logan, near downtown San Diego, is a mostly Latinx community.\n\nThe average annual income for a family of four there is $25,000. Only 38\n\npercent of adults have a high school diploma. Just 3 percent hold a bachelor’s\ndegree.\n\nBut the Barrio Logan College Institute is helping change that narrative.\n\nThey start preparing first generation students for college in third grade. For\nkids enrolled in their program, 100 percent end up graduating from high\nschool – and 100 percent go on to enroll in college. 17\n\nThese are inspirational success stories. They tell us the power of people.\n\nAnd they show us what’s possible when people come together to decide that\ntheir state today doesn’t have to determine their state tomorrow.\n\n16\n17\n\nFirebaugh High School (2017).\nBarrio Logan College Institute (2019).\n\n8\n\n\fFINAL\n\nConclusion\nSo how do we change the future? How do we scale places like Firebaugh\n\nand Barrio Logan?\n\nThe answer is simple: with intention.\n\nFairness has been a long-standing aspiration of our society. But\n\naspiration isn’t enough. We have to turn our desire to be fair into a\ncommitment to include. Inclusion has to become our practice.\n\nWe have to come together. We have to combine the forces of our\n\ninstitutions… our communities… our people.\n\nThat’s the way we rise above what the data tell us is possible. That’s the\n\nway we’ll give the next generation a better future than the one we inherited.\nThank you.\n\n9\n\n\fFINAL\n\nReferences\nAaronson, Stephanie, Mary C. Daly, William Wascher, and David W.

Daly, President and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of San Francisco\nInflation Targeting – Prospects and Challenges\nSponsored by the Reserve Bank of New Zealand\nand the International Monetary Fund\nWellington, New Zealand\nAugust 29, 2019\n9:30AM NZT\nRemarks as prepared for delivery.\n\nIntroduction\nGood morning, and thank you for the opportunity to participate in this\n\nconference. This is my first trip to New Zealand, and I’ve thoroughly enjoyed\n\ntouring about. I had the double bonus of seeing our good friends from\n\nCalifornia – New Zealanders actually – who returned home to Christchurch\n\nabout four years ago. In my travels so far, I can see why New Zealand is on\neveryone’s bucket list!\n\nI’m also delighted to be here in my capacity as president and CEO of the\n\nFederal Reserve Bank of San Francisco – and to help mark the 30th\n\nanniversary of New Zealand’s commitment to an explicit inflation-targeting\n\nregime. It was the first of its kind and has influenced central banks around the\nworld.\n\nBut to be effective, monetary policymaking must continually evolve. We\n\nlive in a dynamic world that demands we remain humble about what we know\n– and curious about what we might learn.\n1\n\n\fFINAL\n\nNew Zealand is a great example of this. You haven’t been complacent\n\nduring the past 30 years. Indeed, you recently moved to an explicit dual\nmandate – one that requires both price stability and full employment.\n\nThis is a framework we have a lot of history with in the United States. So\n\nyou might think I will be providing some lessons from our experience with\nbalancing these two objectives.\n\nAnd I’d like to. But the situation isn’t that simple. The world has changed\n\nsince we first took on a dual mandate more than 40 years ago. And things are\n\ndifferent. In the United States, here in New Zealand, and in countries around\n\nthe world, a new – and less familiar – economic environment has emerged.\n\nOur collective futures now include slower potential growth, lower long-\n\nterm interest rates, and persistently weak inflation. This new landscape\n\ndemands we think differently about how to balance and achieve our price\nstability and full employment objectives.\n\nSo today, I will share how I’m thinking about these issues from my seat\n\nat the San Francisco Fed. But before I begin, let me say that the remarks I\n\nmake today are my own, and do not necessarily reflect the views of anyone\nelse within the Federal Reserve System.\nA New Economic Environment\nTo understand the new environment we face, we first have to look back\n\nto the past. And here I will use the United States as an example.\n\nWhen I started working at the Federal Reserve in 1996, I learned three\n\nimportant facts – the “deep” parameters of central banking (Figure 1).\n\nFirst, the potential growth rate of the U.S. economy averages around 3.5\n\npercent. Second, the real neutral rate of interest – or r-star – also averages\n2\n\n\fFINAL\n\naround 3.5 percent in the United States. 1 Third, unemployment and inflation\nare strongly linked through the Phillips curve.\n\nFast forward to 2019. These facts – these deep parameters – feel like a\n\ndistant memory (Figure 2). As of June, participants of the Federal Open\n\nMarket Committee put longer-run potential growth in the U.S. at about 1.9\n\npercent. Estimates of the long-run neutral rate of interest were penciled in at\n\njust 0.5 percent. 2 As for the Phillips curve… most arguments today center\naround whether it’s dead or just gravely ill. Either way, the relationship\nbetween unemployment and inflation has become very difficult to spot.\nAlthough the numbers may be a little different, the changes I’ve\n\ndescribed are not unique to the United States. Global demographic shifts and\n\nlower productivity gains are tempering growth and reducing long-run interest\n\nrates in many countries. 3 And a number of central banks are finding that\n\ninflation is less responsive to labor market improvements than in the past.\n\nThese trends have important implications for monetary policy. Lower r-\n\nstar and the zero lower bound mean we’ll have less room to maneuver when\n\nthe next downturn occurs. 4 And the fainter signal coming from the Phillips\ncurve means we have less direct, real-time feedback about how monetary\npolicy is playing out in the economy.\n\nIn other words, the jobs of central banks have gotten harder.\n\nThe Congressional Budget Office estimate of real potential growth averaged 3.5 percent from 1949 to 1996\n(https://www.cbo.gov/about/products/budget-economic-data#11). Based on estimates from Laubach and\nWilliams (2003), the real neutral rate of interest averaged 3.9 percent from 1961 to 1996, with a decline\nevident in the early 1990s (https://www.newyorkfed.org/research/policy/rstar).\n2 The median of longer-run GDP growth in the June Summary of Economic Projections was 1.9 percent. The\nmedian of the longer-run real rate of interest was 0.5 percent. See Board of Governors (2019b).\n3 Holston, Laubach, and Williams (2017).\n4 One of the lessons learned from the financial crisis and its aftermath is that alternative tools like forward\nguidance and the balance sheet can be effective at stimulating economies. However, they’re still imperfect\nsubstitutes for the most effective tool at our disposal: traditional interest rate adjustments.\n1\n\n3\n\n\fFINAL\n\nUncertainty and Tradeoffs\nWhen I lay out the backdrop I just described, I’m almost always asked\n\nthe same questions. First, if inflation isn’t rising, can we run the economy as\n\nhot as we want without consequence? And second, does monetary policy\nreally affect inflation anymore?\n\nLet me tackle the hot economy question first.\n\nDespite many years of trying, I’ve been unable to find evidence of a “free\n\nlunch.” Actions always have consequences, and there are always tradeoffs to\n\nconsider. Some are immediate, and some take time to develop.\n\nThe question is… what are the tradeoffs in today’s economic\n\nenvironment? If the normal tension between unemployment and inflation has\nweakened, how do we know whether we’ve achieved our full employment\nmandate?\n\nAgain I’ll turn to the U.S. experience. Our current expansion passed the\n\n10-year mark in July – a U.S. record. Unemployment has fallen from 10\n\npercent at its peak in October 2009 to near historic lows – just 3.7 percent in\nJuly. Other critical labor market indicators have also improved, including\n\nprime-age labor force participation, job-finding rates, wages, and income.\n\nThese improvements have been particularly notable for disadvantaged\n\nworkers who often struggle to get a foothold in the workforce. 5 Recent\n\nresearch I’ve done with colleagues examines this pattern closely. 6 We looked\n\ninto whether running a hot economy – compared with just a sustained\nexpansion – provides extra benefits to marginalized groups.\n5\n6\n\nPetrosky-Nadeau and Valletta (2019).\nAaronson et al. (2019).\n\n4\n\n\fFINAL\n\nWe found that, when the unemployment rate drops below what is\n\nthought to be its long-run sustainable level, the benefits to marginalized\ngroups increase. Said simply, the gains to running a hot economy\n\ndisproportionately flow to groups that are historically less advantaged.\n\nThese findings are echoed in the comments we hear from workforce\n\ndevelopment and community leaders. They tell us that the current hot\n\neconomy has allowed many of their constituents to get a second look from\nemployers. 7\n\nThis outcome is intuitive. When labor markets are tight and firms are\n\ncompeting for workers, they find new ways to fill jobs. They recruit more\n\nintensively, adjust hiring standards, and look to a broader pool of potential\n\nemployees. 8 These conditions create more opportunities for disadvantaged\n\ngroups.\n\nAll of this means that assigning too much weight to our projections of\n\nthe long-run sustainable rate of unemployment – or u-star – risks\n\nundershooting what the labor market can really deliver. Indeed, central banks\nin the United States and other countries have been marking down their\n\nestimates of u-star as unemployment rates have fallen. 9 And recent research\n\nin the United States and here in New Zealand points to non-inflationary rates\n\nof unemployment that are even lower than current estimates of the natural\nrate would imply. 10\n\nPowell (2019).\nThis insight was originally documented in Okun (1973). This type of behavior is documented more recently\nin Davis, Faberman, and Haltiwanger (2013), Leduc and Liu (2019 forthcoming), Abraham and Haltiwanger\n(2019), and Modestino, Shoag, and Ballance (2016).\n9 In 2012, the FOMC Summary of Economic Projections put the longer-run unemployment rate between 5.2\nand 6 percent (Board of Governors 2012). In June 2019, the median estimate of u-star had fallen to 4.2\npercent (Board of Governors 2019b).\n10 Petrosky-Nadeau and Valletta (2019), Crump et al. (2019), and Jacob and Wong (2018).\n7\n8\n\n5\n\n\fFINAL\n\nBut as I said before… there is no free lunch. There are potential\n\nconsequences to running a hot economy we need to consider.\n\nFor instance, an overly tight labor market might encourage businesses\n\nand workers to make decisions that have negative long-term effects on\n\npotential output. Some research has found that persistently strong economic\n\nconditions can pull young people out of school – a choice that may undermine\ntheir future job prospects and earning potential. 11 And anecdotal evidence\n\nsuggests that firms may reduce investments in employee training and skill\n\ndevelopment to reduce the costs of rapid employee turnover.\n\nWe also have to think about how running the economy hotter affects\n\nfinancial stability. If interest rates get too low, and borrowing becomes too\n\neasy, imbalances in financial markets could once again develop. In the United\nStates, I’m closely watching the high level of corporate debt, particularly\n\namong riskier firms. While I don’t view current corporate indebtedness as\n\nposing an acute financial stability risk, this vulnerability could amplify the\nmacroeconomic impact of any shocks to the economy.\n\nSo we need to stay vigilant. But for now, the latest Federal Reserve\n\nFinancial Stability Report judges that the U.S. financial sector remains\nresilient. 12 And if vulnerabilities were to increase further, there are\n\ninstruments such as the countercyclical capital buffer that we might want to\nconsider before making monetary policy more restrictive.\n\nPutting this all together, where do I come out on the tradeoffs of\n\nrunning a hot economy? Right now, with little inflationary pressure and\n11\n12\n\nCharles, Hurst, and Notowidigdo (2018), and Cascio and Narayan (2019).\nBoard of Governors (2019a).\n\n6\n\n\fFINAL\n\nconsiderable uncertainty about the threshold for full employment, I’m biased\ntowards including as many workers as possible in the expansion.\nEvery Tenth Counts\nNow let me turn to the second question: Can monetary policy still affect\n\ninflation?\n\nLooking at the data does give one pause. Inflation rates in many\n\ncountries have remained stubbornly below 2 percent for more than a decade.\nThis is despite considerable monetary stimulus and relatively healthy labor\nmarkets.\n\nNow, some would argue that these misses are not really meaningful –\n\njust a couple of tenths. But in our new economic environment, every tenth\ncounts. There are a number of difficulties that could arise with persistent\nmisses on our 2 percent goal.\n\nOne of the most important benefits of inflation targeting was that it\n\nresulted in well-anchored inflation expectations. Households and firms\n\nbecame willing to smooth through idiosyncratic price shocks rather than\n\nincorporate them into wage demands or long-term contracts. This success is\nreflected in the research that shows expectations, rather than past inflation,\nhave become the key determinant of future inflation. 13\n\nBut like most things, expectations can cut both ways. If we consistently\n\nfall short of our inflation target, expectations will drift down. We’re already\n\nseeing signs of softness in survey- and market-based measures of longer-run\n\ninflation expectations. 14\n\n13\n14\n\nJordà et al. (2019) and IMF (2013).\nNechio (2015) and Lansing (2018).\n\n7\n\n\fFINAL\n\nPersistent misses on inflation will make the public more likely to\n\nincorporate these delivered outcomes into their plans. The anchor we worked\n\nso hard to achieve will move from the 2 percent target we talk about to the\nless-than-2 percent inflation we deliver.\n\nThis is particularly worrisome given the proximity of the effective lower\n\nbound. Below-target inflation translates directly into less policy space to offset\nnegative economic shocks. In very practical terms, if inflation expectations are\n\na quarter point below our target when the next downturn arrives – and so are\n\nnominal interest rates – that’s one less rate cut at our disposal.\nMonetary Policy in a Changing World\n\nLooking ahead, persistently low inflation presents a new problem for\n\nmonetary policymakers.\n\nThirty years ago, central banks around the world needed to tamp down\n\nrising inflation. The Reserve Bank of New Zealand responded by boldly\n\nintroducing inflation targeting as a new monetary policy framework. Others\n\nquickly followed. These flexible inflation-targeting regimes played a large role\n\nin bringing inflation under control and in anchoring inflation expectations.\nToday, we’re fighting a different battle. We’re fighting inflation from\n\nbelow our target. This final figure (Figure 3) shows how dramatic the change\nhas been.\n\nAs central bankers, we have to ask ourselves: Are we powerless to\n\nrespond to these new dynamics? Or do we simply need new tools?\n\nOur current tool, flexible inflation targeting, is by design forgetful. It lets\n\nbygones be bygones and makes no attempt to make up for past inflation\n8\n\n\fFINAL\n\nmisses. This worked well when inflation shocks were tilted to the upside and\n\nwe had plenty of policy space to offset unwanted increases.\n\nIn our new world of low inflation and low r-star, this approach has clear\n\nchallenges. It runs the risk of repeatedly delivering below-target inflation\n\nduring expansions, and leaving the economy with even less policy space when\nthe next downturn hits.\n\nAlternative strategies such as average inflation targeting and price-level\n\nand nominal income targeting explicitly include a make-up strategy. They\n\nensure inflation misses balance out over time. While no magic bullet, these\n\nmake-up approaches recognize that we’ll need to be intentional – rather than\nopportunistic – about offsetting inflation underruns. 15\n\nOf course, any changes in our monetary policy framework require\n\ncareful and deliberate thought. The current approach has been effective in\n\nkeeping inflation low and steady through good times and bad. So the bar for\nchange should be high.\n\nBut the future looks different than the past. And much like 30 years ago,\n\nthe world we face today requires us to consider bold action. For now, we must\n\nfully use the tools we have. And looking ahead, we must adapt our monetary\npolicy frameworks to deliver on the mandates we’re committed to: full\nemployment and price stability.\nConclusion\n\nThere’s no question that our world has changed tremendously in recent\n\nyears. And these changes have created challenges that we’re still learning how\nSvensson (1999), Nessén and Vestin (2005), Bernanke, Kiley, and Roberts (2019), and Mertens and Williams\n(2019).\n15\n\n9\n\n\fFINAL\n\nto address. But we’re working from strong foundations. Foundations that the\n\nReserve Bank of New Zealand helped lay down 30 years ago.\n\nI look forward to figuring out where we go next with you.\n\nThank you.\n\n10\n\n\fFINAL\n\nReferences\nAaronson, Stephanie R., Mary C.

Daly, President and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of San Francisco\nSymposium on Asian Banking and Finance\nSingapore\nJune 3, 2019\n9:45AM SGT\nRemarks as prepared for delivery.\n\nIntroduction\nThank you for that kind introduction, Ravi, and for being the gracious\n\nhost of this year’s symposium.\n\nThe Monetary Authority of Singapore and the Federal Reserve Bank of\n\nSan Francisco have partnered on this event for the past several years. But this\nis my first time making the trip to Singapore – and I’m really excited to be\nhere.\n\nNow, before I begin, I have to give the standard disclaimer: the remarks\n\nI’m about to deliver are my own, and do not necessarily reflect the views of\nanyone else within the Federal Reserve System.\nNavigating headwinds\nBanking for the common good. It’s a natural evolution of the\n\nconversations we’ve been having at this event, and many like it, for the past\nseveral years.\n\n1\n\n\fFINAL\n\nBeing more customer-focused… using finance to create inclusive\n\ngrowth… understanding the role that organizational culture plays in all of it…\nthese are hot topics for both the financial services industry and regulatory\ninstitutions. 1 And progress has been made. 2\n\nYet consumers remain wary – even a little skeptical – of financial firms.\n\nI’ve got a front row seat for this in the San Francisco Bay Area. There are a lot\nof people willing to turn to Big Tech – and away from Big Banks – when it\n\ncomes to managing their finances. A study last year found that 58 percent of\n\nAmericans would be willing to move their banking to non-traditional financial\ncompanies like Amazon or Google. 3\n\nAnd it makes sense. Banks are still repairing the breach of trust caused\n\nby the global financial crisis. Repeated scandals showed that banks weren’t\n\nalways good actors. Poor corporate culture and profit-first practices created\nsignificant consequences for consumers. 4 People lost homes, retirement\n\nsavings, college funds… a sense of security. It left deep scars.\n\nSince then, much-needed regulations have improved the resiliency of\n\nthe financial system, making future crises less likely. This has helped boost\nconfidence in the industry.\n\nBut the world didn’t stand still while banks worked to recover their\n\ncredibility with the public. Technology-based competitors emerged with\ncustomer-centric approaches to finance.\n\nBailey (2018), Menon (2019), and Lagarde (2019).\nDe Nederlandsche Bank (2015) and Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (2016).\n3 Center for the Digital Future at USC Annenberg (2018).\n4 Federal Reserve Bank of New York (2018) and Williams (2018).\n1\n2\n\n2\n\n\fFINAL\n\nThey offered targeted products, tailor-made to serve the needs of a\n\ndiverse customer base. They worked to keep costs low, and efficiency and\n\nconvenience high. Notably, these firms also talked about the broader good,\nand how their business models help promote a better future. 5\n\nPutting these things together, traditional financial institutions are facing\n\nsome pretty strong headwinds. And they’re headwinds that can’t be addressed\nthrough regulatory guardrails alone.\nSo what can be done?\n\nHere’s my view: banks – large and small – need to become owners.\n\nOwners who are committed to – and accountable for – doing right by their\n\ncustomers and their communities.\n\nYou might be thinking that sounds like a lot. Or maybe that it’s even too\n\nhigh of a standard. But speaking from experience, I can tell you: it is possible.\nBecoming owners\n\nThe Federal Reserve System faced its own challenges in the wake of the\n\nfinancial crisis. Public trust in our institution plummeted, and it’s been slow to\n\ncome back. 6 And like private-sector firms, we face an ever-changing\n\nlandscape, and a highly competitive environment for the best ideas and talent.\nThis was especially true at our Bank, with its proximity to Silicon Valley.\n\nSo about four years ago, the San Francisco Fed decided to take a hard\n\nlook at our own organization. What was working? What wasn’t? Our culture\nsoon emerged as one of the biggest areas in need of improvement. So we\ndecided to change it.\n\n5\n6\n\nMenon (2019).\nSaad (2019) and Gallup (2019).\n\n3\n\n\fFINAL\n\nWe started with the basics. We focused not only on what employees do,\n\nbut also how they do it. And we emphasized skills and behaviors that would\nenable our best work… things like collaboration, emotional intelligence,\ninfluence, and critical thinking.\n\nThis was our starting point – our foundation. But something was still\n\nmissing.\n\nTo really get to the next level, it became clear we needed to do more. We\n\nneeded to become owners. Ready to hold ourselves accountable to our\n\nmission, vision, and values – no excuses. Prepared to trust our employees to\n\ndo the right thing – even when no one is watching, and even when there isn’t a\n\ndetailed rulebook to follow.\n\nThis transition to a culture of owners hasn’t been easy. And we’re far\n\nfrom done. But embracing this mindset has changed us – and for the better. So\nI want to share with you what we’ve learned.\nDefining your values\nThe first step in becoming an owner is defining your values. What do\n\nyou believe in? How will you go about achieving your mission and vision?\n\nAt the Federal Reserve, we’re tasked with a dual mandate – promoting\n\nfull employment and price stability. We also support safe and sound banking\n\nand payment systems. That’s our mission.\n\nAt the San Francisco Fed, we want to be the best in public service. That’s\n\nour vision.\n\nOur values are something different – but equally important.\n4\n\n\fFINAL\n\nThey’re spelled out on a banner that greets every person who walks into\n\nour lobby each day. It says: “Our work touches every American and countless\n\nglobal citizens.”\n\nThat’s our core value – service. Service to the people and the\n\ncommunities we represent. That’s the reason we show up to work every day.\nThat’s our touchstone.\nBuilding trust\nDefining your values is essential. But it’s only the beginning of building a\n\nculture of ownership.\n\nTo give values life, and make them real for every individual you work\n\nwith, you have to take action. And those actions have to be rooted in trust –\nthe trust that your people will act in the interest of others and the\norganization.\n\nLet me give you an example. This is what the San Francisco Fed’s\n\nemployee handbook used to look like. It was created with the best of\n\nintentions: to help people become successful members of our team. But what\nit turned into is pretty intimidating.\n\nIt’s heavy. It has a lot of rules. Worst of all, it sends the message that we\n\nneed to micro-manage and monitor the very people we’re counting on to be\nour ambassadors – our employees.\nThis is the opposite of trust.\n\nSo we threw the whole thing out.\nthing.\n\nHere’s the new one. Big difference. I can carry it around with me, for one\n5\n\n\fFINAL\n\nGone are the lists of dos and don’ts. In their place is a new mindset – one\n\nthat defaults to the positive. It describes our values, and calls on employees to\nuphold them using their best judgment. Most importantly, the new handbook\nmoves away from solving for potential bad behavior, and instead emphasizes\nthe expectation of good behavior.\n\nWe followed the new handbook with more radical moves. We told\n\npeople they could “dress for their day,” and “flex for their day,” and “stop\ndoing it” if certain processes no longer added value.\n\nNot surprisingly, all these changes caused some heartburn. You might\n\nbe thinking about all the things that could go wrong. What if people take\nadvantage? What if we can no longer get our work done?\n\nI get it. Conducting business this way requires a lot of trust at every\n\nlevel of the organization. And people are going to bump into each other as\nthey figure things out.\n\nSo it’s important to have a plan in place for mitigating those conflicts.\n\nPart of this can be achieved by simply acknowledging that growing pains are a\nnatural part of the process.\n\nBut it’s equally important for leaders to model how situations should be\n\nevaluated when judgment – rather than a rule book – is the deciding factor.\nEmployees take their cues from the top, especially during times of change.\n\nSo it’s essential for all of us to hold ourselves accountable to the values\n\nwe’ve defined, even if it’s uncomfortable or unpopular in the short term.\nIf you’re willing to do this, I know you’ll be pleasantly surprised.\n\nLiving without a detailed rulebook is possible – if you’ve defined the\n\nright values, and empowered employees to act in the best interest of your\n\norganization and its customers.\n\n6\n\n\fFINAL\n\nThey’ll do the right thing – even if no one is watching, and even when\n\nthey face uncharted territory.\n\nCommitting to a growth mindset\nSo once you’ve defined your values, and built an environment of trust,\n\nhow do you keep growing? How do you stay agile?\n\nThere are two essential ingredients for success: diversity of thought,\n\nand inclusion of ideas.\n\nNow, I’m not talking about optical diversity, where you simply set the\n\ntable with people who look different. I mean true diversity, where you\n\nencourage new ideas and differences of opinion, and include them equally in\nthe discussion.\n\nPut simply: listening to a wide variety of viewpoints produces better\n\noutcomes. It ensures you’re considering all angles. And it makes you aware of\nissues and problems that aren’t even on your radar.\n\nI’ve found this particularly valuable as a new leader.\n\nI’m naturally a fast talker. I love nothing more than batting ideas back\n\nand forth like a ping pong ball. I’ll get excited, interrupt, draw on a whiteboard\n– it’s an event, a brainstorming mania.\n\nBut I recently had an epiphany. Not everyone is like me. And in my\n\nexcitement to jump in first, I was crowding out lots of other good ideas. I was\n\ninadvertently pushing people onto the sidelines.\n\nSo I started writing notes to myself, reminding me to slow down. I’ve\n\nworked harder to include more introverted voices, or remote employees who\nfind it difficult to interject on the phone. And I’ve told others around me to\nhold me accountable to this goal.\n\n7\n\n\fFINAL\n\nIt’s a work in progress. But I’m happy to report that a number of quieter\n\nvoices have emerged and become valuable contributors at my table. And\nthey’re helping to transform our organization.\nMaking the business case\nThis is what’s working for us at the San Francisco Fed.\n\nBut you may be thinking: Sure, this sounds great for a public service\n\norganization. Your job is to pursue the common good. How would this work in\nthe private sector, at a profit-making bank?\n\nAnd I’d like to answer that question with two stories.\n\nThe CEO of the online retailer Zappos once wrote an article in the\n\nHarvard Business Review to explain how his company had earned its\n\nreputation for delivering best-in-class customer service. 7 And he told a story\n\nabout a woman who called in after forgetting to mail back a pair of shoes she’d\nplanned to return. There’d been a death in her family. So the Zappos rep sent\nher flowers.\n\nThat’s the kind of thing that’s possible when employees are empowered\n\nto act as ambassadors for your values. Yes, that phone rep may have spent $50\nto do the right thing – but as the CEO himself said: “now she’s a customer for\nlife.”\n\nThis works for shoes. And I can tell you from personal experience that it\n\nalso works for banks.\n\nWhen I was 16 years old, I needed a checking account. I was working\n\nfull-time and needed to pay rent and utilities – and they only took checks.\n7\n\nHsieh (2010).\n\n8\n\n\fFINAL\n\nSo I found myself at a bank in Ballwin, Missouri, where I grew up. And\n\nwhen I talked to the new accounts clerk, I found out that minors couldn’t open\nan account without a parent’s signature – bank policy.\n\nBut both of my parents were out of the picture. When I explained my\n\nsituation to the clerk, she decided to take a chance.\n\nShe opened my account. Helped me fill out the deposit form, and select\n\nmy checks. She even took a few minutes to explain the basics of banking, so I\ncould avoid any overdrafts and fees.\n\nShe wasn’t a manager. She didn’t have to do this. But she did. She led\n\nwith her values, and the values of her organization. She put my need for a\nchecking account at the center of her business.\nyears.\n\nAnd that stuck with me. I stayed a customer at her bank for almost 20\n\nAligning interests\nWe have a phrase in economics – incentive compatibility – that\n\ndescribes this situation. It’s the moment when the planets align, and what’s\ngood for me, is good for you, is good for society.\n\nWe’re at that moment now for the financial services industry.\n\nIf you’re willing to become an owner… if you’re willing to put your\n\ncustomers and communities at the center of your business… banking for the\n\ncommon good will move beyond the title of this conference, and become the\nnew industry norm.\nThank you.\n\n9\n\n\fFINAL\n\nReferences\nAustralian Prudential Regulation Authority. 2016.

Daly, President and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of San Francisco\nSyracuse University Commencement\nSyracuse, NY\nMay 12, 2019\n11:00AM ET\nRemarks as prepared for delivery.\n*This speech is dedicated to all those who helped me get here.\n\nIntroduction\nWow. This is awesome, and I’m not even graduating. Such a big crowd.\n\nSo much excitement.\n\nBefore I begin, I want all the graduates – and only the graduates – to\n\ngive yourselves a big round of applause. This is a special day, and I want you to\ntake in its meaningfulness.\n\nThe last time I was here, I was getting my Ph.D. and serving as a\n\ngraduation marshal. I was excited, of course, but also slightly nervous that I\nwould mess up my role as flag bearer during our procession.\n\nThis is way more responsibility. But luckily, I don’t have to carry\n\nanything.\n\nChancellor Syverud, thank you so much for entrusting me with this\n\nhonor. And thank you for that very kind introduction.\n\nSince becoming president of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco,\n\nI’ve listened to a lot of introductions about myself.\n1\n\n\fFINAL\n\nThere is a common thread in all of them. An ‘unlikely’ path. GED to PhD\n\nto CEO. Forty years of life condensed into three, rarely seen together,\nacronyms.\n\nThe question that almost always follows is: How did it happen? Am I\n\nexceptional? Did I see forty years ago the life I have today?\nThe answer is simple: not at all.\n\nBetsy\nForty years ago, I was sitting in the parking lot of a McDonald’s near\n\nBallwin, Missouri, where I grew up. I had driven there to meet a woman\n\nnamed Betsy, a friend of my high school guidance counselor.\n\nBetsy was in her mid-30s, a successful woman, busy building her life\n\nand career. I was 15, my family was in chaos, I’d dropped out of high school,\nand I was living with friends. My counselor thought Betsy could help.\n\nBetsy had the fanciest car I had ever seen. It had a tan leather interior,\n\nand when the sun shined in, it felt warm and safe. It was a refuge.\n\nMy counselor was right. Betsy took me under her wing. She encouraged\n\nme to get a GED. She paid $216 for my first semester of college. [I know, it’s\n\nhard to believe.] And that started the journey that led me here, to a PhD from\n\nSyracuse University.\n\nBut those are the highlights of the story, and they don’t capture how\n\nBetsy really changed my life.\n\nSitting in that car, feeling like my world was out of control, I wanted\n\nBetsy to give me answers, to fix things. Instead, she told me:\n“Mary, you have to bloom where you’re planted.”\n2\n\n\fFINAL\n\nI was shocked. I immediately protested. I said it wasn’t fair. I didn’t\n\nknow how to manage my life. I was only 15. It all seemed too much.\nlost.\n\nI blamed others. I blamed myself. For a moment, I even blamed her. I felt\nHow was I going to make it?\n\nSo she said it again. More gently this time.\n\nMary, you have to bloom where you’re planted.\nBuilding resiliency\nThe fact that you have to start from where you are is hard. It’s an easy\n\nstatement to understand, but a much tougher one to accept.\n\nLife can be unfair. Not everyone begins from the same position. And as\n\nyou go out in the world, you may find yourself short of where you think you\nshould be.\n\nSometimes it knocks the wind out of you. Sometimes it makes you\n\nangry. It always leaves you feeling a little unsure.\n\nMy situation was tough. Betsy never denied it. But she told me that I had\n\none life, and I shouldn’t let it be defined by the bad draw I’d gotten.\n\nHer advice was to accept my frustration and sadness, and let it inform –\n\nbut not determine – my future. Let it serve as a reminder, but not a barrier.\n\nI’ll be honest… accepting my situation was difficult. But I also found it\n\nfreeing.\n\nIt meant I could change my life. That my presence mattered. That I had\n\nsome say in my own success.\n\nIt helped me be resilient, and it allowed me to bounce back, make my\n\nway, and stand in front of you today.\n\n3\n\n\fFINAL\n\nBloom where you’re planted\nBut acceptance and blooming aren’t the same. So how do you thrive?\n\nFor me, it’s been about being open.\n\nEvery week when I saw Betsy, she had a new book for me. Sometimes it\n\nwas about art, sometimes history, maybe even poetry. And always, there were\nthe biographies.\n\nI drank it all in. And it let me live in a world beyond my own experience.\nMy father was a postman. My mom stayed home and took care of us. I\n\nhad loved school, but the challenges of our daily lives consumed me. And they\n\ncrowded out my interest in other things. They made me insular, and inward-\n\nfacing. They left me feeling alone.\n\nBetsy’s books took me outside myself. They generated ideas –\n\nperspectives I’d never considered, concepts I’d never thought of. They also\n\nshowed me paths – taken by other people, people I didn’t know – that seemed\ncompletely improbable and wildly unrealistic.\nThey sparked hope.\n\nSo when Betsy suggested I get a GED, I was willing to give it a try.\nGrowing into yourself\nBut that’s not the end of the story. Betsy is a nudger. I’d get one thing\n\ndone, and she would suggest another, even more improbable sounding\n\npossibility. Once I had a GED, she suggested I go to college.\n\nI’d never imagined college – I’d barely heard of it. But I wanted to be\n\nlike Betsy. And I certainly didn’t want to let her down. So I went.\n4\n\n\fFINAL\n\nI was in way over my head during my first semesters of college.\n\nFamiliar feelings crept in. Fear, mostly. A sense that maybe I didn’t belong, and\n\nI couldn’t make it.\n\nSo I worked day and night, and took as many classes as allowed, all in an\n\nattempt to catch up and boost my confidence. I told myself I could fake it until\nI made it.\nthink.\n\nAnd I did make it. But not in the linear, predictable fashion you might\nI graduated with a degree in economics… and philosophy. But I loved\n\nthe arts, and got my first jobs out of college at a theatre, and a dance company.\nEventually I returned to economics and public policy, which brought me to\n\nSyracuse. And after getting a PhD in microeconomics and social policy, I chose\n\na job working on macroeconomics and monetary policy at the San Francisco\nFed.\n\nNow when people hear these details, they often conclude that I must be\n\namazingly self-assured. But the truth is, I’ve spent years struggling with my\n\nconfidence. Wondering when, not if, I would be found out.\n\nWhen would people dig through the veneer I had created and discover\n\nthat, beneath the degrees, the accomplishments, and the contributions, I was\nsimply an imposter – that scared kid in Betsy’s car.\n\nHere is the big reveal. True confidence came only recently for me.\n\nMostly because I spent years focusing on the wrong thing.\n\nOther people weren’t waiting to criticize me, or judge me for my past. I\n\nwas doing that to myself. I was constantly trying to rise above my background.\nThe secret all along was to just embrace it.\n5\n\n\fFINAL\n\nMy experiences absolutely define me, but in a way I hadn’t been able to\n\nsee. They make me focus on others, be tolerant of fresh starts, celebrate wins,\nand look for ways to contribute.\nof it.\n\nIn other words, I’m not who I am despite my life. I am who I am because\n\nDon’t go it alone\nSo with all those shrouds of doubt laying over me, how did I ever come\n\nto see who I was? With the help of many others.\n\nWe’re often taught to admire people who pull themselves up by their\n\nbootstraps and forge a path completely on their own. It can make it hard to be\nvulnerable, and ask someone for help.\n\nBut I didn’t have the luxury of standing alone when I met Betsy at 15.\n\nAnd it taught me that we all need Betsys – in fact, we need a lot of them\n\nthroughout our lives.\n\nA few years ago, I received an award from my undergraduate school –\n\nthe University of Missouri-Kansas City – for ‘defying the odds.’ Winning the\n\naward was a great honor. But the most amazing part was getting to invite all\nthe people who had helped me get there.\n\nMy wife Shelly and I hosted a dinner of gratitude. Betsy was there, of\n\ncourse. But so was my sixth grade best friend… my undergraduate economics\n\nprofessor – a fellow Syracuse grad! – who drove from Phoenix to attend… the\ncouple who brought me into their home in Kansas City when I felt homesick.\nAnd there were many others, too.\n\n6\n\n\fFINAL\n\nThey all had one thing in common. They had been my supporters.\n\nListening when I needed to talk, believing in me when I lost faith, and pushing\nme when I got stuck.\n\nWhen I looked around that table, I can tell you with complete certainty\n\nthat my life wasn’t lesser because I’d gotten help along the way. It was far, far\nricher.\n\nEmbrace your path\nToday is about celebrating your accomplishments. It’s about taking in\n\nyour time here, and looking forward to your future.\nBut my advice isn’t for today.\n\nIt’s for all your future days. The ones that make you stretch and grow as\n\nyou learn who you are, and what you want to contribute.\n\nAnd on those days, I hope you’ll be open. Open to opportunities you\n\nhaven’t yet conceived of, and to paths you’ve never imagined.\n\nDon’t worry if your journey wanders, or if your seemingly perfect plans\n\nend up being not quite right. This is just part of exploring, and it helps you\nfigure out what’s right for you.\n\nAnd when something goes wrong, and fear and worry creep in, I hope\n\nyou’ll remember Betsy’s words: You have to bloom where you’re planted.\nYou may not always be in control of where you land. But you can\n\nabsolutely decide how you’re going to live there.\n\nOwn your situation. Let it make you resilient. Let it fuel your confidence.\nBe vulnerable enough to ask for help, and be brave enough to take it.\n7\n\n\fFINAL\n\nIf you do these things, I promise: you’ll be great. Able to thrive in the\n\nmost unlikely of places. Able to achieve the completely improbable and the\nwildly unrealistic.\n\nThank you, and congratulations. I can’t wait to see who you become.\n\n8\n\n\f"

            "content": "“The Bumpy Road to 2 Percent: Managing Inflation in the Current Economy”\nMary C. Daly, President and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of San Francisco\nThe Commonwealth Club\nSan Francisco, CA\nMarch 26, 2019\n12:00PM PT\nRemarks as prepared for delivery.\n\nIntroduction\nThank you for that kind introduction and warm welcome. Good\n\nafternoon, everyone. The Commonwealth Club’s history of providing forums\nfor healthy public debate is well known, not only in the Bay Area but across\nthe country. So it’s a real honor to be addressing you today.\n\nI became President and CEO of the Federal Reserve Bank of San\n\nFrancisco just about six months ago. The monetary policy decisions we make\n\nat the Federal Open Market Committee eight times a year have wide-ranging\nimplications. In fact, our work touches the lives of every American and\n\ncountless global citizens. So this is a responsibility I take very seriously. And\nI’m here this afternoon to talk about how I see our economic landscape and\nwhat I’ll be paying attention to in the year ahead.\n\nBut first, I need to issue the standard disclaimer: the remarks I’m about\n\nto deliver are my own, and do not necessarily reflect the views of anyone else\nwithin the Federal Reserve System.\n\n1\n\n\fCurrent Conditions\nLet me begin by telling you about the Federal Reserve’s mission, and\n\nhow we judge success. Our job is to promote a healthy and stable economy,\nand we do this by pursuing two goals.\n\nThe first goal is maximum employment. This generally means that\n\neveryone who wants a job can get one. The second goal is price stability,\n\nwhich the Federal Reserve defines as an inflation rate of 2 percent. 1 This\n\nallows the dollar in your pocket to hold its value over time. Taken together,\nwe call this our dual mandate: maximum employment and price stability.\n\nSo given that mandate and our two goals, it’s reasonable to ask, how’s\n\nthe Fed been doing?\n\nLet’s start with the overall health of the economy. We’re on track to set a\n\nrecord for the longest period without a recession in U.S. history. It will extend\n\npast the 10-year mark this summer. The economy looks to have grown just\n\nover 3 percent in 2018, well above its sustainable pace. And while I see some\n\nsigns of slowing on the horizon this year, I expect annual growth will come in\n\naround 2 percent—in line with its long-run trend. 2\n\nThe strength of the economy has led to a robust labor market. In fact,\n\nthe performance of the labor market has been nothing short of extraordinary.\n\nFor example, last year we saw nearly 2.7 million jobs added to the payrolls. In\n\naddition to being a big number, that’s more than twice the amount we need to\n\nkeep pace with new entrants and reentrants coming in to the labor force. 3\nMeanwhile, unemployment remains near its 50-year low.\n\nBoard of Governors (2012).\nFernald (2019).\n3 Bidder, Mahedy, and Valletta (2016).\n1\n2\n\n2\n\n\fEconomic models—as well as historical data—tell us that a prolonged\n\neconomic expansion and a very tight labor market should be pushing inflation\n\nup to, or even above, our 2 percent goal. But that’s not what we’re\n\nexperiencing today. Inflation has remained low—lower than our 2 percent\n\ntarget—for most of the past decade. We’ve grazed 2 percent here and there,\nincluding briefly last year. But it hasn’t been sustainable.\n\nSo on our dual mandate report card, I feel good about where we are on\n\nemployment—but a little less so about inflation.\nDisrupted Links\n\nSo what’s up with inflation? Is it time to throw out our models and start\n\nfrom scratch? Have the fundamental laws of supply and demand broken\n\ndown? And what does all of this mean for monetary policy? That’s what I’m\n\ngoing to spend the rest of my time today addressing—the inflation puzzle and\nwhat we should make of it.\n\nLet’s start by considering how the links between employment and\n\ninflation have traditionally functioned. To do that, we have to go back to Econ\n\n101, and review how monetary policy affects the economy.\n\nIn short, the Federal Reserve sets interest rates. These interest rates\n\ndetermine borrowing costs. Borrowing costs drive consumer and business\nspending, which in turn determines the level of economic activity. When\n\neconomic activity is high, the labor market heats up. A hot labor market allows\nworkers to demand higher wages. And employers pass these wage gains on to\n\nconsumers in the form of higher prices.\n\n3\n\n\fThose are the basics of how things work—in theory, at least. But as a\n\npolicymaker, I have to focus on the practical. And in the real world, things\n\ncrop up that disrupt the simple linkages between monetary policy and the\n\neconomy. Because I’m an economist, I like to call these things “wedges.” And\n\nunderstanding these wedges goes a long way toward understanding the\ninflation puzzle we’re facing.\nWage and Price Wedges\nWhile there are several wedges that complicate the simple theory\n\nconnecting monetary policy to the economy, the ones I will focus on today\nrelate to employment, wages, and prices.\n\nAs a Reserve Bank President, I spend a lot of time talking to businesses,\n\nworkers, and community members about what they’re experiencing. And\nwhat’s loud and clear these days is that the labor market is changing.\n\nAn example I hear again and again is the increasing demand from\n\nemployees for alternative forms of compensation. Employers are being asked\nto provide benefits like free transportation, flexible workweeks, unlimited\n\ntime off, and help with things like student loan repayment and even housing.\n\nMany employers are providing these benefits in an effort to attract and retain\ntalent. And for some firms, they’ve become a meaningful part of employee\ncompensation packages.\n\nThe challenge for policymakers is that these alternative forms of\n\npayment aren’t being captured in the traditional measures we use to track\nwages and salaries.\n\n4\n\n\fThis creates a wedge between the strong labor market we observe and\n\nour available indicators of wage growth, and it mutes the signal we’re\n\nreceiving about the strength of the economy.\n\nAnother important wedge that’s been evolving over several decades is\n\nthe loss of worker bargaining power. 4 Declining unionization—along with\n\nincreased automation and globalization—have made it harder for workers to\n\npush for higher pay, even in very healthy job markets. 5 This weakens the link\nbetween employment and wage growth.\n\nOf course, workers aren’t the only group affected by these changing\n\ndynamics. Many firms have lost pricing power in a global marketplace, facing\n\never-increasing competition to hold onto customers. 6 This means they have a\nharder time passing along rising costs, such as wages, to final goods prices.\n\nAll of these wedges are contributing to the situation we have today: a\n\nstrong economy with a tight labor market—but muted inflation. 7\nThe Fed Wedge\n\nThere’s another wedge weakening the link between economic activity\n\nand inflation, and it might surprise you. It’s the Fed.\n\nThe actions of the Federal Reserve—and the success of its monetary\n\npolicymaking decisions—have played an important role in keeping inflation\ntethered around 2 percent, in good times and bad.\n\nKrueger (2018) and Farber et al. (2018).\nHaldane (2018).\n6 Cavallo (2018), Guerrieri, Gust, and López-Salido (2010), and Rogoff (2006).\n7 Hooper, Mishkin, and Sufi (2019), Galí and Gambetti (2018), Leduc and Wilson (2017),\nBlanchard (2016), and Coibion and Gorodnichenko (2015).\n4\n\n5\n\n5\n\n\fTo explain how, we need to go back to one of those bad times. In the\n\n1970s, a series of economic shocks hit. One shock was an oil embargo that\n\npushed up oil prices. Because of the cost-of-living adjustments written into\n\nmany workers’ contracts, this automatically translated into wage increases.\nThese wage increases led to price increases. And when the Fed didn’t react\naggressively enough to stem the rising inflation, a vicious cycle began.\n\nPeople started to think high inflation was just a fact of life. Inflation\n\neventually peaked in the double digits. It wasn’t until the Fed raised interest\nrates dramatically that inflation finally started to decline. But, as some will\n\nremember, that was a painful process.\n\nOnce inflation was under control, the Fed committed to keeping it that\n\nway. This commitment became a well-known and accepted position that\npeople could depend on. And it ushered in the conditions that dominate\ntoday—the era of well-anchored inflation expectations.\n\nWe see this shift in the data. Inflation expectations—of both businesses\n\nand consumers—started trending down in the late 1980s, and have remained\nclose to the Fed’s 2 percent target since the mid-1990s. 8\n\nWell-anchored inflation expectations have great benefits. When people\n\nknow that the Fed is committed to keeping inflation at 2 percent, they’re more\nlikely to see inflation fluctuations as temporary, and stop short of building\n\nthem into contracts like wage and rental agreements.\n\n8\n\nAndreasen and Christensen (2016), Nechio (2015), and Williams (2006).\n6\n\n\fIn other words, when the Fed is credible, it’s easier for the economic\n\nsystem to absorb shocks. This keeps inflation from plummeting when the\neconomy is weak, and a lid on inflation when the economy is strong. 9\n\nBut here’s the twist. When the Federal Reserve is doing its job well, the\n\nlink between economic activity and inflation is weaker—much like we see\ntoday. This is the essence of the “Fed wedge.”\n\nMaintaining Credibility in a Low-Inflation Environment\nSo what does all of this mean for monetary policy?\n\nAs I mentioned earlier, inflation has generally been low for the past\n\ndecade. In fact, for the past seven years, inflation has consistently come in\nbelow our 2 percent target.\n\nThis may not seem like much of a problem at first glance. After all, isn’t\n\nit a good thing when prices stay roughly the same?\n\nBut too-low inflation has its own risks. It makes the chance of\n\ndeflation—or negative inflation—more likely. And it makes it harder for the\n\nFed to adjust interest rates in the face of economic shocks. 10\n\nThe bigger problem is that the Fed has explicitly stated that 2 percent is\n\nour goal, and that this goal is symmetric. This means we care just as much\n\nabout long periods of too-low inflation as we do about long periods of too-high\n\ninflation. 11\n\nJordà et al. (2019).\nBernanke (2002).\n11 Board of Governors (2019).\n9\n\n10\n\n7\n\n\fInflation consistently below target tugs at inflation expectations. While\n\nthere is no sign today that the anchor has drifted down significantly, we are\nseeing signs that inflation expectations are edging lower. 12 This bears close\n\nwatching.\n\nWe need to be vigilant on this front, and work to deliver 2 percent\n\ninflation on a sustained basis. The Federal Reserve’s continued credibility\nwith consumers and businesses depends on it.\nConclusion\nLet me end with a few closing thoughts. The Federal Reserve’s\n\ncredibility is one of our most important assets. It isn’t just about having\n\npeople believe the things we say—though of course that’s important. Fed\n\ncredibility is the foundation of our ability to make effective monetary policy.\nThe American people put a lot of trust in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nWe worked hard to earn that trust. We intend to keep earning it every day.\nThank you.\n\n12\n\nDaly (2019), Williams (2019), and Cao and Shapiro (2016).\n8\n\n\fReferences\nAndreasen, Martin M., and Jens H.E.

DALY\nPresident and CEO\nFederal Reserve Bank of San Francisco\nTo\nRegional Economic Development for Eastern Idaho (REDI)\nIdaho Falls, Idaho\nNovember 12, 2018\nAS PREPARED FOR DELIVERY\nIntroduction\nThanks very much for that kind introduction. I’d like to thank Park Price for helping organize this\nevent and for his long service as a San Francisco Fed Director. Park is the definition of a Fed Family\nmember, and I am delighted to deliver my first speech as the president and CEO of the Federal\nReserve Bank of San Francisco in the community Park calls home.\n\nPage 1 of 11\n\n\fI would also like to recognize our veterans who have chosen to spend part of their day with us; we\nthank you for your service.\nI’ve been coming to Idaho since 1997, when I was just a rookie economist. It was love at first sight,\nthe mix of agriculture and technology, rural and urban, the natural beauty, and all the things I love to\ndo: skiing, biking, and hiking. Indeed, when days get hard my mantra is, I’m packing up and moving\nto Idaho. Apparently I am not the only one. Boise was recently flagged by Forbes magazine as the\nfastest-growing metro area in the country,1 and Eastern Idaho is sure to be right behind.\nMore generally, Idaho’s economy is flourishing, so it’s a perfect backdrop to talk about the broader\nU.S. outlook, which is very favorable. As the president of the San Francisco Fed, my job is to\nrepresent most of the western states—from Idaho and Utah out to Hawaii and Alaska—in the\nformulation of the nation’s monetary policy. The Fed’s goal, simply put, is to keep the expansion on\na solid and sustainable footing. Congress has given us two mandates meant to support this: full\nemployment and stable prices. Most of our job focuses on the short run, not letting the economy get\ntoo hot or too cold, but we also have to consider the economy’s longer-term performance. My\nremarks today will focus on each of these in turn.\nNow, before I dive in, let me say that my views are my own and do not necessarily reflect those of\nanyone else in the Federal Reserve System.\nCurrent economic conditions\nI’ll start with the current state of the economy, which is very good. The expansion is over nine years\nold and seems destined to set a new record for the longest period without a recession in U.S. history,\nwhich it should reach in the middle of next year. The labor market is booming. Household and\nbusiness balance sheets are very healthy, and confidence is high. All these factors point to significant\nunderlying economic momentum, which is being boosted by tailwinds including the federal fiscal\n\n1\n\nSharf (2018).\n\nPage 2 of 11\n\n\fstimulus and global growth that, despite some recent unevenness, has been solid over the past few\nyears.\nEven in this strong economy, though, some people are getting left behind. There are pockets of\neconomic distress, and we need to do all we can to ensure that growth is inclusive and everyone has\nan opportunity to benefit.\nMonetary policy, however, can’t do everything. Our job is to keep the overall economy healthy, thus\nhelping promote sustainable economic growth. By doing this, monetary policy supports economic\nwell-being and creates opportunities for all to advance.\nImplications for monetary policy\nThis principle of sustaining a healthy expansion has guided our recent policy and plans. As you\nprobably know, the Fed’s monetary policy group, the Federal Open Market Committee, or FOMC,\nmeets eight times per year. We left interest rates unchanged at our meeting last week. More\ngenerally, though, we’ve been gradually increasing rates in order to bring the stance of monetary\npolicy closer to neutral.\nThis policy normalization, or return to neutral, reflects our commitment to the Fed’s dual mandate.\nOne goal is “maximum” or full employment. This means an unemployment rate that is very low,\nreflecting normal worker turnover in a thriving labor market. Recent unemployment numbers below\n4 percent strongly suggest that the labor market has reached or exceeded full employment. But there\nare other indicators as well, and I’ll return to them in a moment.\nOur other goal is stable prices. In 2012, the FOMC determined that aiming for price inflation of 2\npercent was most consistent with that broad long-run goal.2 We’d been mostly running below that\ntarget since the Great Recession ended in 2009. Recently, though, inflation has come back up and is\nbasically on target. I expect this modest uptrend to continue, with inflation rising to just a bit above\n2 percent over the next year or so. Of course, there are risks on both sides of that projection.\n\n2\n\nBoard of Governors (2012).\n\nPage 3 of 11\n\n\fInflation could pick up more rapidly than expected, or it could drop back down again.3 For now,\nthough, the inflation numbers are very encouraging.\nThese conditions, with both of the Fed’s goals essentially met, merit the gradual normalization of\nmonetary policy.\nSo why gradual? I view this gradualism as a process of iterated learning, guided by incoming data.\nThat is, we take a policy action, wait, learn about the economy’s response, and repeat. The\ninformation gathered through this gradual approach is crucial for determining the speed and size of\nthe subsequent policy adjustments. Of course, since monetary policy acts with a significant lag—\nlikely a few years—policymakers must plan ahead, but need to be ready to adjust if the data or the\nenvironment change.4\nIn other words, the FOMC is not on autopilot, with quarterly rate increases locked in. We’re\nconstantly looking at the data and adjusting the monetary policy path as needed in response.\nAre we at full employment?\nThat summarizes where I see the economy and policy headed. But there are always uncertainties.\nWe’ve been surprised at how long it’s taken inflation to return to target. This has raised questions\nabout whether the economy has truly reached its full potential. In other words, are we at the point\nwhere growth will be increasingly constrained by bottlenecks and other supply factors, rather than\ninadequate demand?\nIn the labor market, this idea of an economy at its potential corresponds to full employment. Hence\nthe question: “Are we at full employment?” [slide]. While we frequently summarize the state of the\nlabor market with the unemployment rate, we always look at a wide variety of other labor market\nindicators. These include broader measures of underemployment that take into account individuals who\nare out of the labor market or stuck in part-time jobs. We also watch an array of independent data\nseries on job openings, worker quit rates, reported job availability and difficulties filling jobs, and\n3\n4\n\nThese risks are discussed in Powell (2018). See also Shapiro (2018, forthcoming).\nHavranek and Rusnak (2013).\n\nPage 4 of 11\n\n\fothers. Essentially all of these indicators are flashing bright green: they’ve met or moved beyond\ntheir values from past peaks, signaling a labor market that is indeed at full employment.\nThe key exception is continued low rates of labor force participation. This refers to the fraction of\nthe working-age population that is either employed or is unemployed and actively seeking work. My\nfirst chart shows the patterns in participation over the past 25 years for the overall population ages\n16 and over and for workers in their prime working years, corresponding to ages 25 to 54.\n\nYou can see that the overall rate has generally been on the decline since the year 2000.\nDemographics play a big role—specifically aging, as many of the baby boom generation head off for\nretirement.\nBut an aging population doesn’t explain everything. The chart also shows a drop in labor force\nparticipation among prime-age workers. Like the overall rate, prime-age participation peaked around\nthe year 2000. It fell around the 2001 recession and then took an even steeper tumble during and\nafter the Great Recession of 2007 through 2009. It reached a low point in 2015, nearly eight years\nafter the initial downturn. We’ve seen a bit of improvement since then. But currently, the prime-age\nparticipation rate is significantly lower than it was in the 1990s.\n\nPage 5 of 11\n\n\fThis raises the question—why aren’t Americans working like they used to? Some observers think\nthis reflects a labor market that hasn’t yet recovered from the last recession. But my reading of the\nevidence suggests that longer-term factors are at play.\nA number of influences have been identified. Research by San Francisco Fed economist Nicolas\nPetrosky-Nadeau and his coauthor Bob Hall suggests that some of the drop owes to economically\nsecure families opting in favor of one employed spouse rather than two.5 In other words, there may\nhave been some shift toward the “life” end of the work-life balance.\nAnother factor behind the decline is ongoing job polarization that favors workers at the high and\nlow ends of the skill distribution but hinders those in the middle. This is mainly due to changing\ntechnology. I know for myself, I never call a travel agent anymore. With a few taps and swipes on\nmy phone, I can book a trip to almost anywhere in the world in seconds. But it goes far beyond that:\nour economy is automating a wide range of jobs in the middle-skill range, from assembly lines, to\ncall center workers, to grocery checkers.\nA growing body of research finds that these pressures on middle-skill jobs leave a big swath of\nworkers on the sidelines, wanting work but not having the skills or flexibility to keep pace with the\never-changing economy.6\nWhat to do?\nI’ve argued that low workforce participation reflects long-term challenges. Good monetary policy\ncan’t directly cure these problems. But as I’ve already noted, it can help by keeping the expansion\ngoing. Recessions cause long-term damage to workers’ employment and wage prospects.7 Keeping\nthe economy on an even keel can help avoid these problems.\nBut much can be done beyond good monetary policy. We shouldn’t think of “full employment” as a\nfixed target, but instead think of it as something that can be moved. From that perspective, there\nappears to be quite a bit of upside potential for U.S. workforce participation.\nHall and Petrosky-Nadeau (2016).\nSee Abraham and Kearney (2018), Autor, Katz, and Kearney (2006), Autor (2010), and Valletta and Barlow (2018).\n7 See for example Davis and von Wachter (2011).\n5\n6\n\nPage 6 of 11\n\n\fInternational comparisons are helpful on this point. The next chart shows the prime-age\nparticipation rate in Germany, Canada, the United Kingdom, and the United States. In these other\nadvanced economies, participation has increased overall and now stands well above the rates\nobserved in the United States. This is especially striking because, just like the United States, these\ncountries are facing long-term challenges like labor market polarization. Yet, they have managed to\noffset the downward pull on participation rates.\n\nWhat factors have contributed to this growing divergence between us and other countries?\nEducation is one. Like most advanced economies, job creation in the United States has tilted toward\njobs that require a college degree.8 But we’re not adequately preparing our new workers for the jobs\nof the future. Although the share of young people with four-year college degrees is rising, we are\nfalling behind many of our international competitors.9\nSo where should we focus our efforts when it comes to increasing college education? A good place\nto start would be reducing the educational attainment gap across students of different races and\nethnicities. Equalizing opportunity and access to higher education has substantial upside potential\n8\n9\n\nCarnevale, Smith, and Strohl (2013), OECD (2018a).\nOECD (2018b).\n\nPage 7 of 11\n\n\ffor overall growth, as well as for enhancing the economic mobility that is at the core of our\nAmerican identity.10\nBut education is not the only answer. There are other things that can be done. The United States\nversus Canada comparison is especially telling (chart). You can see a growing participation gap\nbetween the two countries since the late 1990s. By 2017, the prime-age participation rate was over 5\npercentage points higher in Canada than in the States. This is a startling difference. It represents\nabout 6.7 million additional individuals in the U.S. who could be in the labor force.\n\nIn a research report scheduled for public release tomorrow, I worked with current and former San\nFrancisco Fed staff to try to understand this gap.11 We found that it’s mostly due to differences for\nwomen: they account for about three-fourths, or 5 million, of that 6.7 million total. And it’s not a\nmatter of differences in educational attainment: the Canadian edge is generally evident across all\neducational groups.\n\n10\n11\n\nFurther discussion is provided in Daly (2018).\nDaly et al. (2018).\n\nPage 8 of 11\n\n\fWhy is there such a large gap in women’s participation rates across the two countries? We discuss\nsome tentative but compelling answers in our research note. Government subsidies for the cost of\nchildcare in Canada may play a role, supporting the return to work for parents—especially\nmothers—with young children.\nProbably more important, though, are Canada’s generous parental leave policies. Workers are\nassured of being able to return to their prior job, with the same compensation, after taking a\nprolonged parental leave—up to a year and a half in some provinces. They also receive payments\nthat replace much of their lost income during leave, funded out of the nation’s employment\ninsurance system. This system encourages people to return to jobs rather than drop out of the labor\nforce following the birth of children.\nNow I’m not advocating we adopt the Canadian system or recommending any particular policy. But\nthe comparison with Canada, as well as with other industrialized nations, shows that policy matters\nand that, with the right mix of skills and support, there’s meaningful potential for increasing U.S.\nworkforce participation.\nThe Fed can help by making sure that the economy continues to grow, creating work opportunities\nfor wide swaths of the population. But over the long term, it is equally important to develop more\nsupportive educational and family policies, so that individuals are encouraged to take advantage of\nthose opportunities.\nConclusion\nTo wrap up, the U.S. economy is in very good shape. Keeping it that way requires continuing on the\npath of consistent, thoughtful monetary policy. In conjunction with policies designed to encourage\nworkforce participation, this also may help boost our economy’s longer-term growth potential,\nthereby supporting economic advancement for all Americans.

WILLIAMS\nPresident and CEO\nFederal Reserve Bank of San Francisco\nTo the\nEconomic Club of Minnesota\nMinneapolis, Minnesota\nMay 15, 2018\nAS PREPARED FOR DELIVERY\nIntroduction\nGood afternoon, and thank you for the kind introduction. I know that here, at the\nEconomic Club of Minnesota, you regularly host Fed presidents, so you’re no\nstrangers to speeches on interest rates and monetary policy. Today I’m going to take\nadvantage of that fact and take a step back. Today I’m going to talk about where I see\n\nPage 1 of 11\n\n\finterest rates going, not just over the next few months, but over the next several years,\nand discuss the economic fundamentals driving the changes taking place.\nOne of the key factors that influences my thinking on monetary policy is something\ncalled r-star. Today I hope you’ll indulge me while I describe what r-star is, where it’s\nheaded, and how that affects the direction of interest rates.\nNow, I’ve already referred to interest rates and monetary policy several times. So\nbefore I go any further I should give the usual Fed disclaimer that the views I express\nare mine alone and do not necessarily reflect those of anyone else at the Minneapolis\nFed, the San Francisco Fed, the New York Fed, or the Federal Reserve System as a\nwhole!\n\nR-star and the new normal\nSo what is this r-star I keep referring to, and why is it so important when it comes to\nthinking about interest rates?\nR-star is what economists call the natural rate of interest; it’s the real interest rate\nexpected to prevail when the economy is at full strength. While a central bank like the\nFed sets short-term interest rates, r-star is a result of longer-term economic factors\nbeyond the influence of central banks and monetary policy.1\nSuch is my fascination with interest rates, that r-star is an area I’ve researched\nextensively. If by the end of this speech you share just a tenth of my passion for r-star,\nI’ll feel like I’ve done my job!\nConsistent with this definition, my discussion will focus on the longer-term r-star that will prevail over the next decade,\nin contrast to a shorter-run concept that may fluctuate from year to year depending on economic developments.\n1\n\nPage 2 of 11\n\n\fMy own view is that r-star today is around 0.5 percent. Assuming inflation is running\nat our goal of 2 percent, that means the typical, or normal short-term interest rate is\n2.5 percent.2 When put into a historical context, r-star stands at an incredibly low\nlevel—in fact, a full 2 percentage points below what a normal interest rate looked like\njust 20 years ago. This trend is not unique to the United States: Averaging across\nCanada, the euro area, Japan, and the United Kingdom, a measure of global r-star is a\nbit below 0.5 percent.3\nR-star matters a great deal, because it anchors where short-term interest rates will tend\nto be in the future. In a world of low r-star, policymakers, banks, businesses, and\nhouseholds all need to plan for lower interest rates than they’ve experienced in\ndecades past.\nRecently some economists and central bankers have pointed to signs that the fortunes\nof r-star are set to rise. I wish I could join in this optimism, but I don’t yet see\nconvincing evidence of such a shift. The longer-run drivers still point to a “new\nnormal” of a low r-star and relatively low interest rates.\n\nFor comparison, the median longer-run value of the federal funds rate in the Federal Open Market Committee’s\n(FOMC’s) most recent economic projections is 2.875 percent (Board of Governors 2018b).\n3 Holston, Laubach, and Williams (2017) and Fujiwara et al. (2016).\n2\n\nPage 3 of 11\n\n\fWhat drives the fortunes of r-star?\nI’ve already mentioned that r-star is driven by longer-run structural factors, beyond\nthe influence of central banks. But what are those factors, and how do they influence\nthe fortunes of r-star?\nThree key global developments have caused r-star to come down in a number of\ndeveloped economies over the past two decades: changes in demographics, a\nslowdown in productivity growth, and heightened demand for safe assets.4\nChanges in demographics affect r-star on a number of levels. We are living longer:\nOver the past three decades, life expectancy in developed economies has risen by\nnearly five years and is expected to keep rising.5 When people expect to live longer,\nthey tend to save more for retirement, and this increased saving puts downward\npressure on interest rates.6\nDespite the fact that we’re living longer, labor force growth in the United States has\nactually slowed, largely due to baby boomers retiring and a lower fertility rate. In fact,\nthe labor force is forecast to grow just ½ percent per year over the next decade, well\nbelow past trends.7 Fewer people joining the labor force means fewer people working,\nproducing, and consuming things, which leads to slower growth and less investment,\nwhich in turn drives r-star down.\nThe same thing is true of productivity growth, which has also slowed compared with\nearlier decades.8 In the 1990s and early 2000s, the explosion of the internet and\nSee Williams (2016, 2017) and references therein.\nData are from the United Nations (2017).\n6 Carvalho, Ferrero, and Nechio (2016) and Gagnon, Johannsen, and Lopez-Salido (2016).\n7 Congressional Budget Office (2018).\n8 Fernald (2016).\n4\n5\n\nPage 4 of 11\n\n\fcomputing power led to annual productivity gains averaging 2 to 3 percent.\nProductivity gains since the recession have generally hovered around 1 percent. I have\na sneaking suspicion it’s because we’re using all that technology to play Candy Crush,\ninstead of increasing productivity! But I don’t have the data to back that up.\nIn all seriousness, productivity growth is influenced by technological innovation,\nwhich is notoriously hard to predict. In my home state of California, the world\nappears to be reinvented every week, but if we look at data from the OECD, there’s\nno indication that we can expect a leap in productivity growth on an international\nscale. While I can hope we’re on the brink of another game-changing invention like the\ninternet, for the moment, the data indicate productivity growth is still stuck in low\ngear.\nThe third and final factor holding down r-star is the high global demand for safe\nassets we’ve seen develop over the past two decades. This has driven down the\nreturns on Treasury securities and safe short-term loans relative to those on riskier\nassets like corporate bonds and equities, and thereby depressed r-star.9\n\nA positive outlook\nAll this doom and gloom caused by demographics, productivity growth, and the\ndemand for safe assets may come as a surprise. We’re now in the second-longest\nexpansion in U.S. history, and like most people I feel very positive about the\neconomic outlook, here and abroad.\n\n9\n\nBernanke (2015) and Del Negro et al. (2017).\n\nPage 5 of 11\n\n\fU.S. GDP increased about 2.5 percent last year, the unemployment rate is the lowest\nwe’ve seen in 18 years, and inflation is nearing the Fed’s 2 percent target.\nThe latest inflation data show that the drop in inflation we saw in 2017 was\ntemporary. It is very reassuring to me, as I spent the latter part of last year making\npredictions that inflation would start to rise this year. And it’s always a relief when one\nof your predictions comes true!\nLooking ahead, I expect the expansion to continue, with growth averaging around 2.5\npercent over this year and the next.\nThere are a few tailwinds that account for this solid economic performance. These\ninclude strong financial conditions, solid global growth, and the fiscal stimulus. In\nfact, the International Monetary Fund recently reported that global growth registered\nan impressive 3.8 percent in 2017, and they expect it to be near 4 percent this year and\nnext.10\n\nThe optimism about r-star is (sadly) misplaced\nIt’s these strong tailwinds that are leading some people to believe that we’ll see r-star\nmove back up. But, as I said, this optimism is, sadly, misplaced.\nIt’s time to return to our trio of demographics, productivity growth, and the global\ndemand for safe assets.\n\n10\n\nInternational Monetary Fund (2018).\n\nPage 6 of 11\n\n\fWhen it comes to demographics, the thing I hear discussed is that the baby boomer\ngeneration is a peculiarity that will slowly work its way out of the data. That’s a polite\nway of saying that, once my generation has retired, labor force growth will return to\nthe speed of recent decades. But research by my colleagues at the San Francisco Fed\nreveals that our increased longevity and propensity to save are the key demographic\ndrivers keeping r-star low, and they’re not about to reverse.11\nPeople living longer and saving more are two trends I would like to see continue! But\nthey do both spell bad news for the fortunes of r-star.\nThe second thing I hear discussed is that there’s more cause for optimism around\nproductivity growth because of the fiscal stimulus and, more specifically, the tax cuts.\nIn principle, if businesses have a smaller tax burden, they’ll have a greater incentive to\ninvest in capital equipment and research and development, which will drive\nproductivity growth.\nAlthough I agree that lower tax rates on businesses should spur greater investment\nand productivity, the resulting effect on r-star is likely to be relatively modest. By my\nown calculations, we can expect the fiscal stimulus to increase r-star over the next\ndecade by no more than 0.25 percentage point. This modest effect is in part because\nthe tax cuts are front-loaded—that is, they have a larger effect on growth in the next\nfew years than in later ones.12\nIn addition, it’s important to remember that r-star is affected by global economic\nconditions and not just those in the United States. A bump in U.S. growth improves\n11\n12\n\nCarvalho, Ferrero, and Nechio (2017).\nMertens (2018).\n\nPage 7 of 11\n\n\fglobal growth, but if other countries don’t follow suit, the effect on r-star will be\nrelatively modest.\nThe third leading factor in terms of a rising r-star is the demand for safe assets. The\ntheoretical argument that, with such strong economic conditions, we should see the\nappetite for riskier investments increase, pushing up interest rates overall, makes\nsense. But that’s not what’s played out in the data, at least so far.\nThese three issues—demographics, productivity growth, and the demand for safe\nassets—all point to an r-star that’s set to hold its position low in the sky for quite\nsome time.\n\nMonetary policy\nIf you’re not as passionate as I am about r-star at this point, listen up, because things\nare about to get more interesting. I’m going to discuss what all this means for\nmonetary policy and the path of interest rates.\nFollowing the global financial crisis, the Fed cut interest rates and kept them low to\nstimulate the economy and get it back on its feet. Now that the expansion is well\nunder way, we’re in the process of normalizing monetary policy and bringing interest\nrates back up. Based on the center of the distribution of projections from our March\nmeeting, the Federal Open Market Committee has indicated a total of three to four\n\nPage 8 of 11\n\n\frate increases this year and further gradual rate increases over the next two years will\nbe appropriate.13 I view this to be the right direction for monetary policy.\nAt our most recent meeting at the beginning of May we decided not to change the\nfederal funds rate, consistent with our gradual pace of policy normalization.14\nBut even as we raise rates, I’m conscious that the fundamental drivers that govern rstar are lower than we’ve seen in the past. With a new normal for short-term rates of\naround 2½ percent, interest rates are likely to remain low relative to historical\nexperience.\n\nConclusion\nIn conclusion, it’s important to distinguish between the current strong economic\nconditions and the key longer-run drivers underpinning interest rates. I am always\nkeeping a close eye on both the short-term economic outlook and the longer-term\nfactors that define the more fundamental changes taking place. I don’t have a crystal\nball, so it’s always the numbers that inform my opinion. For the moment, r-star\ncontinues to shine brightly, guiding monetary policy, but hold steady, low on the\nhorizon.\n\n13\n14\n\nBoard of Governors (2018b).\nBoard of Governors (2018a)\n\nPage 9 of 11\n\n\fReferences\nBernanke, Ben S. 2015. “Why Are Interest Rates So Low, Part 3: The Global Savings Glut.” Ben\nBernanke’s Blog, Brookings, April 1. https://www.brookings.edu/blog/benbernanke/2015/04/01/why-are-interest-rates-so-low-part-3-the-global-savings-glut/\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. 2018a. “Federal Reserve issues FOMC\nstatement.” Press release, May 2.\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20180502a.htm\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. 2018b. “FOMC Projections materials,\naccessible version.” March 21.\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomcprojtabl20180321.htm\nCarvalho, Carlos, Andrea Ferrero, and Fernanda Nechio. 2016. “Demographics and Real Interest\nRates: Inspecting the Mechanism.” European Economic Review 88, pp. 208–226.\nCarvalho, Carlos, Andrea Ferrero, and Fernanda Nechio. 2017. “Demographic Transition and Low\nU.S. Interest Rates.” FRBSF Economic Letter 2017-27 (September 25).\nhttp://www.frbsf.org/economic-research/publications/economicletter/2017/september/demographic-transition-and-low-us-interest-rates/\nCongressional Budget Office. 2018. “The Budget and Economic Outlook: 2018 to 2028.” Report,\nApril. https://www.cbo.gov/publication/53651\nDel Negro, Marco, Domenico Giannone, Marc P.

            "content": "For release on delivery\n8:00 a.m. EST\nNovember 29, 2017\n\nStatement by\nJanet L. Yellen\nChair\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nbefore the\nJoint Economic Committee\nU.S. Congress\nNovember 29, 2017\n\n\fChairman Tiberi, Ranking Member Heinrich, and members of the Committee, I\nappreciate the opportunity to testify before you today. I will discuss the current economic\noutlook and monetary policy.\nThe Economic Outlook\nThe U.S. economy has strengthened further this year. Smoothing through the volatility\ncaused by the recent hurricanes, job gains averaged about 170,000 per month from January\nthrough October, a somewhat slower pace than last year but still above the range that we\nestimate will be consistent with absorbing new entrants to the labor force in coming years. With\nthe job gains this year, 17 million more Americans are employed now than eight years ago.\nMeanwhile, the unemployment rate, which stood at 4.1 percent in October, has fallen\n0.6 percentage point since the turn of the year and is nearly 6 percentage points below its peak in\n2010. In addition, the labor force participation rate has changed little, on net, in recent years,\nwhich is another indication of improving conditions in the labor market, given the downward\npressure on the participation rate associated with an aging population. However, despite these\nlabor market gains, wage growth has remained relatively modest. Unemployment rates for\nAfrican Americans and Hispanics, which tend to be more sensitive to overall economic\nconditions than those for whites, have moved down, on net, over the past year and are now near\nlevels last seen before the recession. That said, it remains the case that unemployment rates for\nthese minority groups are noticeably higher than for the nation overall.\nMeanwhile, economic growth appears to have stepped up from its subdued pace early in\nthe year. After having risen at an annual rate of just 1-1/4 percent in the first quarter, U.S.\ninflation-adjusted gross domestic product (GDP) is currently estimated to have increased at a\n3 percent pace in both the second and third quarters despite the disruptions to economic activity\n\n\f-2in the third quarter caused by the recent hurricanes. Moreover, the economic expansion is\nincreasingly broad based across sectors as well as across much of the global economy. I expect\nthat, with gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary policy, the economy will continue to\nexpand and the job market will strengthen somewhat further, supporting faster growth in wages\nand incomes. Although asset valuations are high by historical standards, overall vulnerabilities\nin the financial sector appear moderate, as the banking system is well capitalized and broad\nmeasures of leverage and credit growth remain contained.\nEven with a step-up in growth of economic activity and a stronger labor market, inflation\nhas continued to run below the 2 percent rate that the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC)\njudges most consistent with our congressional mandate to foster both maximum employment and\nprice stability. Increases in gasoline prices in the aftermath of the hurricanes temporarily pushed\nup measures of overall consumer price inflation, but inflation for items other than food and\nenergy has remained surprisingly subdued. The total price index for personal consumption\nexpenditures increased 1.6 percent over the 12 months ending in September, while the core price\nindex, which excludes energy and food prices, rose just 1.3 percent over the same period, about\n1/2 percentage point slower than a year earlier. In my view, the recent lower readings on\ninflation likely reflect transitory factors. As these transitory factors fade, I anticipate that\ninflation will stabilize around 2 percent over the medium term. However, it is also possible that\nthis year’s low inflation could reflect something more persistent. Indeed, inflation has been\nbelow the Committee’s 2 percent objective for most of the past five years. Against this\nbackdrop, the FOMC has indicated that it intends to carefully monitor actual and expected\nprogress toward our inflation goal.\n\n\f-3Although the economy and the jobs market are generally quite strong, real GDP growth\nhas been disappointingly slow during this expansion relative to earlier decades. One key reason\nfor this slowdown has been the retirement of the older members of the baby-boom generation\nand hence the slower growth of the labor force. Another key reason has been the unusually\nsluggish pace of productivity growth in recent years. To generate a sustained boost in economic\ngrowth without causing inflation that is too high, we will need to address these underlying\ncauses. In this regard, the Congress might consider policies that encourage business investment\nand capital formation, improve the nation’s infrastructure, raise the quality of our educational\nsystem, and support innovation and the adoption of new technologies.\nMonetary Policy\nI will turn now to the implications of recent economic developments and the outlook for\nmonetary policy. With ongoing strengthening in labor market conditions and an outlook for\ninflation to return to 2 percent over the next couple of years, the FOMC has continued to\ngradually reduce policy accommodation. The Committee raised the target range for the federal\nfunds rate by 1/4 percentage point at both our March and June meetings, with the range now\nstanding at 1 to 1-1/4 percent. And, in October, the Committee began its balance sheet\nnormalization program, which will gradually and predictably reduce our securities holdings. The\nCommittee set limits on the pace of balance sheet reduction; those limits should guard against\noutsized moves in interest rates and other potential market strains. Indeed, there has been little,\nif any, market effect associated with the balance sheet runoff to date. We do not foresee a need\nto alter the balance sheet program, but, as we said in June, we would be prepared to resume\nreinvestments if a material deterioration in the economic outlook were to warrant a sizable\nreduction in the federal funds rate.\n\n\f-4Changes to the target range for the federal funds rate will continue to be the Committee’s\nprimary means of adjusting the stance of monetary policy. At our meeting earlier this month, we\ndecided to maintain the existing target range for the federal funds rate. We continue to expect\nthat gradual increases in the federal funds rate will be appropriate to sustain a healthy labor\nmarket and stabilize inflation around the FOMC’s 2 percent objective. That expectation is based\non the view that the current level of the federal funds rate remains somewhat below its neutral\nlevel--that is, the rate that is neither expansionary nor contractionary and keeps the economy\noperating on an even keel. The neutral rate currently appears to be quite low by historical\nstandards, implying that the federal funds rate would not have to rise much further to get to a\nneutral policy stance. If the neutral level rises somewhat over time, as most FOMC participants\nexpect, additional gradual rate hikes would likely be appropriate over the next few years to\nsustain the economic expansion.\nOf course, policy is not on a preset course; the appropriate path for the federal funds rate\nwill depend on the economic outlook as informed by incoming data. The Committee has noted\nthat it will carefully monitor actual and expected inflation developments relative to its symmetric\ninflation goal. More generally, in determining the timing and size of future interest rate\nadjustments, the Committee will take into account a wide range of information, including\nmeasures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations,\nand readings on financial and international developments.\nThank you. I would be pleased to answer your questions.\n\n\f"

Bernanke) the\n2017 Paul H. Douglas Award for Ethics in Government\nfrom\nInstitute of Government and Public Affairs at the University of Illinois\nWashington, D.C.\n\nNovember 7, 2017\n\n\fThank you for the honor of sharing this award with such a worthy person, my\nfriend and former colleague Ben Bernanke, and also for the honor of being associated\nwith the exemplary life and legacy of Paul Douglas.\nSen. Douglas’s contributions to ethics in government are an important aspect of\nthat legacy, but since Ben and I are the first economists to win this award, I would also\nlike to give due credit to Professor Douglas for his contributions to economics.\nWorking with the mathematician Charles Cobb, Douglas gathered data and\ncreated a statistical model that advanced economists’ understanding of the relative\ncontributions to production made by capital and labor. This work demonstrated many of\nthe methods that economists would come to use and continue to use to this day. Douglas\nconstructed empirical measures of key economic concepts. He then employed what were,\nfor the time, advanced statistical techniques to analyze these data, thereby shedding light\non a basic economic relationship. As one recent commentator put it, work such as\nDouglas’s was part of “a growing literature , , , [that] played an important role in shaping\nthe approach to combining statistical methods and economic theory that would become\nthe standard econometric practice in the later decades of the 20th century.” 1\nBut, of course, Paul Douglas was much more than an economist. From an early\nage, he always seemed to be the man in the middle, seen by the two sides of a dispute as\nintelligent, knowledgeable, and impartial enough to be trusted to seek a solution. He\nmediated labor disputes and advised local government officials in Illinois. He also\nhelped governors in Pennsylvania and New York develop what became Social Security,\nunemployment insurance, and the idea of publicly owned power utilities. After losing his\n\n1\n\nSee p. 228 in Jeff Biddle (2012), “Retrospectives: The Introduction of the Cobb-Douglas Regression,”\nJournal of Economic Perspectives, vol. 26 (Spring), pp. 223-36.\n\n\f-2first election for the U.S. Senate in 1942, at the age of 49 he enlisted in the U.S. Marines\nand was awarded a Bronze Star and Purple Heart for his service in the Pacific. Later,\nafter he was elected to the Senate, Douglas was a champion of consumer protection laws,\nincluding the 1968 Truth in Lending Act, and was a leading supporter of civil rights\nlegislation.\nOne of Paul Douglas’s most important achievements in public life was to promote\nethics in government. He was raised with a strong sense of right and wrong and was\nheavily influenced by the philosopher John Stuart Mill to believe that ethical behavior\nwas also an eminently practical approach to life. As a college professor, he entered\npublic life in Chicago in the 1920s somewhat reluctantly to fight the spectacular political\nand commercial corruption that was strangling the city. Once elected to office, he faced\nthe challenge of how to act ethically when corruption was so universal that the city’s\naldermen were expected to funnel large sums to their constituents, based on the\npresumption that all politicians were “on the take.” If he refused bribes and then had no\nmoney to hand out, how would he convince people that he wasn’t simply refusing to\nshare?\nThe key was transparency and communication. Everyone who asked for a large\npayment was handed a mimeographed statement titled “Please Help Me to Be an Honest\nAlderman.” At first, the public, inured to corruption, either disbelieved him or thought\nhim a sucker for refusing to take bribes. But over time, Douglas’s stand changed both the\ndemands made by supplicants and his constituents’ expectations for ethical behavior by a\ngovernment official.\n\n\f-3Similarly, in 1939, Paul Douglas was one of the first public officials in America\nto publish a full accounting of his personal finances. In his memoir, Douglas admits that\nthis and other ethical rules he imposed on himself were often a nuisance and, in some\ncases, probably went further than needed to demonstrate his honesty. But he believed\nthat the public’s trust was so fundamental to the effectiveness of government that such\nsteps were appropriate. As a senator, he continued to publish his finances and observed\nstrict limits on the value of personal gifts he received from those seeking benefits from\nhim as a public official. He strongly believed that these gift limits also made him more\neffective as a public servant, and he campaigned for legislation that ultimately led to the\nwidespread requirement of financial disclosure and limits on accepting gifts.\nI share Paul Douglas’s view that behaving ethically is both the right thing to do\nand, in practical terms, helps maintain the trust the public places in those who act on its\nbehalf. The Federal Reserve’s very effectiveness in setting monetary policy depends on\nthe public’s assured confidence that we act only in its interest. We must act ethically, and\nwe must demonstrate our ethical standards in ways that leave little room for doubt.\nI am grateful to share this award with Ben, and I am even more grateful for the\nexample Paul Douglas set for ethics in government that has guided countless public\nofficials since his day and also shaped the public’s expectation that its leaders will put the\npublic’s interests first.\n\n\f"

            "content": "For release on delivery\n7:30 p.m. EDT\nOctober 20, 2017\n\nA Challenging Decade and a Question for the Future\n\nRemarks by\nJanet L. Yellen\nChair\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat the\n2017 Herbert Stein Memorial Lecture\nNational Economists Club\nWashington, D.C.\n\nOctober 20, 2017\n\n\fI am delighted to address the National Economists Club, and I am also honored on\nthis occasion to be associated with Herb Stein, whose public service and\nscholarship--characterized by careful analysis, clear-eyed pragmatism, and sharp wit-exemplified the best in our profession. Herb was willing to consider new ideas and new\napproaches to government policy, and that openness fits with the subject of my remarks\ntoday. Namely, I will discuss the unconventional monetary policy tools used by the\nFederal Reserve since the start of the financial crisis and Great Recession and the role\nthat those tools may play in addressing future economic challenges.\nNearly 10 years ago, with our nation mired in its worst economic and financial\ncrisis since the Great Depression, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC)\nconfronted a key challenge to the pursuit of its congressionally mandated goals of\nmaximum employment and price stability: how to support a weakening U.S. economy\nonce our main conventional policy tool, the federal funds rate, had been lowered to\nessentially zero. Addressing that problem eventually led to a second challenge: how to\nensure that we could scale back monetary policy accommodation in an orderly fashion\nonce it was no longer needed. Failure to meet either challenge would have significantly\ncompromised our ability to foster maximum employment and price stability, leading to\nserious consequences for the livelihoods of millions of Americans.\nI will argue today that we have met the first challenge and have made good\nprogress to date in meeting the second. Thanks in part to the monetary policy\naccommodation provided in the aftermath of the crisis--especially through enhanced\nforward rate guidance and large-scale asset purchases--the U.S. economy has made great\nstrides. Indeed, with the economy now operating near maximum employment and\n\n\f-2inflation expected to rise to the FOMC’s 2 percent objective over the next couple of\nyears, the FOMC has been scaling back the accommodation provided in response to the\nGreat Recession. In no small part because of our authority to pay interest on excess\nreserves, the process of removing policy accommodation is working well.\nAfter discussing a few issues related to our recent decision to start reducing the\nsize of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet, I will address a key question: What is the\nappropriate future role of the unconventional policy tools that we deployed to address the\nGreat Recession? While I believe that influencing short-term interest rates should\ncontinue to be our primary monetary policy lever in normal times, our unconventional\npolicy tools will likely be needed again should some future economic downturn drive\nshort-term interest rates back to their effective lower bound. Indeed, empirical analysis\nsuggests that the neutral federal funds rate--defined as the level of the federal funds rate\nthat is neither expansionary nor contractionary when the economy is operating near its\npotential--is much lower than in previous decades. Consequently, the probability that\nshort-term interest rates may need to be reduced to their effective lower bound at some\npoint is uncomfortably high, even in the absence of a major financial and economic crisis.\nI will return to the question about the future of our various policy tools, but first I\nwould like to review our experience this decade, which I view as instructive for\naddressing that question.\nMeeting the Challenge of Providing Additional Accommodation\nA substantial body of evidence suggests that the U.S. economy is much stronger\ntoday than it would have been without the unconventional monetary policy tools\ndeployed by the Federal Reserve in response to the Great Recession. Two key tools were\n\n\f-3large-scale asset purchases and forward guidance about our intentions for the future path\nof short-term interest rates. The rationale for those tools was straightforward: Given our\ninability to meaningfully lower short-term interest rates after they reached near-zero in\nlate 2008, the FOMC used increasingly explicit forward rate guidance and asset\npurchases to apply downward pressure on longer-term interest rates, which were still well\nabove zero.\nLonger-term interest rates reflect, in part, financial market participants’\nexpectations of the future path of short-term interest rates. As a result, FOMC\ncommunications that affect those expectations--such as the enhanced forward rate\nguidance provided in our post-meeting statements in the aftermath of the Great\nRecession--can affect longer-term interest rates. 1 In addition, longer-term interest rates\ninclude a term premium, which is the compensation demanded by investors for bearing\nthe interest rate risk associated with longer-term securities. When the Federal Reserve\nbuys longer-term securities in the open market, the remaining stock of securities available\nfor purchase by the public declines, which pushes the prices of those securities up and\nthus depresses their yields by lowering the term premiums embedded in those yields. 2\nSeveral studies have found that our forward rate guidance and asset purchases did\nappreciably reduce longer-term interest rates. 3\n\n1\n\nBefore the Great Recession, the FOMC occasionally provided forward rate guidance, but that guidance\nwas typically confined to a relatively short horizon.\n2\nIn addition to depressing term premiums, large-scale asset purchases by the Federal Reserve can lower\nlonger-term yields if those purchases are perceived by the public as a signal that short-term interest rates\nare likely to remain lower for longer than previously anticipated.\n3\nSee, for instance, Eric T. Swanson and John C. Williams (2014), “Measuring the Effect of the Zero Lower\nBound on Medium- and Longer-Term Interest Rates,” American Economic Review, vol. 104 (October),\npp. 3154-85; Joseph Gagnon, Matthew Raskin, Julie Remache, and Brian Sack (2011), “The Financial\nMarket Effects of the Federal Reserve’s Large-Scale Asset Purchases,” International Journal of Central\nBanking, vol. 7 (March), pp. 3-43, www.ijcb.org/journal/ijcb11q1a1.pdf; and Stefania D’Amico, William\n\n\f-4The FOMC’s goal in lowering longer-term interest rates was to help the U.S.\neconomy recover from the recession and stem the disinflationary forces that emerged\nfrom it. Some have suggested that the slow pace of the economic recovery proves that\nour unconventional policy tools were ineffective. However, one should recognize that\nthe recovery could have been much slower in the absence of our unconventional tools.\nIndeed, the evidence strongly suggests that forward rate guidance and securities\npurchases--by substantially lowering borrowing costs for millions of American families\nand businesses and making overall financial conditions more accommodative--did help\nspur consumption and business spending, lower the unemployment rate, and stave off\ndisinflationary pressures. 4\nOther central banks also deployed unconventional policy tools in the years that\nfollowed the financial crisis. 5 Evidence accumulated from their experience also supports\nthe notion that these tools have helped stimulate economic activity in their countries after\ntheir short-term interest rates were lowered to near-zero--and, in some cases, even below\nzero. 6\n\nEnglish, David Lopez-Salido, and Edward Nelson (2012), “The Federal Reserve’s Large-Scale Asset\nPurchase Programmes: Rationale and Effects,” Economic Journal, vol. 122 (November), pp. F415-46.\n4\nSee, for instance, Eric M.

The unemployment rate had dropped\nto 6 percent by midyear--well below its Great Recession peak of 10 percent--and other\nmeasures of labor market conditions were also showing significant improvement. In\naddition, inflation, as measured by the change in the price index for personal\nconsumption expenditures, had reached about 1-3/4 percent by mid-2014 after hovering\naround 1 percent in the fall of 2013. Reflecting that progress, the Federal Reserve’s\nfocus was shifting from providing additional monetary policy accommodation to scaling\nit back. 7 A key question for the FOMC then was how to reduce the degree of\naccommodation in the context of a vastly expanded Federal Reserve balance sheet.\nOne possible approach was to start by reducing the Federal Reserve’s securities\nholdings while short-term interest rates remained at the lower bound. We could allow\nsecurities to roll off the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet and even sell securities, thereby\nputting upward pressure on long-term rates while calibrating the pace and configuration\nof the reduction in our holdings as warranted by our maximum employment and price\nstability objectives. Eventually, once our securities holdings had shrunk sufficiently, the\nFOMC could start nudging up its short-term interest rate target.\nOne problem of this “last in, first out” approach was that the FOMC does not have\nany experience in calibrating the pace and composition of asset redemptions and sales to\nactual and prospective economic conditions. Indeed, as the so-called taper tantrum of\n\n7\n\nSee Janet L. Yellen (2017), “From Adding Accommodation to Scaling It Back,” speech delivered at the\nExecutives’ Club of Chicago, Chicago, Ill., March 3,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/yellen20170303a.htm.\n\n\f-62013 illustrated, even talk of prospective changes in our securities holdings can elicit\nunexpected abrupt changes in financial conditions.\nGiven the lack of experience with reducing our asset holdings to scale back\nmonetary policy accommodation and the need to carefully calibrate the removal of\naccommodation, the FOMC opted to allow changes in the Federal Reserve’s securities\nholdings to play a secondary role in the Committee’s normalization strategy. Rather than\nbalance sheet shrinkage, the FOMC decided that its primary tool for scaling back\nmonetary policy accommodation would be influencing short-term interest rates.\nAs we explained in our “normalization principles” issued in September 2014, the\nFOMC decided to maintain the overall size of the Federal Reserve’s securities holdings at\nan elevated level until sometime after the FOMC had begun to raise short-term interest\nrates. 8 Once normalization of the level of the federal funds rate was “well under way”\nand the Committee judged that the economic expansion was strong enough that further\nincreases in short-term interest rates were likely to be warranted, the FOMC would\ngradually and predictably reduce the size of the balance sheet by allowing the Federal\nReserve’s securities holdings to “run off”--that is, we would allow our balance sheet to\nshrink passively by not reinvesting all of the principal payments from our securities. 9\n\n8\n\nInformation on the FOMC’s Policy Normalization Principles and Plans is available on the Board’s\nwebsite at https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/policy-normalization.htm.\n9\nThe FOMC announced in December 2015 that it anticipated maintaining its reinvestment policy until\nnormalization of the level of the federal funds rate was “well under way.” That announcement is available\non the Board’s website at https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/monetary20151216a1.pdf.\nMore recently, in June 2017, the FOMC provided additional details regarding its approach to reduce the\nFederal Reserve’s securities holdings, indicating that once the balance sheet normalization plan began,\nprincipal payments received from securities held by the Federal Reserve would be reinvested only to the\nextent that those payments exceeded certain monthly caps. The caps would rise gradually but would\nremain in place during the normalization process. The June 2017 announcement, Addendum to the Policy\nNormalization Principles and Plans, is available on the Board’s website at\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/FOMC_PolicyNormalization.20170613.pdf.\n\n\f-7One advantage of the FOMC’s chosen approach to scaling back accommodation\nis that both the FOMC and the public have decades of experience with adjustments in\nshort-term interest rates in response to changes in economic conditions. Nonetheless, the\npost-crisis environment presented a new test to the FOMC’s ability to influence shortterm interest rates.\nBefore the crisis, the FOMC could raise the federal funds rate--the rate at which\nbanks with excess reserves lend to banks with a reserve need--by removing a small\namount of reserves from the banking system. That would translate into a higher federal\nfunds rate because reserves were relatively scarce to begin with. The intuition was\nsimple: The FOMC would signal that it was going to tighten conditions in the reserve\nmarket, and the cost of obtaining reserves in the market--the federal funds rate--would\nrise. Other market interest rates would then increase accordingly.\nAfter the crisis, however, reserves were plentiful because the Federal Reserve\nfunded its large-scale asset purchases through adding reserves to the system--crediting\nthe bank accounts of those who were selling assets to the Fed. Moreover, in light of the\nFOMC’s decision not to sell the longer-term securities it acquired, reserves were likely to\nremain plentiful for the foreseeable future. Consequently, when the time came to remove\naccommodation, a key question for the Committee was how to raise the federal funds rate\nin an environment of abundant reserves. 10 An important part of the answer to that\nquestion came in the Federal Reserve’s authority to pay interest on excess reserves. The\n\n10\n\nFor a discussion of the pre- and post-crisis frameworks for implementing short-term interest rate\ndecisions, see Jane E. Ihrig, Ellen E. Meade, and Gretchen C. Weinbach (2015), “Rewriting Monetary\nPolicy 101: What’s the Fed’s Preferred Post-Crisis Approach to Raising Interest Rates?” Journal of\nEconomic Perspectives, vol. 29 (Fall), pp. 177-98,\nhttp://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/jep.29.4.177.\n\n\f-8Congress granted the Federal Reserve that authority in 2006, to become effective in 2011.\nHowever, in the fall of 2008, the Congress moved up the effective date to October 2008.\nHaving authority to pay interest on excess reserves means that the Federal\nReserve can influence the federal funds rate and other short-term interest rates regardless\nof the amount of excess reserves in the banking system. The mechanics of the new\nframework are straightforward: Banks will generally only provide short-term funding at\nan interest rate around or above what they could earn at the Fed. As a result, if the\nFederal Reserve raised the rate it paid, other short-term lending rates would likely rise as\nwell. 11 This new approach for raising short-term interest rates is working well: Since\nDecember 2015, we have raised the interest paid on excess reserves and the target range\nfor the federal funds rate by 100 basis points, and the effective federal funds rate has\nrisen accordingly. 12\nA Closer Look at Our Balance Sheet Strategy\nIn light of our recent decision to start reducing our securities holdings this month,\nI would like to discuss a few aspects of our balance sheet strategy. 13 The FOMC\nanticipated that its decision to maintain the size of the Federal Reserve’s securities\n\n11\n\nThe Federal Reserve created supplementary tools to be used as needed to help strengthen its influence\nover short-term interest rates when reserves are plentiful. For instance, the overnight reverse repurchase\nagreement facility allows a variety of counterparties, including eligible money market funds, governmentsponsored enterprises, broker-dealers, and depository institutions to invest funds overnight with the Federal\nReserve at a rate determined by the FOMC.\n12\nFor a discussion of how increases in the FOMC’s target range for the federal funds rate have transmitted\nto other short-term interest rates, see Alyssa Anderson, Jane Ihrig, Mary-Frances Styczynski, and Gretchen\nC. Weinbach (2017), “How Have the Fed’s Three Rate Hikes Passed through to Selected Short-Term\nInterest Rates?” FEDS Notes (Washington: Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, June 2),\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/notes/feds-notes/how-have-the-feds-three-rate-hikes-passedthrough-to-selected-short-term-interest-rates-20170602.htm.\n13\nThe FOMC’s announcement of the beginning of implementation of the balance sheet normalization plan\nis available on the Board’s website; see Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2017),\n“Federal Reserve Issues FOMC Statement,” press release, September 20,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/monetary20170920a1.pdf.\n\n\f-9holdings at an elevated level until sometime after the beginning of rate hikes would keep\nsome downward pressure on longer-term interest rates well after the end of its asset\npurchase programs. Although estimates of the effect of our securities holdings on longerterm interest rates are subject to uncertainty, a recent study reported that the Federal\nReserve’s securities holdings were reducing the term premium on the 10-year Treasury\nyield by roughly 1 percentage point at the end of 2016. 14\nThe guidance that the FOMC would eventually start a gradual and predictable\nreduction of the Federal Reserve’s securities holdings implied that the downward\npressure on longer-term yields would likely diminish over time as financial market\nparticipants came to expect that the start of balance sheet normalization was nearing.\nIndeed, with that process now under way, it is likely that our securities holdings are now\ndepressing the term premium on the 10-year yield by somewhat less than the\n1 percentage point estimate reported for late last year.\nSeveral factors suggest that the downward pressure on term premiums exerted by\nour securities holdings is likely to diminish only gradually as our holdings shrink. For\ninstance, as I have already noted, our intention to reduce our balance sheet by reducing\nreinvestment of repayments of principal on our holdings--rather than selling assets--has\nbeen well communicated for several years now. As a result, we do not anticipate a jump\nin term premiums as our balance sheet reduction plan gets under way. In addition, the\n\n14\n\nSee Brian Bonis, Jane Ihrig, and Min Wei (2017), “Projected Evolution of the SOMA Portfolio and the\n10-Year Treasury Term Premium Effect,” FEDS Notes (Washington: Board of Governors of the Federal\nReserve System, September 22), https://doi.org/10.17016/2380-7172.2081.\n\n\f- 10 maturity distribution of our securities holdings is such that it will take some years for the\nsize of our holdings to normalize via runoff. 15\nThe judgment that the downward pressure on term premiums will decline only\ngradually as we reduce the size of our balance sheet stands in sharp contrast to evidence\nsuggesting that this pressure built up rather quickly when we were expanding our balance\nsheet. To understand this contrast, remember that, unlike our plan to shrink our balance\nsheet, the various phases of our asset purchases had, to differing degrees, an element of\nsurprise, with asset purchase announcements occasionally leaving a distinct imprint on\nthe path of longer-term yields. Moreover, each of our asset purchase programs resulted\nin a rapid increase in our securities holdings during a relatively short period, whereas the\nnormalization process will play out gradually over many years.\nI have focused thus far on the likely response of term premiums to our balance\nsheet reduction plan. Let me turn my attention briefly to the likely response of longerterm yields, which, as I have noted, reflect both a term premium component and\nexpectations of the future path of short-term interest rates. While the available evidence\npoints to a strong reaction of longer-term yields to our asset purchases, it is conceivable\nthat those yields will react much more modestly to our balance sheet reduction plan.\nConsider, for instance, a hypothetical scenario in which the FOMC has decided\nnot to rely on balance sheet reduction to scale back accommodation, choosing instead to\ncontinue to reinvest indefinitely all principal payments from the Federal Reserve’s\n\n15\n\nMoreover, as the FOMC announced in June, the Committee decided to cap the monthly run-off in the\nFederal Reserve’s securities holdings, making the balance sheet normalization process even more\npredictable and gradual. The FOMC’s announcement is available on the Board’s website; see Board of\nGovernors of the Federal Reserve System (2017), “FOMC Issues Addendum to the Policy Normalization\nPrinciples and Plans,” press release, June 14,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20170614c.htm.\n\n\f- 11 securities holdings. If financial market participants perceived no change in the economic\noutlook and no intention on the part of the FOMC to alter the overall stance of monetary\npolicy, the FOMC’s inclination to leave the size of the balance sheet unchanged would be\ntaken as an indication that the FOMC would instead rely more on increases in short-term\ninterest rates to scale back accommodation, resulting in a faster pace of short-term\ninterest hikes. On net, longer-term yields may be little affected by this hypothetical\nscenario: While the decreased emphasis on balance sheet reduction would depress term\npremiums and hold longer-term yields lower, the expected faster pace of short-term\ninterest rate increases would push longer-term yields higher. 16\nA Key Question for the Future\nAs the financial crisis and Great Recession fade into the past and the stance of\nmonetary policy gradually returns to normal, a natural question concerns the possible\nfuture role of the unconventional policy tools we deployed after the onset of the crisis.\nMy colleagues on the FOMC and I believe that, whenever possible, influencing shortterm interest rates by targeting the federal funds rate should be our primary tool. As I\nhave already noted, we have a long track record using this tool to pursue our statutory\ngoals. In contrast, we have much more limited experience with using our securities\nholdings for that purpose.\nWhere does this assessment leave our unconventional policy tools? I believe their\ndeployment should be considered again if our conventional tool reaches its limit--that is,\n\n16\n\nIn contrast, when the Federal Reserve was purchasing assets, short-term interest rates were at their\neffective lower bound, and they were expected to remain there for the foreseeable future. As a result,\ndecisions to buy additional assets--and the resulting additional downward pressure on term premiums--were\nnot offset by expectations of a higher path for short-term interest rates. The end result was that there was\ngreater potential for asset purchases to have a discernible effect on longer-term yields in the years\nimmediately following the financial crisis than in current circumstances.\n\n\f- 12 when the federal funds rate has reached its effective lower bound and the U.S. economy\nstill needs further monetary policy accommodation.\nDoes this mean that it will take another Great Recession for our unconventional\ntools to be used again? Not necessarily. Recent studies suggest that the neutral level of\nthe federal funds rate appears to be much lower than it was in previous decades. 17\nIndeed, most FOMC participants now assess the longer-run value of the neutral federal\nfunds rate as only 2-3/4 percent or so, compared with around 4-1/4 percent just a few\nyears ago. 18 With a low neutral federal funds rate, there will typically be less scope for\nthe FOMC to reduce short-term interest rates in response to an economic downturn,\nraising the possibility that we may need to resort again to enhanced forward rate guidance\nand asset purchases to provide needed accommodation. 19\nOf course, substantial uncertainty surrounds any estimates of the neutral level of\nshort-term interest rates. In this regard, there is an important asymmetry to consider. If\nthe neutral rate turns out to be significantly higher than we currently estimate, it is less\n\n17\n\nSee, for instance, James D. Hamilton, Ethan S. Harris, Jan Hatzius, and Kenneth D.

In contrast, if the\nneutral rate is as low as we estimate or even lower, we will be glad to have our\nunconventional tools in our toolkit.\nThe bottom line is that we must recognize that our unconventional tools might\nhave to be used again. If we are indeed living in a low-neutral-rate world, a significantly\nless severe economic downturn than the Great Recession might be sufficient to drive\nshort-term interest rates back to their effective lower bound.\nConclusion\nLet me conclude with a brief summary. As a result of the Great Recession, the\nFederal Reserve has confronted two key challenges over the past several years: One, the\nFOMC had to provide additional policy accommodation after short-term interest rates\nreached their effective lower bound; and two, subsequently, as we made progress toward\nthe achievement of our mandate, we had to start scaling back that accommodation in the\npresence of a vastly expanded Federal Reserve balance sheet.\nToday I highlighted two points about the FOMC’s experience with those\nchallenges. First, the monetary policy tools that the Federal Reserve deployed in the\nimmediate aftermath of the crisis--explicit forward rate guidance, large-scale asset\npurchases, and the payment of interest on excess reserves--have helped us overcome\nthese challenges.\nSecond, in light of evidence suggesting that the neutral level of short-term interest\nrates is significantly lower than it was in previous decades, the likelihood that future\nmonetary policymakers will have to confront those two challenges again is\nuncomfortably high. For this reason, we must keep our unconventional policy tools\n\n\f- 14 ready to be deployed again should short-term interest rates return to their effective lower\nbound.\n\n\f"

Yellen\nChair\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\nCommunity Banking in the 21st Century\nFifth Annual Community Banking Research and Policy Conference\ncosponsored by the Federal Reserve System and Conference of State Bank Supervisors\nFederal Reserve Bank of St. Louis\nSt. Louis, Missouri\n\nOctober 4, 2017\n\n\fI am very glad to welcome everyone here to this conference sponsored by the\nFederal Reserve System and the Conference of State Bank Supervisors. Since the first of\nthese gatherings five years ago, this research and policy conference has established itself\nas an important event where industry leaders, academics, and supervisors discuss the\nlatest research and exchange ideas about promoting a healthy and growing community\nbanking industry.\nAll of us share an interest in seeing that community banks continue their vital role\nin their customers’ lives and in a strong and stable U.S. financial system. The Fed has\nbeen working hard to ensure that its regulation and supervision of banks are tailored\nappropriately to the size, complexity, and role different institutions play in the financial\nsystem. For community banks, which by and large avoided the risky business practices\nthat contributed to the financial crisis, we have been focused on making sure that muchneeded improvements to regulation and supervision since the crisis are appropriate and\nnot unduly burdensome.\nOne way we are doing this is through the regulatory review required by the\nEconomic Growth and Regulatory Paperwork Reduction Act, known as EGRPRA. The\nfirst step we took, pursuant to EGRPRA, was to listen to industry and others with a stake\nin how community banks are supervised, which was accomplished through soliciting\nwritten comments and by holding six outreach meetings in 2014 and 2015. Our\nEGRPRA report, issued in March, was focused on community banks, and it noted steps\nthat had already taken place, for example, to simplify Call Report requirements and\nexpand the number of firms eligible for less frequent examinations. Since that report, the\nBoard of Governors, along with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the\n\n\f-2Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, has proposed a rule expanding the number of\ncommercial real estate transactions that will no longer require an appraisal, allowing for a\nless detailed evaluation. And just last week, the Fed, along with other regulators, took a\nsignificant step to reduce the regulatory burden on community banks and other smaller\nand less complex institutions by proposing to simplify several requirements in the\nregulatory capital rule.\nWe have done this because we have an abiding commitment to consider how our\ndecisions affect institutions and the customers they serve. We are well aware that\ncommunity banks serve communities, businesses, and households that are often\nunderserved by larger institutions and offer more extensive and more personalized\nservices than are often otherwise available. We know that community bankers are part of\nthe communities they serve, and they are often better able to understand the needs and the\naspirations of their customers.\nWe hope that the research presented at this conference stimulates discussion about\nthe leading policy issues facing the industry and supervisors. As in the past, I see that\nthis year’s agenda includes presentations related to several important issues, including the\neffect of supervision on risk-tasking and the effects of greater competition on community\nbanks. I am cheered to see that finance students at the University of Akron remain\ninterested enough in community banking to participate in a case-study competition\nrelated to community banking, and I am pleased that the conference will hear a\npresentation of the winning case study.\n\n\f-3In closing, let me thank the conference organizers with the Fed and the\nConference of State Bank Supervisors, the scholars and others making presentations, and\nall of you for attending. I hope you have a terrific conference.\n\n\f"

Yellen\nChair\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\n“Fostering a Dynamic Global Recovery,” a symposium sponsored by\nthe Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City\nJackson Hole, Wyoming\n\nAugust 25, 2017\n\n\fA decade has passed since the beginnings of a global financial crisis that resulted\nin the most severe financial panic and largest contraction in economic activity in the\nUnited States since the Great Depression. Already, for some, memories of this\nexperience may be fading--memories of just how costly the financial crisis was and of\nwhy certain steps were taken in response. Today I will look back at the crisis and discuss\nthe reforms policymakers in the United States and around the world have made to\nimprove financial regulation to limit both the probability and the adverse consequences of\nfuture financial crises.\nA resilient financial system is critical to a dynamic global economy--the subject\nof this conference. A well-functioning financial system facilitates productive investment\nand new business formation and helps new and existing businesses weather the ups and\ndowns of the business cycle. Prudent borrowing enables households to improve their\nstandard of living by purchasing a home, investing in education, or starting a business.\nBecause of the reforms that strengthened our financial system, and with support from\nmonetary and other policies, credit is available on good terms, and lending has advanced\nbroadly in line with economic activity in recent years, contributing to today’s strong\neconomy.1\nAt the same time, reforms have boosted the resilience of the financial system.\nBanks are safer. The risk of runs owing to maturity transformation is reduced. Efforts to\nenhance the resolvability of systemic firms have promoted market discipline and reduced\n\n1\n\nOver the 12 quarters ending in the first quarter of this year, borrowing by the nonfinancial business sector\nincreased at an annual rate just above 6 percent, on average, and borrowing by households and nonprofit\ninstitutions rose at an annual rate of 3-1/4 percent, on average; the corresponding average pace of increase\nin nominal gross domestic product was 3-3/4 percent. Over the same period, lending by private depository\ninstitutions advanced at an annual rate of nearly 6-1/2 percent.\n\n\f-2the problem of too-big-to-fail. And a system is in place to more effectively monitor and\naddress risks that arise outside the regulatory perimeter.\nNonetheless, the scope and complexity of financial regulatory reforms demand\nthat policymakers and researchers remain alert to both areas for improvement and\nunexpected side effects. The Federal Reserve is committed to continuing to evaluate the\neffects of regulation on financial stability and on the broader economy and to making\nappropriate adjustments.\nI will start by reviewing where we were 10 years ago. I will then walk through\nsome key reforms our country has put in place to diminish the chances of another severe\ncrisis and limit damage during times of financial instability. After reviewing these steps,\nI will summarize indicators and research that show the improved resilience of the U.S.\nfinancial system--resilience that is due importantly to regulatory reform as well as actions\ntaken by the private sector. I will then turn to the evidence regarding how financial\nregulatory reform has affected economic growth, credit availability, and market liquidity.\nDevelopments 10 Years Ago\nThe U.S. and global financial system was in a dangerous place 10 years ago. U.S.\nhouse prices had peaked in 2006, and strains in the subprime mortgage market grew acute\nover the first half of 2007.2 By August, liquidity in money markets had deteriorated\nenough to require the Federal Reserve to take steps to support it.3 And yet the discussion\n\n2\n\nA contemporaneous perspective on subprime mortgage market developments at this time is provided in\nBen S. Bernanke (2007), “The Subprime Mortgage Market,” speech delivered at the Federal Reserve Bank\nof Chicago’s 43rd Annual Conference on Bank Structure and Competition, Chicago, May 17,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bernanke20070517a.htm.\n3\nOn August 17, 2007, the Federal Reserve Board reduced the primary credit rate at the discount window\nby 50 basis points and announced a change to the Reserve Banks’ usual practices to allow the provision of\nterm financing for as long as 30 days, renewable by the borrower. The changes were announced to remain\nin place until the Federal Reserve determined that market liquidity had improved materially. See Board of\n\n\f-3here at Jackson Hole in August 2007, with a few notable exceptions, was fairly optimistic\nabout the possible economic fallout from the stresses apparent in the financial system.4\nAs we now know, the deterioration of liquidity and solvency within the financial\nsector continued over the next 13 months. Accumulating strains across the financial\nsystem, including the collapse of Bear Stearns in March 2008, made it clear that\nvulnerabilities had risen across the system. As a result, policymakers took extraordinary\nmeasures: The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) sharply cut the federal funds\nrate, and the Federal Reserve, in coordination with the Treasury Department and other\nagencies, extended liquidity facilities beyond the traditional banking sector, applying to\nthe modern structure of U.S. money markets the dictum of Walter Bagehot, conceived in\nthe 19th century, to lend freely against good collateral at a penalty rate.5 Still, the\ndeterioration in the financial sector continued, with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac failing\nin early September.6\nBut the deterioration from early 2007 until early September 2008--already the\nworst financial disruption in the United States in many decades--was a slow trickle\n\nGovernors of the Federal Reserve System (2007), “Federal Reserve Board Discount Rate Action,” press\nrelease, August 17, https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/monetary/20070817a.htm.\n4\nThe proceedings from the 2007 conference are instructive about the range of views regarding housingrelated developments preceding the acute phase of the financial crisis. See Federal Reserve Bank of\nKansas City (2007), Housing, Housing Finance, and Monetary Policy, proceedings of an economic policy\nsymposium (Kansas City: FRBKC),\nhttps://www.kansascityfed.org/publications/research/escp/symposiums/escp-2007.\n5\nFor a discussion of the correspondence between the steps taken by the Federal Reserve and those\nsuggested by Walter Bagehot in the 19th century, see Brian F. Madigan (2009), “Bagehot’s Dictum in\nPractice: Formulating and Implementing Policies to Combat the Financial Crisis,” speech delivered at the\nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City’s annual economic symposium, Jackson Hole, Wyo., August 21,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/madigan20090821a.htm.\n6\nA timeline of developments in the United States over the financial crisis is available on the Federal\nReserve Bank of St. Louis’s website at https://www.stlouisfed.org/financial-crisis/full-timeline. The failure\nof Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac is marked by the decision of the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA)\nto place Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in government conservatorship on September 7, 2008. Links to\ndocuments outlining the actions taken around this time are available on the FHFA’s website at\nhttps://www.fhfa.gov/Media/PublicAffairs/Pages/Conservatorship-of-Fannie-Mae-and-Freddie-Mac.aspx.\n\n\f-4compared with the tidal wave that nearly wiped out the financial sector that September\nand led to a plunge in economic activity in the following months. Not long after Fannie\nand Freddie were placed in government conservatorship, Lehman Brothers collapsed,\nsetting off a week in which American International Group, Inc. (AIG), came to the brink\nof failure and required large loans from the Federal Reserve to mitigate the systemic\nfallout; a large money market fund “broke the buck” (that is, was unable to maintain a net\nasset value of $1 per share) and runs on other money funds accelerated, requiring the\nTreasury to provide a guarantee of money fund liabilities; global dollar funding markets\nnearly collapsed, necessitating coordinated action by central banks around the world; the\ntwo remaining large investment banks became bank holding companies, thereby ending\nthe era of large independent investment banks in the United States; and the Treasury\nproposed a rescue of the financial sector. Within several weeks, the Congress passed-and President Bush signed into law--the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008,\nwhich established the $700 billion Troubled Asset Relief Program; the Federal Reserve\ninitiated further emergency lending programs; and the Federal Deposit Insurance\nCorporation (FDIC) guaranteed a broad range of bank debt.7 Facing similar challenges in\ntheir own jurisdictions, many foreign governments also undertook aggressive measures to\nsupport the functioning of credit markets, including large-scale capital injections into\nbanks, expansions of deposit insurance programs, and guarantees of some forms of bank\ndebt.\n\n7\n\nIn the fall of 2008, the three largest investment banks were (in alphabetical order) Goldman Sachs, Merrill\nLynch, and Morgan Stanley. Merrill Lynch agreed to be acquired by Bank of America, and the remaining\ntwo firms became bank holding companies.\n\n\f-5Despite the forceful policy responses by the Treasury, the Congress, the FDIC,\nand the Federal Reserve as well as authorities abroad, the crisis continued to intensify:\nThe vulnerabilities in the U.S. and global economies had grown too large, and the\nsubsequent damage was enormous. From the beginning of 2008 to early 2010, nearly\n9 million jobs, on net, were lost in the United States. Millions of Americans lost their\nhomes. And distress was not limited to the U.S. economy: Global trade and economic\nactivity contracted to a degree that had not been seen since the 1930s. The economic\nrecovery that followed, despite extraordinary policy actions, was painfully slow.\nWhat the Crisis Revealed and How Policymakers Have Responded\nThese painful events renewed efforts to guard against financial instability. The\nCongress, the Administration, and regulatory agencies implemented new laws,\nregulations, and supervisory practices to limit the risk of another crisis, in coordination\nwith policymakers around the world.\nThe vulnerabilities within the financial system in the mid-2000s were numerous\nand, in hindsight, familiar from past financial panics. Financial institutions had assumed\ntoo much risk, especially related to the housing market, through mortgage lending\nstandards that were far too lax and contributed to substantial overborrowing. Repeating a\nfamiliar pattern, the “madness of crowds” had contributed to a bubble, in which investors\nand households expected rapid appreciation in house prices. The long period of\neconomic stability beginning in the 1980s had led to complacency about potential risks,\nand the buildup of risk was not widely recognized.8 As a result, market and supervisory\n\n8\n\nThe notion that popular sentiment may contribute to mispricing of assets--for example, the power of the\nmadness of crowds--is attributed to Charles Mackay (1841), Memoirs of Extraordinary Popular Delusions\nand the Madness of Crowds (London: Richard Bentley). A more modern perspective, and one using a\n\n\f-6discipline was lacking, and financial institutions were allowed to take on high levels of\nleverage. This leverage was facilitated by short-term wholesale borrowing, owing in part\nto market-based vehicles, such as money market mutual funds and asset-backed\ncommercial paper programs that allowed the rapid expansion of liquidity transformation\noutside of the regulated depository sector. Finally, a self-reinforcing loop developed, in\nwhich all of the factors I have just cited intensified as investors sought ways to gain\nexposure to the rising prices of assets linked to housing and the financial sector. As a\nresult, securitization and the development of complex derivatives products distributed\nrisk across institutions in ways that were opaque and ultimately destabilizing.\nIn response, policymakers around the world have put in place measures to limit a\nfuture buildup of similar vulnerabilities. The United States, through coordinated\nregulatory action and legislation, moved very rapidly to begin reforming our financial\nsystem, and the speed with which our banking system returned to health provides\nevidence of the effectiveness of that strategy. Moreover, U.S. leadership of global efforts\nthrough bodies such as the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, the Financial\nStability Board (FSB), and the Group of Twenty has contributed to the development of\nstandards that promote financial stability around the world, thereby supporting global\ngrowth while protecting the U.S. financial system from adverse developments abroad.\n\nphrase as memorable as the madness of crowds, is provided by Robert J. Shiller (2016), Irrational\nExuberance, 3rd ed. (Princeton, N.J.: Princeton University Press). The notion that economic stability can\ngenerate a buildup of imbalances that subsequently contributes to instability is presented in Hyman P.\nMinsky (1974), “The Modeling of Financial Instability: An Introduction,” in Modeling and Simulation,\nVol. 5, Part 1, proceedings of the Fifth Annual Pittsburgh Conference (Pittsburgh: Instrument Society of\nAmerica), pp. 267-72, http://digitalcommons.bard.edu/hm_archive/467. A related discussion of how\nfinancial excesses often precede downturns (and even panics) is provided in Charles P. Kindleberger and\nRobert Z. Aliber (2005), Manias, Panics, and Crashes: A History of Financial Crises, 5th ed. (Hoboken,\nN.J.: John Wiley & Sons).\n\n\f-7Preeminent among these domestic and global efforts have been steps to increase the lossabsorbing capacity of banks, regulations to limit both maturity transformation in shortterm funding markets and liquidity mismatches within banks, and new authorities to\nfacilitate the resolution of large financial institutions and to subject systemically\nimportant firms to more stringent prudential regulation.\nSeveral important reforms have increased the loss-absorbing capacity of global\nbanks. First, the quantity and quality of capital required relative to risk-weighted assets\nhave been increased substantially.9 In addition, a simple leverage ratio provides a\nbackstop, reflecting the lesson imparted by past crises that risk weights are imperfect and\na minimum amount of equity capital should fund a firm’s total assets. Moreover, both\nthe risk-weighted and simple leverage requirements are higher for the largest, most\nsystemic firms, which lowers the risk of distress at such firms and encourages them to\nlimit activities that could threaten financial stability.10 Finally, the largest U.S. banks\nparticipate in the annual Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR)--the\n\n9\n\nThese improvements encompass a number of changes. The regulatory requirements for capital have been\nincreased and focus on Tier 1 common equity, which proved more capable of absorbing losses than lowerquality forms of capital. The role of bank internal models in determining risk-weighted assets also has\nbeen significantly constrained in the United States. In addition, exposures previously considered off\nbalance sheet have been incorporated into risk-weighted assets.\n10\nThe Federal Reserve Board, the FDIC, and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency adopted a final\nrule to strengthen the leverage ratio standards for the largest, most interconnected U.S. banking\norganizations on April 8, 2014. Under the final rule, covered bank holding companies must maintain a\nleverage buffer of 2 percentage points above the minimum supplementary leverage ratio requirement of\n3 percent, for a total of 5 percent, to avoid restrictions on capital distributions and discretionary bonus\npayments (see Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation,\nand Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (2014), “Agencies Adopt Enhanced Supplementary\nLeverage Ratio Final Rule and Issue Supplementary Leverage Ratio Notice of Proposed Rulemaking,” joint\npress release, April 8, https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/bcreg20140408a.htm).\nThe Federal Reserve approved a final rule imposing risk-based capital surcharges on the largest, most\nsystemically important U.S. bank holding companies on July 20, 2015; in connection with the final rule, the\nBoard issued a white paper describing the calibration of the risk-based capital surcharges (see Board of\nGovernors of the Federal Reserve System (2015), “Federal Reserve Board Approves Final Rule Requiring\nthe Largest, Most Systemically Important U.S. Bank Holding Companies to Further Strengthen Their\nCapital Positions,” press release, July 20,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/bcreg20150720a.htm).\n\n\f-8stress tests. In addition to contributing to greater loss-absorbing capacity, the CCAR\nimproves public understanding of risks at large banking firms, provides a forwardlooking examination of firms’ potential losses during severely adverse economic\nconditions, and has contributed to significant improvements in risk management.\nReforms have also addressed the risks associated with maturity transformation.\nThe fragility created by deposit-like liabilities outside the traditional banking sector has\nbeen mitigated by regulations promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission\naffecting prime institutional money market funds. These rules require these prime funds\nto use a floating net asset value, among other changes, a shift that has made these funds\nless attractive as cash-management vehicles. The changes at money funds have also\nhelped reduce banks’ reliance on unsecured short-term wholesale funding, since prime\ninstitutional funds were significant investors in those bank liabilities. Liquidity risk at\nlarge banks has been further mitigated by a new liquidity coverage ratio and a capital\nsurcharge for global systemically important banks (G-SIBs). The liquidity coverage ratio\nrequires that banks hold liquid assets to cover potential net cash outflows over a 30-day\nstress period. The capital surcharge for U.S. G-SIBs links the required level of capital for\nthe largest banks to their reliance on short-term wholesale funding.11\nWhile improvements in capital and liquidity regulation will limit the reemergence\nof the risks that grew substantially in the mid-2000s, the failure of Lehman Brothers\ndemonstrated how the absence of an adequate resolution process for dealing with a\n\nMoreover, the Federal Reserve’s Comprehensive Liquidity Analysis and Review, in which supervisors\nanalyze the liquidity risks and practices at large banks, has promoted improvements in liquidity-risk\nmanagement. The U.S. banking agencies also have proposed a net stable funding ratio (NSFR) to help\nensure that large banks have a stable funding profile over a one-year horizon, and we are working toward\nfinalization of the NSFR.\n11\n\n\f-9failing systemic firm left policymakers with only the terrible choices of a bailout or\nallowing a destabilizing collapse. In recognition of this shortcoming, the Congress\nadopted the orderly liquidation authority in Title II of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street\nReform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act) to provide an alternative\nresolution mechanism for systemically important firms to be used instead of bankruptcy\nproceedings when necessary to preserve financial stability. The orderly liquidation\nauthority contains a number of tools, including liquidity resources and temporary stays on\nthe termination of financial contracts, that would help protect the financial system and\neconomy from the severe adverse spillovers that could occur if a systemic firm failed.\nImportantly, any losses incurred by the government in an Orderly Liquidation Authority\nresolution would not be at the expense of taxpayers, since the statute provides that all\nsuch losses must be borne by other large financial firms through subsequent assessments.\nIn addition, the Congress required that the largest banks submit living wills that describe\nhow they could be resolved under bankruptcy.12 And the Federal Reserve has mandated\nthat systemically important banks meet total loss-absorbing capacity requirements, which\nrequire these firms to maintain long-term debt adequate to absorb losses and recapitalize\nthe firm in resolution. These enhancements in resolvability protect financial stability and\nhelp ensure that the shareholders and creditors of failing firms bear losses. Moreover,\nthese steps promote market discipline, as creditors--knowing full well that they will bear\n\n12\n\nIn addition to these steps, the Board issued another proposal to make G-SIBs more resolvable in May of\nlast year (see Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2016), “Federal Reserve Board Proposes\nRule to Support U.S. Financial Stability by Enhancing the Resolvability of Very Large and Complex\nFinancial Firms,” press release, May 3,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/bcreg20160503b.htm). This proposed rule would\nimpose restrictions on G-SIBs’ qualified financial contracts--including derivatives and repurchase\nagreements (or repos)--to guard against the rapid, mass unwinding of those contracts during the resolution\nof a G-SIB. The proposed restrictions are a key step toward G-SIB resolvability because rapidly unwinding\nthese contracts could destabilize the financial system by causing asset fire sales and toppling other firms.\n\n\f- 10 losses in the event of distress--demand prudent risk-taking, thereby limiting the problem\nof too-big-to-fail.\nFinancial stability risks can also grow large outside the regulated banking sector,\nas amply demonstrated by the events of 2007 and 2008. In response, a number of\nregulatory changes affecting what is commonly referred to as the shadow banking sector\nhave been instituted. A specific example of such risks, illustrative of broader\ndevelopments, was the buildup of large counterparty exposures through derivatives\nbetween market participants and AIG that were both inappropriately risk-managed and\nopaque. To mitigate the potential for such risks to arise again, new standards require\ncentral clearing of standardized over-the-counter derivatives, enhanced reporting\nrequirements for all derivatives, and higher capital as well as margin requirements for\nnoncentrally cleared derivatives transactions.13\nAnother important step was the Congress’s creation of the Financial Stability\nOversight Council (FSOC). The council is responsible for identifying risks to financial\nstability and for designating those financial institutions that are systemically important\nand thus subject to prudential regulation by the Federal Reserve. Both of these\nresponsibilities are important to help guard against the risk that vulnerabilities outside the\nexisting regulatory perimeter grow to levels that jeopardize financial stability.14\n\n13\n\nOne area in which regulations have shifted to a lesser degree in the United States is that of time-varying\nmacroprudential tools, in which regulatory requirements are adjusted to address changes in vulnerabilities\nthat may affect the financial system. For example, U.S. regulatory authorities have adopted rules that allow\nuse of the countercyclical capital buffer, but other time-varying tools are limited in the United States. This\nissue is discussed in, for example, Stanley Fischer (2015), “Macroprudential Policy in the U.S. Economy,”\nspeech delivered at “Macroprudential Monetary Policy,” 59th Economic Conference of the Federal Reserve\nBank of Boston, Boston, October 2,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/fischer20151002a.htm.\n14\nFor example, the FSOC contributed, through its identification process, to the development of the\nSecurities and Exchange Commission reforms affecting money market funds. The FSOC has also\n\n\f- 11 The Financial System Is Safer\nThe evidence shows that reforms since the crisis have made the financial system\nsubstantially safer. Loss-absorbing capacity among the largest banks is significantly\nhigher, with Tier 1 common equity capital more than doubling from early 2009 to now.15\nThe annual stress-testing exercises in recent years have led to improvements in the capital\npositions and risk-management processes among participating banks. Large banks have\ncut their reliance on short-term wholesale funding essentially in half and hold\nsignificantly more high-quality, liquid assets. Assets under management at prime\ninstitutional money market funds that proved susceptible to runs in the crisis have\ndecreased substantially. And the ability of regulators to resolve a large institution has\nimproved, reflecting both new authorities and tangible steps taken by institutions to\nadjust their organizational and capital structure in a manner that enhances their\nresolvability and significantly reduces the problem of too-big-to-fail.\nThe progress evident in regulatory and supervisory metrics has been accompanied\nby shifts in private-sector assessments that also suggest enhanced financial stability.\nInvestors have recognized the progress achieved toward ending too-big-to-fail, and\nseveral rating agencies have removed the government support rating uplift that they once\naccorded to the largest banks. Credit default swaps for the large banks also suggest that\n\ndesignated four firms as systemically important--AIG, GE Capital, Prudential, and MetLife. GE Capital\nchose to shrink, adjust its business model, and reduce its footprint in short-term wholesale funding\nmarkets--and hence reduce a source of systemic risk. These actions caused the FSOC to subsequently\nremove its designation as systemically important last year--illustrating how the designation process allows\nboth identifying systemic firms and removing such designations when appropriate.\n15\nThe increase in Tier 1 common equity among bank holding companies has been sizable, especially for\nthe largest banks. If the largest banks are defined as either the eight U.S. global systemically important\nbanks or the U.S. bank holding companies that participated in the CCAR in 2017 (and for which data are\navailable for 2009:Q1), Tier 1 common equity has more than doubled in dollar terms and relative to riskweighted assets from the first quarter of 2009 to the most recent observations.\n\n\f- 12 market participants assign a low probability to the distress of a large U.S. banking firm.\nMarket-based assessments of the loss-absorbing capacity of large U.S. banks have moved\nup in recent years, and market-based measures of equity now lie in the range of book\nestimates of equity. To be sure, market-based measures may not reflect true risks--they\ncertainly did not in the mid-2000s--and hence the observed improvements should not be\noveremphasized.16 But supervisory metrics are not perfect, either, and policymakers and\ninvestors should continue to monitor a range of supervisory and market-based indicators\nof financial system resilience.\nEconomic research provides further support for the notion that reforms have made\nthe system safer. Studies have demonstrated that higher levels of bank capital mitigate\nthe risk and adverse effects of financial crises.17 Moreover, researchers have highlighted\nhow liquidity regulation supports financial stability by complementing capital\n\n16\n\nFor example, Natasha Sarin and Lawrence Summers have reviewed market-based measures of bank\nequity and related measures of bank risks and concluded that such measures have not improved since the\nmid-2000s. This assessment may understate the improvement in fundamental risk within the banking\nsector, as it takes the elevated valuations and low assessment of default risk implied by market prices\nduring the earlier period as indicative of fundamentals. Despite these shortcomings, their analysis is a\nuseful reminder of the importance of considering both regulatory metrics and assessments implied by\nmarket prices. See Natasha Sarin and Lawrence H. Summers (2016), “Understanding Bank Risk through\nMarket Measures,” Brookings Papers on Economic Activity, Fall, pp. 57-109,\nhttps://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/sarintextfall16bpea.pdf.\n17\nFor example, see the review of evidence in Simon Firestone, Amy Lorenc, and Ben Ranish (2017), “An\nEmpirical Economic Assessment of the Costs and Benefits of Bank Capital in the US,” Finance and\nEconomics Discussion Series 2017-034 (Washington: Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System,\nApril), https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/feds/files/2017034pap.pdf. Some research is less\nsupportive of the role of bank capital in limiting the risk of financial crises but suggests that higher levels of\nbank capital limit the economic costs of a financial crisis (for example, Òscar Jordà, Björn Richter, Moritz\nSchularick, and Alan M. Taylor (2017), “Bank Capital Redux: Solvency, Liquidity, and Crisis,” NBER\nWorking Paper Series 23287 (Cambridge, Mass.: National Bureau of Economic Research, March)). Some\nof the differences in findings across studies may be due to the degree to which the studies incorporate data\nfrom different countries and over different periods, as researchers disagree over the extent to which\ncomparisons across countries or periods appropriately account for other factors that differ across such\ndimensions.\n\n\f- 13 regulation.18 Economic models of the resilience of the financial sector--so called topdown stress-testing models--reinforce the message from supervisory stress tests that the\nriskiness of large banks has diminished over the past decade.19 Similarly, model-based\nanalyses indicate that the risk of adverse fire sale spillovers across banks or brokerdealers have been substantially mitigated.20\nIs This Safer System Supporting Growth?\nI suspect many in this audience would agree with the narrative of my remarks so\nfar: The events of the crisis demanded action, needed reforms were implemented, and\nthese reforms have made the system safer. Now--a decade from the onset of the crisis\nand nearly seven years since the passage of the Dodd-Frank Act and international\nagreement on the key banking reforms--a new question is being asked: Have reforms\ngone too far, resulting in a financial system that is too burdened to support prudent risktaking and economic growth?\nThe Federal Reserve is committed individually, and in coordination with other\nU.S. government agencies through forums such as the FSOC and internationally through\nbodies such as the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and the FSB, to evaluating\n\n18\n\nFor example, Charles A.E. Goodhart, Anil K. Kashyap, Dimitrios P. Tsomocos, and Alexandros P.\nVardoulakis (2013), “An Integrated Framework for Analyzing Multiple Financial Regulations,”\nInternational Journal of Central Banking, supp. 1, vol. 9 (January), pp. 109-43; and Gazi I. Kara and S.\nMehmet Ozsoy (2016), “Bank Regulation under Fire Sale Externalities,” Finance and Economics\nDiscussion Series 2016-026 (Washington: Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, April),\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/econresdata/feds/2016/files/2016026pap.pdf.\n19\nFor example, researchers at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York have developed a top-down stresstesting model, and simulation results from the model suggest that the resilience of the U.S. banking system\nhas improved since the crisis; see Beverly Hirtle, Anna Kovner, James Vickery, and Meru Bhanot (2014),\n“Assessing Financial Stability: The Capital and Loss Assessment under Stress Scenarios (CLASS)\nModel,” Staff Report 663 (New York: Federal Reserve Bank of New York, February; revised July 2015),\nhttps://www.newyorkfed.org/medialibrary/media/research/staff_reports/sr663.pdf.\n20\nFor example, see Fernando Duarte and Thomas Eisenbach (2013), “Fire-Sale Spillovers and Systemic\nRisk,” Staff Report 645 (New York: Federal Reserve Bank of New York, October; revised February 2015),\nhttps://www.newyorkfed.org/medialibrary/media/research/staff_reports/sr645.pdf.\n\n\f- 14 the effects of financial market regulations and considering appropriate adjustments.\nFurthermore, the Federal Reserve has independently taken steps to evaluate potential\nadjustments to its regulatory and supervisory practices. For example, the Federal Reserve\ninitiated a review of its stress tests following the 2015 cycle, and this review suggested\nchanges to reduce the burden on participating institutions, especially smaller institutions,\nand to better align the supervisory stress tests with regulatory capital requirements.21 In\naddition, a broader set of changes to the new financial regulatory framework may deserve\nconsideration. Such changes include adjustments that may simplify regulations applying\nto small and medium-sized banks and enhance resolution planning.22\nMore broadly, we continue to monitor economic conditions, and to review and\nconduct research, to better understand the effect of regulatory reforms and possible\nimplications for regulation. I will briefly summarize the current state of play in two\nareas: the effect of regulation on credit availability and on changes in market liquidity.\n\nIn response to the Federal Reserve’s review and other information, the Board finalized a rule adjusting its\ncapital plan and stress-testing rules, effective for the 2017 cycle, on January 30, 2017. The final rule\nremoves large and noncomplex firms from the qualitative assessment of the Federal Reserve’s CCAR,\nreducing significant burden on these firms and focusing the qualitative review in CCAR on the largest,\nmost complex financial institutions. More generally, changes to improve regulatory and supervisory\npractices related to stress testing by reducing unnecessary burden while preserving resilience are under\nconsideration. Possible changes have been discussed in Daniel K. Tarullo (2016), “Next Steps in the\nEvolution of Stress Testing,” speech delivered at the Yale University School of Management Leaders\nForum, New Haven, Conn., September 26,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/tarullo20160926a.htm.\n22\nAn overview of a set of principles that may guide such adjustments is discussed by Jerome H. Powell\n(2017), “Relationship between Regulation and Economic Growth,” statement before the Committee on\nBanking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, U.S. Senate, June 22,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/testimony/powell20170622a.htm. In addition, the Federal\nReserve Board has continued to engage in international efforts to assess the effects of reforms and possible\nadjustments; in this context, the FSB has developed a framework for the post-implementation evaluation of\nthe effects of the Group of Twenty financial regulatory reforms; see Financial Stability Board (2017),\nFramework for Post-Implementation Evaluation of the Effects of the G20 Financial Regulatory Reforms\n(Basel, Switzerland: FSB, July), www.fsb.org/wp-content/uploads/P030717-4.pdf.\n21\n\n\f- 15 The effects of capital regulation on credit availability have been investigated\nextensively. Some studies suggest that higher capital weighs on banks’ lending, while\nothers suggest that higher capital supports lending.23 Such conflicting results in academic\nresearch are not altogether surprising. It is difficult to identify the effects of regulatory\ncapital requirements on lending because material changes to capital requirements are rare\nand are often precipitated, as in the recent case, by financial crises that also have large\neffects on lending.\nGiven the uncertainty regarding the effect of capital regulation on lending,\nrulemakings of the Federal Reserve and other agencies were informed by analyses that\nbalanced the possible stability gains from greater loss-absorbing capacity against the\npossible adverse effects on lending and economic growth.24 This ex ante assessment\npointed to sizable net benefits to economic growth from higher capital standards--and\nsubsequent research supports this assessment.25 The steps to improve the capital\n\n23\n\nThe related literature is sizable. An early contribution is Ben S. Bernanke and Cara S. Lown (1991),\n“The Credit Crunch,” Brookings Papers on Economic Activity, no. 2, pp. 205-47. Research finding a\nsizable negative relationship between capital requirements and lending includes Shekhar Aiyar, Charles W.\nCalomiris, and Tomasz Wieladek (2014), “Does Macro-Prudential Regulation Leak? Evidence from a UK\nPolicy Experiment,” Journal of Money, Credit and Banking, vol. 46 (s1; February), pp. 181-214. Research\nfinding little relationship between lending and capital ratios (outside financial crises) includes Mark\nCarlson, Hui Shan, and Missaka Warusawitharana (2013), “Capital Ratios and Bank Lending: A Matched\nBank Approach,” Journal of Financial Intermediation, vol. 22 (October), pp. 663-87. Research suggesting\nthat higher capital levels may increase lending includes Leonardo Gambacorta and Hyun Song Shin (2016),\n“Why Bank Capital Matters for Monetary Policy,” BIS Working Papers 558 (Basel, Switzerland: Bank for\nInternational Settlements, April), www.bis.org/publ/work558.pdf.\n24\nFor example, see Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (2010), An Assessment of the Long-Term\nEconomic Impact of Stronger Capital and Liquidity Requirements (Basel, Switzerland: BCBS, August),\nwww.bis.org/publ/bcbs173.pdf; and Macroeconomic Assessment Group (2010), Interim Report: Assessing\nthe Macroeconomic Impact of the Transition to Stronger Capital and Liquidity Requirements (Basel,\nSwitzerland: MAG, August), www.bis.org/publ/othp10.pdf.\n25\nThe ex ante studies from the Basel Committee and the Macroeconomic Assessment Group referenced in\nnote 24 pointed to sizable net benefits from higher capital requirements. More academic research pointing\nto similar conclusions using macroeconomic models (and typically focused on model-specific measures of\neconomic welfare) includes Michael T. Kiley and Jae W. Sim (2014), “Bank Capital and the\nMacroeconomy: Policy Considerations,” Journal of Economic Dynamics and Control, vol. 43 (June),\npp. 175-98; Laurent Clerc, Alexis Derviz, Caterina Mendicino, Stephane Moyen, Kalin Nikolov, Livio\n\n\f- 16 positions of banks promptly and significantly following the crisis, beginning with the\n2009 Supervisory Capital Assessment Program, have resulted in a return of lending\ngrowth and profitability among U.S. banks more quickly than among their global peers.\nWhile material adverse effects of capital regulation on broad measures of lending\nare not readily apparent, credit may be less available to some borrowers, especially\nhomebuyers with less-than-perfect credit histories and, perhaps, small businesses. In\nretrospect, mortgage borrowing was clearly too easy for some households in the mid2000s, resulting in debt burdens that were unsustainable and ultimately damaging to the\nfinancial system. Currently, many factors are likely affecting mortgage lending,\nincluding changes in market perceptions of the risk associated with mortgage lending;\nchanges in practices at the government-sponsored enterprises and the Federal Housing\nAdministration; changes in technology that may be contributing to entry by nonbank\nlenders; changes in consumer protection regulations; and, perhaps to a limited degree,\nchanges in capital and liquidity regulations within the banking sector. These issues are\ncomplex and interact with a broader set of challenges related to the domestic housing\nfinance system.\n\nStracca, Javier Suarez, and Alexandros P. Vardoulakis (2015), “Capital Regulation in a Macroeconomic\nModel with Three Layers of Default,” International Journal of Central Banking, vol. 11 (June), pages 9-63;\nand Juliane Begenau (2016), “Capital Requirements, Risk Choice, and Liquidity Provision in a Business\nCycle Model,” unpublished paper, Harvard Business School, September. Subsequent analyses, albeit ones\nthat follow similar approaches, also suggest that there are net benefits to higher capital standards. One\nexample is the analysis by Firestone, Lorenc, and Ranish, “An Empirical Economic Assessment,” in\nnote 17. Another is Ingo Fender and Ulf Lewrick (2016), “Adding It All Up: The Macroeconomic Impact\nof Basel III and Outstanding Reform Issues,” BIS Working Papers 591 (Basel, Switzerland: Bank for\nInternational Settlements, November), www.bis.org/publ/work591.pdf. Indeed, this research points to\nbenefits from capital requirements in excess of those adopted, a conclusion also reached in Wayne\nPassmore and Alexander H. von Hafften (2017), “Are Basel’s Capital Surcharges for Global Systemically\nImportant Banks Too Small?” Finance and Economics Discussion Series 2017-021 (Washington: Board of\nGovernors of the Federal Reserve System, February),\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/econresdata/feds/2017/files/2017021pap.pdf.\n\n\f- 17 Credit appears broadly available to small businesses with solid credit histories,\nalthough indicators point to some difficulties facing firms with weak credit scores and\ninsufficient credit histories.26 Small business formation is critical to economic dynamism\nand growth. Smaller firms rely disproportionately on lending from smaller banks, and\nthe Federal Reserve has been taking steps and examining additional steps to reduce\nunnecessary complexity in regulations affecting smaller banks.27\nFinally, many financial market participants have expressed concerns about the\nability to transact in volume at low cost--that is, about market liquidity, particularly in\ncertain fixed-income markets such as that for corporate bonds. Market liquidity for\ncorporate bonds remains robust overall, and the healthy condition of the market is\napparent in low bid-ask spreads and the large volume of corporate bond issuance in\nrecent years. That said, liquidity conditions are clearly evolving. Large dealers appear to\ndevote less of their balance sheets to holding inventories of securities to facilitate trades\nand instead increasingly facilitate trades by directly matching buyers and sellers. In\n\n26\n\nThis conclusion is consistent with, for example, the findings in Federal Reserve Banks (2017), 2016\nSmall Business Credit Survey: Report on Employer Firms (New York: Federal Reserve Bank of New\nYork, April), https://www.newyorkfed.org/medialibrary/media/smallbusiness/2016/SBCS-ReportEmployerFirms-2016.pdf.\n27\nAs I have discussed previously, the Federal Reserve has been considering improvements through a\nnumber of work streams. For example, the Federal Reserve and the other banking agencies have recently\ncompleted the Economic Growth and Regulatory Paperwork Reduction Act (EGRPRA) review. Under\nEGRPRA, the federal banking agencies are required to conduct a joint review of their regulations every\n10 years to identify provisions that are outdated, unnecessary, or unduly burdensome. The Federal Reserve\nviewed this review as a timely opportunity to step back and identify ways to reduce regulatory burden,\nparticularly for smaller or less complex banks that pose less risk to the U.S. financial system. I discussed\npreliminary emerging themes from this review in Janet L. Yellen (2016), “Supervision and Regulation,”\nstatement before the Committee on Financial Services, U.S. House of Representatives, September 28,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/testimony/yellen20160928a.htm. For the final EGRPRA\nreport to the Congress, see Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Office of the Comptroller of\nthe Currency, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and National Credit Union Administration (2017),\nJoint Report to Congress: Economic Growth and Regulatory Paperwork Reduction Act (Washington:\nFederal Financial Institutions Examination Council, March),\nhttps://www.ffiec.gov/pdf/2017_FFIEC_EGRPRA_Joint-Report_to_Congress.pdf.\n\n\f- 18 addition, algorithmic traders and institutional investors are a larger presence in various\nmarkets than previously, and the willingness of these institutions to support liquidity in\nstressful conditions is uncertain. While no single factor appears to be the predominant\ncause of the evolution of market liquidity, some regulations may be affecting market\nliquidity somewhat. There may be benefits to simplifying aspects of the Volcker rule,\nwhich limits proprietary trading by banking firms, and to reviewing the interaction of the\nenhanced supplementary leverage ratio with risk-based capital requirements. At the same\ntime, the new regulatory framework overall has made dealers more resilient to shocks,\nand, in the past, distress at dealers following adverse shocks has been an important factor\ndriving market illiquidity. As a result, any adjustments to the regulatory framework\nshould be modest and preserve the increase in resilience at large dealers and banks\nassociated with the reforms put in place in recent years.\nRemaining Challenges\nSo where do we stand a decade after the onset of the most severe financial crisis\nsince the Great Depression? Substantial progress has been made toward the Federal\nReserve’s economic objectives of maximum employment and price stability, in putting in\nplace a regulatory and supervisory structure that is well designed to lower the risks to\nfinancial stability, and in actually achieving a stronger financial system. Our more\nresilient financial system is better prepared to absorb, rather than amplify, adverse\nshocks, as has been illustrated during periods of market turbulence in recent years.\nEnhanced resilience supports the ability of banks and other financial institutions to lend,\nthereby supporting economic growth through good times and bad.\n\n\f- 19 Nonetheless, there is more work to do. The balance of research suggests that the\ncore reforms we have put in place have substantially boosted resilience without unduly\nlimiting credit availability or economic growth. But many reforms have been\nimplemented only fairly recently, markets continue to adjust, and research remains\nlimited. The Federal Reserve is committed to evaluating where reforms are working and\nwhere improvements are needed to most efficiently maintain a resilient financial system.\nMoreover, I expect that the evolution of the financial system in response to global\neconomic forces, technology, and, yes, regulation will result sooner or later in the all-toofamiliar risks of excessive optimism, leverage, and maturity transformation reemerging in\nnew ways that require policy responses. We relearned this lesson through the pain\ninflicted by the crisis. We can never be sure that new crises will not occur, but if we keep\nthis lesson fresh in our memories--along with the painful cost that was exacted by the\nrecent crisis--and act accordingly, we have reason to hope that the financial system and\neconomy will experience fewer crises and recover from any future crisis more quickly,\nsparing households and businesses some of the pain they endured during the crisis that\nstruck a decade ago.\n\n\f"

            "content": "For release at\n8:30 a.m. EDT\nJuly 12, 2017\n\nStatement by\nJanet L. Yellen\nChair\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nbefore the\nCommittee on Financial Services\n\nU.S. House of Representatives\nJuly 12, 2017\n\n\fChairman Hensarling, Ranking Member Waters, and other members of the Committee, I\nam pleased to present the Federal Reserve’s semiannual Monetary Policy Report to the Congress.\nIn my remarks today I will briefly discuss the current economic situation and outlook before\nturning to monetary policy.\nCurrent Economic Situation and Outlook\nSince my appearance before this committee in February, the labor market has continued\nto strengthen. Job gains have averaged 180,000 per month so far this year, down only slightly\nfrom the average in 2016 and still well above the pace we estimate would be sufficient, on\naverage, to provide jobs for new entrants to the labor force. Indeed, the unemployment rate has\nfallen about 1/4 percentage point since the start of the year, and, at 4.4 percent in June, is\n5-1/2 percentage points below its peak in 2010 and modestly below the median of Federal Open\nMarket Committee (FOMC) participants’ assessments of its longer-run normal level. The labor\nforce participation rate has changed little, on net, this year--another indication of improving\nconditions in the jobs market, given the demographically driven downward trend in this series.\nA broader measure of labor market slack that includes workers marginally attached to the labor\nforce and those working part time who would prefer full-time work has also fallen this year and\nis now nearly as low as it was just before the recession. It is also encouraging that jobless rates\nhave continued to decline for most major demographic groups, including for African Americans\nand Hispanics. However, as before the recession, unemployment rates for these minority groups\nremain higher than for the nation overall.\nMeanwhile, the economy appears to have grown at a moderate pace, on average, so far\nthis year. Although inflation-adjusted gross domestic product is currently estimated to have\nincreased at an annual rate of only 1-1/2 percent in the first quarter, more-recent indicators\n\n\f-2suggest that growth rebounded in the second quarter. In particular, growth in household\nspending, which was weak earlier in the year, has picked up in recent months and continues to be\nsupported by job gains, rising household wealth, and favorable consumer sentiment. In addition,\nbusiness fixed investment has turned up this year after having been soft last year. And a\nstrengthening in economic growth abroad has provided important support for U.S. manufacturing\nproduction and exports. The housing market has continued to recover gradually, aided by the\nongoing improvement in the labor market and mortgage rates that, although up somewhat from a\nyear ago, remain at relatively low levels.\nWith regard to inflation, overall consumer prices, as measured by the price index for\npersonal consumption expenditures, increased 1.4 percent over the 12 months ending in May, up\nfrom about 1 percent a year ago but a little lower than earlier this year. Core inflation, which\nexcludes energy and food prices, has also edged down in recent months and was 1.4 percent in\nMay, a couple of tenths below the year-earlier reading. It appears that the recent lower readings\non inflation are partly the result of a few unusual reductions in certain categories of prices; these\nreductions will hold 12-month inflation down until they drop out of the calculation.\nNevertheless, with inflation continuing to run below the Committee’s 2 percent longer-run\nobjective, the FOMC indicated in its June statement that it intends to carefully monitor actual\nand expected progress toward our symmetric inflation goal.\nLooking ahead, my colleagues on the FOMC and I expect that, with further gradual\nadjustments in the stance of monetary policy, the economy will continue to expand at a moderate\npace over the next couple of years, with the job market strengthening somewhat further and\ninflation rising to 2 percent. This judgment reflects our view that monetary policy remains\naccommodative. Ongoing job gains should continue to support the growth of incomes and,\n\n\f-3therefore, consumer spending; global economic growth should support further gains in U.S.\nexports; and favorable financial conditions, coupled with the prospect of continued gains in\ndomestic and foreign spending and the ongoing recovery in drilling activity, should continue to\nsupport business investment. These developments should increase resource utilization somewhat\nfurther, thereby fostering a stronger pace of wage and price increases.\nOf course, considerable uncertainty always attends the economic outlook. There is, for\nexample, uncertainty about when--and how much--inflation will respond to tightening resource\nutilization. Possible changes in fiscal and other government policies here in the United States\nrepresent another source of uncertainty. In addition, although the prospects for the global\neconomy appear to have improved somewhat this year, a number of our trading partners continue\nto confront economic challenges. At present, I see roughly equal odds that the U.S. economy’s\nperformance will be somewhat stronger or somewhat less strong than we currently project.\nMonetary Policy\nI will now turn to monetary policy. The FOMC seeks to foster maximum employment\nand price stability, as required by law. Over the first half of 2017, the Committee continued to\ngradually reduce the amount of monetary policy accommodation. Specifically, the FOMC raised\nthe target range for the federal funds rate by 1/4 percentage point at both its March and June\nmeetings, bringing the target to a range of 1 to 1-1/4 percent. In doing so, the Committee\nrecognized the considerable progress the economy had made--and is expected to continue to\nmake--toward our mandated objectives.\nThe Committee continues to expect that the evolution of the economy will warrant\ngradual increases in the federal funds rate over time to achieve and maintain maximum\nemployment and stable prices. That expectation is based on our view that the federal funds rate\n\n\f-4remains somewhat below its neutral level--that is, the level of the federal funds rate that is\nneither expansionary nor contractionary and keeps the economy operating on an even keel.\nBecause the neutral rate is currently quite low by historical standards, the federal funds rate\nwould not have to rise all that much further to get to a neutral policy stance. But because we also\nanticipate that the factors that are currently holding down the neutral rate will diminish\nsomewhat over time, additional gradual rate hikes are likely to be appropriate over the next few\nyears to sustain the economic expansion and return inflation to our 2 percent goal. Even so, the\nCommittee continues to anticipate that the longer-run neutral level of the federal funds rate is\nlikely to remain below levels that prevailed in previous decades.\nAs I noted earlier, the economic outlook is always subject to considerable uncertainty,\nand monetary policy is not on a preset course. FOMC participants will adjust their assessments\nof the appropriate path for the federal funds rate in response to changes to their economic\noutlooks and to their judgments of the associated risks as informed by incoming data. In this\nregard, as we noted in the FOMC statement last month, inflation continues to run below our\n2 percent objective and has declined recently; the Committee will be monitoring inflation\ndevelopments closely in the months ahead.\nIn evaluating the stance of monetary policy, the FOMC routinely consults monetary\npolicy rules that connect prescriptions for the policy rate with variables associated with our\nmandated objectives. However, such prescriptions cannot be applied in a mechanical way; their\nuse requires careful judgments about the choice and measurement of the inputs into these rules,\nas well as the implications of the many considerations these rules do not take into account. I\nwould like to note the discussion of simple monetary policy rules and their role in the Federal\nReserve’s policy process that appears in our current Monetary Policy Report.\n\n\f-5Balance Sheet Normalization\nLet me now turn to our balance sheet. Last month the FOMC augmented its Policy\nNormalization Principles and Plans by providing additional details on the process that we will\nfollow in normalizing the size of our balance sheet. The Committee intends to gradually reduce\nthe Federal Reserve’s securities holdings by decreasing its reinvestment of the principal\npayments it receives from the securities held in the System Open Market Account. Specifically,\nsuch payments will be reinvested only to the extent that they exceed gradually rising caps.\nInitially, these caps will be set at relatively low levels to limit the volume of securities that\nprivate investors will have to absorb. The Committee currently expects that, provided the\neconomy evolves broadly as anticipated, it will likely begin to implement the program this year.\nOnce we start to reduce our reinvestments, our securities holdings will gradually decline,\nas will the supply of reserve balances in the banking system. The longer-run normal level of\nreserve balances will depend on a number of as-yet-unknown factors, including the banking\nsystem’s future demand for reserves and the Committee’s future decisions about how to\nimplement monetary policy most efficiently and effectively. The Committee currently\nanticipates reducing the quantity of reserve balances to a level that is appreciably below recent\nlevels but larger than before the financial crisis.\nFinally, the Committee affirmed in June that changing the target range for the federal\nfunds rate is our primary means of adjusting the stance of monetary policy. In other words, we\ndo not intend to use the balance sheet as an active tool for monetary policy in normal times.\nHowever, the Committee would be prepared to resume reinvestments if a material deterioration\nin the economic outlook were to warrant a sizable reduction in the federal funds rate. More\ngenerally, the Committee would be prepared to use its full range of tools, including altering the\n\n\f-6size and composition of its balance sheet, if future economic conditions were to warrant a more\naccommodative monetary policy than can be achieved solely by reducing the federal funds rate.\nThank you. I would be pleased to take your questions.\n\n\f"

Yellen\nChair\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\n“125 Years of Women at Brown Conference”\nsponsored by Brown University\nProvidence, Rhode Island\n\nMay 5, 2017\n\n\fThank you, and let me say what an honor it is, as an alumna of this great\nuniversity, to be here today and part of this important occasion.\nAs we celebrate the 125th anniversary of women being admitted to Brown, it\nseems appropriate to reflect on the progress that women have achieved in the intervening\nyears. Since 1891, women have made tremendous strides in their ability to pursue their\ndreams of education and meaningful work and to support themselves and their families.\nIn pursuing these goals, women have helped improve working conditions for all workers\nand have been a major factor in America’s prosperity over the past century and a quarter.\nDespite this progress, evidence suggests that many women remain unable to\nachieve their goals. The gap in earnings between women and men, although smaller than\nit was years ago, is still significant; women continue to be underrepresented in certain\nindustries and occupations; and too many women struggle to combine aspirations for\nwork and family. Further advancement has been hampered by barriers to equal\nopportunity and workplace rules and norms that fail to support a reasonable work-life\nbalance. If these obstacles persist, we will squander the potential of many of our citizens\nand incur a substantial loss to the productive capacity of our economy at a time when the\naging of the population and weak productivity growth are already weighing on economic\ngrowth.\nTo enliven the history I will present today, I will include the experiences of\nwomen graduates of this institution, in most cases in their own words, as related in oral\nhistories preserved by Brown. 1 Among these alumnae, I am proud to say, is a member of\nmy own family who was an early graduate of Pembroke, Elizabeth Stafford Hirschfelder\n\n1\n\nI am grateful for the assistance of Brown University staff in facilitating access to Brown Women Speak,\nthe University’s oral history project, and particularly the help of archivist Mary Murphy.\n\n\f-2of the Class of 1923. Her career and achievements as a mathematician embody both the\nopportunities that opened for Pembroke graduates in the decades after she left here and\nthe limitations many women faced and the compromises she, like so many others, was\nforced to make.\nA Historical Perspective on Women in the Labor Force\nFrom the time that Brown began to accept women and into the 1920s, most\nwomen in the United States did not work outside the home, and those who did were\nprimarily young and unmarried. In that era, just 20 percent of all women were “gainful\nworkers,” as the Census Bureau then categorized labor force participation outside the\nhome, and only 5 percent of those married were categorized as such. 2 Of course, these\nstatistics somewhat understate the contributions of married women to the economy\nbeyond housekeeping and childrearing, since women’s work in the home often included\nwork in family businesses and the home production of goods, such as agricultural\nproducts, for sale. Also, the aggregate statistics obscure the differential experience of\nwomen by race. African American women were about twice as likely to participate in the\nlabor force as were white women at the time, largely because they were more likely to\nremain in the labor force after marriage. 3\n\n2\n\nMy discussion of the history of female labor force participation draws heavily on the pioneering work of\nClaudia Goldin, including her 2006 Ely Lecture “The Quiet Revolution that Transformed Women’s\nEmployment, Education, and Family” to the American Economic Association and her 1990 work\nUnderstanding the Gender Gap: An Economic History of American Women, from which the statistics on\nfemale labor force participation from the late 19th century until the mid-20th century are drawn. A\nthorough discussion of the quality of these data and their usefulness in making comparisons over time is\nincluded in that work.\n3\nThe higher participation rates of African American women have been attributed to different cultural\nnorms that developed during slavery and the legacy of slavery, which left blacks impoverished and with\nlow levels of education, making women’s wages an important source of family income (Boustan and\nCollins, 2013; Goldin, 1977).\n\n\f-3What was true for women in general was also true of the early graduates of what\nwas then called the Women’s College, the large majority of whom got married, raised\nfamilies, and did not pursue careers. The fact that many women left work upon marriage\nreflected cultural norms, the nature of the work available to them, and legal strictures.\nThe occupational choices of those young women who did work were severely\ncircumscribed. Most women lacked significant education--only 54 percent of girls aged\n5 to 19 were enrolled in school in 1890. 4 And women with little education mostly toiled\nas piece workers in factories or as domestic workers, jobs that were dirty and often\nunsafe. Educated women, like those who attended Brown’s Women’s College, were\nscarce. Fewer than 2 percent of all 18- to 24-year-olds were enrolled in an institution of\nhigher education, and just one-third of those were women. 5 Such women did not have to\nperform manual labor, but their choices were likewise constrained. Edna McDonald was\na graduate of the Class of 1919, and in her oral history, she summed up the opportunities\nfor her and her classmates: “Let’s be frank,” she said. “What choices did women have?\nTeaching. You could teach. You could be a lab technician. Or you could go into office\nwork and be a secretary. Those were the only real choices.” Margery Chittenden\nLeonard graduated from Pembroke in 1929 and went on to earn a J.D. as the only woman\nin her class at Boston University--after two others withdrew. And with that law degree,\nher first job was as a secretary, and she continued to struggle to find work as a lawyer. In\nher oral history, Doris Madeline Hopkins, a 1928 graduate, talked about the opportunity\n\n4\n5\n\nU.S. Department of Education (1993).\nU.S. Department of Education (1993), p. 76.\n\n\f-4that she had to work, but also about being told she had to leave her job once she got\nmarried. Indeed, at the time, marriage bars were widespread. 6\nThere were notable exceptions, such as, of course, Mary Emma Woolley, a Brown\ngraduate who went on to serve as the president of Mount Holyoke College, and Ethel\nRobinson, the first black woman to graduate from Brown, who taught English at Howard\nUniversity. Helen Butts, from the Class of 1928, taught natural sciences at Smith and\nlater zoology at Wellesley, the beginning of a long and productive career as a biological\nresearcher. Another exception was Betty Stafford, the aunt of my husband, George. She\ngrew up in Providence, earned bachelor’s and master’s degrees at Brown in mathematics\nand then rather adventurously headed west, teaching at two universities in Texas in the\n1920s before completing her Ph.D. and then teaching at the University of Wisconsin.\nDespite the widespread sentiment against women, particularly married women,\nworking outside the home and with the limited opportunities available to them, women\ndid enter the labor force in greater numbers over this period, with participation rates\nreaching nearly 50 percent for single women by 1930 and nearly 12 percent for married\nwomen. This rise suggests that while the incentive, and in many cases the imperative,\nremained for women to drop out of the labor market at marriage when they could rely on\ntheir husband’s income, mores were changing. Indeed, these years overlapped with the\nso-called first wave of the women’s movement, when women came together to agitate for\nchange on a variety of social issues, including suffrage and temperance, and which\nculminated in the ratification of the 19th amendment in 1920 guaranteeing women the\nright to vote.\n\n6\n\nGoldin (1990), pp. 160-66.\n\n\f-5Between the 1930s and mid-1970s, women’s participation in the economy\ncontinued to rise, with the gains primarily owing to an increase in work among married\nwomen. By 1970, 50 percent of single women and 40 percent of married women were\nparticipating in the labor force. 7 Several factors contributed to this rise. First, with the\nadvent of mass high school education, graduation rates rose substantially. 8 At the same\ntime, new technologies contributed to an increased demand for clerical workers, and\nthese jobs were increasingly taken on by women. Moreover, because these jobs tended to\nbe cleaner and safer, the stigma attached to work for a married woman diminished. And\nwhile there were still marriage bars that forced women out of the labor force, these\nformal barriers were gradually removed over the period following World War II.\nAnother innovation was the introduction in the late 1940s of part-time schedules, which\ncombined with the proliferation of modern appliances to make it more feasible for\nmarried women to work outside the home. 9\nOver the decades from 1930 to 1970, increasing opportunities also arose for\nhighly educated women, such as the graduates of what was by then called Pembroke\nCollege, to work in professions. That said, early in that period, most women still\nexpected to have short careers, and women were still largely viewed as secondary earners\nwhose husbands’ careers came first. Thus, while it was becoming more common for\nwomen such as Betty Stafford to teach at colleges and universities, their career prospects\nwere not the same as those for men. After earning her Ph.D. at Wisconsin, Betty married\na fellow student and over the next decade coauthored five important papers with him and\n\n7\n\nNote that for the 1970s and beyond, the participation rate is calculated as a share of those aged 16 and\nolder, whereas for earlier years it is calculated as a share of those aged 15 and older.\n8\nGoldin and Katz (2008).\n9\nGoldin (2006), pp. 5-6.\n\n\f-6a well-regarded reference work. But, while her husband progressed from instructor to\nprofessor at Wisconsin, Betty worked as an instructor on an ad hoc basis. During World\nWar II, while he worked for the government in Washington and New York, Betty stayed\nin Madison, teaching math to servicemen. When he took a job teaching in California\nafter the war, they divorced, and it was only then that she was a given a position as\nassistant professor.\nAs time progressed, attitudes about women working and their employment\nprospects did change. As women gained experience in the labor force, they increasingly\nsaw that they could balance work and family. A new model of the two-income family\nemerged. 10 Some women began to attend college and graduate school with the\nexpectation of working, whether or not they planned to marry and have families, as did\nRita Schorr-Germain, an immigrant who survived Auschwitz, graduated from Pembroke\nin 1953, and went on to teach European history while her husband also had a successful\nacademic career. In her oral history, Rita says she was encouraged by many Brown\nprofessors and never considered the possibility that her gender would stand in the way of\nan academic career, a shift in outlook that was becoming increasingly common in the\n1950s. As did most women’s colleges at the time, Pembroke continued to produce\nnurses, schoolteachers, and social workers, and many women who worked only until they\nmarried and had children. But, from the late 1950s on, it also increasingly graduated\nwriters, doctors, lawyers, diplomats, physicians, psychotherapists, and archeologists, and,\n\n10\n\nFor instance, although many women who had joined the war effort in the 1940s were fired at the end of\nthe war, as the Korean War effort picked up and the demand for the labor of women rose, women, who had\nlearned that they could combine work and family were ready to reenter the labor force, so that by the early\n1950s female labor force participation resumed its war-time high (Kessler-Harris, 1982, pp. 302-03).\nMoreover, evidence suggests that sons whose mothers increased their labor force participation in the wake\nof World War II had wives who were more likely to work (Fernández, Fogli, and Olivette, 2004).\n\n\f-7in 1959, the first female faculty member of Brown University. Among those women\nfortunate to attend Pembroke in this era of dramatic change was me. I enrolled at Brown\nfully planning to attend graduate school and have a career, as did many of my classmates\nin the Class of 1967.\nBy the 1970s, a dramatic change in women’s work lives was under way. In the\nperiod after World War II, many women had not expected that they would spend as much\nof their adult lives working as turned out to be the case. By contrast, in the 1970s young\nwomen more commonly expected that they would spend a substantial portion of their\nlives in the labor force, and they prepared for it, increasing their educational attainment\nand taking courses and college majors that better equipped them for careers as opposed to\njust jobs.\nIn surveys of young people about their expectations of their futures, young\nwomen during this era increasingly placed an emphasis on career success. 11 Susan\nGraber Slusky of the Class of 1971 said in her oral history that she chose Pembroke for\nBrown’s excellence in chemistry and physics, because she was already planning the\ncareer she went on to have as a researcher. Perhaps unsurprisingly, this is also the period\nin which many all-male colleges admitted women or combined their women’s and men’s\nundergraduate schools, as Brown did when it merged Pembroke and Brown College\nin 1971.\nThese changes in attitudes and expectations were supported by other changes\nunder way in society. Workplace protections were enhanced through the passage of the\nPregnancy Discrimination Act in 1978 and the recognition of sexual harassment in the\n\n11\n\nInterestingly, over this time young men put increasing weight on family. Goldin (2006), pp. 9 and 11.\n\n\f-8workplace. Access to birth control increased, which allowed married couples greater\ncontrol over the size of their families and young women the ability to delay marriage and\nto plan children around their educational and work choices. 12 And in 1974, women\ngained, for the first time, the right to apply for credit in their own name without a male\nco-signer. 13\nBy the early 1990s, the labor force participation rate of prime working-age\nwomen--those between the ages of 25 and 54--reached just over 74 percent, compared\nwith roughly 93 percent for prime working-age men. By then, the share of women going\ninto the traditional fields of teaching, nursing, social work, and clerical work declined,\nand more women were becoming doctors, lawyers, managers, and, yes, professors. As\nwomen increased their education and joined industries and occupations formerly\ndominated by men, the gap in earnings between women and men began to close\nsignificantly. 14\nPositive Spillovers from Women’s Increased Participation in the Workforce\nLooking back, the story of the past 125 years is one of slow but steady progress\ntoward women’s full participation in the economy and the fulfillment of their career\ngoals. Unfortunately, the success of women has often been seen as coming at the\nexpense of men. Indeed, regularly in the late 19th and 20th centuries there were calls to\nprotect men from women’s entry into the labor force. The early female graduates of\nBrown faced such attitudes from fellow students and even from faculty. Ruth Pederson, a\n\n12\n\nSee, for example, Bailey (2010) and Goldin and Katz (2002).\nThe Equal Credit Opportunity Act, passed in 1974, prohibited discrimination in the provision of credit on\nthe basis of gender, race, religion, marital status and national origin. It also disallowed credit providers\nfrom asking women about their plans for future children.\n14\nBlau and Kahn (2016).\n13\n\n\f-9member of the Class of 1919, said some professors did not want to teach women and\nprohibited women from taking their classes. Margery Leonard remembered one Boston\nUniversity professor who urged her to drop out of law school. When she refused, this\nprofessor punished her by forcing her to recite the details of rape and seduction cases\nbefore her jeering, stomping classmates. And it wasn’t only men who had this attitude.\nAmong the women who were fighting for better labor standards early in the 20th century,\nmany were heavily influenced by elite cultural standards that viewed a woman’s place as\nin the home and argued that men should be paid a “family wage” that would allow them\nto support their family singlehandedly--a standard that many working-class families\ncould not afford. Moreover, many of the labor protections promoted to protect women\nwere often based on theories about women’s weaker nature, and these protections served\nto circumscribe their work. 15 During the Great Depression, limiting women’s role in the\nworkforce was considered a way to address the high rates of unemployment, although the\nexperience of those years showed the importance of women in supporting their families\nfinancially. 16 Similarly, women who had successfully worked during World War II,\neither as part of the war effort or to support their families while their husbands were\nfighting, often were pushed out of their jobs to make room for returning soldiers. 17\nAfter the war and then single, my relative, Betty Stafford, remained an assistant\nprofessor at the University of Wisconsin despite an enviable body of research. She\nmarried another Wisconsin professor, an eminent chemist, and collaborated with him on\nhis research. But, in 1954, she gave up her assistant professorship, she said, to be able to\n\n15\n\nKessler-Harris (1982), pp. 184-85.\nKessler-Harris (1982), pp. 250-58.\n17\nKessler-Harris (1982), pp. 286-87.\n16\n\n\f- 10 accompany her husband on his frequent international travels. Betty later moved with her\nhusband to California, and after his death, she endowed a graduate fellowship in the\nsciences and a prize in theoretical chemistry. Although Betty’s accomplishments were\nconsiderable, against the backdrop of increasing opportunity for women over her lifetime\nI believe that Betty Stafford Hirschfelder was denied opportunities and greater success\nsimply because she was a woman.\nDespite the fears of some that women entering into the workforce would crowd\nout men, the evidence shows that the rise in women’s participation has contributed to\nwidespread improvements in the safety and productivity of our workplaces, to the health\nof families, and to the macroeconomic success that our country has enjoyed over the past\n125 years.\nIn the first decades of the 20th century, the struggle to improve the working\nconditions of young women drawn into factories was a pillar of the overall movement\ntoward improved labor standards. Women’s demands for safer factories, humane\nworkweeks, and higher pay, which were often pursued through organizing and striking,\ncontributed substantially to the social upheaval and public debate of that period that\neventually led to the passage of stronger labor standards. These efforts also produced\ngenerations of women who went on to be leaders in the broader labor movement and in\nthe broader movements for equality.\nThe rise in female labor force participation was an early focus of and helped\nestablish the fields of statistics and labor economics in their modern incarnations. Carroll\nWright, the first commissioner of what is now known as the Bureau of Labor Statistics\nand who established the high standards for data collection and analysis for which the\n\n\f- 11 bureau is known, devoted his agency’s fourth annual report, for the year 1888, to the\ntopic of Working Women in Large Cities. 18 Moreover, the issues surrounding women’s\nwork, such as the minimum wage, pay equity, and maximum workweeks, were topics of\ngreat interest to early practitioners of labor economics. 19\nIt is often said that we should welcome women’s presence in the workplace\nbecause it allows us to capitalize on the talents of our entire population, and this is\ncertainly true. But it is also good business. A number of studies on how groups perform\nindicate that workforces that vary on dimensions such as gender, race, and ethnicity\nproduce better decisionmaking processes and better outcomes. 20\nEvidence also suggests that women’s work has positive spillovers to their family\nlives and to the success of their children, which in turn benefits all of society. It is a wellestablished finding in the literature on development that maternal education and work are\npositively associated with better health and educational outcomes for children. 21 A\nrecent meta-study also suggests that children in the United States with working mothers\ndo as well if not better in school, both academically and behaviorally, than children with\nmothers that stay home full time. This effect is particularly strong for families that have\nfewer social and economic resources, including single-parent families. 22 As time goes\non, girls with working mothers are more likely to be employed and hold supervisory\npositions, and they earn somewhat more. In addition, sons raised in families with\n\n18\n\nBureau of Labor (1889).\nGoldin (2006), p. 4.\n20\nSee the discussion of this literature on pp. 232-33 of Bayer and Rouse (2016) and the studies cited\ntherein.\n21\nSee, for example, World Bank (2012).\n22\nLucas-Thompson, Goldberg, and Prause (2010).\n19\n\n\f- 12 working mothers assume greater childcare responsibilities as adults than sons whose\nmothers did not work. 23\nThis is not to say that children do not need attention from both parents to develop\ninto academically successful and socially well-adjusted adults--they certainly do. Also,\nas I will discuss, women are making choices that reflect their desire to balance work and\nfamily. These findings bear on the question of how best to support women’s work\nthrough public policies aimed at helping women and men better manage work and family.\nFrom a macroeconomic perspective, women’s incorporation into the economy\ncontributed importantly to the rapid rise in economic output and well-being over the\n20th century. Between 1948 and 1990, the rise in female participation contributed about\n1/2 percentage point per year to the potential growth rate of real gross domestic\nproduct. 24 And this estimate does not take into account the effect of the increases in\nwomen’s education and work experience that also occurred over that period and boosted\ntheir productivity. In addition, since 1979, women have accounted for a majority of the\nrise in real household income. In dollar terms, the gains were greatest for households in\nthe top third of the earnings distribution, but without the increase in women’s earnings,\nfamilies in the bottom and middle thirds of the distribution would have experienced\ndeclines. 25\nRemaining Challenges and Some Possible Solutions\nI have argued thus far that we, as a country, have reaped great benefits from the\nincreasing role that women have played in the economy. But evidence suggests that\n\n23\n\nMcGinn, Ruiz Castro, and Lingo (2015).\nBoard staff calculation using data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n25\nBoushey and Vaghul (2016).\n24\n\n\f- 13 barriers to women’s continued progress remain. The participation rate for prime\nworking-age women peaked in the late 1990s and currently stands at about 75 percent. 26\nOf course, women, particularly those with lower levels of education, have been affected\nby the same economic forces that have been pushing down participation among men,\nincluding technical change and globalization. 27 However, women’s participation\nplateaued at a level well below that of prime working-age men, which stands at over\n88 percent. While some married women choose not to work, the size of this disparity\nshould lead us to examine the extent to which structural problems, such as a lack of equal\nopportunity and challenges to combining work and family, are holding back women’s\nadvancement.\nAs I mentioned earlier, the gap in earnings between men and women has\nnarrowed substantially, but progress has slowed lately, and women working full time still\nearn about 17 percent less than men, on average, each week. 28 Even when we compare\nmen and women in the same or similar occupations who appear nearly identical in\nbackground and experience, a gap of about 10 percent typically remains. 29 As such, we\ncannot rule out that gender-related impediments hold back women, including outright\n\n26\n\nThe labor force participation rate for all women declined from a peak of 60 percent in 1999 and 2000 and\nnow stands a bit below 57 percent. However, as has been documented elsewhere, much of the decline for\nall women can be explained by the aging of the baby boomers into their retirement years and lower\nparticipation among teens and young adults. It is also possible that the labor force participation rate is still\nbeing held down a bit by the waning effects of the Great Recession. Aaronson and others (2014).\n27\nAaronson and others (2014). Also see Council of Economic Advisers (2016) and the studies cited\ntherein.\n28\nBlau and Kahn (2016).\n29\nManning and Swaffield (2008) find that although men and women enter the British labor force earning\nthe same amount, among those who worked continuously and full time for 10 years, women would still\nearn 8 percent less than men, even if they have the same personality traits, were childless, and profess no\ninterest in having children. Also see Blau and Kahn (2016) and Noonan, Corcoran, and Courant (2005).\n\n\f- 14 discrimination, attitudes that reduce women’s success in the workplace, and an absence\nof mentors.\nRecent research has shown that although women now enter professional schools\nin numbers nearly equal to men, they are still substantially less likely to reach the highest\nechelons of their professions. 30 For instance, 47 percent of students at top-50 law schools\nare female, and women obtain 40 percent of M.B.A.’s from top programs. Nonetheless,\nwomen are still poorly represented among corporate CEOs, as partners in top law firms,\nand as executives in finance. 31 Even in my own field of economics, women constitute\nonly about one-third of Ph.D. recipients, a number that has barely budged in two\ndecades. 32 This lack of success in climbing the professional ladder would seem to\nexplain why the wage gap actually remains largest for those at the top of the earnings\ndistribution. 33\nOne of the primary factors contributing to the failure of these highly skilled\nwomen to reach the tops of their professions and earn equal pay is that top jobs in fields\nsuch as law and business require longer workweeks and penalize taking time off. This\nwould have a disproportionately large effect on women, who continue to bear the lion’s\nshare of domestic and child-rearing responsibilities. 34 Within academia, the short\ntimeframe in which assistant professors have to prove themselves good candidates for\n\n30\n\nMoran (2015); Olson (2016).\nOn the status of women in finance and corporations see Bertrand, Goldin, and Katz (2010) and the\nstudies cited therein.

If it is costly\nfor employees to share information and split the work, then there would be a high\npremium, in the form of compensation, for those who can work the long hours. 36\nWorkplaces where the income of employees depends on the effort of co-workers, such as\nlaw partnerships, also have an incentive to require long workweeks. 37\nBut however sensible such arrangements may be from a business perspective, it\ncan be difficult for women to meet the demands in these fields once they have children.\nThe very fact that these types of jobs require such long hours likely discourages some\nwomen--as well as men--from pursuing these career tracks. Advances in technology\nhave facilitated greater work-sharing and flexibility in scheduling, and there are further\nopportunities in this direction. 38 Economic models also suggest that while it can be\ndifficult for any one employer to move to a model with shorter hours, if many firms were\nto change their model, they and their workers could all be better off. 39\nOf course, most women are not employed in fields that require such long hours or\nthat impose such severe penalties for taking time off. But the difficulty of balancing\nwork and family is a widespread problem. In fact, the recent trend in many occupations\n\n35\n\nUnfortunately, in contrast to some of the successful gender neutral policies I discuss below, efforts to\naddress the tenure problem by giving all new parents extra time before the tenure decision has actually had\nthe effect of reducing female tenure rates and raising those of men. Antecol, Bedrard and Stearns, (2016).\n36\nGoldin (2014).\n37\nSee, for example, Akerlof (1976) and Landers, Rebitzer, and Taylor (1996).\n38\nSee the discussion in Goldin (2014), p. 117.\n39\nLanders, Rebitzer, and Taylor (1996), p. 334.\n\n\f- 16 is to demand complete scheduling flexibility, which can result in too few hours of work\nfor those with family demands and can make it difficult to schedule childcare. 40 Reforms\nthat encourage companies to provide some predictability in schedules, cross-train\nworkers to perform different tasks, or require a minimum guaranteed number of hours in\nexchange for flexibility could improve the lives of workers holding such jobs. Another\nproblem is that in most states, childcare is affordable for fewer than half of all families. 41\nAnd just 5 percent of workers with wages in the bottom quarter of the wage distribution\nhave jobs that provide them with paid family leave. 42 This circumstance puts many\nwomen in the position of having to choose between caring for a sick family member and\nkeeping their jobs.\nIn this context, it is useful to compare the workforce experiences of American\nwomen to those in other advanced economies. In 1990, the labor force participation rate\nin the United States of prime working-age women, 74 percent, was higher than in all but\na few industrialized nations. But in the intervening years, while the participation rate of\nU.S. women was roughly stable, elsewhere it increased steadily, and by 2010 the United\nStates fell to 17th place out of 22 advanced economies with respect to female labor force\nparticipation. 43 A number of studies have examined the role of various public policies in\nexplaining patterns in female labor force participation across countries. These studies\nfind that policy differences--in particular, the expansion of paid leave following\nchildbirth, steps to improve the availability and affordability of childcare, and increased\navailability of part-time work--go a long way toward explaining the divergence between\n\n40\n\nCajner and others (2014); Lambert, Haley-Lock, and Henly (2012).\nBivens and others (2016).\n42\nBureau of Labor Statistics (2016).\n43\nBlau and Kahn (2013).\n41\n\n\f- 17 advanced economies. 44 Evidence suggests that if the United States had policies in place\nsuch as those employed in many European countries, female labor force participation\ncould be as high as 82 percent. 45\nHowever, these policies entail tradeoffs. Women in other advanced economies\nare more likely than women in the United States to be employed part time, which could\nreflect a greater ease in arranging flexible schedules and more time with family, but it\nalso comes with costs, including a wage penalty and fewer opportunities for training and\nadvancement. Such findings raise the question of whether the policies enacted overseas\nin recent years have had the unintended consequence of making it more expensive for\nemployers there to hire women into full-time jobs with opportunities for advancement, as\nwomen are more likely to be eligible for and to make use of such benefits. 46\nThis possibility should inform our own thinking about policies to make it easier\nfor women and men to combine their family and career aspirations. For instance,\nimproving access to affordable and good quality childcare would appear to fit the bill, as\nit has been shown to support full-time employment. 47 Recently, there also seems to be\nsome momentum for providing families with paid leave at the time of childbirth. The\nexperience in Europe suggests picking policies that do not narrowly target childbirth, but\ninstead can be used to meet a variety of the health and caregiving responsibilities. 48\n\n44\n\nNote that Blau and Kahn (2013) do not find that improvement in the provision of childcare in other\nadvanced economies relative to the United States explain the divergence in participation since the 1990s;\nhowever, Thévenon (2013) finds that the greater provision of childcare has a positive effect on full-time\nemployment.\n45\nBlau and Kahn (2013), p. 7.\n46\nIn most European countries, men are significantly less likely than women to use paid parental leave,\nalthough in a few countries, including Sweden and Iceland, over 40 percent of users of parental leave are\nmen (OECD, 2016).\n47\nThévenon (2013), p. 26.\n48\nIn testimony before the Joint Economic Committee and the House Subcommittee on the Federal\nWorkforce, Postal Service, and the District of Columbia, a breakdown of claims on New Jersey’s short-\n\n\f- 18 Conclusion\nThe United States faces a number of longer-term economic challenges, including\nthe aging of the population and the low growth rate of productivity. One recent study\nestimates that increasing the female participation rate to that of men would raise our gross\ndomestic product by 5 percent. 49 And, as I have argued, our workplaces and families, as\nwell as women themselves, would benefit from continued progress. However, a number\nof factors, which I have only had a chance to touch upon, appear to be holding women\nback, including the difficulty women currently have in trying to combine their careers\nwith other aspects of their lives, including caregiving. In looking to solutions, we should\nconsider improvements to work environments and policies that benefit not only women,\nbut all workers. Pursuing such a strategy would be in keeping with the story of the rise in\nwomen’s involvement in the workforce, which, as I have described here, has contributed\nnot only to their own well-being but more broadly to the welfare and prosperity of our\ncountry.\nThe title for my remarks today, “So We All Can Succeed,” was inspired by\nMalala Yousafzai, the advocate for girls’ and women’s education, who said, “We cannot\nall succeed when half of us are held back.” 50 Brown University has played its own role\nby admitting women 125 years ago, by educating many thousands of women over the\n\nterm disability program in 2000 showed that pregnancy and childbirth constituted just 15 percent of all\nclaims (Lovell, 2008).\n49\nAguirre and others (2012).\n50\nYousafzai (2013), paragraph 22.\nNote: On May 5, 2017, a typo was corrected to change 83 to 93 in the following sentence on page 8: “By\nthe early 1990s, the labor force participation rate of prime working-age women--those between the ages of\n25 and 54--reached just over 74 percent, compared with roughly 83 percent for prime working-age men.”\n\n\f- 19 decades, and by continuing to be a place that equips men and women with the means to\nmake our nation and the world a better place.\n\n\f- 20 References\nAaronson, Stephanie, Tomaz Cajner, Bruce Fallick, Felix Galbis-Reig, Christopher\nSmith, and William Wascher (2014). “Labor Force Participation: Recent\nDevelopments and Future Prospects,” Brookings Papers on Economic Activity,\nFall, pp. 197-275, https://www.brookings.edu/wpcontent/uploads/2016/07/Fall2014BPEA_Aaronson_et_al.pdf.\nAguirre, DeAnne, Leila Hoteit, Christine Rupp, and Karim Sabbagh (2012).\nEmpowering the Third Billion: Women and the World of Work in 2012.

Yellen\nChair\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\n“Creating a Just Economy,” the 2017 annual conference of the\nNational Community Reinvestment Coalition\nWashington, D.C.\n\nMarch 28, 2017\n\n\fThank you for this opportunity to be part of the National Community\nReinvestment Coalition’s annual conference. It is a pleasure to address a group of\norganizations committed to improving the lives of low- and moderate-income Americans\nand strengthening communities. I am especially pleased to be with you in 2017, which\nmarks the 40th anniversary of the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA).\nAs you know, the CRA requires banks to help meet the credit needs of the\ncommunities they are chartered to serve, including low- and moderate-income\nneighborhoods. Since its enactment, the CRA has helped channel capital into\ncommunities and, in the process, supported innovative and effective approaches to\ncommunity development.\nWe at the Federal Reserve take our CRA responsibilities seriously. We evaluate\nthe CRA performance of the state-chartered banks we supervise and make the ratings and\nwritten evaluations public. 1 We currently are improving our examination procedures and\nexaminer training. We also work with our fellow bank regulators to continually improve\nour implementation of the law. And, as many of you know, we recently revised our\ninteragency guidance to clarify how various community development activities are\nconsidered in assessing CRA performance, among them workforce development, which\nis my topic today. 2\nWorkforce Development Initiatives and Challenges\nWorkforce development is a bit of a catchall phrase encompassing different types\nof initiatives that help prepare people for jobs by providing them with training, placement\n\n1\n\nCRA information is available on the Board’s website at\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/apps/crape/BankRating.aspx.\n2\nSee the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council’s CRA webpage “Interagency Questions and\nAnswers” available at https://www.ffiec.gov/cra/qnadoc.htm.\n\n\f-2assistance, and other support. Organizations dedicated to providing workforce\ndevelopment are interested not just in helping people secure any jobs, but jobs that pay\nwell, provide benefits, offer opportunities for advancement, and are less likely to be\neliminated during economic downturns. Significant job market changes in recent years,\nbrought about by global competition and technological advances--and the new and\nshifting skills that these changes demand--make workforce development more important\nthan ever before.\nAs community development practitioners, you know that good-paying, stable jobs\nare not only important to workers and their families, but also are the foundation of strong\nneighborhoods. As part of our CRA responsibilities, the Federal Reserve, together with\nthe Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Office of the Comptroller of the\nCurrency, has made it clear that banks will receive CRA recognition for lending to,\ninvesting in, and providing services to workforce development initiatives. In fact, two\nFederal Reserve Banks recently published a framework describing how workforce\ndevelopment initiatives can fit within a bank’s broader CRA strategy. 3\nWhile the job market for the United States as a whole has improved markedly\nsince the depths of the financial crisis, the persistently higher unemployment rates in\nlower-income and minority communities show why workforce development is so\nessential. For instance, unemployment rates averaged 13 percent in low- and moderate-\n\n3\n\nSee Elizabeth Sobel Blum and Steven Shepelwich (2017), Engaging Workforce Development: A\nFramework for Meeting CRA Obligations, Federal Reserve Banks of Dallas and Kansas City (Dallas: FRB\nDallas, January), https://www.dallasfed.org/-/media/Documents/cd/pubs/workforce.pdf?la=en.\n\n\f-3income communities from 2011 through 2015, compared with 7.3 percent in higherincome communities. 4\nThe challenges for workers in minority communities are even greater. The\naverage unemployment rate across all census tracts where minorities made up a majority\nof the population averaged 14.3 percent from 2011 through 2015. Also, a much smaller\nshare of the prime working-age population in these areas is employed--67.7 percent\nduring this period, which is nearly 9 percentage points lower than in communities with\nsmaller minority populations. 5 These elevated unemployment rates and depressed\nemployment-to-population ratios underscore the strong need for effective workforce\ndevelopment options for these communities.\nEducation as a Workforce Development Strategy\nProbably the most important workforce development strategy is improving the\nquality of general education. The rapid rise in U.S. education levels in the 20th century,\nfacilitated by the growing availability of high school education in the first part of the\ncentury and the rapid expansion of public universities after World War II, contributed\nenormously to the broad-based economic gains associated with that period. 6 But,\nunfortunately, for a wide variety of reasons that are beyond the scope of this talk,\neducation levels have historically lagged in low- and moderate-income communities,\n\n4\n\nLow- and moderate-income communities are census tracts with a family median income under 80 percent\nof the area median income. Higher-income communities are census tracts with median incomes of 80\npercent of the area median income or greater. Statistics represent the average of census tract\nunemployment rates rather than the unemployment rate across all individuals in these tracts combined.\n5\nPrime-age workers are those who are aged 25 to 54. Statistics are from the American Community Survey\n(ACS) data releases from 2011 through 2015, available on the U.S. Census Bureau’s website at\nhttps://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs.\n6\nSee Claudia Goldin (2001), “The Human-Capital Century and American Leadership: Virtues of the Past,”\nJournal of Economic History, vol. 61 (June), pp. 263-92, https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aopcambridge-core/content/view/S0022050701028017.\n\n\f-4particularly communities of color. Between 2011 and 2015, the average proportion of\nadults in low- and moderate-income communities who had dropped out of high school\nwas 23.5 percent, which is more than double the 10.9 percent rate in higher-income\ncommunities during that period. 7\nWhen students from low- and moderate-income families do complete high\nschool, they are less likely to pursue a college degree. And when they do attend college,\nthose students are less likely to graduate. 8 Among the reasons for the disparity are a lack\nof money to pay for college and the burden of family responsibilities. 9 As a result, the\nproportion of adults in low- and moderate-income communities from 2011 through 2015\nwho had a four-year college degree or graduate degree was about half the share in higherincome communities--17.6 percent versus 34 percent. 10\nThis educational disparity matters because, among many reasons, people with less\neducation experience both higher unemployment and lower average earnings. In\nDecember 2016, for example, the unemployment rate for people aged 25 and older with a\nbachelor’s or higher degree was only 2.6 percent. However, the rate was nearly double,\n\n7\nAdults are defined here as individuals aged 25 and older. Statistics are from the ACS data releases from\n2011 through 2015; see note 5.\n8\nFollowing a cohort of high school sophomores in 2002, 96 percent of students from a high\nsocioeconomic-status family pursued at least some higher education and 60 percent completed a bachelor’s\ndegree. Among students from a low socioeconomic-status family, 72 percent pursued higher education and\n14 percent completed a bachelor’s degree. Socioeconomic status is based on family income and parents’\neducation. See National Center for Education Statistics (2015), “Postsecondary Attainment: Differences\nby Socioeconomic Status,” in The Condition of Education 2015 (Washington: NCES),\nhttps://nces.ed.gov/programs/coe/pdf/coe_tva.pdf.\n9\nMany people who did not enroll for or did not complete a degree also gave as a reason that they wanted to\nwork, which may also reflect budget constraints that made pursuing or completing a higher education\ndifficult. See Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2016), Report on the Economic WellBeing of U.S. Families in 2015 (Washington: Board of Governors, May),\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/2015-report-economic-well-being-us-households-201605.pdf.\n10\nSee note 7.\n\n\f-55.1 percent, for workers in this age group with only a high school diploma and about\ntriple, 7.9 percent, for those without a high school degree. 11\nWhile high school graduates earn somewhat more than people who did not finish\nhigh school, the big payoff comes with a four-year college or advanced degree. 12 The\nadvantages of higher education, evidenced by lower unemployment rates and higher\nearnings, are clear across the spectrum but are greater for non-Hispanic whites than for\nAfrican Americans and Hispanics.\nImproving educational levels in low- and moderate-income communities is a\nlong-term task. At least partially because of a lack of early childhood education and the\nsometimes lower quality of schools, children in these neighborhoods score substantially\nlower on standardized tests and drop out of high school at higher rates. 13 Thus, a starting\npoint is to improve access to quality education in early childhood and improve the quality\nof primary and secondary schooling.\n\n11\nMoreover, “over 95 percent of jobs created during the recovery have gone to workers with at least some\ncollege education, while those with a high school diploma or less are being left behind” (as quoted from the\nintroduction on the webpage for Anthony P. Carnevale, Tamara Jayasundera, and Artem Gulish (2016),\nAmerica’s Divided Recovery: College Haves and Have-Nots (Washington: Georgetown University Center\nfor Education and the Workforce), https://cew.georgetown.edu/cew-reports/americas-divided-recovery).\nAlso see Bureau of Labor Statistics (2017), “The Employment Situation--February 2017,” news release,\nMarch 10, Table A-4: Employment Status of the Civilian Population 25 Years and over by Educational\nAttainment, https://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.t04.htm; and BLS (2017), “Labor Force Statistics\nfrom the Current Population Survey,” March 10, Table A-10: Unemployment Rates by Age, Sex, and\nMarital Status, Seasonally Adjusted, https://www.bls.gov/web/empsit/cpseea10.htm.\n12\nThe median weekly earnings for men with a high school degree but no college was $779, and for women\nit was $603. These amounts compare with median weekly earnings of $1,501 for men and $1,117 for\nwomen with a bachelor’s or higher degree.\n13\nSee Sean F. Reardon (2016), School District Socioeconomic Status, Race, and Academic Achievement,\npaper, Stanford Center for Education Policy Analysis (Stanford: Stanford CEPA),\nhttps://cepa.stanford.edu/content/school-district-socioeconomic-status-race-and-academic-achievement;\nMotoko Rich, Amanda Cox, and Matthew Bloch (2016), “Money, Race and Success: How Your School\nDistrict Compares,” New York Times, April 29,\nhttp://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/04/29/upshot/money-race-and-success-how-your-school-districtcompares.html; and Geoffrey T. Wodtke, David J. Harding, and Felix Elwert (2011), “Neighborhood\nEffects in Temporal Perspective,” American Sociological Review, vol.76 (October), pp. 713-36.\n\n\f-6We must also recognize and address the barriers faced by low- and moderateincome students trying to attain higher levels of education--barriers not typically faced by\ntheir more well-off peers. First, these students often do not have friends or family who\nhave achieved higher educational levels, which matters because students whose parents\ndid not attend college are much less likely to pursue a college degree themselves. 14 Even\nso, these students can benefit from high school counselors or other mentors who can\nassist them in choosing schools that provide the financial and counseling support that will\nhelp them complete their degrees. And they can benefit from help in picking majors and\ndegrees that lead to higher earnings. 15\nSecond, lower-income students often pursue their education while working to\nsupport themselves and family members. Educational programs that help students\nbalance these competing responsibilities go a long way to improving completion rates. In\nrecognition of this fact, the U.S. Department of Education is offering competitive grants\nto postsecondary institutions to support or establish campus-based childcare programs\nprimarily serving the needs of low-income students. 16\nI want to reiterate that addressing the particular barriers standing in the way of\nlower-income students attending college and earning a degree requires a long-term\n\n14\nFor example, 65 percent of young adults (aged 25 to 34) with a parent who received a bachelor’s degree\ncompleted one themselves, compared with 16 percent of young adults whose parents completed no\neducation beyond high school.

However, not every student wants a two- or four-year degree or will have the\nfinancial wherewithal to pursue and complete a postsecondary degree. To support\nprograms aimed at students not bound for college, in 2015, the Federal Reserve Banks of\nPhiladelphia, Cleveland, and Atlanta identified occupations with above-average wages\nfor workers without a bachelor's degree in the country’s 100 largest metropolitan areas. 17\nThe Reserve Banks made this information available to workforce development providers\nonline and in workshops. Educational programs and training that lead to better paying\nand more steady work are crucial for people without college degrees, particularly lowerincome workers.\nWorkforce Development Programs in Action\nIn the rest of my remarks, I would like to highlight some examples of successful\ninitiatives that illustrate key features of effective workforce development. 18 As you\nknow, within our community affairs offices, the Federal Reserve devotes considerable\neffort to studying and promoting effective workforce development, so I am able to draw\n\n17\n\nTop occupations noted across all MSAs included the following: registered nurses; first-line supervisors\nof office and administrative support workers; sales representatives, wholesale and manufacturing; business\noperations specialists, sales representative services; general and operations managers; computer system\nanalysts; automotive service technicians and mechanics; first-line supervisors of construction trades and\nextraction work; plumbers, pipefitters, and steamfitters; first-line supervisors of mechanics, installers; and\nconstruction laborers. See Keith Wardrip, Kyle Fee, Lisa Nelson, and Stuart Andreason, Identifying\nOpportunity Occupations in the Nation’s Largest Metropolitan Economies, Federal Reserve Banks of\nPhiladelphia, Cleveland, and Ohio (Cleveland: FSB of Cleveland), available at\nhttps://www.clevelandfed.org/newsroom-and-events/publications/special-reports/sr-20150909-identifyingopportunity-occupations.aspx.\n18\nFor a broad summary of recent research and policy issues related to workforce development, see the 2015\npublication Transforming U.S. Workforce Development Policies for the 21st Century (available at\nhttps://www.kansascityfed.org/publications/community/transformworkforce) developed by the Federal\nReserve Banks of Atlanta and Kansas City in partnership with the John J. Heldrich Center for Workforce\nDevelopment at Rutgers University. In addition, all Reserve Banks and the Board of Governors are\ncurrently engaged in a System workforce development initiative that will gather up-to-date perspectives\nfrom employers and organizations engaged in worker training and education. This initiative will include a\nseries of regional Reserve Bank meetings, a publication on effective investments and outcomes, and a\ncapstone conference in October in Austin, Texas.\n\n\f-8on the knowledge and experience of our staff. In discussing the examples, I would like to\nmake five points.\nFirst, it is crucial for younger workers to establish a solid connection to\nemployment early in their work lives. The Federal Reserve’s 2013 Survey of Young\nWorkers found that 18- to 30-year-olds with early work experience were more likely to\nemerge from the recent recession with a permanent job. 19 Other studies have found that\nstudents who worked 20 hours per week in their senior year of high school earned higher\nwages later in life than those who did not, and that summer youth employment programs\nimproved participants’ attitudes toward their communities, raised their academic\naspirations, and boosted their job readiness skills. 20 The findings point to some of the\nreasons that the Boston Fed decided to lend technical support to a pilot program called\nPocket Change, which aims to reduce unemployment among low-income 18- to 24-yearolds in Somerville, Massachusetts, through internships, training in job skills, and\nreinforcement of important soft skills such as punctuality and effective communication.\nIn its first two years, the initiative trained 53 low-income young people and placed 20 of\nthem in jobs. The results of this modest program indicate the promise of efforts that\n\n19\n\nThe survey found that 82 percent of workers who had worked for pay during high school had a\npermanent job--4 percentage points higher than for all workers combined. See Board of Governors of the\nFederal Reserve System (2014), In the Shadow of the Great Recession: Experiences and Perspectives of\nYoung Workers (Washington: Board of Governors, November),\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/econresdata/2013-experiences-and-perspectives-of-young-workers201411.pdf.\n20\nBaum and Ruhm (2016) do observe, however, that these gains from employment during the\nsenior year of high school have diminished substantially relative to earlier cohorts. See Charles L.\nBaum and Christopher J. Ruhm (2016), “The Changing Benefits of Early Work Experience,”\nSouthern Economic Journal, vol. 83 (October), pp. 343-63.\n\n\f-9focus on first-time work experiences, and Somerville is now seeking to expand the\ninitiative. 21\nMy second observation is that career and technical education (CTE) programs,\nwhich have seen a revival in recent years, have considerable potential. For some time,\nvocational education had fallen out of favor or was in decline in the United States, as it\nwas associated with the deleterious practice of “tracking” less advantaged students that\ndenied them the opportunity for the best education. But more recently, CTE has been\nrefined and has made a comeback as an effective way to help non-college-bound workers\ngain valuable skills and obtain a foothold in a labor market that increasingly requires\ntechnical proficiency. These programs teach the skills needed to pursue careers in fields\nsuch as construction, manufacturing, health care, information technology, hospitality, and\nfinancial services.\nThis point brings me to my third observation, which is that effective CTE\nprograms and other workforce development initiatives are able to match education and\ntraining to good-paying jobs when they actively engage employers in the training\nprocess. WorkAdvance, a regional sector-specific program, is a good example. It\ndelivers an array of aligned services to meet local business needs and provide jobs for\nunemployed and low-income adults in multiple cities. 22 An evaluation of the program\nlast year in Tulsa, New York City, and northeast Ohio found it was especially effective\n\n21\nFor more information on Pocket Change, see the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston’s Working Cities\nChallenge webpage at\nhttps://www.bostonfed.org/workingcities/massachusetts/round1/cities/somerville.html.\n22\nAligned services may include intensive screening, occupational skills training, job development and\nplacement services, and retention and advancement services.\n\n\f- 10 because it offered training for in-demand skills and industry-recognized certifications,\nand it focused on jobs that have clear paths for advancement. 23\nA fourth observation is that apprenticeships, which are more common in other\ncountries, could play a larger role for low- and moderate-income individuals in our\ncountry as part of broader career and technical education efforts. For instance, a state-run\nprogram in South Carolina, Apprenticeship Carolina, helps employers develop\napprenticeships at no cost to them. Businesses receive a $1,000 annual tax credit per\napprenticeship, and the program assists them with information and technical needs,\npaperwork, and the integration of classroom learning at local technical colleges. The\nprogram has led to sizable job gains at a modest cost to the state. 24 Similarly,\nWashington State registered apprenticeship programs contributed to substantial long-term\nincreases in employment rates and hourly wages. 25\nMy fifth and final observation is that promoting entrepreneurship could play a\ngreater role in workforce development. Entrepreneurship is a fundamental strength of the\nAmerican economy, and owning your own business or working for yourself can offer\nincome, a means of building wealth, and, sometimes, greater flexibility for balancing job\nand family commitments. Yet we see less self-employment in low- and moderate-income\n\n23\n\nFor more on the WorkAdvance program, see the MDRC website at\nwww.mdrc.org/project/workadvance#overview, and for information on that program in Northeast Ohio, see\nthe Towards Employment website at http://towardsemployment.org/strategic-initiatives/workadvance.\n24\nSee Harry J.

Programs that equip people with the management skills and knowledge they\nneed to start and operate a successful small business can help. Relevant and effective\ntraining can reduce the failure rate of businesses by helping owners make better decisions\nand avoid costly mistakes. 28 These programs are especially critical in low-income and\nrural communities where other resources to support small business development may be\nscarce.\nAs part of their community affairs work, several Federal Reserve Banks have\nsmall business development initiatives. The Federal Reserve Bank of New York\norganized a small business protection and education series last year in partnership with\nthe Brooklyn Chamber of Commerce and a local development corporation. Participants\nlearned about capital resources available to small businesses, online credit alternatives for\nsmall businesses, and the risks of handling large volumes of cash. In another example,\nthe Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City developed a guide to help rural and smaller\n\n26\n\nFrom 2011 through 2015, only 8 percent of households in low- and moderate-income communities\nreported self-employment income, compared with 11 percent of all households (see ACS data releases in\nnote 5).\n27\nOnly 4 percent of African American-owned firms and 9 percent of Hispanic-owned firms have paid\nemployees, compared with 22 percent of non-minority-owned firms; see U.S. Department of Commerce,\nMinority Business Development Agency (2016), “U.S. Minority-Owned Firms,” fact sheet (Washington:\nMBDA, January), www.mbda.gov/sites/default/files/2012SBO_MBEFactSheet020216.pdf.\n28\nSee Glenn Muske and Nancy Stanforth (2000), “The Educational Needs of Small Business Owners: A\nLook into the Future,” Journal of Extension, vol. 38 (December),\nhttps://www.joe.org/joe/2000december/a4.php.\n\n\f- 12 metropolitan communities promote conditions favorable to growing local businesses\nrather than relying only on efforts to attract large companies. 29\nOf course, in addition to training, small business owners need financing. But, as\nmany of you know, factors such as lack of a credit history or a poor credit history and\nlimited collateral--for example, home equity--make it difficult for the owners of small\nenterprises to access traditional business credit. This situation is true for many minority,\nwomen, and low-income borrowers. 30 Nontraditional lenders, including more than 1,000\nCommunity Development Financial Institutions around the country, help fill the gap. 31\nConclusion\nTo conclude, while the economy overall is recovering and the job market has\nimproved substantially since the recession, pockets of persistently high unemployment, as\nwell as other challenges, remain.

Yellen\nChair\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\n“Strong Foundations: The Economic Futures of Kids and Communities,” the\n10th Biennial Federal Reserve System Community Development Research Conference\n\nWashington, D.C.\n\nMarch 23, 2017\n\n\fI would like to welcome all of you and thank you for joining us to discuss a set of\ntopics of considerable importance to our country. This is the Federal Reserve’s 10th\nbiennial community development research conference, dedicated as always to issues of\nsignificance to people and communities around the country. The conference is\ncosponsored by, and includes substantive contributions from, the community\ndevelopment offices of all 12 Federal Reserve Banks as well as the Board of Governors.\nThat united effort and level of commitment reflects how consequential we consider these\nissues to be. This conference is intended to present and highlight rigorous research that I\nam confident will inform how you think about your own work, whether from the\nperspective of policymaking, community development practice, or research.\nOur last conference, two years ago, explored various aspects of economic\nmobility, largely among adults. This year, we gather to discuss “The Economic Futures\nof Kids and Communities,” and, in part, I see this topic as an extension of that earlier\nconversation about mobility.\nToday and tomorrow, we focus on research about the foundation or building\nblocks for economic success that are laid even before young people enter the workforce\nand assume responsibility for their own finances.\nWe will hear from leading experts on a range of issues related to how children,\nyouths, and young adults are shaped in ways that may ultimately affect their ability later\nto productively contribute to the economy and manage their finances. We can learn from\nwhat the data and analysis tell us, and our hope is that making use of this information will\nlead to more effective programs and policies and thus better outcomes.\n\n\f-2Considerable evidence shows that growing up poor makes it harder to succeed as\nan adult, and new research by the Fed likewise shows the strong connection between the\ntypical experiences of poverty in childhood and economic challenges later as an adult.\nThe data come from the Board’s latest Survey of Household Economics and\nDecisionmaking (SHED), which will be published later this spring.1 In the most recent\nsurvey, we asked some of the younger respondents--aged 25 to 39--to think about their\nchildhoods. We asked those young adults whether, during their childhoods, they found\nthemselves worrying about having enough food to eat, having a stable caregiver, or about\ntheir personal safety. About 10 percent said they regularly worried about one or more of\nthese concerns, and an additional 19 percent said they sometimes worried about them.\nWe were then able to compare responses about their experiences in childhood to\nwhat these young adults told us about their current circumstances. Some pretty clear\npatterns emerged. Of those young adults who regularly had one or more of these\nchildhood concerns growing up, more than one-half say that they are currently facing\nchallenges in getting by financially. This fraction compares to just over one-fourth of\nthose who said they never, or only rarely, worried about these concerns as children that\nnow experience this level of financial challenge. Young adults who regularly or\nsometimes worried when they were children about their care, safety, or having enough to\neat are also less likely to be employed, less likely to have consistent income month-to-\n\n1\n\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (forthcoming), 2016 Survey of Household Economics\nand Decisionmaking (Washington: Board of Governors).

This conference is about understanding what kinds of environments and\nresources can best help children meet with economic success after they reach adulthood.\nThere has been a lot of discussion in the aftermath of the Great Recession about how to\nbest connect people with steady jobs. But research presented over the next two days\nmakes a compelling case that there is a need to also think longer term about how to\nprepare people for success in the labor market. In fact, this research underscores the\nvalue of starting young to develop basic work habits and skills, like literacy, numeracy,\nand interpersonal and organizational skills. These habits and skills help prepare people\nfor work, help them enter the labor market sooner, meet with more success over time, and\nbe in a position to develop the more specialized skills and obtain the academic credentials\nthat are strongly correlated with higher and steadier earnings. Indeed, a growing body of\neconomic and education literature has focused on the relative efficiency of addressing\nworkforce development challenges through investments in early childhood development\nand education compared with interventions later in life.\nI believe that data, evidence, and research can help policymakers and practitioners\nthink more clearly about the implications for improving economic and life outcomes for\neveryone. To this end, the speakers at this conference will focus on three broad issues. I\n\n2\n\nSee note 1.\n\n\f-4would like to briefly mention each, highlighting some of the questions that I believe can\nbe informed by the research that will be presented here.\nFirst, this morning’s panel will address early childhood development and\neducation. In recent years, medicine and social science has revealed more than we ever\nhave known before about which factors and experiences in childhood can make a\ndifference later in life. However, many questions demand further attention. A\nfundamental one is how positive developmental outcomes can be promoted among those\nwho were not born into families with socioeconomic advantages. While we do know\nthere are advantages to good quality early childhood education, we should strive to better\nunderstand what kind of returns on investment this education provides and how to\nmaximize these returns. The answers to these questions may influence thinking about\nhow programs and interventions meant to assist kids and their families should be\nstructured for maximum effectiveness to help put kids on the road to economic success.\nSecond, researchers have explored the effects of neighborhoods and community\nconditions on the development of young people. Some presenters at this conference will\nshare their understanding of how physical surroundings influence personal development.\nFor instance, how do the form and quality of community institutions such as schools,\ncommunity centers, and libraries play a role? What other kinds of community\ncharacteristics--such as public safety, transportation, and environmental quality--might\nhelp or hinder general education and financial skill development? A particularly\nimportant question is how kids’ home environments affect them in ways that matter for\ntheir future economic success. It is also critically important to ask, what kinds of\ninterventions have proven track records, and are these programs scalable?\n\n\f-5Third, and finally, other presenters will explore issues around skill development\nof youths and young adults, workforce outcomes, and the implications for the broader\neconomy. They will ask how we understand which formative experiences most affect the\nability of young people to successfully move to the next chapter in their lives, whether\nthat means college, a job, or other paths such as self-employment. What role does a\nrange of programs--starting with early childhood education all the way through youth\nvocational or apprenticeship training--play in affecting job readiness? How effective are\ndifferent approaches, and what are the returns on investment? We should also pay\nattention to how well young people form the sorts of “soft skills”--things like teamwork,\ncommunication, and the ability to handle conflict--that are so valued by employers. And,\nfor young people whose paths become difficult, such as those who get caught up in the\njuvenile justice system, what effect do such experiences have on their futures as workers\nand consumers, and what are the most promising approaches to foster a course\ncorrection?\nI hope that the data and other evidence presented today and tomorrow are of use\nto you in your work. Community development professionals attending this conference\nmay consider how the design and implementation of their programs may be improved.\nPolicymakers may look more closely at how kids are affected--purposefully or\nunintentionally--by public policies. And researchers may encounter ideas that spark new\nwork that can shed further light on these important topics.\nI think it is important that we better understand these issues, and I applaud you for\ntaking the time to be here to share your knowledge and to learn. Our young people are\nthe future, and we all want them to have the support they need for successful and\n\n\f-6fulfilling lives. As a central banker, I recognize the benefits to the broader economy\nwhen more people are better prepared for work and for managing their finances. In short,\nensuring that all of our kids have “strong foundations” will help build a similarly strong\nfoundation for the U.S. economy.\n\n\f"

Yellen\nChair\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\nThe Executives’ Club of Chicago\n\nChicago Hilton\n720 S. Michigan Avenue\nChicago, Illinois\n\nMarch 3, 2017\n\n\fI am pleased to join you today to discuss the U.S. economy and the Federal\nReserve’s monetary policy. I strongly believe that my colleagues and I should explain, as\nclearly as we can, both the reasons for our decisions and the fundamental principles that\nunderlie our strategy.\nToday I will review the conduct of monetary policy during the nearly 10 years\nsince the onset of the financial crisis. Although the Federal Reserve’s policy strategy for\nsystematically pursuing its congressionally mandated goals of maximum employment\nand price stability has not changed during this period, the Federal Open Market\nCommittee (FOMC) has made significant tactical adjustments along the way. I will\nspend most of my time today discussing the rationale for the adjustments the Committee\nhas made since 2014, a year that I see as a turning point, when the FOMC began to\ntransition from providing increasing amounts of accommodation to gradually scaling it\nback.\nThe process of scaling back accommodation has so far proceeded at a slower pace\nthan most FOMC participants anticipated in 2014. Both unexpected economic\ndevelopments and deeper reevaluations of structural trends affecting the U.S. and global\neconomies prompted us to reassess our views on the outlook and associated risks and,\nconsequently, the appropriate stance of monetary policy, both in the near term and the\nlonger run. Looking ahead, we continue to expect the evolution of the economy to\nwarrant further gradual increases in the target range for the federal funds rate. However,\ngiven how close we are to meeting our statutory goals, and in the absence of new\ndevelopments that might materially worsen the economic outlook, the process of scaling\nback accommodation likely will not be as slow as it was in 2015 and 2016.\n\n\f-2I should note that I will discuss the process of scaling back accommodation\nmostly from the perspective of our interest rate decisions, which my FOMC colleagues\nand I see as our primary tool for actively adjusting the stance of monetary policy when\nour actions are not constrained by the zero lower bound on short-term interest rates. 1\nAssessing the Degree of Monetary Policy Accommodation\nIn our monetary policy deliberations, the FOMC always faces two fundamental\nquestions: First, how do we assess the current stance of monetary policy? Second, what\nare the strategic and tactical considerations that underpin our decisions about the\nappropriate stance of monetary policy going forward? These questions are difficult\nbecause the interactions between monetary policy and the economy are complex. Policy\naffects the economy through many different channels, and, in turn, many factors\ninfluence the appropriate course of policy.\nGauging the current stance of monetary policy requires arriving at a judgment of\nwhat would constitute a neutral policy stance at a given time. A useful concept in this\nregard is the neutral “real” federal funds rate, defined as the level of the federal funds rate\nthat, when adjusted for inflation, is neither expansionary nor contractionary when the\neconomy is operating near its potential. In effect, a “neutral” policy stance is one where\nmonetary policy neither has its foot on the brake nor is pressing down on the accelerator.\nAlthough the concept of the neutral real federal funds rate is exceptionally useful in\nassessing policy, it is difficult in practical terms to know with precision where that rate\n\n1\n\nWhen the federal funds rate was near zero and we felt the economy still needed more support, the FOMC\nacted, beginning in 2008, to purchase longer-term securities. Although we stopped increasing the size of\nour securities portfolio in 2014, we have been reinvesting principal payments from our securities holdings\never since. We have said that we expect to maintain this policy until normalization of the level of the\nfederal funds rate is well under way. We have also said that, when it becomes appropriate to reduce the\nsize of our balance sheet, we will do so primarily by letting maturing assets run off our balance sheet.\n\n\f-3stands. As a result, and as I described in a recent speech, my colleagues and I consider a\nwide range of information when assessing that rate. 2 As I will discuss, our assessments\nof the neutral rate have significantly shifted down over the past few years.\nIn the Committee’s most recent projections last December, most FOMC\nparticipants assessed the longer-run value of the neutral real federal funds rate to be in\nthe vicinity of 1 percent. 3 This level is quite low by historical standards, reflecting, in\npart, slow productivity growth and an aging population not only in the United States, but\nalso in many advanced economies. Moreover, the current value of the neutral real\nfederal funds rate appears to be even lower than this longer-run value because of several\nadditional headwinds to the U.S. economy in the aftermath of the financial crisis, such as\nsubdued economic growth abroad and perhaps a lingering sense of caution on the part of\nhouseholds and businesses in the wake of the trauma of the Great Recession.\nIt is difficult to say just how low the current neutral rate is because assessments of\nthe effect of post-recession headwinds on the current level of the neutral real rate are\nsubject to a great deal of uncertainty. Some recent estimates of the current value of the\nneutral real federal funds rate stand close to zero percent. 4 With the actual value of the\nreal federal funds rate currently near minus 1 percent, a near-zero estimate of the neutral\nreal rate means that the stance of monetary policy remains moderately accommodative,\nan assessment that is consistent with the fact that employment has been growing at a\npace--around 180,000 net new jobs per month--that is notably above the level estimated\n\n2\n\nSee Yellen (2017).\nThis estimate of the neutral real federal funds rate is based on the difference between the medians of the\nlonger-run projections for the federal funds rate and inflation submitted by individual FOMC participants\nfor the December 2016 FOMC meeting. The most recent Summary of Economic Projections, an addendum\nto the minutes of that meeting, is available on the Board’s website at\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomcminutes20161214ep.htm.\n4\nSee, for instance, Holston, Laubach, and Williams (2016).\n3\n\n\f-4to be consistent with the longer-run trend in labor force growth--between 75,000 and\n125,000 per month. 5 As I will explain, this policy stance seems appropriate given that\nthe underlying trend in inflation appears to be still running somewhat below 2 percent.\nBut as that gap closes, with labor market conditions now in the vicinity of our maximum\nemployment objective, the Committee considers it appropriate to move toward a neutral\npolicy stance.\nMy colleagues and I generally anticipate that the neutral real federal funds rate\nwill rise to its longer-run level over the next few years. This expectation partly underlies\nour view that gradual increases in the federal funds rate will likely be appropriate in the\nmonths and years ahead: Those increases would keep the economy from significantly\noverheating, thereby sustaining the expansion and maintaining price stability.\nPost-Crisis Period: Same Strategy, New Tactics\nI will now examine the strategic and tactical considerations that go into FOMC\ndeliberations by discussing past monetary policy decisions in the context of our mandate\nfrom the Congress to pursue maximum employment and price stability.\nThe FOMC’s monetary policy strategy is based on three basic principles. First,\nour monetary policy must be goal driven. We must take care to ensure that our decisions\nover time are consistent with our commitment to achieve the Federal Reserve’s\ncongressionally mandated goals of maximum employment and price stability, and that the\npublic understands and has confidence in that commitment. Second, our monetary policy\nmust be forward looking because our decisions tend to influence economic activity and\n\n5\n\nThe estimate of the actual value of the real federal funds rate (around minus 1 percent) is based on the\ndifference between the current value of the effective federal funds rate (close to 0.66 percent) and the latest\nreading on inflation as measured by the 12-month change in the price index for personal consumption\nexpenditures excluding energy and food items (1-3/4 percent).\n\n\f-5inflation with a substantial lag. Among other things, this implies looking through shortterm and transitory developments and focusing on the medium-term outlook--roughly\ntwo or three years out--when making policy decisions. Third, our monetary policy must\nbe risk sensitive. Because the outlook is uncertain, we must assess appropriate policy\nwith an eye toward the risk that our expectations about the economy turn out to be\nsignificantly wrong.\nWe have followed this basic strategy for decades and, in 2012, the FOMC\nformalized it in our “Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy.” 6\nThe Committee has reaffirmed this commitment annually. But the challenges brought\nabout by the financial crisis, and the very deep recession and painfully slow recovery that\nfollowed, compelled us to adjust our tactics for carrying out our policy strategy. In\nparticular, once the Committee had cut the federal funds rate to near zero in late 2008, it\nbecame necessary to deploy new tools to supply the considerable monetary\naccommodation required by the extremely weak state of the job market and persistently\nlow inflation. 7 Those tools--especially our large-scale securities purchases and\nincreasingly explicit forward guidance pertaining to the likely future path of the federal\nfunds rate--enabled the Federal Reserve to provide necessary additional support to the\nU.S. economy by pushing down longer-term interest rates and easing financial conditions\nmore generally.\nMuch has been written and said already about the provision of additional\naccommodation between 2008 and 2014, when the FOMC completed its latest round of\n\n6\n\nThe Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy is available on the Board’s website at\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/FOMC_LongerRunGoals.pdf.\n7\nSee Yellen (2016).\n\n\f-6large-scale securities purchases, so I will turn now to our policy stance since 2014, when\nthe FOMC’s main focus started to shift from providing additional accommodation to\nscaling it back. 8\n2014: A Turning Point for Monetary Policy\nBy late 2013, the FOMC concluded that the economy had made sufficient\nprogress, and the outlook was sufficiently favorable, that it should reduce the pace of its\nlarge-scale securities purchases. But we reiterated that these purchases would continue\nuntil the outlook for the labor market had improved substantially. The U.S. economy\nmade notable progress toward the FOMC’s statutory goals during 2014, with the\nunemployment rate dropping to close to 6 percent by mid-year--well below its GreatRecession peak of 10 percent--and other measures of labor market conditions also\nshowing improvement: Payroll gains were solid; job openings had risen significantly;\nand the number of workers voluntarily quitting their jobs--a sign of confidence in the\nlabor market--was rising back toward pre-crisis levels. We were also seeing progress on\nachieving our price stability goal: Total inflation as measured by changes in the headline\npersonal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index reached about 1-3/4 percent by\nmid-2014 after hovering around 1 percent in the fall of 2013. Inflation seemed to be\nmoving toward the FOMC’s 2 percent objective, a level that the FOMC judges to be\nconsistent with price stability because it is low enough that it does not need to figure\nprominently into people’s and businesses’ economic decisions but high enough to serve\nas a buffer against deflation and provide greater scope for monetary policy to address\neconomic weakness.\n\n8\n\nFor a discussion of our monetary policy during the 2008-14 period, see, for instance, Engen, Laubach, and\nReifschneider (2015).\n\n\f-7The progress seen during 2014 indicated to the FOMC that it was no longer\nnecessary to provide increasing amounts of support to the U.S. economy by continuing to\nadd to the Federal Reserve’s holdings of longer-term securities. Accordingly, the\nCommittee continued to reduce the pace of asset purchases over the course of the year,\nending its purchases in October. That step, however, did not mark an immediate shift\ntoward tighter monetary policy because we also indicated then that we did not expect to\nraise interest rates for a considerable time after the end of our securities purchases.\nMoreover, as the Committee explained in a set of “normalization principles” issued that\nSeptember, the intention was to maintain the overall size of the Federal Reserve’s balance\nsheet at an elevated level until sometime after the FOMC had begun to raise its target for\nthe federal funds rate. 9 We decided that maintaining a highly accommodative stance of\nmonetary policy remained appropriate because, while the U.S. economy was stronger and\ncloser to meeting our statutory goals, we saw significant room for improvement. In\nparticular, the unemployment rate still stood above our assessment of its longer-run\nnormal level--that is, the unemployment rate that we expect to prevail when the economy\nis operating at maximum employment--and inflation remained below the 2 percent\nobjective.\nBecause my colleagues and I expected that labor market conditions would\ncontinue to improve and that inflation would move back to 2 percent over the medium\n\n9\n\nThe FOMC’s Policy Normalization Principles and Plans are available on the Board’s website at\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/monetary/20140917c.htm.\nSeveral studies support the notion that maintaining the size of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet at an\nelevated level is consistent with keeping a highly accommodative policy stance, particularly when shortterm interest rates are close to zero, as it was the case in 2014--see, for instance, D’Amico and others\n(2012) and many of the references in Engen, Laubach, and Reifschneider (2015). Large Federal Reserve\nholdings of longer-term securities reduce the total amount of such securities available for purchase by the\npublic, exerting upward pressure on their prices and, thus, depressing their yields and contributing to lower\nborrowing costs for American families and businesses.\n\n\f-8term, we anticipated that the time was approaching when the economy would be strong\nenough that we should start to scale back our support. Indeed, the FOMC’s June 2014\nSummary of Economic Projections (SEP) reported that nearly all FOMC participants saw\na higher federal funds rate as appropriate in the next calendar year. In contrast, only two\nparticipants in December 2013 thought that it would be appropriate to start raising that\nrate in the next calendar year.\nUneven Progress in 2015 and into 2016\nIn 2015, the unemployment rate fell significantly faster than we generally had\nanticipated in 2014. However, a series of unanticipated global developments beginning\nin the second half of 2014--including a prolonged decline in oil prices, a sizable\nappreciation of the dollar, and financial market turbulence emanating from abroad--ended\nup having adverse implications for the outlook for inflation and economic activity in the\nUnited States, prompting the FOMC to remove monetary policy accommodation at a\nslower pace than we had anticipated in mid-2014.\nU.S. gross domestic product (GDP) growth generally surprised to the downside in\n2015, reflecting, in part, weak economic activity abroad, the earlier appreciation of the\ndollar, and the effect of falling oil prices on business fixed investment. This\nunanticipated slowing in the pace of the economic recovery caused us to worry about the\nsustainability of ongoing improvements in employment and, thus, of likely progress\ntoward our maximum employment goal. Our worry was reinforced by our assessment\nthat, with the federal funds rate still near zero, there would likely be only limited scope\nfor us to respond by lowering short-term rates if the weakening in economic activity\nturned out to be persistent. In contrast, if the weakening proved transitory and the\n\n\f-9economy instead began to overheat, threatening to push inflation to an undesirably high\nlevel, the FOMC would have ample scope to respond through tighter monetary policy.\nInflation also was lower than expected, with headline PCE prices rising less than\n1 percent over the course of 2015, instead of around 1-3/4 percent as we had anticipated\nin June 2014. Much of this shortfall reflected the effects of falling oil prices and the\nappreciation of the dollar. My colleagues and I typically look through the effects on\ninflation of fluctuations in oil prices and the dollar because these effects tend to be\ntransitory. However, we became concerned in 2015 about the risk that part of the decline\nin inflation could prove to be longer lasting, especially given that inflation had already\nbeen running below our 2 percent objective for quite some time. 10 These various\nconsiderations, along with our reassessment of longer-run economic conditions--which I\nwill discuss shortly--explain why the Committee ended up raising the target range for the\nfederal funds rate only 1/4 percentage point in 2015, substantially less than the full\npercentage point increase suggested by the median projection of FOMC participants\nreported in June 2014.\n2016 also brought some unexpected economic developments that led us to\nproceed cautiously. During the first half of the year, mixed readings on the job market,\nalong with additional disappointing data on real GDP growth, suggested again that\nprogress toward the achievement of our maximum employment goal could be slowing\nmarkedly. Meanwhile, inflation hovered just below 1 percent as dollar appreciation\ncontinued to exert downward pressure on import prices, and financial market turbulence\nemanating from abroad--associated with concerns about the Chinese economy and the\n\n10\n\nThese concerns were reinforced somewhat by a decline in market-based measures of inflation\ncompensation.\n\n\f- 10 Brexit referendum--posed new risks to U.S. economic activity and inflation. Moreover,\neven as payroll gains turned solid again in the second half of 2016, the unemployment\nrate remained relatively flat, suggesting that perhaps there was more room for\nimprovement in the job market than we had previously thought. Those unanticipated\ndevelopments were part of the reason why the Committee again opted to proceed more\nslowly in removing accommodation than had been anticipated at the start of the year. We\nended up increasing the target range for the federal funds rate by only 1/4 percentage\npoint over the course of 2016, rather than the full percentage point suggested by our\nDecember 2015 projections.\nReassessing Longer-Run Conditions\nThe slower-than-anticipated increase in our federal funds rate target in 2015 and\n2016 reflected more than just the inflation, job market, and foreign developments I\nmentioned. During that period, the FOMC and most private forecasters generally\nlowered their assessments of the longer-run neutral level of the real federal funds rate.\nIndeed, at our October 2015 meeting, the FOMC had a comprehensive discussion of\nneutral real interest rates and was impressed by the breadth of evidence suggesting that\nthose rates had declined both here and abroad, and that the decline had been going on for\nsome time. In response to this growing evidence, the median assessment by FOMC\nparticipants of the longer-run level of the real federal funds rate fell from 1-3/4 percent in\nJune 2014 to 1-1/2 percent in December 2015 and then to 1 percent in December 2016.\nThese reassessments reflected, in part, the persistence of surprisingly sluggish\nproductivity growth--both in the United States and abroad--and suggested that fewer\n\n\f- 11 federal funds rate increases would be necessary than previously thought to scale back\naccommodation.\nPartly in response to persistently slow wage growth, FOMC participants and\nprivate forecasters have in recent years lowered their estimates of the normal longer-run\nrate of unemployment. The median projection of FOMC participants of the longer-run\nlevel of the unemployment rate fell from about 5-1/4 percent in June 2014 to\napproximately 4-3/4 percent in December 2016. Other things being equal, a lower\nlonger-run level of the unemployment rate suggests that the economy has greater scope to\ncreate jobs without generating too much inflation. 11 Thus, the downward revisions to\nFOMC participants’ views on the unemployment rate over the longer run contributed to\nour assessment that monetary policy could stay accommodative longer than we had\nanticipated in 2014.\nFurther Progress since Mid-2016\nThe U.S. economy has exhibited remarkable resilience in the face of adverse\nshocks in recent years, and economic developments since mid-2016 have reinforced the\nCommittee’s confidence that the economy is on track to achieve our statutory goals. Job\ngains have remained quite solid, and the unemployment rate, at 4.8 percent in January, is\nnow in line with the median of FOMC participants’ estimates of its longer-run normal\nlevel. On the whole, the prospects for further moderate economic growth look\nencouraging, particularly as risks emanating from abroad appear to have receded\n\n11\n\nThe assessment that there was perhaps more room for improvement in the labor market than previously\nthought was reinforced by data showing that the labor force participation rate remained relatively stable in\n2016, rather than declining as many had expected.\n\n\f- 12 somewhat. The Committee currently assesses that the risks to the outlook are roughly\nbalanced.\nMoreover, after remaining disappointingly low through mid-2016, inflation\nmoved up during the second half of 2016, mainly because of the diminishing effects of\nthe earlier declines in energy prices and import prices. More recently, higher energy\nprices appear to have temporarily boosted inflation, with the total PCE price index rising\nnearly 2 percent in the 12 months ending in January. Core PCE inflation--which\nexcludes volatile energy and food prices and, therefore, tends to be a better indicator of\nfuture inflation--has been running near 1-3/4 percent. Market-based measures of inflation\ncompensation have moved up, on net, in recent months, although they remain low.\nWith the job market strengthening and inflation rising toward our target, the\nmedian assessment of FOMC participants as of last December was that a cumulative 3/4\npercentage point increase in the target range for the federal funds rate would likely be\nappropriate over the course of this year. In light of current economic conditions, such an\nincrease would be consistent with the Committee’s expectation that it will raise the target\nrange for the federal funds rate at a gradual pace and would bring the real federal funds\nrate close to some estimates of its current neutral level. However, partly because my\ncolleagues and I expect the neutral real federal funds rate to rise somewhat over the\nlonger run, we projected additional gradual rate hikes in 2018 and 2019.\nOur individual projections for the appropriate path for the federal funds rate\nreflect economic forecasts that generally envision that economic activity will expand at a\nmoderate pace in coming years, labor market conditions will strengthen somewhat\nfurther, and inflation will be at or near 2 percent over the medium term. In short, we\n\n\f- 13 currently judge that it will be appropriate to gradually increase the federal funds rate if\nthe economic data continue to come in about as we expect. Indeed, at our meeting later\nthis month, the Committee will evaluate whether employment and inflation are\ncontinuing to evolve in line with our expectations, in which case a further adjustment of\nthe federal funds rate would likely be appropriate.\nNonetheless, as we have said many times--and as my discussion today\ndemonstrates--monetary policy cannot be and is not on a preset course. As in 2015 and\n2016, the Committee stands ready to adjust its assessment of the appropriate path for\nmonetary policy if unanticipated developments materially change the economic outlook.\nMonetary Policy Is Not a Panacea\nThe U.S. economy has shown great improvement and is close to meeting our\ncongressionally mandated goals of maximum employment and price stability, but we of\ncourse recognize that important challenges remain. For instance, as we noted in our latest\nMonetary Policy Report to the Congress, the ongoing expansion has been the slowest\nsince World War II, with real GDP growth averaging only about 2 percent per year. 12\nThis subdued pace reflects, in part, slower growth in the labor force in recent years-compared with much of the post-World War II period--and disappointing productivity\ngrowth both in the United States and abroad.\nOur report also noted that, despite a notable pickup in 2015, real incomes for the\nmedian family were still a bit lower than they were prior to the Great Recession, and the\ngains during this economic recovery have been skewed toward the top of the income\ndistribution, as has been the case for quite some time. Families at the 10th percentile of\n\n12\n\nSee Board of Governors (2017).\n\n\f- 14 the income distribution earned about 4 percent less in 2015 than they did in 2007,\nwhereas families at the 90th percentile earned about 4 percent more. In addition, the\neconomic circumstances of blacks and Hispanics, while improved since the depths of the\nrecession, remain worse, on average, that those of whites or Asians.\nThese unwelcome developments unfortunately reflect structural challenges that\nlie substantially beyond the reach of monetary policy. Monetary policy cannot, for\ninstance, generate technological breakthroughs or affect demographic factors that would\nboost real GDP growth over the longer run or address the root causes of income\ninequality. And monetary policy cannot improve the productivity of American workers.\nFiscal and regulatory policies--which are of course the responsibility of the\nAdministration and the Congress--are best suited to address such adverse structural\ntrends.\nConclusion\nTo conclude, we at the Federal Reserve must remain squarely focused on our\ncongressionally mandated goals. The economy has essentially met the employment\nportion of our mandate and inflation is moving closer to our 2 percent objective. This\noutcome suggests that our goal-focused, outlook-dependent approach to scaling back\naccommodation over the past couple of years has served the U.S. economy well.\nThis same approach will continue to drive our policy decisions in the months and\nyears ahead. With that in mind, our policy aims to support continued growth of the\nAmerican economy in pursuit of our congressionally mandated objectives. We do that,\nas I have noted, with an eye always on the risks. To that end, we realize that waiting too\nlong to scale back some of our support could potentially require us to raise rates rapidly\n\n\f- 15 sometime down the road, which in turn could risk disrupting financial markets and\npushing the economy into recession. Having said that, I currently see no evidence that\nthe Federal Reserve has fallen behind the curve, and I therefore continue to have\nconfidence in our judgment that a gradual removal of accommodation is likely to be\nappropriate. However, as I have noted, unless unanticipated developments adversely\naffect the economic outlook, the process of scaling back accommodation likely will not\nbe as slow as it was during the past couple of years.\n\n\f- 16 References\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2017).

            "content": "For release on delivery\n10:00 a.m. EST\nFebruary 14, 2017\n\nStatement by\nJanet L. Yellen\nChair\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nbefore the\nCommittee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs\nU.S. Senate\nFebruary 14, 2017\n\n\fChairman Crapo, Ranking Member Brown, and other members of the Committee, I am\npleased to present the Federal Reserve’s semiannual Monetary Policy Report to the Congress. In\nmy remarks today I will briefly discuss the current economic situation and outlook before turning\nto monetary policy.\nCurrent Economic Situation and Outlook\nSince my appearance before this Committee last June, the economy has continued to\nmake progress toward our dual-mandate objectives of maximum employment and price stability.\nIn the labor market, job gains averaged 190,000 per month over the second half of 2016, and the\nnumber of jobs rose an additional 227,000 in January. Those gains bring the total increase in\nemployment since its trough in early 2010 to nearly 16 million. In addition, the unemployment\nrate, which stood at 4.8 percent in January, is more than 5 percentage points lower than where it\nstood at its peak in 2010 and is now in line with the median of the Federal Open Market\nCommittee (FOMC) participants’ estimates of its longer-run normal level. A broader measure of\nlabor underutilization, which includes those marginally attached to the labor force and people\nwho are working part time but would like a full-time job, has also continued to improve over the\npast year. In addition, the pace of wage growth has picked up relative to its pace of a few years\nago, a further indication that the job market is tightening. Importantly, improvements in the\nlabor market in recent years have been widespread, with large declines in the unemployment\nrates for all major demographic groups, including African Americans and Hispanics. Even so, it\nis discouraging that jobless rates for those minorities remain significantly higher than the rate for\nthe nation overall.\nOngoing gains in the labor market have been accompanied by a further moderate\nexpansion in economic activity. U.S. real gross domestic product is estimated to have risen\n\n\f-21.9 percent last year, the same as in 2015. Consumer spending has continued to rise at a healthy\npace, supported by steady income gains, increases in the value of households’ financial assets\nand homes, favorable levels of consumer sentiment, and low interest rates. Last year’s sales of\nautomobiles and light trucks were the highest annual total on record. In contrast, business\ninvestment was relatively soft for much of last year, though it posted some larger gains toward\nthe end of the year in part reflecting an apparent end to the sharp declines in spending on drilling\nand mining structures; moreover, business sentiment has noticeably improved in the past few\nmonths. In addition, weak foreign growth and the appreciation of the dollar over the past two\nyears have restrained manufacturing output. Meanwhile, housing construction has continued to\ntrend up at only a modest pace in recent quarters. And, while the lean stock of homes for sale\nand ongoing labor market gains should provide some support to housing construction going\nforward, the recent increases in mortgage rates may impart some restraint.\nInflation moved up over the past year, mainly because of the diminishing effects of the\nearlier declines in energy prices and import prices. Total consumer prices as measured by the\npersonal consumption expenditures (PCE) index rose 1.6 percent in the 12 months ending in\nDecember, still below the FOMC’s 2 percent objective but up 1 percentage point from its pace in\n2015. Core PCE inflation, which excludes the volatile energy and food prices, moved up to\nabout 1-3/4 percent.\nMy colleagues on the FOMC and I expect the economy to continue to expand at a\nmoderate pace, with the job market strengthening somewhat further and inflation gradually rising\nto 2 percent. This judgment reflects our view that U.S. monetary policy remains\naccommodative, and that the pace of global economic activity should pick up over time,\nsupported by accommodative monetary policies abroad. Of course, our inflation outlook also\n\n\f-3depends importantly on our assessment that longer-run inflation expectations will remain\nreasonably well anchored. It is reassuring that while market-based measures of inflation\ncompensation remain low, they have risen from the very low levels they reached during the latter\npart of 2015 and first half of 2016. Meanwhile, most survey measures of longer-term inflation\nexpectations have changed little, on balance, in recent months.\nAs always, considerable uncertainty attends the economic outlook. Among the sources of\nuncertainty are possible changes in U.S. fiscal and other policies, the future path of productivity\ngrowth, and developments abroad.\nMonetary Policy\nTurning to monetary policy, the FOMC is committed to promoting maximum\nemployment and price stability, as mandated by the Congress. Against the backdrop of\nheadwinds weighing on the economy over the past year, including financial market stresses that\nemanated from developments abroad, the Committee maintained an unchanged target range for\nthe federal funds rate for most of the year in order to support improvement in the labor market\nand an increase in inflation toward 2 percent. At its December meeting, the Committee raised\nthe target range for the federal funds rate by 1/4 percentage point, to 1/2 to 3/4 percent. In doing\nso, the Committee recognized the considerable progress the economy had made toward the\nFOMC’s dual objectives. The Committee judged that even after this increase in the federal funds\nrate target, monetary policy remains accommodative, thereby supporting some further\nstrengthening in labor market conditions and a return to 2 percent inflation.\nAt its meeting that concluded early this month, the Committee left the target range for the\nfederal funds rate unchanged but reiterated that it expects the evolution of the economy to\nwarrant further gradual increases in the federal funds rate to achieve and maintain its\n\n\f-4employment and inflation objectives. As I noted on previous occasions, waiting too long to\nremove accommodation would be unwise, potentially requiring the FOMC to eventually raise\nrates rapidly, which could risk disrupting financial markets and pushing the economy into\nrecession. Incoming data suggest that labor market conditions continue to strengthen and\ninflation is moving up to 2 percent, consistent with the Committee’s expectations. At our\nupcoming meetings, the Committee will evaluate whether employment and inflation are\ncontinuing to evolve in line with these expectations, in which case a further adjustment of the\nfederal funds rate would likely be appropriate.\nThe Committee’s view that gradual increases in the federal funds rate will likely be\nappropriate reflects the expectation that the neutral federal funds rate--that is, the interest rate\nthat is neither expansionary nor contractionary and that keeps the economy operating on an even\nkeel--will rise somewhat over time. Current estimates of the neutral rate are well below precrisis levels--a phenomenon that may reflect slow productivity growth, subdued economic\ngrowth abroad, strong demand for safe longer-term assets, and other factors. The Committee\nanticipates that the depressing effect of these factors will diminish somewhat over time, raising\nthe neutral funds rate, albeit to levels that are still low by historical standards.\nThat said, the economic outlook is uncertain, and monetary policy is not on a preset\ncourse. FOMC participants will adjust their assessments of the appropriate path for the federal\nfunds rate in response to changes to the economic outlook and associated risks as informed by\nincoming data. Also, changes in fiscal policy or other economic policies could potentially affect\nthe economic outlook. Of course, it is too early to know what policy changes will be put in place\nor how their economic effects will unfold. While it is not my intention to opine on specific tax\nor spending proposals, I would point to the importance of improving the pace of longer-run\n\n\f-5economic growth and raising American living standards with policies aimed at improving\nproductivity. I would also hope that fiscal policy changes will be consistent with putting U.S.\nfiscal accounts on a sustainable trajectory. In any event, it is important to remember that fiscal\npolicy is only one of the many factors that can influence the economic outlook and the\nappropriate course of monetary policy. Overall, the FOMC’s monetary policy decisions will be\ndirected to the attainment of its congressionally mandated objectives of maximum employment\nand price stability.\nFinally, the Committee has continued its policy of reinvesting proceeds from maturing\nTreasury securities and principal payments from agency debt and mortgage-backed securities.\nThis policy, by keeping the Committee’s holdings of longer-term securities at sizable levels, has\nhelped maintain accommodative financial conditions.\nThank you. I would be pleased to take your questions.\n\n\f"

Yellen\nChair\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\nStanford Institute for Economic Policy Research\nStanford University\nStanford, California\n\nJanuary 19, 2017\n\n\fIt is a privilege to be here today to discuss how the Federal Reserve is conducting\nmonetary policy to promote a healthy economy. For more than 30 years, research from\nthe Stanford Institute for Economic Policy Research has informed economic policy, and\nevents such as this one have helped foster debate among scholars, policymakers, business\nleaders, and members of the public on critical economic issues facing our nation. I\nappreciate the opportunity to participate.\nIn my remarks today, I will review the considerable progress the economy has\nmade toward the attainment of the two objectives that the Congress has assigned to the\nFederal Reserve--maximum employment and price stability. The upshot is that labor\nutilization is close to its estimated longer-run normal level, and we are closing in on our\n2 percent inflation objective. I will then discuss the prospects for adjusting monetary\npolicy in the manner needed to sustain a strong job market while maintaining low and\nstable inflation. Determining how best to adjust the federal funds rate over time to\nachieve these objectives will not be easy. For that reason, in the balance of my remarks, I\nwill discuss some considerations that will help inform our decisions, including the\nguidance provided by simple policy rules. I will conclude by touching on some key\nuncertainties affecting the outlook.\nProgress to Date\nMy assessment of progress to date will begin with the labor market. Since the\ndepths of the Great Recession, about 15-1/2 million jobs have been added to the U.S.\neconomy, on net. In 2016, job gains averaged about 180,000 per month, well above the\npace of 75,000 to 125,000 per month that is probably consistent with keeping the\n\n\f-2unemployment rate stable over the longer run. 1 The unemployment rate is now close to\nestimates of its longer-run normal level, and other measures of labor utilization have\nimproved appreciably. As shown in figure 1, a broader measure of labor\nunderutilization--the U-6 measure, which includes not only the unemployed but also\npeople working part time who would like full-time employment and those who would\nlike a job but are not actively looking--has retraced nearly all of the steep run-up that\noccurred as a result of the recession. 2\nOther indicators also support the view that the labor market has largely recovered\nfrom the severe downturn that occurred in the wake of the financial crisis. As illustrated\nby the red dashed line in figure 2, the quits rate--an indicator of workers’ confidence\nabout leaving an existing job to pursue new opportunities--is nearly back to its prerecession level. And some indicators, such as small businesses’ assessments of the\ndifficulty of hiring, shown by the solid black line, as well as the average length of time it\ntakes firms to fill vacancies and the job openings rate, even suggest that the labor market\nis a bit tighter than before the financial crisis. Of course, both the labor force\nparticipation rate and the employment-to-population ratio are still much lower than they\nwere a decade ago. But the cyclical element in these declines looks to have largely\ndisappeared, and what is left seems to mostly reflect the aging of the population and other\nsecular trends. 3 Based on this array of labor market indicators, I judge labor utilization to\nbe reasonably close to its normal longer-run level while also recognizing that estimates of\n1\n\nThe sustainable longer-run pace of payroll employment growth depends on a number of a factors, such as\nthe growth rate of the working-age population, trend movements in labor force participation, and the\nprevalence of self-employment and multiple job holdings, so it cannot be predicted with precision.\n2\nThe normal level of the U-6 measure may now be somewhat higher than it was prior to the financial crisis\nbecause of a trend toward greater reliance on part-time workers in many sectors. See Golden (2016).\n3\nSee Aaronson and others (2014).\n\n\f-3the sustainable levels of the unemployment rate and the employment-to-population ratio\nare inherently imprecise. 4\nIn the coming months, I expect some further strengthening in labor market\nconditions as the economy continues to expand at a moderate pace--a view that is shared\nby most of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC). 5 Overall\neconomic growth has been driven by consumer spending, which has been bolstered by\nsubstantial gains in household income and wealth. Business investment, in contrast, has\nbeen soft. But recent readings on business sentiment and new orders for equipment are\nconsistent with the view that capital spending will likely strengthen modestly this year;\nanother positive factor is that oil drilling, which plummeted after oil prices fell sharply\nback in late 2014, has recently begun to pick up. As we look to broader trends, gross\ndomestic product (GDP) growth has been restrained in recent years by a variety of forces\ndepressing both supply and demand, including slow labor force and productivity growth,\nweak growth abroad, and lingering headwinds from the financial crisis. Although I am\ncautiously optimistic that some of these forces will abate over time, I anticipate that they\nwill continue to restrain overall growth over the medium term, likely holding down the\nlevel of interest rates consistent with stable labor market conditions.\nTurning to inflation, we are now much closer to the FOMC’s 2 percent objective\nthan we were just a year ago. Prices, as measured by the index for personal consumption\nexpenditures (PCE), rose nearly 1-1/2 percent in the 12 months ending in November, as\n\n4\n\nIn addition, a persistently strong labor market could potentially lead some firms to rely less on part-time\nworkers, or might encourage some people to rejoin the labor force who would otherwise sit on the\nsidelines. However, evidence on these sorts of endogenous supply-side effects is rather limited, as I noted\nin a recent speech (see Yellen, 2016).\n5\nA summary of the projections submitted by Committee participants for the December 2016 FOMC\nmeeting can be found at www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomcprojtabl20161214.htm.\n\n\f-4compared with only 1/2 percent during 2015. Moreover, core PCE inflation--a better\nindicator of the underlying inflation trend--picked up 1/4 percentage point, to a little over\n1-1/2 percent. This rise in inflation was anticipated and largely represents a fading of the\neffects of earlier declines in energy prices and the prices of non-energy imports. In\naddition, slack in labor and product markets is no longer placing downward pressure on\ninflation, in contrast to the situation only a few years ago when the unemployment rate\nwas still quite elevated. Barring future major swings in oil prices and the foreign\nexchange value of the dollar, inflation is likely to move up to 2 percent over the next\ncouple of years, aided by a strong labor market.\nIn light of the progress that has been achieved toward our employment and\ninflation objectives and the Committee’s assessment of the outlook, the FOMC raised the\ntarget range for the federal funds rate at its December meeting by 25 basis points, to\nbetween 50 and 75 basis points. The Committee judges, however, that the stance of\nmonetary policy remains modestly accommodative, and so policy should support some\nfurther strengthening in labor market conditions and thus the return of inflation to our 2\npercent goal.\nMaintaining Sustainable Growth in a Context of Price Stability\nWith the unemployment rate near its longer-run normal level and likely to move a\nbit lower this year, a natural question is whether monetary policy has fallen behind the\ncurve. The short answer, I believe, is “no.” It is true that many employers report\ndifficulties in finding qualified workers in selected occupations, and that more workers\nare comfortable quitting jobs to take or look for better positions. But this is to be\n\n\f-5expected in a healthy labor market and not evidence that the economy as a whole is\nexperiencing a serious worker shortage.\nThe recent behavior of wages provides additional evidence pertaining to the\ndegree of labor market slack. As shown in figure 3, increases in average hourly earnings,\nthe employment cost index, and compensation per hour remain subdued, picking up only\nmodestly of late. 6 Again, these data do not seem consistent with an overheated labor\nmarket. Moreover, signs of overheating in the broader economy are also scarce. For\nexample, capacity utilization in the manufacturing sector is well below its historical\naverage. Most importantly, although core inflation is rising gradually from a low level,\nthis increase mainly reflects the waning of the effects of earlier movements in the dollar,\nnot upward pressure from resource utilization.\nOf course, even if the labor market is not overheated currently, one might worry\nthat overheating could rapidly emerge as labor market conditions strengthen further,\ncausing inflation to surge. I consider this unlikely for several reasons. First, the pace of\nlabor market improvement has slowed appreciably in the past couple of years: For\nexample, average payroll gains moderated from 250,000 per month in 2014 to 180,000\nlast year, and the unemployment rate declined 1-3/4 percentage points cumulatively over\n\n6\n\nAn exception to this pattern is the Atlanta Fed’s Wage Growth Tracker (WGT), which does show a\nnoticeable acceleration in hourly wages as self-reported in the Current Population Survey. Like average\nhourly earnings, the WGT excludes benefits costs and so is less comprehensive than the ECI or businesssector compensation per hour (CPH). In addition, the WGT is based on a smaller sample than the measures\nshown in Figure 3 and it only covers a sub-set of the workforce--specifically, employed individuals who\nwere also employed a year ago, and whose earnings are less than $150,000 per year. Finally, because\naverage hourly earnings and business-sector CPH are measured as total wages divided by total hours, an\nincrease in wages for high earners has a larger effect in those measures than a similarly proportioned\nincrease for lower-wage workers, and this is not so for the WGT.\n\n\f-62014 and 2015, compared with only 1/4 percentage point last year. 7 Second, economic\ngrowth more broadly seems unlikely to pick up markedly in the near term given the\nongoing restraint from weak foreign demand and other factors that I mentioned,\nparticularly in an environment in which monetary policy is likely to become gradually\nless accommodative. Finally, figure 4 illustrates the relationship over the past several\ndecades between labor market pressures and core inflation. Note that during periods\nwhen the unemployment rate fell below the Congressional Budget Office’s estimate of its\nnormal long-run level, shown by the yellow shaded regions, core inflation, the solid red\nline, rose little, if at all. This stability is especially marked since inflation expectations\nbecame anchored during the mid-to-late 1990s. 8\nThat said, I think that allowing the economy to run markedly and persistently\n“hot” would be risky and unwise. Waiting too long to remove accommodation could\ncause inflation expectations to begin ratcheting up, driving actual inflation higher and\nmaking it harder to control. The combination of persistently low interest rates and strong\nlabor market conditions could lead to undesirable increases in leverage and other\nfinancial imbalances, although such risks would likely take time to emerge. 9 Finally,\n\n7\n\nMany other labor market indicators also improved more slowly in 2016 relative to the pace seen in the\nprior two years, including the U-6 measure of labor utilization, the rates of job openings, hiring and quits,\nsurvey readings on net hiring plans and the difficulty of filling vacancies, and the average duration of\nunemployment. A notable exception to this general pattern is the labor force participation rate, which\ndeclined fairly steadily from 2007 through 2015 but then flattened out last year despite continuing\ndownward pressure from the aging of the population and other factors. However, improvements in labor\nmarket conditions along this dimension arguably reflect an increase in potential output, and so they are\nprobably not a source of inflationary pressures.\n8\nDuring the late 1960s through the 1970s, however, inflation did rise noticeably whenever the\nunemployment rate moved below its longer-run normal level, primarily because the Federal Reserve did\nnot adequately check persistent movements in inflation by tightening monetary policy, thereby allowing\ninflation expectations to drift. This experience illustrates the importance of keeping inflation expectations\nanchored through systematic policy actions.\n9\nThe Federal Reserve closely monitors a wide range of indicators of financial stability, which currently\nprovide little evidence of significant increases in leverage or rapid growth in credit. However, some asset\n\n\f-7waiting too long to tighten policy could require the FOMC to eventually raise interest\nrates rapidly, which could risk disrupting financial markets and pushing the economy into\nrecession. For these reasons, I consider it prudent to adjust the stance of monetary policy\ngradually over time--a strategy that should improve the prospects that the economy will\nachieve sustainable growth with the labor market operating at full employment and\ninflation running at about 2 percent.\nEvaluating the Appropriate Stance of Monetary Policy\nAchieving these goals could prove challenging, however, even if the economy\nmanages to avoid being hit with adverse shocks over the next few years. To sustain a\nstrong job market with inflation at our 2 percent objective, policy must gradually shift\ntoward a neutral stance, where “neutral” is defined as a level of the federal funds rate that\nis neither expansionary nor contractionary when the economy is operating near its\npotential. But what level of the federal funds rate is neutral at the present time? How\nquickly should the funds rate target move up to this neutral level? And how will the\nneutral rate itself evolve over time?\nTo help answer such questions, the FOMC considers a voluminous amount of\ninformation concerning many factors, including financial markets and credit availability,\nlabor market conditions and overall economic activity, wages and prices, and foreign\neconomic developments. The FOMC also evaluates forecasts from a range of economic\nmodels, assessments of key risks to the outlook, and detailed analyses of how different\nmonetary policy strategies would affect projected outcomes and risks. Among the\n\nvaluations, particularly for commercial real estate, are high. With regard to the linkages between labor\nutilization and financial stability, my interpretation of the historical evidence is that undesirable increases in\nleverage or the emergence of asset bubbles are not the inevitable consequence of tight labor markets per se.\n\n\f-8strategies routinely considered by the Committee are the recommendations of a variety of\nsimple monetary policy rules. In addition, FOMC participants prepare individual\nprojections on a quarterly basis of the most likely paths of key macroeconomic variables\nunder their own assessments of “appropriate monetary policy,” together with their\nestimates of the normal longer-run values of the federal funds rate, the unemployment\nrate, and GDP growth. 10 Armed with this wealth of information, the Committee as a\nwhole then decides on the most appropriate policy action to adopt at each of its meetings.\nSuch a comprehensive, forward-looking approach to policymaking is similar to that\nemployed at other central banks. 11\nFigure 5 shows a plot of FOMC participants’ most recent assessments of the\nappropriate path for the federal funds rate through 2019. The black solid lines show the\nmedian value of the federal funds rate at the end of each year. To understand the\nconsiderations that likely underlay these judgments, I will contrast participants’\nassessments with the recommendations of some simple policy rules commonly used to\nhelp gauge the appropriate stance of policy. As I noted, the Committee routinely reviews\npolicy recommendations from a variety of benchmark rules, and I believe that their\nprescriptions can be helpful in providing broad guidance about how the federal funds rate\nshould be adjusted over time in response to movements in real activity and inflation.\nThat said, I will emphasize that the use and interpretation of such prescriptions require\n\n10\n\nThese individual projections are published quarterly in the Summary of Economic Projections that\naccompanies the release of the minutes from the March, June, September and December meetings of the\nFOMC.\n11\nThe FOMC’s procedures share many of the features of forecast targeting, an approach to monetary\npolicymaking advocated by Svensson (2005), among others. However, while the Committee publishes\nparticipants’ projections--including policy paths--in the SEP, it does not publish a “consensus” forecast, in\ncontrast to some other central banks.\n\n\f-9careful judgments about both the measurement of the inputs to these rules and the\nimplications of the many considerations the rules do not take into account.\nConsider first the well-known Taylor rule, which embodies key principles of good\nmonetary policy. The rule calls for systematic adjustments in the federal funds rate\nrelative to its expected longer-run neutral level in response to movements in inflation and\nthe output gap, defined as the percentage difference between actual output and the\neconomy’s productive potential. 12 To implement the rule, one must decide on the\nappropriate definition and measurement of its inputs. Should inflation be defined using\nthe latest noisy quarterly reading on headline PCE inflation or a measure intended to\nsmooth through transitory price movements? What technique should be used to\napproximate the output gap, given that different approaches often yield materially\ndifferent estimates? And what assumption should be made about the neutral value of the\nfederal funds rate in the longer run?\nThe Taylor rule is often implemented by assuming that the real, or inflationadjusted, value of the longer-run neutral interest rate--which I will call R* for\n\nFormally, the rule originally published by Taylor (1993) can be written as 𝑅𝑅𝑡𝑡 = 𝑅𝑅 ∗ + 𝜋𝜋𝑡𝑡 +\n0.5(𝜋𝜋𝑡𝑡 − 𝜋𝜋 ∗ ) + 0.5𝑌𝑌𝑡𝑡 , where R is the federal funds rate, R* is the level of the real federal funds rate that on\naverage is expected to be consistent with sustaining maximum employment and stable inflation in the\nlonger run, π is current inflation, π* is the central bank’s inflation objective (2 percent, in the case of the\nFederal Reserve), and Y is the output gap, defined as the difference between the current level of real GDP\nand what it would be if the economy was operating at maximum employment. Importantly, the rule\nembodies three key principles that central banks take into account when setting policy to stabilize inflation\nand the overall economy. First, a persistent movement in inflation requires a more than one-for-one\nresponse of the policy rate to stabilize inflation. Second, monetary policy should raise real interest rates\nabove their normal longer-run level whenever inflation is above its desired level and resource utilization is\nhigher than normal, and lower them when the opposite holds. (Note that implementing this latter principle\nrequires estimates of both the economy’s productive potential and the longer-run level of the real policy\nrate that would be consistent with keeping the economy operating on an even keel.) And, finally,\npolicymakers should respond in a systematic manner to changes in economic conditions in order to help\nfinancial market participants and others better understand how policy is likely to respond over time to\ncurrent and future events, thereby influencing expectations in a way that promotes economic stability.\n12\n\n\f- 10 convenience--is equal to 2 percent, roughly the average historical value of the real federal\nfunds rate prior to the financial crisis. For inflation, we can use the 12-month change in\ncore PCE prices, a measure of the current underlying rate of inflation. And the output\ngap can be reasonably approximated as twice the difference between the estimated\nlonger-run normal rate of unemployment and the actual unemployment rate. 13 The\ndashed red line in figure 5 shows the resulting recommendations for policy over the\nmedium term, based on the medians of the unemployment and inflation projections\nsubmitted by FOMC participants in December but assuming--in contrast to the median of\nparticipants’ December assessments--that R* equals 2 percent. As figure 5 shows, this\nversion of the Taylor rule prescribes a much higher path for the federal funds rate than\nthe median of participants’ assessments of appropriate policy.\nOne important factor explaining this divergence is the FOMC’s growing\nrecognition that the longer-run neutral level of the real federal funds rate has likely\ndeclined below 2 percent, contrary to what is often assumed in implementations of the\nTaylor rule. As illustrated by the left-hand panel of figure 6, since 2000, both FOMC\nparticipants and respondents to the Blue Chip survey have markedly reduced their\nprojections of the level of real short-term interest rates expected to prevail in the longer\nrun. Presumably, these revisions were made in response to accumulating evidence that\nlower real interest rates than those seen on average in the past would be needed\npermanently to keep the economy operating on an even keel. In addition, the right-hand\npanel shows considerable changes over time in estimates of the normal longer-run rate of\n\n13\n\nHistorically, percent deviations of real GDP from statistical estimates of its long-run trend are roughly\ntwice as large on average as deviations of the unemployment rate from its estimated long-run value--a\nrelationship known as Okun’s law.\n\n\f- 11 unemployment, with corresponding implications for estimates of the economy’s\nproductive potential and the output gap. Such revisions would imply shifts in the level of\nthe Taylor rule’s prescriptions by as much as 1-1/4 percentage points, holding other\nfactors constant. 14 Clearly, sensible implementation of policy rules requires adjustments\nto take such changes into account, as a failure to do so would result in poor monetary\npolicy decisions and poor economic outcomes. 15\nFigure 7 illustrates the policy implications of alternative revised assessments of\nthe longer-run neutral real rate of interest. As before, the short-dashed red line shows the\nprescriptions of the Taylor rule using the standard 2 percent assumption for R*. The\nsolid red line, however, shows the rule’s prescriptions with R* equal to 1 percent, the\nmedian of the longer-run projections of the real federal funds rate made by FOMC\nparticipants last month. This adjustment appreciably reduces the rule’s policy\nprescriptions.\nEven with this downward adjustment of the longer-run neutral rate, however, the\nTaylor rule’s prescriptions are arguably still too restrictive. The problem is that the rule\nignores the likelihood that it will likely take many years before the forces now restraining\n\n14\n\nAdditional complications arise in the measurement of economic slack because the difference between the\nunemployment rate and its estimated normal level is not always a complete gauge of overall labor\nutilization. Such was the case in the current expansion until recently because the labor force participation\nrate was unusually low and involuntary part-time employment unusually high, given the level of the\nunemployment rate. Moreover, although movements in resource utilization for the economy as a whole are\ngenerally proportional to changes in labor utilization, the relationship varies somewhat over time. Partly as\na result, contemporaneous estimates of the output gap can deviate markedly from subsequent estimates for\nthe same period calculated using revised data. For example, in early 2010, the Congressional Budget\nOffice (CBO) estimated that the output gap in 2009:Q2 was negative 7.7 percent, but the CBO has since\nlowered it to negative 6.3 percent--a large revision with important implications for assessments of the\ndeviation of actual policy from the prescriptions of simple policy rules.\n15\nIf monetary policy persistently followed the prescriptions of a Taylor rule that assumed that R* was\n2 percent when it was in fact 1 percent, then employment would run persistently below its maximum\nsustainable level and inflation would run persistently below 2 percent. Under such circumstances, inflation\nexpectations might begin to fall, creating a risk of deflation.\n\n\f- 12 the economy dissipate to the degree envisioned in participants’ estimates of the longerrun normal level of the real federal funds rate. Because overall growth has been quite\nmoderate over the past few years despite an accommodative stance of monetary policy,\nsome recent estimates of the current value of the neutral real federal funds rate stand\nclose to zero. 16 If the neutral rate were to remain quite low over the medium term, as\nwould be expected if the global economy does not materially strengthen and productivity\ngrowth remains anemic, then the appropriate setting for R* in the Taylor rule would\narguably be zero, yielding a yet lower path for the federal funds rate, as shown by the\nlong-dashed red line. These considerations illustrate that there is now no obvious “right”\nsetting for R* because we do not know how rapidly the forces restraining the economy\nwill abate, and there is a significant risk that it could be very slow. When the economy\nhas been hit with unusually persistent shocks, the Taylor rule, for this reason, provides a\nproblematic benchmark.\nSimple policy rules also typically neglect information with potentially important\nimplications for the economic outlook because they focus only on where conditions are\ntoday. For example, simple rules ignore such important factors as fiscal policy, trends\naffecting global growth, structural developments influencing the supply of credit, and\noverall financial conditions. One special factor at the moment pertains to the Federal\nReserve’s balance sheet. The downward pressure on longer-term interest rates that the\nFed’s asset holdings exert is expected to diminish over time--a development that amounts\n\n16\n\nFor example, see Holston, Laubach, and Williams (2016).\n\n\f- 13 to a “passive” removal of monetary policy accommodation. Other things being equal,\nthis factor argues for a more gradual approach to raising short-term rates. 17\nLastly, simple rules ignore important risk-management considerations that have\ninfluenced the Committee’s decisions in recent years. With the federal funds rate still\nnear zero, the Committee recognizes that, should the economy unexpectedly weaken in\nthe next year or two, there would likely be only limited scope to respond by lowering\nshort-term rates. But if the economy instead began to overheat, threatening to push\ninflation to an undesirably high level, the FOMC would have ample scope to respond\nthrough tighter monetary policy. Such asymmetric risks arguably call for a more gradual\npath of rate increases than indicated by the prescriptions of a simple policy rule.\nThe academic literature on policy rules has studied many alternatives to the\nTaylor rule, and the FOMC regularly reviews a number of them. 18 These rules embed\ndiffering but valuable perspectives, and there is no consensus among central bankers or\nacademics about the relative utility of various rules. One such alternative is the\n“balanced approach” rule, illustrated by the purple short-dashed line in figure 8. This\nrule differs from the Taylor rule by being twice as responsive to movements in resource\n\n17\n\nBased on estimates generated using the term-structure model developed by Li and Wei (2013) and the\nprocedure discussed in Ihrig and others (2012) and extended by Engen, Laubach, and Reifschneider (2015),\nthe Federal Reserve’s holdings of Treasury securities and agency mortgage-backed securities continue to\nput considerable downward pressure on longer-term interest rates. However, this pressure is estimated to\nbe gradually easing as the average maturity of the portfolio declines and the end-date for reinvestment\ndraws closer. Over the course of 2017, this easing could increase the yield on the 10-year Treasury note by\nabout 15 basis points, all else being equal. Based on the estimated co-movement of short-term and longterm interest rates, such a change in longer-term yields would be similar to that which, on average, has\nhistorically accompanied two 25 basis point hikes in the federal funds rate.\n18\nFor example, prescriptions from seven different rules, calculated using forecasts of economic activity and\ninflation from different sources, are regularly posted by the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland at\nhttps://www.clevelandfed.org/our-research/indicators-and-data/simple-monetary-policy-rules.aspx.\n\n\f- 14 utilization. 19 The prescriptions of the balanced-approach rule in this figure, as with the\nsolid red Taylor-rule plot, assume that R* equals 1 percent, consistent with the medians\nof the latest FOMC projections. Because participants on average anticipate a modest\nundershooting of the unemployment rate below its estimated longer-run level, the\nbalanced-approach rule calls for a slightly faster pace of tightening over the next several\nyears than the Taylor rule.\nFigure 8 also reports results for a “change” rule, shown as the green long-dashed\nline. As its name implies, this rule does not prescribe a particular level of the federal\nfunds rate at a given time but rather how the existing rate should change from quarter to\nquarter based on two gaps--the difference between inflation and its desired level as well\nas the difference between the unemployment rate and its longer-run normal level. 20 In\ncontrast to the other two rules, the change rule does not take a stand on the value of the\nlonger-run neutral level of the real federal funds rate, thus avoiding a potential source of\nerror. Instead, it moves interest rates up and down until both gaps close, an approach that\nin theory enables it to perform well when the true value of R* is unknown. Because both\ngaps are relatively modest at the moment and are projected to remain so, the change rule\ncalls for fairly gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary policy over the next few\nyears given the current outlook.\n\nThe balanced-approach rule is 𝑅𝑅𝑡𝑡 = 𝑅𝑅 ∗ + 𝜋𝜋𝑡𝑡 + 0.5(𝜋𝜋𝑡𝑡 − 𝜋𝜋 ∗ ) + 1.0𝑌𝑌𝑡𝑡 , where all terms are defined as in\nthe Taylor rule. (See note 12 for details.) As noted by Taylor (1999), research suggests that this rule may\ndo a better job than the Taylor rule in stabilizing real activity and inflation.\n20\nThe change rule is 𝑅𝑅𝑡𝑡 = 𝑅𝑅𝑡𝑡−1 + 1.2(𝜋𝜋𝑡𝑡 − 2) + 2.0(𝑈𝑈 ∗ − 𝑈𝑈𝑡𝑡 ), where R is the federal funds rate, π is fourquarter rate of core PCE inflation, U* is the projected longer-run unemployment rate, and U is the current\nunemployment rate. In computing the prescriptions for the change rule shown in figure 8, the midpoint of\nthe target range for the federal funds rate prior to the December 2016 FOMC meeting, 0.38 percent, is used\nas the starting point. For a discussion of this rule (and of policy rules in general), see Taylor and Williams\n(2010).\n19\n\n\f- 15 The FOMC, for reasons that I have discussed, does not base its decisions on the\nprescriptions of any specific policy rule. Nevertheless, the three benchmarks I have\ndescribed--the Taylor rule, the balanced-approach rule, and the change rule, appropriately\ncalibrated--have historically provided useful guidance about appropriate adjustments in\nthe general direction of monetary policy over time. This guidance is illustrated by\nfigure 9, which compares the path of the federal funds rate since 2000 with the\nprescriptions of the three rules, based on the actual rates of inflation and unemployment\nobserved at each point in time, along with contemporaneous Blue Chip projections of the\nlonger-run unemployment rate and R*.\nAs the figure shows, the rules clearly signaled that a major reduction in the\nfederal funds rate was appropriate in 2008 given the marked deterioration in economic\nconditions. In addition, all three rules signaled that monetary policy needed to provide\nmore stimulus during the recession and the subsequent recovery than could be provided\nby keeping short-term interest rates near zero. For this reason, the Committee turned to\nasset purchases to help make up for the shortfall by putting additional downward pressure\non longer-term interest rates. The FOMC also sought to compensate for its inability to\npush the federal funds rate below zero by indicating that the funds rate would need to stay\nunusually low for longer than would otherwise be expected and simple policy rules\nwould prescribe. 21 Under this “make up” strategy, and taking into account the reasons\nfor deviating from the Taylor rule that I discussed a moment ago, the Committee kept the\n\n21\n\nFor example, the FOMC advised in the statement released after its December 2012 meeting that\nconditions would likely warrant keeping the funds rate near zero at least as long as the unemployment rate\nwas above 6-1/2 percent--a threshold that was not passed until mid-2014. As discussed by Reifschneider\nand Williams (2000), Werning (2012), and Woodford (2012), this type of lower-for-longer guidance can\nhelp compensate for the constraint on monetary policy created by the zero lower bound on nominal interest\nrates. Engen, Laubach, and Reifschneider (2015) find that the FOMC’s guidance, together with its asset\npurchases, provided significant economic stimulus in the years following the financial crisis.\n\n\f- 16 federal funds rate near zero for longer than two of the rules would have prescribed. But\nas labor market conditions continued to improve over time, the rising trajectories for the\nfederal funds rate prescribed by all three rules signaled that the time was drawing near to\nbegin gradually reducing monetary accommodation. Consistent with this advice, the\nFOMC suspended its asset purchase program in mid-2014 and began raising the federal\nfunds rate in late 2015. 22\nTo sum up, simple policy rules can serve as useful benchmarks to help assess how\nmonetary policy should be adjusted over time. However, their prescriptions must be\ninterpreted carefully, both because estimates of some of their key inputs can vary\nsignificantly and because the rules often do not take into account important\nconsiderations and information pertaining to the outlook. For these reasons, the rules\nshould not be followed mechanically, since doing so could have adverse consequences\nfor the economy.\nConclusion\nMy remarks have focused on the policy trajectory that the Committee now\nconsiders likely to be appropriate to sustain the economic expansion while keeping\ninflation close to our 2 percent goal. In concluding, it is important to emphasize the\nconsiderable uncertainty that attaches to such assessments and the need to constantly\nupdate them.\nIn particular, the path of the neutral federal funds rate, which plays an important\nrole in determining the appropriate policy path, is highly uncertain. For example,\nproductivity growth is a key determinant of the neutral rate, and while most forecasters\n\n22\n\nFor a closer look at the FOMC’s policy actions in 2016 and their relationship to previous forecasts and\nsubsequent changes in economic conditions, see Nechio and Rudebusch (2016).\n\n\f- 17 expect productivity growth to pick up from its recent unusually slow pace, the timing of\nsuch a pickup is highly uncertain. Indeed, there is little consensus among researchers\nabout the causes of the recent slowdown in productivity growth that has occurred both at\nhome and abroad. 23 The strength of global growth will also have an important bearing on\nthe neutral rate through both trade and financial channels, and here, too, the scope for\nsurprises is considerable. Finally, I would mention the potential for changes in fiscal\npolicy to affect the economic outlook and the appropriate policy path. At this point,\nhowever, the size, timing, and composition of such changes remain uncertain. 24\nHowever, as this discussion highlights, the course of monetary policy over the next few\nyears will depend on many different factors, of which fiscal policy is just one.\n\n23\n\nTo sample some of the different views about the sources of the recent slowdown in productivity growth\nand the prospects for faster growth in the future, see Gordon (2016), Fernald and Wang (2015),\nBrynjolfsson and McAfee (2014), and Decker and others (2016, forthcoming).\n24\nA related source of uncertainty is the limited ability of economists to predict the effects of specific\nchanges in tax policy or government spending on the overall economy. In part, this uncertainty arises\nbecause the net effect depends to some extent on the response of financial markets; in addition, estimates\nvary considerably on the economic effects of changes in marginal tax rates or different types of spending.\n\n\f- 18 References\nAaronson, Stephanie, Tomaz Cajner, Bruce Fallick, Felix Galbis-Reig, Christopher\nSmith, and William Wascher (2014). “Labor Force Participation: Recent\nDevelopments and Future Prospects,” Brookings Papers on Economic Activity,\nFall, pp. 197-255, www.brookings.edu/wpcontent/uploads/2016/07/Fall2014BPEA_Aaronson_et_al.pdf.\nBrynjolfsson, Erik, and Andrew McAfee (2014).

Yellen\nChair\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\nThe Commonwealth Club\nSan Francisco, California\n\nJanuary 18, 2017\n\n\fGood afternoon. It is a pleasure to join all of you at the Commonwealth Club\ntoday, not the least because the club and the Federal Reserve have a few things in\ncommon. Both organizations, as it happens, have a board of governors and a chair. And\nboth the club’s and the Fed’s histories extend back more than a century. The club, as\nmany here know, was founded in 1903, and the Federal Reserve a decade later. Perhaps\nbecause of our shared origins in the Progressive Era, a period of reform in American life,\nwe hold certain values in common. According to your website, the club is nonpartisan\nand dedicated to the impartial discussion of issues important to your community and the\nnation. At the Fed, we too are nonpartisan and focused squarely on the public interest.\nWe strive to conduct our deliberations impartially and base our decisions on factual\nevidence and objective analysis. This afternoon I will discuss some challenges we’ve\nfaced in our recent deliberations and may face in the next few years.\nPerhaps, though, it is best to start by stepping back and asking, what is--and,\nimportantly, what isn’t--our job as the nation’s central bank? And how do we go about\ntrying to accomplish it? The Federal Reserve has an array of responsibilities. I’ll\nmention our principal duties and then focus on one--monetary policy, the responsibility\nthat gets the most public attention.\nIn addition to monetary policy, we--in collaboration with other regulatory\nagencies at both the federal and state levels--oversee banks and some other financial\ninstitutions to ensure they operate safely and soundly and treat their customers fairly. We\nmonitor the financial system as a whole and promote its stability to help avoid financial\ncrises that could choke off credit to consumers and businesses. We also reliably and\nsafely process trillions of dollars of payments for the nation’s banks and the federal\n\n\f-2government and ensure that banks have an ample supply of currency and coin to meet the\ndemands of their depositors. And we work with communities, nonprofit organizations,\nlenders, educators, and others to encourage financial and economic literacy, promote\nequal access to credit, and advance economic and community development.\nBut, as I noted, monetary policy draws the most headlines. What is monetary\npolicy, exactly? Simply put, it consists of central bank actions aimed at influencing\ninterest rates and financial conditions more generally. Its purpose is to help foster a\nhealthy economy. But monetary policy cannot, by itself, create a healthy economy. It\ncannot, for instance, educate young people, generate technological breakthroughs, make\nworkers and businesses more productive, or address the root causes of inequality.\nFundamentally, the energy, ingenuity, and know-how of American workers and\nentrepreneurs, along with our natural resources, create prosperity. Regulatory policy and\nfiscal policy--the decisions by the Administration and the Congress about how much and\nhow the government spends, taxes, and borrows--can influence these more fundamental\neconomic pillars.\nI’ve said what monetary policy cannot do. But what can it do? It can lean against\ndamaging fluctuations in the economy. Nearly 40 years ago, the Congress set two main\nguideposts for that task--maximum employment and price stability. We refer to these\nassigned goals as our dual mandate. When the economy is weak and unemployment is on\nthe rise, we encourage spending and investing by pushing short-term interest rates lower.\nAs you may know, the interest rate that we target is the federal funds rate, the rate banks\ncharge each other for overnight loans. Lowering short-term rates in turn puts downward\npressure on longer-term interest rates, making credit more affordable--for families, for\n\n\f-3instance, to buy a house or for businesses to expand. Similarly, when the economy is\nthreatening to push inflation too high down the road, we increase interest rates to keep the\neconomy on a sustainable path and lean against its tendency to boom and then bust.\nBut what exactly do the terms “maximum employment” and “price stability”\nmean? Does maximum employment mean that every single person who wants a job has a\njob? No. There are always a certain number of people who are temporarily between jobs\nafter having recently lost a job or having left one voluntarily to pursue better\nopportunities. Others may have just graduated and have started looking for a job or have\ndecided to return to working--for instance, when their child starts school. This so-called\nfrictional unemployment is evident even in the healthiest of economies.\nThen there is structural unemployment--a difficult problem both for the people\naffected and for policymakers trying to address it. Sometimes people are ready and\nwilling to work, but their skills, perhaps because of technological advances, are not a\ngood fit for the jobs that are available. Or suitable jobs may be available but are not close\nto where they and their families live. These are factors over which monetary policy has\nlittle influence. Other measures--such as job training and other workforce development\nprograms--are better suited to address structural unemployment.\nAfter taking account of both frictional and structural unemployment, what\nunemployment rate is roughly equivalent to the maximum level of employment that can\nbe sustained in the longer run? The rate can change over time as the economy evolves,\nbut, for now, many economists, including my colleagues at the Fed and me, judge that it\nis around 4-3/4 percent. It’s important to try to estimate the unemployment rate that is\n\n\f-4equivalent to maximum employment because persistently operating below it pushes\ninflation higher, which brings me to our price stability mandate.\nDoes price stability mean having no inflation whatsoever? Again, the answer is\nno. By “price stability,” we mean a level of inflation that is low and stable enough that it\ndoesn’t need to figure prominently into people’s and businesses’ economic decisions.\nBased on research and decades of experience, we define that level as 2 percent a year--an\ninflation objective similar to that adopted by most other major central banks. 1 Individual\nprices, of course, move up and down by more than 2 percent all the time. Such\nmovements are essential to a well-functioning economy. They allow supply and demand\nto adjust for various goods and services. By “inflation,” we mean price changes as a\nwhole for all of the various goods and services that households consume.\nNo one likes high inflation, and it is easy to understand why. Although wages\nand prices tend to move in tandem over long periods, inflation erodes household\npurchasing power if it is not matched with similar increases in wages, and it eats away\nthe value of households’ savings. So, then, why don’t we and other central banks aim for\nzero inflation? There are several technical reasons, but a more fundamental reason is to\ncreate a buffer against the opposite of inflation--that is, deflation. Deflation is a general\nand persistent decline in the level of prices, a phenomenon Americans last experienced\nduring the Great Depression of the 1930s and one that Japan has confronted for most of\nthe past two decades. Deflation can feed on itself, leading to economic stagnation or\nworse. It puts pressure on employers to either cut wages or cut jobs. And it can be very\nhard on borrowers, who find themselves repaying their loans with dollars that are worth\n\n1\n\nOur objective is 2 percent inflation as measured by the annual change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures published by the Commerce Department’s Bureau of Economic Analysis.\n\n\f-5more than the dollars they originally borrowed. I am sure we all remember learning in\nschool about farm families in the Great Depression who couldn’t pay their mortgages and\nlost their homes and their livelihoods when crop prices fell persistently.\nAnother important reason to maintain a modest inflation buffer is that too low\ninflation impairs the ability of monetary policy to counter economic downturns. When\ninflation is very low, interest rates tend to be very low also, even in good times. And\nwhen interest rates are generally very low, the Fed has only limited room to cut them to\nhelp the economy in bad times.\nIn a nutshell, the Fed’s goal is to promote financial conditions conducive to\nmaximum employment and price stability. And I have offered broad-brush definitions of\neach of those objectives. So where is the economy now, in relationship to them? The\nshort answer is, we think it’s close. The economy has come a long way since the\nfinancial crisis. As you know, the crisis marked the start of a very deep recession. It\ndestroyed nearly 9 million jobs, and it’s been a long, slow slog to recover from it.\nUnemployment peaked at 10 percent late in 2009, a level unseen for more than 25 years,\nand didn’t move below 8 percent for nearly three years. Falling home prices put millions\nof homeowners “underwater,” meaning they owed more on their mortgages than their\nhomes were worth. And the stock market plunged, slashing the value of 401(k)\nretirement nest eggs.\nThe extraordinarily severe recession required an extraordinary response from\nmonetary policy, both to support the job market and prevent deflation. We cut our shortterm interest rate target to near zero at the end of 2008 and kept it there for seven years.\nTo provide further support to American households and businesses, we pressed down on\n\n\f-6longer-term interest rates by purchasing large amounts of longer-term Treasury securities\nand government-guaranteed mortgage securities. And we communicated our intent to\nkeep short-term interest rates low for a long time, thus increasing the downward pressure\non longer-term interest rates, which are influenced by expectations about short-term rates.\nNow, it’s fair to say, the economy is near maximum employment and inflation is\nmoving toward our goal. The unemployment rate is less than 5 percent, roughly back to\nwhere it was before the recession. And, over the past seven years, the economy has\nadded about 15-1/2 million net new jobs. Although inflation has been running below our\n2 percent objective for quite some time, we have seen it start inching back toward\n2 percent last year as the job market continued to improve and as the effects of a big drop\nin oil prices faded. Last month, at our most recent meeting, we took account of the\nconsiderable progress the economy has made by modestly increasing our short-term\ninterest rate target by 1/4 percentage point to a range of 1/2 to 3/4 percent. It was the\nsecond such step--the first came a year earlier--and reflects our confidence the economy\nwill continue to improve.\nNow, many of you would love to know exactly when the next rate increase is\ncoming and how high rates will rise. The simple truth is, I can’t tell you because it will\ndepend on how the economy actually evolves over coming months. The economy is vast\nand vastly complex, and its path can take surprising twists and turns. What I can tell you\nis what we expect--along with a very large caveat that our interest rate expectations will\nchange as our outlook for the economy changes. That said, as of last month, I and most\nof my colleagues--the other members of the Fed Board in Washington and the presidents\nof the 12 regional Federal Reserve Banks--were expecting to increase our federal funds\n\n\f-7rate target a few times a year until, by the end of 2019, it is close to our estimate of its\nlonger-run neutral rate of 3 percent.\nThe term “neutral rate” requires some explaining. It is the rate that, once the\neconomy has reached our objectives, will keep the economy on an even keel. It is neither\npressing on the gas pedal to make the car go faster nor easing off so much that the car\nslows down. Right now our foot is still pressing on the gas pedal, though, as I noted, we\nhave eased back a bit. Our foot remains on the pedal in part because we want to make\nsure the economic expansion remains strong enough to withstand an unexpected shock,\ngiven that we don’t have much room to cut interest rates. In addition, inflation is still\nrunning below our 2 percent objective, and, by some measures, there may still be some\nroom for progress in the job market. For instance, wage growth has only recently begun\nto pick up and remains fairly low. A broader measure of unemployment isn’t quite back\nto its pre-recession level. It includes people who would like a job but have been too\ndiscouraged to look for one and people who are working part time but would rather work\nfull time.\nNevertheless, as the economy approaches our objectives, it makes sense to\ngradually reduce the level of monetary policy support. Changes in monetary policy take\ntime to work their way into the economy. Waiting too long to begin moving toward the\nneutral rate could risk a nasty surprise down the road--either too much inflation, financial\ninstability, or both. In that scenario, we could be forced to raise interest rates rapidly,\nwhich in turn could push the economy into a new recession.\nThe factors I have just discussed are the usual sort that central bankers consider as\neconomies move through a recovery. But a longer-term trend--slow productivity\n\n\f-8growth--helps explain why we don’t think dramatic interest rate increases are required to\nmove our federal funds rate target back to neutral. Labor productivity--that is, the output\nof goods and services per hour of work--has increased by only about 1/2 percent a year,\non average, over the past six years or so and only 1-1/4 percent a year over the past\ndecade. That contrasts with the previous 30 years when productivity grew a bit more\nthan 2 percent a year. This productivity slowdown matters enormously because\nAmericans’ standard of living depends on productivity growth. With productivity growth\nof 2 percent a year, the average standard of living will double roughly every 35 years.\nThat means our children can reasonably hope to be better off economically than we are\nnow. But productivity growth of 1 percent a year means the average standard of living\nwill double only every 70 years.\nEconomists do not fully understand the causes of the productivity slowdown.\nSome emphasize that technological progress and its diffusion throughout the economy\nseem to be slower over the past decade or so. Others look at college graduation rates,\nwhich have flattened out after rising rapidly in previous generations. And still others\nfocus on a dramatic slowing in the creation of new businesses, which are often more\ninnovative than established firms. While each of these factors has likely played a role in\nslowing productivity growth, the extent to which they will continue to do so is an open\nquestion. 2\nWhy does slow productivity growth, if it persists, imply a lower neutral interest\nrate? First, it implies that the economy’s usual rate of output growth, when employment\n\n2\n\nOther factors depressing the neutral rate include housing construction and lackluster exports. Housing\nstill hasn’t fully recovered from the financial crisis, in part because mortgage-qualification standards\nremain tight. Weak growth abroad in Europe, China, and elsewhere, some of which is related to their own\nproductivity challenges, has hurt sales of U.S. goods.\n\n\f-9is at its maximum and prices are stable, will be significantly slower than the post-World\nWar II average. Slower economic growth, in turn, implies businesses will see less need\nto invest in expansion. And it implies families and individuals will feel the need to save\nmore and spend less. Because interest rates are the mechanism that brings the supply of\nsavings and the demand for investment funds into balance, more saving and less\ninvestment imply a lower neutral interest rate. Although we can’t directly measure the\nneutral interest rate, it is something that can be estimated in retrospect. And, as we have\nincreasingly realized, it has probably been trending down for a while now. Our current 3\npercent estimate of the longer-run neutral rate, for instance, is a full percentage point\nlower than our estimate just three years ago.\nYou might be thinking, what does this discussion of rather esoteric concepts such\nas the neutral rate mean to me? If you are a borrower, it means that, although the interest\nrates you pay on, say, your auto loan or mortgage or credit card likely will creep higher,\nthey probably will not increase dramatically. Likewise, if you are a saver, the rates you\nearn could inch higher after a while, but probably not by a lot. For some years, I’ve\nheard from savers who want higher rates, and now I’m beginning to hear from borrowers\nwho want lower rates. I can’t emphasize strongly enough, though, that we are not trying\nto help one of those groups at the expense of the other. We’re focused very much on that\ndual mandate I keep mentioning. At the end of the day, we all benefit from plentiful jobs\nand stable prices, whether we are savers or borrowers--and many of us, of course, are\nboth.\nEconomics and monetary policy are, at best, inexact sciences. Figuring out what\nthe neutral interest rate is and setting the right path toward it is not like setting the\n\n\f- 10 thermostat in a house: You can’t just set the temperature at 68 degrees and walk away.\nAnd, because changes in monetary policy affect the economy with long lags sometimes,\nwe must base our decisions on our best forecasts of an uncertain future. Thus, we must\ncontinually reassess and adjust our policies based on what we learn.\nThat point leads me to repeat what I said when I began: Like the Commonwealth\nClub, the Federal Reserve was created more than a century ago during an era of\ngovernment reform to serve the public interest. The structure established for the Federal\nReserve back then intentionally insulates us from short-term political pressures so we can\nfocus on what’s best for the American economy in the longer run. I promise you, with\nthe sometimes imperfect information and evidence we have available, we will do just that\nby making the best decisions we can, as objectively as we can.\nThank you. I welcome your questions.\n\n\f"

Yellen\nChair\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat a\nConversation with the Chair: A Teacher Town Hall Meeting\nWashington, D.C.\n(And via video link to Federal Reserve Banks)\n\nJanuary 12, 2017\n\n\fThank you, and thank you to all the educators who have come to the Board this\nevening or travelled to one of the Fed’s regional Reserve Banks to watch and listen via\nthe webcast.\nI am very much looking forward to hearing from you about teaching economics,\nand I am eager to respond to your questions. For that reason, and also because I expect\nthat school starts very early tomorrow for many of you, I will try to keep my remarks\nbrief. But I do have a message to impart about the work you do, which is vitally\nimportant not only to your students, but also, I believe, to the world they will soon inherit\nand even to the mission of the Federal Reserve.\nFirst and foremost, of course, like all teachers, you are helping prepare your\nstudents for successful and rewarding lives. The knowledge you impart and the intellect\nand talents you help develop are powerful tools your students can use to build those lives.\nLike some other subjects students encounter in school, economics teaches analytical and\ncritical thinking skills that can aid in the development and success of anyone. Part of\nsuccess for your students is economic success--as capable, creative, and productive\nmembers of the workforce and as consumers adept at managing their finances.\nEconomics provides knowledge and skills of practical use in college and in the\nworkplace, and it also provides skills to plan and make wise financial decisions, which\nare some of the most important and consequential that we face in life.\nYour students benefit very directly from this education, but so does everyone else\nin society. Everyone is engaged in and depends on the economy, and nothing is more\ncritical to a healthy and growing economy than the capability, creativity, and\nproductiveness of its workforce. Whenever I am asked what policies and initiatives could\n\n\f-2do the most to spur economic growth and raise living standards, improving education is\nat the top of my list.\nIn addition to the role you play in preparing students for jobs and careers, you also\nhelp prepare them to be responsible consumers. The economy needs productive workers,\nand it also depends on consumers, whose individual spending decisions, as most of you\nsurely have taught in class, collectively account for two-thirds of economic activity.\nConsumers skilled in managing their finances are better prepared to weather bad times,\nand stronger household finances overall can help sustain growth, stabilize the economy,\nand mitigate an economic downturn.\nStabilizing the economy and mitigating a downturn, of course, also happen to be\namong the Federal Reserve’s primary responsibilities. When successful, monetary policy\ncan be a powerful and effective tool to these ends, but its capabilities are dwarfed by\nlarger factors such as the productivity of the workforce and the strength of household\nfinances. By educating students and directly supporting their contributions to the\neconomy as producers and consumers, all teachers, especially teachers of economics, are\neffectively furthering our mission at the Fed, so let me offer my thanks for making that\njob a little easier.\nTo help support your important work as teachers, the Federal Reserve Board and\nthe 12 Reserve Banks conduct programs, organize events, and publish books and other\nmaterials to spread knowledge of the role of the Fed--and economics in general--and to\npromote financial literacy. Before I get to those events and programs, let me say a word\nabout what is probably the most important pedagogical aid that the Fed produces--the\n182-page book called The Federal Reserve System: Purposes and Functions. The 10th\n\n\f-3edition of Purposes and Functions, published in October of last year, offers a detailed\nand comprehensive account of what, why, and how the Fed carries out its different\nresponsibilities. I think it is a wonderful resource for teaching about the Fed, and copies\nare available via the Board’s website. 1\nEach of the Fed’s Reserve Banks has community outreach and educational\ninitiatives in the areas of the country they serve, and the outreach to economics teachers\nis coordinated by the group chaired by Amy Hennessy, the Federal Reserve System\nEconomic Education Group.\nAt the Board, we have for some years operated a program called FedEd, which\nsends Fed employees into schools throughout the Washington, D.C., metropolitan area\nand sponsors events for students here at the Eccles Building. 2 FedEd’s outreach to\nschools depends on the time and sacrifice of several dozen research assistants, who are\ntypically recent college graduates who work for two or three years at the Board.\nResearch assistants who volunteer for FedEd visit schools; help teach about the Fed,\neconomics, and finance; and answer questions about work opportunities at the Board.\nThe Federal Reserve is committed to promoting diversity in our ranks and in the\neconomics profession, and FedEd has furthered these goals by making sure to include\nschools with significant numbers of minority students.\nThis past school year, FedEd sent research assistants into nine different schools\nand FedEd volunteers have visited 38 different schools since 2012. FedEd was back in\nschools last fall, drawing from 48 research assistants who volunteered to participate.\n\n1\n\nPurposes and Functions is available on the Board’s website at https://www.federalreserve.gov/pf/pf.htm.\nMore information about FedEd is available on the Board’s website at\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/educational-tools/fed-education.htm.\n\n2\n\n\f-4FedEd also sponsors several speaker events a year that bring students into this Board\nRoom. Students recently heard a presentation from Scott Alvarez, who oversees the\nBoard’s Legal Division, and, in February, Vice Chairman Stanley Fischer will speak to\nstudents at another event. FedEd is overseen by two research assistants, Caroline Shinkle\nand Jamie Lenney, along with Karen Pence, who is an economist at the Board. All three\nare with us this evening and prepared to answer further questions about the program.\nOnline resources for teachers can be found on the Board’s website at\nfederalreserve.gov, and additional resources available throughout the System are at\nfederalreserveeducation.org. The websites include videos in which policymakers and the\nstaff describe the Fed’s functions. Also, the sites include historical materials and a\nwealth of information related to the financial crisis and the Fed’s response.\nLet me leave it there, and again thank teachers for participating in this town hall,\nand offer my thanks, on behalf of the Board of Governors, for the valuable work you do\nevery day. I would be very happy to respond to your questions.\n\n\f"

            "content": "For release on delivery\n1:30 p.m. EST\nDecember 19, 2016\n\nCommencement Remarks\n\nby\nJanet L. Yellen\nChair\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\nUniversity of Baltimore 2016 Midyear Commencement\nBaltimore, Maryland\n\nDecember 19, 2016\n\n\fThank you, President Schmoke, for this award and for the opportunity to be here\ntoday to offer my congratulations to the members of the Class of 2016. I would also like\nto recognize the vital support students have received from family, friends, and others,\nmany of whom are here to share this great occasion.\nIn a moment, I will explain why I am particularly proud and honored to be\nspeaking to the new graduates of this university, but first I’d like to address students on a\ntopic that I expect is on the minds of many of you, which is the job market.\nThe short version of what I have to say is that while I expect workers will\ncontinue to face some challenges in the coming years, I believe, for two reasons, that the\njob prospects and career opportunities for new graduates at this time are very good. First,\nafter years of a slow economic recovery, you are entering the strongest job market in\nnearly a decade. The unemployment rate, at 4.6 percent, is near what it was before the\nrecession. This is a level that has been associated with good job opportunities. Job\ncreation is continuing at a steady pace; the layoff rate is low; and job openings are up\nover the past couple years, which is another sign of a healthy job market. There are also\nindications that wage growth is picking up, and weekly earnings for younger workers\nhave made strong gains over the past couple of years. That is probably one reason why\nyounger workers reported feeling significantly more optimistic about the job market\ncompared with 2013, according to a survey published just today by the Federal Reserve.1\nChallenges do remain. The economy is growing more slowly than in past\nrecoveries, and productivity growth, which is a major influence on wages, has been\ndisappointing.\n\n1\n\nSee Board of Governors (2016). In a survey conducted in 2015, 61 percent of young adults reported\nfeeling optimistic about job opportunities, compared with 45 percent who felt that way in 2013.\n\n\f-2But it also looks like the economic gains of the past few years are finally raising\nliving standards for most people. Median household income grew and poverty fell\nsignificantly in 2015, although these measures were still lagging their levels from before\nthe recession.2 An improving economy may be especially important for you, as new\ngraduates. Those who graduate and enter the workforce during a strong economy are\nmore likely to find employment, remain employed, and enjoy persistently higher\nearnings.3\nThe second reason for optimism is that you have already done the one thing that\nresearch shows is most important to a successful and stable working life: earning the\ndegrees you will receive today. Economists are not certain about many things. But we\nare quite certain that a college diploma or an advanced degree is a key to economic\nsuccess. Those with a college degree are more likely to find a job, keep a job, have\nhigher job satisfaction, and earn a higher salary. The advantage in earnings is large.\nCollege grads’ annual earnings last year were, on average, 70 percent higher than those\nwith only a high school diploma. Back in 1980, the difference was only 20 percent. The\ngap in earnings is significant only a few years after graduation--almost $18,000 a year,\naccording to some recent data. Beyond these advantages, research also shows that a\ncollege or graduate degree typically leads to a happier, healthier, and longer life.4\nOne explanation for the greater advantage in recent decades conferred by higher\neducation is that it reflects an increase in the demand for educated workers compared\n\n2\n\nFor more on median household income adjusted for inflation and the poverty rate, see Posey (2016) and\nBishaw and Glassman (2016).\n3\nSee, for example, Kahn (2010); Oreopoulos, Von Wachter, and Heisz (2012); and Altonji, Kahn, and\nSpeer (2016).\n4\nFor recent estimates of the college earnings premium over time, see Pew Research (2014) and Council of\nEconomic Advisers (2016). For a discussion of some nonpecuniary benefits of completing college, see\nOreopoulos and Salvanes (2011).\n\n\f-3with others. The drivers of this increasing demand for those with college and graduate\ndegrees are likely to continue to be important. Let me mention two of the most\nimportant factors.\nFirst, technology. For decades, technological advances have increasingly allowed\nsimpler, repetitive tasks to be done more cheaply and safely by machines. This kind of\nwork in factories, stores, and offices often required only a high school education. At the\nsame time, technological advances have increased demand for workers with the education\nnecessary to perform the ever-growing share of jobs where technology is important.\nMore recently, further advances are automating increasingly complex tasks and allowing\nworkers with the ability and flexibility to use technology to be more productive. Higher\neducation has also changed in response, and one of the most important things many of\nyou learned at the University of Baltimore was how to learn, adapt, and succeed in the\ntechnology-rich environment of most workplaces.\nThe second major development in the job market is globalization, which allows\ngoods and services to be produced wherever it is most economical. Offshoring and trade\nhave profoundly affected the U.S. economy. No one knows which jobs and which\nindustries will thrive as globalization continues or how each of you will be affected, but I\ncan say that the education you have earned will provide an important advantage. Like\ntechnological change, globalization has reinforced the shift away from lower-skilled jobs\nthat require less education to higher-skilled jobs that require college and advanced\ndegrees. The jobs that globalization creates in the United States, serving a global\neconomy of billions of people, are more likely to be filled by those who, like you, have\nsecured the advantage of higher education.\n\n\f-4While globalization will likely continue and technology will continue to advance,\nwe don’t know how fast the economy will grow, what new technologies will be\ndeveloped, or how quickly and consistently employment will expand. What is\nconsiderably more certain, however, is that success will continue to be tied to education,\nin part because a good education enhances one’s ability to adapt to a changing economy.\nOne reason for the increasing economic advantage of a college or graduate degree\nis the very slow growth of earnings in the last few decades for those with only a high\nschool education. It concerns me, as it should concern all of us, that many are falling\nbehind. Improvements in elementary and secondary education can help prepare more\npeople for college and the opportunities college makes available, but for those who do\nnot attend college, we must find other ways to extend economic opportunity to everyone\nin America.\nIn discussing higher education, you may have noticed that I have spoken in terms\nof completing your degrees. Research shows that a large share of the benefits I have\ndescribed from higher education comes only to those who graduate. Even those\ncompleting three or more years of college benefit much less when they don’t get a\ndegree.5 For example, some of you may be worried about paying off loans you have\ntaken out to pay for your education. The good news is that the vast majority of student\nborrowers who complete their degrees find work that allows them to keep up with their\npayments and pay off their loans.\nEverything I have said so far could apply to the graduates this year of any college\nor university. The rest of what I have to say is about you, the 2016 graduates of the\n\n5\n\nFor example, see Oreopoulos and Petronijevic (2013) and Bound and Turner (2011).\n\n\f-5University of Baltimore. I have learned a bit about you recently, with the help of the\nuniversity’s staff. Let me tell you a few things about some of your classmates that you\nmay not know.\nAmong you today is a full-time student who found the time each semester to\nvolunteer with non-profit organizations, including one that helps refugees from other\ncountries find their place in this community. Another of your fellow students, who used\nto doubt that she could ever afford college, has become a student leader. She made the\nDean’s List every semester after transferring from community college.\nLike many of you, another of your fellow graduates took day and evening classes\nto balance work and family demands. She was forced to change jobs to accommodate\nthis schedule. She later decided her future lay in digital communications, which required\nher to switch majors after taking some required classes. Today she will become the first\nperson in her family to graduate from college.\nSome of you were born in other countries. One of you lived in four other\ncountries before coming to the University of Baltimore for a master’s degree. Many of\nyou have contributed to the sense of community at the University of Baltimore by\nactively participating in student life. One of you has even decided to seek a career\nhelping other students as a student affairs professional.\nThese are a few of the outstanding people who will join you in walking across this\nstage today. Let me describe one more.\nTo that student, sitting in the audience, I would say: you deserve a tremendous\namount of credit. Based on what I have learned, you did not have all of the advantages\nthat can pave the way to college and graduate school. You overcame obstacles to make it\n\n\f-6here, and more obstacles to complete your degree. One of the biggest of these obstacles,\nin fact, was that some people doubted you could or would succeed. But others in your\nlife believed in you. Some of them are here today. They believed in you, and you\nbelieved in yourself, and your talent and intelligence and hard work enabled you to earn\nthe degree you are about to receive.\nIf this sounds like you, then you are absolutely right, because I am not describing\njust one member of the University of Baltimore’s Class of 2016--I am trying to describe\nevery one of you. In different ways, I expect all of you have overcome obstacles and\ndemonstrated resilience and determination to succeed. All of you have gained knowledge\nand used your intelligence and talents to complete your degrees. As impressed as I am\nwith any individual graduating today, I am more impressed with what all of you have\nachieved.\nLet me tell you what else I have learned. More than the students of some colleges\nand universities, I know that many of you have deep roots in this city and in the county.\nMany of you will start careers, build your lives, and raise your families here. The\nchallenges you have overcome are the challenges faced by many people in Baltimore and\nin communities throughout America. Your success, which we celebrate today, is also the\npromise of a brighter future for this city. The degrees you have worked so hard to earn\nand the opportunities now opening up to you represent the stubborn, earnest hope that\nanyone and everyone who strives to succeed still can succeed.\nAnd that is why I consider it a rare privilege to speak to you today, and a great\nhonor to be associated with the University of Baltimore and the members of the Class of\n2016. Thank you, and congratulations.\n\n\f-7-\n\nReferences\nAltonji, Joseph G., Lisa B. Kahn, and Jamin D.

Yellen\nChair\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nbefore the\nJoint Economic Committee\nU.S. Congress\nNovember 17, 2016\n\n\fChairman Coats, Ranking Member Maloney, and members of the Committee, I\nappreciate the opportunity to testify before you today. I will discuss the current economic\noutlook and monetary policy.\nThe Economic Outlook\nThe U.S. economy has made further progress this year toward the Federal Reserve’s\ndual-mandate objectives of maximum employment and price stability. Job gains averaged\n180,000 per month from January through October, a somewhat slower pace than last year but\nstill well above estimates of the pace necessary to absorb new entrants to the labor force. The\nunemployment rate, which stood at 4.9 percent in October, has held relatively steady since the\nbeginning of the year. The stability of the unemployment rate, combined with above-trend job\ngrowth, suggests that the U.S. economy has had a bit more “room to run” than anticipated earlier.\nThis favorable outcome has been reflected in the labor force participation rate, which has been\nabout unchanged this year, on net, despite an underlying downward trend stemming from the\naging of the U.S. population. While above-trend growth of the labor force and employment\ncannot continue indefinitely, there nonetheless appears to be scope for some further\nimprovement in the labor market. The unemployment rate is still a little above the median of\nFederal Open Market Committee (FOMC) participants’ estimates of its longer-run level, and\ninvoluntary part-time employment remains elevated relative to historical norms. Further\nemployment gains may well help support labor force participation as well as wage gains; indeed,\nthere are some signs that the pace of wage growth has stepped up recently. While the\nimprovements in the labor market over the past year have been widespread across racial and\nethnic groups, it is troubling that unemployment rates for African Americans and Hispanics\nremain higher than for the nation overall, and that the annual income of the median African\n\n\f-2American household and the median Hispanic household is still well below the median income\nof other U.S. households.\nMeanwhile, U.S. economic growth appears to have picked up from its subdued pace\nearlier this year. After rising at an annual rate of just 1 percent in the first half of this year,\ninflation-adjusted gross domestic product is estimated to have increased nearly 3 percent in the\nthird quarter. In part, the pickup reflected some rebuilding of inventories and a surge in soybean\nexports. In addition, consumer spending has continued to post moderate gains, supported by\nsolid growth in real disposable income, upbeat consumer confidence, low borrowing rates, and\nthe ongoing effects of earlier increases in household wealth. By contrast, business investment\nhas remained relatively soft, in part because of the drag on outlays for drilling and mining\nstructures that has resulted from earlier declines in oil prices. Manufacturing output continues to\nbe restrained by the weakness in economic growth abroad and by the appreciation in the U.S.\ndollar over the past two years. And while new housing construction has been subdued in recent\nquarters despite rising prices, the underlying fundamentals--including a lean stock of homes for\nsale, an improving labor market, and the low level of mortgage rates--are favorable for a pickup.\nTurning to inflation, overall consumer prices, as measured by the price index for personal\nconsumption expenditures, increased 1-1/4 percent over the 12 months ending in September, a\nsomewhat higher pace than earlier this year but still below the FOMC’s 2 percent objective.\nMuch of this shortfall continues to reflect earlier declines in energy prices and in prices of nonenergy imports. Core inflation, which excludes the more volatile energy and food prices and\ntends to be a better indicator of future overall inflation, has been running closer to 1-3/4 percent.\nWith regard to the outlook, I expect economic growth to continue at a moderate pace\nsufficient to generate some further strengthening in labor market conditions and a return of\n\n\f-3inflation to the Committee’s 2 percent objective over the next couple of years. This judgment\nreflects my view that monetary policy remains moderately accommodative and that ongoing job\ngains, along with low oil prices, should continue to support household purchasing power and\ntherefore consumer spending. In addition, global economic growth should firm, supported by\naccommodative monetary policies abroad. As the labor market strengthens further and the\ntransitory influences holding down inflation fade, I expect inflation to rise to 2 percent.\nMonetary Policy\nI will turn now to the implications of recent economic developments and the economic\noutlook for monetary policy. The stance of monetary policy has supported improvement in the\nlabor market this year, along with a return of inflation toward the FOMC’s 2 percent objective.\nIn September, the Committee decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at\n1/4 to 1/2 percent and stated that, while the case for an increase in the target range had\nstrengthened, it would, for the time being, wait for further evidence of continued progress toward\nits objectives.\nAt our meeting earlier this month, the Committee judged that the case for an increase in\nthe target range had continued to strengthen and that such an increase could well become\nappropriate relatively soon if incoming data provide some further evidence of continued progress\ntoward the Committee’s objectives. This judgment recognized that progress in the labor market\nhas continued and that economic activity has picked up from the modest pace seen in the first\nhalf of this year. And inflation, while still below the Committee’s 2 percent objective, has\nincreased somewhat since earlier this year. Furthermore, the Committee judged that near-term\nrisks to the outlook were roughly balanced.\n\n\f-4Waiting for further evidence does not reflect a lack of confidence in the economy.\nRather, with the unemployment rate remaining steady this year despite above-trend job gains,\nand with inflation continuing to run below its target, the Committee judged that there was\nsomewhat more room for the labor market to improve on a sustainable basis than the Committee\nhad anticipated at the beginning of the year. Nonetheless, the Committee must remain forward\nlooking in setting monetary policy. Were the FOMC to delay increases in the federal funds rate\nfor too long, it could end up having to tighten policy relatively abruptly to keep the economy\nfrom significantly overshooting both of the Committee’s longer-run policy goals. Moreover,\nholding the federal funds rate at its current level for too long could also encourage excessive\nrisk-taking and ultimately undermine financial stability.\nThe FOMC continues to expect that the evolution of the economy will warrant only\ngradual increases in the federal funds rate over time to achieve and maintain maximum\nemployment and price stability. This assessment is based on the view that the neutral federal\nfunds rate--meaning the rate that is neither expansionary nor contractionary and keeps the\neconomy operating on an even keel--appears to be currently quite low by historical standards.\nConsistent with this view, growth in aggregate spending has been moderate in recent years\ndespite support from the low level of the federal funds rate and the Federal Reserve’s large\nholdings of longer-term securities. With the federal funds rate currently only somewhat below\nestimates of the neutral rate, the stance of monetary policy is likely moderately accommodative,\nwhich is appropriate to foster further progress toward the FOMC’s objectives. But because\nmonetary policy is only moderately accommodative, the risk of falling behind the curve in the\nnear future appears limited, and gradual increases in the federal funds rate will likely be\nsufficient to get to a neutral policy stance over the next few years.\n\n\f-5Of course, the economic outlook is inherently uncertain, and, as always, the appropriate\npath for the federal funds rate will change in response to changes to the outlook and associated\nrisks.\nThank you. I would be pleased to answer your questions.\n\n\f"

Yellen\nChair\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\n“The Elusive ‘Great’ Recovery:\nCauses and Implications for Future Business Cycle Dynamics”\n60th annual economic conference sponsored by the\nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston\nBoston, Massachusetts\n\nOctober 14, 2016\n\n\fExtreme economic events have often challenged existing views of how the\neconomy works and exposed shortcomings in the collective knowledge of economists.\nTo give two well-known examples, both the Great Depression and the stagflation of the\n1970s motivated new ways of thinking about economic phenomena. More recently, the\nfinancial crisis and its aftermath might well prove to be a similar sort of turning point.\nToday I would like to reflect on some ways in which the events of the past few years\nhave revealed limits in economists’ understanding of the economy and suggest several\nimportant questions I hope the profession will try to answer. Some of these questions are\nnot new, though recent events have made them more urgent. Appropriately, some are\naddressed by the papers prepared for this conference. Pursuing answers to these\nquestions is vital to the work of Federal Reserve and other economic policymakers, and\nthe Fed is likewise engaged in ongoing research to seek answers.\nThe Influence of Demand on Aggregate Supply\nThe first question I would like to pose concerns the distinction between aggregate\nsupply and aggregate demand: Are there circumstances in which changes in aggregate\ndemand can have an appreciable, persistent effect on aggregate supply?\nPrior to the Great Recession, most economists would probably have answered this\nquestion with a qualified “no.” They would have broadly agreed with Robert Solow that\neconomic output over the longer term is primarily driven by supply--the amount of output\nof goods and services the economy is capable of producing, given its labor and capital\nresources and existing technologies. Aggregate demand, in contrast, was seen as\nexplaining shorter-term fluctuations around the mostly exogenous supply-determined\n\n\f-2longer-run trend. 1 This conclusion deserves to be reconsidered in light of the failure of\nthe level of economic activity to return to its pre-recession trend in most advanced\neconomies. This post-crisis experience suggests that changes in aggregate demand may\nhave an appreciable, persistent effect on aggregate supply--that is, on potential output. 2\nThe idea that persistent shortfalls in aggregate demand could adversely affect the\nsupply side of the economy--an effect commonly referred to as hysteresis--is not new; for\nexample, the possibility was discussed back in the mid-1980s with regard to the\nperformance of European labor markets. 3 But interest in the topic has increased in light\nof the persistent slowdown in economic growth seen in many developed economies since\nthe crisis. Several recent studies present cross-country evidence indicating that severe\nand persistent recessions have historically had these sorts of long-term effects, even for\ndownturns that appear to have resulted largely or entirely from a shock to aggregate\ndemand. 4 With regard to the U.S. experience, one study estimates that the level of\npotential output is now 7 percent below what would have been expected based on its precrisis trajectory, and it argues that much of this supply-side damage is attributable to\nseveral developments that likely occurred as a result of the deep recession and slow\nrecovery. 5 In particular, the study finds that in the wake of the crisis, the United States\nexperienced a modest reduction in labor supply as a result of reduced immigration and a\nfall in labor force participation beyond what can be explained by cyclical conditions and\n\n1\n\nSee Solow (1997).\nOr, as Summers (2014) asked in a pithy inversion of Say’s law, is it true that “lack of demand creates lack\nof supply?” (p. 37).\n3\nAs Blanchard and Summers (1986) discuss, the question at the time was whether the long-run\nequilibrium, or “natural,” rate of unemployment in European economies had been permanently raised by\nprevious periods of high actual unemployment.\n4\nFor example, see Cerra and Saxena (2008); Howard, Martin, and Wilson (2011); Martin, Nunyan, and\nWilson (2014); and Blanchard, Cerutti, and Summers (2015).\n5\nSee Reifschneider, Wascher, and Wilcox (2015).\n2\n\n\f-3demographic factors, as well as a marked slowdown in the estimated trend growth rate of\nlabor productivity. The latter likely reflects an unusually slow pace of business capital\naccumulation since the crisis and, more conjecturally, the sharp decline in spending on\nresearch and development and the very slow pace of new firm formation in recent years. 6\nIf we assume that hysteresis is in fact present to some degree after deep\nrecessions, the natural next question is to ask whether it might be possible to reverse\nthese adverse supply-side effects by temporarily running a “high-pressure economy,”\nwith robust aggregate demand and a tight labor market. One can certainly identify\nplausible ways in which this might occur. Increased business sales would almost\ncertainly raise the productive capacity of the economy by encouraging additional capital\nspending, especially if accompanied by reduced uncertainty about future prospects. In\naddition, a tight labor market might draw in potential workers who would otherwise sit\non the sidelines and encourage job-to-job transitions that could also lead to moreefficient--and, hence, more-productive--job matches. 7 Finally, albeit more speculatively,\nstrong demand could potentially yield significant productivity gains by, among other\nthings, prompting higher levels of research and development spending and increasing the\nincentives to start new, innovative businesses.\nHysteresis effects--and the possibility they might be reversed--could have\nimportant implications for the conduct of monetary and fiscal policy. For example,\nhysteresis would seem to make it even more important for policymakers to act quickly\n\n6\n\nFernald (2015), however, argues that much of the apparent slowdown in U.S. potential GDP growth\nbegan prior to the 2007-09 recession.\n7\nSee Okun (1973) for an early discussion of the benefits of a high-pressure economy. Importantly, not all\nof these benefits might show up as measured output, but they would nonetheless be welfare improving--for\nexample, higher job satisfaction from better matches between workers and employers, as noted by Akerlof,\nRose, and Yellen (1988).\n\n\f-4and aggressively in response to a recession, because doing so would help to reduce the\ndepth and persistence of the downturn, thereby limiting the supply-side damage that\nmight otherwise ensue. In addition, if strong economic conditions can partially reverse\nsupply-side damage after it has occurred, then policymakers may want to aim at being\nmore accommodative during recoveries than would be called for under the traditional\nview that supply is largely independent of demand.\nMore research is needed, however, to better understand the influence of\nmovements in aggregate demand on aggregate supply. 8 From a policy perspective, we of\ncourse need to bear in mind that an accommodative monetary stance, if maintained too\nlong, could have costs that exceed the benefits by increasing the risk of financial\ninstability or undermining price stability. More generally, the benefits and potential costs\nof pursuing such a strategy remain hard to quantify, and other policies might be better\nsuited to address damage to the supply side of the economy.\nHeterogeneity\nMy second question asks whether individual differences within broad groups of\nactors in the economy can influence aggregate economic outcomes--in particular, what\neffect does such heterogeneity have on aggregate demand?\nMany macroeconomists work with models where groups of individual actors,\nsuch as households or firms, are treated as a single “representative” agent whose behavior\nstands in for that of the group as a whole. For example, rather than explicitly modeling\n\n8\n\nFor example, the experience of the 1990s might seem to provide a natural case study of whether reverse\nhysteresis is possible. Unfortunately, most studies of the labor market during this period do not directly\nspeak to this issue, although Holzer, Raphael, and Stoll (2006) investigate changes in employers’\nwillingness to hire less-skilled workers during these years, while Katz and Krueger (1999) and my own\nstudy with Blinder (2001) explore the somewhat related question of how the U.S. economy was able to\nsimultaneously experience rapid growth, low unemployment, and low inflation in the late 1990s.\n\n\f-5and then adding up the separate actions of a large number of different households, a\nmacro model might instead assume that the behavior of a single “average” household can\ndescribe the aggregate behavior of all households.\nPrior to the financial crisis, these so-called representative-agent models were the\ndominant paradigm for analyzing many macroeconomic questions. However, a\ndisaggregated approach seems needed to understand some key aspects of the Great\nRecession. To give one example, consider the effects of negative housing equity on\nconsumption. Although households typically reduce their spending in response to wealth\ndeclines, the many households whose equity positions in their homes were actually\ndriven negative by the reduction in house prices may have curtailed their spending even\nmore sharply because of a markedly reduced ability to borrow. Such a development, in\nturn, would shift the relationship between housing equity (which remained solidly\npositive in the aggregate) and consumer spending for the economy as a whole. Such a\nshift in an aggregate relationship would be difficult to understand or predict without\nusing disaggregated data and models.\nMore generally, studying the effects of household and firm heterogeneity might\nhelp us better account for the severity of the recession and the slow recovery. At the\nhousehold level, recent research finds that heterogeneity can amplify the effects of\nadverse shocks, a result that is largely driven by households with very little net worth that\nsharply increase their savings in a recession. 9 At the firm level, there is evidence that\nfinancial constraints had a particularly large adverse effect on employment at small firms\nand the start-up of new firms, factors that may be part of the explanation for the Great\n\n9\n\nSee Krueger, Mitman, and Perri (2016).\n\n\f-6Recession’s long duration and the subsequent slow recovery. 10 More generally, if larger\nfirms seeking to expand have better access to credit than smaller ones, overall growth in\ninvestment and employment could depend in part on the distribution of sales across\ndifferent types of businesses. Modeling any of these issues quantitatively will likely\nrequire the use of a heterogeneous-agent framework.\nEconomists’ understanding of how changes in fiscal and monetary policy affect\nthe economy might also benefit from the recognition that households and firms are\nheterogeneous. For example, in simple textbook models of the monetary transmission\nmechanism, central banks operate largely through the effect of real interest rates on\nconsumption and investment. Once heterogeneity is taken into account, other important\nchannels emerge. For example, spending by many households and firms appears to be\nquite sensitive to changes in labor income, business sales, or the value of collateral that in\nturn affects their access to credit--conditions that monetary policy affects only indirectly.\nStudying monetary models with heterogeneous agents more closely could help us shed\nnew light on these aspects of the monetary transmission mechanism.\nWhile the economics profession has long been aware that these issues matter,\ntheir effects had been incorporated into macro models only to a very limited extent prior\nto the financial crisis. 11 I am glad to now see a greater emphasis on the possible\nmacroeconomic consequences of heterogeneity, including in work by economists at the\n\n10\n\nOn the role of financing constraints for firm employment, see Siemer (2014); Chodorow-Reich (2014);\nand Duygan-Bump, Levkov, and Montoriol-Garriga (2015). A general-equilibrium model with\nheterogeneity among firms and credit frictions is studied in Khan and Thomas (2013). For the role of entry\nand exit in macroeconomic dynamics, see Clementi and Palazzo (2016) as well as Gourio, Messer, and\nSiemer (2016).\n11\nFor early quantitative work on the relationship between income and wealth heterogeneity and the\nmacroeconomy, see Krusell and Smith (1998).\n\n\f-7Federal Reserve. 12 Nevertheless, the various linkages between heterogeneity and\naggregate demand are not yet well understood, either empirically or theoretically. More\nbroadly, even though the tools of monetary policy are generally not well suited to achieve\ndistributional objectives, it is important for policymakers to understand and monitor the\neffects of macroeconomic developments on different groups within society.\nFinancial Linkages to the Real Economy\nMy third question concerns a key issue for monetary policy and macroeconomics\nthat is less directly addressed by this conference: How does the financial sector interact\nwith the broader economy?\nIn light of the housing bubble and subsequent events, policymakers clearly need\nto better understand what kinds of developments contribute to financial crises. What is\nthe relationship between the buildup of excessive leverage and the value of real estate and\nother types of collateral, and what factors impede or facilitate the deleveraging process\nthat follows? Does the economic fallout from a financial crisis depend on the particulars\nof the crisis, such as whether it involves widespread damage to household balance sheets?\nHow does the nature and degree of the interconnections between financial firms affect the\npropagation and amplification of stress through the financial system and overall\neconomy? Finally--and most importantly--what can monetary policy and financial\noversight do to reduce the frequency and severity of future crises?\n\n12\n\nGuvenen (2011) reviews several issues related to macroeconomics with heterogeneity. For an overview\nof the interactions between distribution and aggregate outcomes, see the work by Quadrini and Rios-Rull\n(2015). For recent work on the effects of monetary policy in models with heterogeneous agents, see\nKaplan, Moll, and Violante (2016); Gornemann, Kuester, and Nakajima (2016); Auclert (2016); and Sterk\nand Tenreyro (2016).\n\n\f-8Although the scope of these questions extends beyond the themes of this\nconference, it does include issues that are closely related. Consider the influence of\nbalance sheet conditions and noninterest credit terms on spending and overall activity--an\narea where it is important to take account of differences across individual households and\nfirms, as I just noted. Research on this topic has, of course, been ongoing for some time,\nand it has expanded greatly in the wake of the financial crisis. 13 But I believe we have a\nlot more to learn about the ways in which changes in underwriting standards and other\ndeterminants of credit availability interact with interest rates to affect such things as\nconsumer spending, housing demand and home prices, business investment (especially\nfor small firms), and the formation of new firms. 14 For example, is the persistent increase\nin the personal saving rate that we have observed since the collapse of the housing bubble\nprimarily a result of a sustained shift toward more prudent underwriting standards by\n\n13\n\nFor an example of early research on this topic, see Bernanke and Gertler (1989). Other important precrisis studies include the development of the financial accelerator model by Bernanke and others (1999a)\nand work by Kashyap and Stein (2000) and Peek, Rosengren, and Tootell (2003) on the bank balance sheet\nchannel and the effects of bank loan supply shocks. For a more recent summary of the role of banks in the\nmonetary transmission mechanism, see Peek and Rosengren (2013). Chaney, Sraer, and Thesmer (2012)\nprovide evidence for the collateral channel of real estate for corporate investment, while Mian, Rao, and\nSufi (2013) examine the influence of household balance sheets on consumption.\n14\nMore empirical work would be useful to disentangle the spending effects that result from changes in\ncredit conditions from those that result from movements in interest rates, as estimates of the latter likely\noften inadvertently incorporate the former. Most empirical models of the overall economy do not explicitly\ncontrol for the influence of noninterest credit factors on consumption and investment; as a result, estimated\ninterest rate effects will partially reflect the influence of these factors to the extent these factors are\ncorrelated with interest rates. There are many reasons to suspect that this is the case. Movements in\ninterest rates influence a firm’s cash flow and the value of its collateral, all else being equal. Higher\ninterest rates also adversely affect consumer spending and especially residential investment, both by\nforcing households to devote a greater portion of their income to debt service and by making it more\ndifficult to qualify for a loan because of maximum payment-to-income rules. Evidence for these effects is\nprovided by Gertler and Karadi (2015), who show that relatively small changes in short-term interest rates\nare correlated with large movements in credit costs. Such correlations and interactions may explain why\nsome types of spending appear to be more correlated with movements in nominal interest rates than with\nreal interest rates; see Fair (2004, ch. 3) for evidence on this point. Finally, the relative contributions of\nrelaxed lending standards, low interest rates, and other factors to housing bubbles, both in the United States\nand abroad, remains an open and unsettled topic; Agnello and Shucknecht (2011) present cross-country\nevidence that monetary policy plays an important role, while Dokko and others (2011) argue that monetary\npolicy was a minor influence in the most recent episode.\n\n\f-9lenders? Is it something that will ultimately prove transitory once households finish\nrepairing their balance sheets or become more confident about their future prospects for\nemployment and income? 15 The answer to this latter question could have significant\nimplications for the longer-run normal, or neutral, level of interest rates and thus for the\nconduct of monetary policy.\nInflation Dynamics\nMy fourth question goes to the heart of monetary policy: What determines\ninflation?\nFrom my perspective, the standard framework for thinking about inflation\ndynamics used by central bank economists and others prior to the financial crisis remains\nconceptually useful today. A simple description of this framework might go something\nlike this: 16 Inflation is characterized by an underlying trend that has been essentially\nconstant since the mid-1990s; previously, this trend seemed to drift over time, influenced\nby actual past inflation or other economic conditions. Theory and evidence suggest that\nthis trend is strongly influenced by inflation expectations that, in turn, depend on\nmonetary policy. In particular, the remarkable stability of various measures of expected\ninflation in recent years presumably represents the fruits of the Federal Reserve’s\nsustained efforts since the early 1980s to bring down and then stabilize inflation at a low\nlevel. The anchoring of inflation expectations that has resulted from this policy does not,\nhowever, prevent actual inflation from fluctuating from year to year in response to the\ntemporary influence of movements in energy prices and other disturbances. In addition,\n\n15\n\nSee Mian, Rao, and Sufi (2013) for an assessment of the role of leverage and housing wealth shocks in\ndriving consumption during the Great Recession. Work by Justiniano, Primiceri, and Tambalotti (2015)\nsuggests that debt overhang alone cannot explain the slow recovery from the Great Recession.\n16\nSee Yellen (2015) for a more extensive discussion.\n\n\f- 10 inflation will tend to run above or below its underlying trend to the extent that resource\nutilization--which may serve as an indicator of firms’ marginal costs--is persistently high\nor low. 17\nWhile this general framework for thinking about the inflation process remains\nuseful, questions about some of its quantitative features have arisen in the wake of the\nGreat Recession and the subsequent slow recovery. For example, the influence of labor\nmarket conditions on inflation in recent years seems to be weaker than had been\ncommonly thought prior to the financial crisis. Although inflation fell during the\nrecession, the decline was quite modest given how high unemployment rose; likewise,\nwages and prices rose comparatively little as the labor market gradually recovered.\nWhether this reduction in sensitivity was somehow caused by the recession or instead\npre-dated it and was merely revealed under extreme conditions is unclear. 18 Either way,\nthe underlying cause is unknown. Does the reduced sensitivity reflect structural changes,\nsuch as globalization or a greater role for intangible capital in production that have\nreduced the importance of cyclical swings in domestic activity for firms’ marginal costs\nand pricing power? Or does it perhaps reflect the well-documented reluctance--or,\n\n17\n\nIn the economic literature, this general description of the inflation process is referred to as the\nexpectations-augmented Phillips curve. In its simplest form, the Phillips curve relates inflation to expected\ninflation and the intensity of resource utilization in the economy. In practice, however, empirical\nspecifications also typically include measures of supply shocks, such as changes in the relative prices of\nenergy or imported goods, as additional determinants. Two well-known variants of the Phillips curve are\nthe traditional “accelerationist” specification and the so-called New Keynesian Phillips curve; the former\napproximates inflation expectations using a moving average of past inflation, while the latter assumes that\ninflation expectations are “rational” and consistent with the predictions of a structural model of the entire\neconomy. Some adherents of either type of Phillips curve argue that their preferred model can explain the\nbehavior of inflation during and after the financial crisis. For example, Gordon (2013) presents evidence in\nfavor of an accelerationist model, while Del Negro, Giannoni, and Schorfheide (2015) make this claim for a\nNew Keynesian model.\n18\nSee Blanchard (2016) for evidence on how the responsiveness of inflation to resource utilization has\nchanged over time. Interestingly, research suggests that this sensitivity began declining well before the\ncrisis.\n\n\f- 11 alternatively, limited ability--of firms to cut the nominal wages of their employees, which\ncould help to explain the relatively moderate movements in inflation we saw during and\nafter the recession? 19\nAnother gap in our knowledge about the nature of the inflation process concerns\nexpectations. Although many theoretical models suggest that actual inflation should be\nmost closely related to short-run inflation expectations, as an empirical matter, measures\nof long-run expectations appear to explain the data better. 20 Yet another unresolved issue\nconcerns whose expectations--those of consumers, firms, or investors--are most relevant\nfor wage and price setting, a point on which theory provides no clear-cut guidance. More\ngenerally, the precise manner in which expectations influence inflation deserves further\nstudy. 21\nPerhaps most importantly, we need to know more about the manner in which\ninflation expectations are formed and how monetary policy influences them. Ultimately,\nboth actual and expected inflation are tied to the central bank’s inflation target, whether\nthat target is explicit or implicit. 22 But how does this anchoring process occur? Does a\ncentral bank have to keep actual inflation near the target rate for many years before\ninflation expectations completely conform? Can policymakers instead materially\n\n19\n\nFor an early discussion of the potential macroeconomic effects of downward nominal wage rigidity, see\nAkerlof, Dickens, and Perry (1996). More recently, Daly and Hobijn (2014) develop a model in which the\nreluctance or inability of firms to cut nominal wages (or both) creates important nonlinearities in the\nrelationship between labor utilization and wage inflation. Finally, Fallick, Lettau, and Wascher (2015)\nreview the evidence for downward nominal wage rigidity in recent years and explore the ways in which it\nhas interacted with labor market stress over time.\n20\nSpecifically, survey measures of long-run inflation expectations are broadly correlated with estimates of\ninflation’s longer-term trend. See Clark and Davig (2008); see also Faust and Wright (2013, who make a\nrelated point in the context of inflation forecasting.\n21\nAs Mavroeidis, Plagborg-Moller, and Stock (2014) conclude from their exhaustive survey, empirical\nestimates of the New Keynesian inflation equation are “unable to pin down the role of expectations in the\ninflation process sufficiently accurately for the results to be useful for policy analysis” (p. 172).\n22\nFor a discussion of the theoretical and empirical influence of monetary policy on inflation in the context\nof a formal inflation-targeting regime, see Bernanke and others (1999b).\n\n\f- 12 influence inflation expectations directly and quickly by simply announcing their intention\nto pursue a particular inflation goal in the future? Or does the truth lie somewhere in\nbetween, with a change in expectations requiring some combination of clear\ncommunications about policymakers’ inflation goal, concrete policy actions to\ndemonstrate their commitment to that goal, and at least some success in moving actual\ninflation toward its desired level in order to demonstrate the feasibility of the strategy?\nAlthough historical experience suggests that changing the public’s inflation expectations\nwould be neither quick nor easy, it is not clear which of these possibilities is correct. 23\nWith nominal short-term interest rates at or close to their effective lower bound in\nmany countries, the broader question of how expectations are formed has taken on\nheightened importance. Under such circumstances, many central banks have sought\nadditional ways to stimulate their economies, including adopting policies that are directly\naimed at influencing expectations of future interest rates and inflation. The unusually\nexplicit and extended guidance about the likely future path of the federal funds rate that\nwas provided by the FOMC from 2011 through 2014 is an example of such a policy, as is\nthe Bank of Japan’s upward revision to its official inflation objective in 2013. Moreover,\nthese and other expectational strategies may be needed again in the future, given the\nlikelihood that the global economy may continue to experience historically low interest\nrates, thereby making it unlikely that reductions in short-term interest rates alone would\nbe an adequate response to a future recession. 24\n\n23\n\nSee Kiley (2008) for a discussion of the relationship between U.S. monetary policy and survey measures\nof long-run inflation expectations; his results suggest that it took many years for the Federal Reserve to\nsucceed in anchoring long-run expectations at a low level. In a similar vein, Bernanke and others (1999b)\nconclude that inflation expectations “respond only after a lag following declines in [actual] inflation”\n(p. 298) based on their study of the effects of adopting inflation targeting in different countries.\n24\nI discussed this likelihood in a recent speech (Yellen, 2016).\n\n\f- 13 For all of these reasons, I hope that researchers will strive to improve our\nunderstanding of inflation dynamics and its interactions with monetary policy.\nInternational Linkages\nBefore closing, let me mention one additional area where more study is needed-the effects of changes in U.S. monetary policy on financial and economic conditions in\nthe rest of the world and the ways in which those foreign effects can feed back to\ninfluence conditions here at home. Of course, cross-country monetary policy spillovers\nhave been the subject of scholarly debate since the Great Depression, and much of the\nformal analysis of this topic dates back to the early 1960s. 25 But this issue has received\nrenewed interest with the advent of unconventional monetary policies after the Great\nRecession and, more recently, the divergence of monetary policies among major\nadvanced-economy central banks.\nBroadly speaking, monetary policy actions in one country spill over to other\neconomies through three main channels: changes in exchange rates; changes in domestic\ndemand, which alter the economy’s imports; and changes in domestic financial\nconditions--such as interest rates and asset prices--that, through portfolio balance and\nother channels, affect financial conditions abroad. Research by Federal Reserve staff\nsuggests that, all told, U.S. monetary policy spillovers to other economies are positive-that is, policies designed to provide stimulus to the U.S. economy also boost activity\nabroad, as negative effects of dollar depreciation are offset by positive effects of higher\nU.S. imports and easier foreign financial conditions. 26 However, this issue is far from\n\n25\n\nSee Mundell (1963) and Fleming (1962).\nSee Ammer, De Pooter, Erceg, and Kamin (2016). Other recent research on this topic includes Fukuda,\nKimura, Sudo, and Ugai (2013); Georgiadis (2015); Glick and Leduc (2015); and Ilzetski and Jin (2013).\n\n26\n\n\f- 14 settled, as are a host of other related questions, including the following: Do U.S.\nmonetary policy actions affect advanced and emerging market countries differently? Do\nconventional and unconventional monetary policies spill over to other countries\ndifferently? And to what extent are U.S. interest rates and financial conditions influenced\nby easing measures abroad?\nConclusion\nIn closing, I would like to commend the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston for\norganizing this conference and fostering research and debate on questions vital to our\nunderstanding of the economy. Answering these questions will help the Federal\nReserve’s efforts to promote a healthy economy, and I am grateful for the opportunity to\nspeak to you today and be part of this important discussion.\n\n\f- 15 References\nAgnello, Luca, and Ludger Schuknecht (2011). “Booms and Busts in Housing Markets:\nDeterminants and Implications,” Journal of Housing Economics, vol. 20\n(September), pp. 171-90.\nAkerlof, George A., William T.

Yellen\nChair\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\n“Banking and the Economy: A Forum for Minority Bankers”\nSponsored by the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City\n\nKansas City, Missouri\n\nSeptember 29, 2016\n\n\fThank you, and I also would like to thank the organizers of this forum for\narranging for me to be part of your conversation, on a day when other business\nunfortunately prevents me from travelling to Kansas City.\nAnd I am really looking forward to hearing from all of you on what I expect will\nbe a range of topics, but I thought I might start with a few remarks about something of\nconsiderable interest to me, which is diversity and inclusion.\nI think the Kansas City Fed is an excellent place to discuss this issue because of\nthe recognition it has received for promoting diversity and inclusion, both among\nbusinesses and other organizations in the 10th District and in its own ranks. I know that\nthe Bank is continuing to hold Diversity Summits with firms and community groups, the\nmost recent of which was last month. In various ways, it is also promoting diversity\namong its own staff and senior leaders through recruiting, hiring and promotions, and is\nclosely tracking progress. The Greater Kansas City Chamber of Commerce singled out\nthe Bank this year for its diversity efforts from among 20 organizations and businesses.\nI believe these efforts reflect a commitment to diversity that is found throughout\nthe Federal Reserve System, and I would like to talk a bit about the basis for that\ncommitment, starting with why it is that diversity, in its different forms, is so important.\nOne reason that the Fed organizes conferences such as this one is to facilitate\ncommunication. In this case, we want to communicate with you, as leaders of institutions\nwe oversee and are otherwise affected by our decisions. We want to understand your\nviews and try to explain what we are trying to accomplish. Such communication would\nnot be effective if only one or just a few banks in the 10th District were part of the\nconversation. Today’s forum includes bankers from smaller community banks, regional\n\n\f-2banks, and large banks because the roles of your institutions in your communities differ,\nand hearing your different views provides a fuller picture of the industry’s views.\nSimilarly, it is important to include in the conversation bankers of diverse backgrounds,\nwhich is why it is important that we hear from minority bankers.\nIn these examples, diversity in its various forms is a source of strength, which is\nsomething that we as financial regulators understand very well. The Federal Reserve\nsupports an ongoing role for community banks in part because diversity among financial\ninstitutions promotes a stable and healthy financial system, spurring competition and\nensuring that customers of all types have access to a wide variety of services. The\nFederal Reserve supports the Partnership for Progress, which assists and advises\nminority-owned financial institutions, because we believe that those institutions are\nlikewise a source of diversity that contributes to a healthy financial system.\nI expect it is not news, either, to bankers, that diversity is a source of strength.\nEvery day, in serving customers, bankers can see the strength that comes from diversity-the wisdom of diversification in investment decisions, in diverse product lines for the\nbusinesses you lend to, and especially in the strength of diverse communities.\nDiversity also strengthens organizations by making it possible to have a wide\nvariety of views available. It helps ensure that individuals within those organizations\nhave the opportunity to shine and employ their talents to the fullest and that their best\nideas are heard and acted on. The banks you serve are better able to reach new\ncustomers, especially groups of customers who have historically been underbanked, when\nthey show that serving those customers is a top priority. And one of the most effective\nways of showing a commitment to a diverse customer base is showing a commitment to a\n\n\f-3diverse workforce. Demographic trends indicate that minorities will be an increasing\nshare of the population in the years and decades ahead, and thus an increasing share of\nnew customers for your institutions.\nMy organization, the Federal Reserve, is also committed to a diverse workforce\nand to diversity in our senior leadership. The Federal Reserve is pursuing this goal not\nonly for all of the practical reasons I have cited to seek diversity, but also because it is the\nright thing to do. I want to be clear to all of you that I am committed to improving\ndiversity throughout our organization, including at the upper ranks. Diversity is also\nimportant on the boards of directors and advisory councils of Reserve Banks. I hope, in\nfact, that in this room today there are individuals who one day may serve as an advisor,\ndirector or even a Reserve Bank President or member of the Board of Governors.\nImproving diversity requires effort and constant focus. We will continue working\nhard to achieve this goal. I believe it is as vital to the Federal Reserve as it is to your\nemployers, and to every employer, to improve diversity and extend opportunity to\neveryone.\n\n\f"

            "content": "For release on delivery\n10:00 a.m. EDT\nSeptember 28, 2016\n\nStatement by\nJanet L. Yellen\nChair\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nbefore the\nCommittee on Financial Services\nU.S. House of Representatives\nSeptember 28, 2016\n\n\fChairman Hensarling, Ranking Member Waters, and other members of the committee, I\nappreciate the opportunity to testify on the Federal Reserve’s regulation and supervision of\nfinancial institutions.\nOne of the Federal Reserve’s fundamental goals is to make sure that our regulatory and\nsupervisory program is tailored to the risk that different financial institutions pose to the system\nas a whole. As we saw in 2007–08, the failure of systemically important financial institutions\ncan destabilize the financial system and undermine the real economy. The largest, most\ncomplicated firms must therefore be subject to prudential standards that are more stringent than\nthe standards that apply to other firms. Small and medium-sized banking organizations--whose\nfailure would generally pose much less risk to the system--should be subject to standards that are\nmaterially less stringent.\nThe Federal Reserve has made substantial progress in building a regulatory and\nsupervisory program that is consistent with these principles. We have implemented key\nstandards designed to limit the financial stability risks posed by the largest, most complex\nbanking firms. We continue to work on some remaining standards and to assess the adequacy of\nthis package of measures. With respect to small and medium-sized banks, we must build on the\nsteps we have already taken to ensure that they do not face undue regulatory burdens. Looking\nforward, we must continue to monitor for the emergence of new risks, since another key lesson\nfrom the crisis is that financial stability threats change over time.\nStrengthening the Regulation and Supervision of the Largest Financial Institutions\nThe Federal Reserve’s post-crisis efforts to strengthen its regulation and supervision of\nlarge banks have focused on promoting the safety and soundness of these firms and on limiting\nthe adverse effects that their distress or failure could have on the financial system and the\n\n\f-2broader economy. This orientation is consistent with section 165 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street\nReform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act), which directs the Board to impose\nenhanced prudential standards on large banking organizations “in order to prevent or mitigate\nrisks to financial stability.” Our efforts to mitigate financial stability risks posed by large\nfinancial institutions generally fall into one of two categories. First, we aim to make large\nfinancial institutions more resilient in order to reduce the likelihood of their failure or distress.\nAnd second, we aim to make large financial institutions more resolvable to limit the damage that\ntheir failure would have on the rest of the financial system and on the broader economy.\nResiliency\nTo increase the resiliency of the largest banking organizations, the Federal Reserve has\nestablished a broad set of enhanced prudential standards for large domestic and foreign banking\norganizations. Together with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and the Office\nof the Comptroller of the Currency, we have implemented capital rules that require large banking\norganizations to hold substantially larger amounts of high-quality capital than they were required\nto hold before the 2007–08 crisis, and we have adopted a liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) that\nrequires these organizations to hold a buffer of high-quality, liquid assets sufficient to meet\nliquidity outflows during a 30-day period of severe funding stress. We have also proposed\nsingle-counterparty credit limits that are designed to guard against the build-up of excessive\nconcentrations of credit risk and, along with the other federal banking agencies, proposed a Net\nStable Funding Ratio that would require banks to maintain a minimum level of stable funding\nrelative to the liquidity of their assets over a one-year horizon.\nIn addition to strengthening the regulation of the largest, most complex financial\ninstitutions, we have also transformed our supervision of firms that pose elevated risk to U.S.\n\n\f-3financial stability through the creation of the Large Institution Supervision Coordinating\nCommittee (LISCC). 1 The LISCC is distinguished by several characteristics. First, the LISCC\nhas implemented a centralized, multidisciplinary approach to supervision by bringing together\nexperts from around the Federal Reserve System in the areas of supervision, research, legal\ncounsel, financial markets, and payments systems. Second, major areas of focus for the\nsupervision of firms in the LISCC portfolio are capital and liquidity resiliency under normal and\npotentially adverse conditions in the future, as well as recovery and resolution preparedness.\nAnd third, the LISCC complements traditional, firm-specific supervisory work with annual\n“horizontal” programs that examine these firms at the same time and on the same set of issues in\norder to promote better monitoring of trends and consistency of assessments across all of the\nLISCC firms.\nWith regard to capital adequacy, the introduction of capital stress testing for large\nbanking organizations has been one of our signature innovations since the financial crisis. As\nevents during the financial crisis demonstrated, capital buffers that seem adequate in a benign\nenvironment may turn out to be far less than adequate during periods of stress. For this reason,\nconsistent with the stress-testing mandate in the Dodd-Frank Act, the Federal Reserve conducts\nsupervisory stress tests each year on banking organizations with $50 billion or more in total\nassets to determine whether they have sufficient capital to continue operations through periods of\neconomic stress and market turbulence, and whether their capital planning frameworks are\nadequate to their risk profiles. The expectation embodied in our stress testing program that large\n\n1\n\nThe firms currently in the LISCC portfolio are American International Group, Inc.; Bank of America Corporation;\nThe Bank of New York Mellon Corporation; Barclays PLC; Citigroup Inc.; Credit Suisse Group AG;\nDeutsche Bank AG; The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.; JPMorgan Chase & Co.; Morgan Stanley; Prudential\nFinancial, Inc.; State Street Corporation; UBS AG; and Wells Fargo & Company. Further information on the\nLISCC is available on the Board’s website at www.federalreserve.gov/bankinforeg/large-institutionsupervision.htm.\n\n\f-4banking organizations should maintain sufficient capital buffers to withstand a period of\nsignificant stress promotes the resilience of those firms and of the financial system more\ngenerally.\nWhile our stress testing program has been successful since it was first introduced in 2009,\nthe crisis reinforced the need for regulators and supervisors to continually revisit the\neffectiveness of their tools and adjust as needed over time. We therefore launched a review of\nthe Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR) program last year with the aim of reassessing our stress testing practices on a comprehensive basis. As part of this process, we met\nwith a wide range of stakeholders, including academics, analysts, bankers, public interest groups,\nand others. We are now considering making several changes to our stress testing methodology\nand process.\nThe leading idea that has emerged from our comprehensive CCAR review is to integrate\nCCAR with our regulatory capital framework. More specifically, the regulatory capital rules\nnow include a firm-specific, risk-based capital surcharge for each global systemically important\nbank (G-SIB) and a uniform capital conservation buffer requirement above the regulatory capital\nminimum for all firms. Under the approach we are considering, the existing capital conservation\nbuffer would be replaced with a risk-sensitive, firm-specific buffer that is sized based on stress\ntest results. Each firm’s buffer requirement would be set equal to the decline in its common\nequity tier 1 capital ratio in the supervisory stress test. The buffer requirement would be floored\nat 2.5 percent of risk-weighted assets, the current level of the capital conservation buffer, to\navoid any reduction in the stringency of the regulatory capital rules. We call this idea the “stress\ncapital buffer,” and it would effectively move the stress test to the center of our regulatory\ncapital framework.\n\n\f-5For the eight U.S. G-SIBs, the move to the stress loss buffer--which would be similar in\neffect to including the G-SIB capital surcharge in the CCAR post-stress minimum--would result\nin a significant aggregate increase in capital requirements. Thus, in addition to simplifying the\ncapital framework by integrating CCAR with our regulatory capital rules, the stress loss buffer\nwould advance our macroprudential goal of making G-SIBs more resilient. In contrast, the move\nto the stress loss buffer approach generally would not entail a toughening of our requirements for\nthe 25 large banking firms that are subject to CCAR but are not G-SIBs. Nor would the move\nhave any impact on community banks or other firms with less than $50 billion in assets.\nWe are also considering making certain changes to the stress test assumptions used in\nCCAR. For example, under the current CCAR program, a firm’s capital adequacy is assessed by\nassuming that the firm continues to make its baseline capital distributions over the stress test’s\ntwo-year planning horizon. We are considering changing this conservative assumption, in\nsignificant part because of the advent of the capital conservation buffer in the regulatory capital\nrules, which limits the ability of a firm to make capital distributions when its capital ratios are\nlower than the buffer requirement. Instead, we are proposing that firms simply add one year of\nplanned dividends to their stress capital buffer requirement in recognition of the fact that firms\ngenerally are more reluctant to reduce dividends than share buybacks. On this and other changes\nto CCAR that we are considering, we will of course seek public input before moving to adopt\nthem.\nResolvability\nDuring the crisis, fears about the systemic consequences that would result from the\nbankruptcies of systemically important firms motivated extraordinary government actions. The\nfears proved well-founded: The bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers significantly exacerbated the\n\n\f-6crisis. To reduce the potential that resolution of a large financial firm in bankruptcy will be\ndisorderly, section 165(d) of the Dodd-Frank Act requires large banking organizations to\nproduce living wills that help these firms prepare to be resolved in an orderly way under the\nBankruptcy Code. Although the Bankruptcy Code provides the default legal framework for\nresolving a failed bank holding company, the Dodd-Frank Act also creates a backup resolution\nauthority that can be used if the resolution of a failed financial company under the Bankruptcy\nCode would have serious adverse effects on U.S. financial stability. The orderly liquidation\nauthority in Title II of the Dodd-Frank Act has several features that could reduce the systemic\nimpact of a firm’s resolution, including an orderly liquidation fund and provisions to prevent the\nchaotic unwinding of a firm’s derivatives, securities financing transactions, and other qualified\nfinancial contracts. In the unlikely event that the orderly liquidation fund does incur losses, these\nlosses would be covered by assessments on major financial firms and would not be passed on to\ntaxpayers.\nThe Federal Reserve has recently proposed important new rules to increase the prospects\nfor the orderly resolution of a G-SIB. Last October, the Board proposed to require the eight U.S.\nG-SIBs to meet total loss-absorbing capacity (TLAC) and long-term debt requirements. The\nproposal would require these systemically important firms to maintain outstanding a large\nquantity of long-term debt that could be used to absorb losses and recapitalize the firm in\nresolution. Because, by definition, the actual equity of a bank will have been substantially\ndepleted--if not totally eliminated--by the time it fails, a separate long-term debt requirement is\nessential to ensure that the resolution authority has the raw material from which to manufacture\nnew equity in resolution to recapitalize and stabilize the failed firm. For this reason, the\nproposed long-term debt requirement would more assuredly enhance the prospects for successful\n\n\f-7resolution--and thereby contribute to solving the too-big-to-fail problem--than would a TLAC\nrequirement on its own. The proposal would also restrict the operations of G-SIB holding\ncompanies, so that those legal entities could go through resolution without setting off short-term\nwholesale funding runs or otherwise jeopardizing financial stability.\nIn May this year, the Board issued another proposal to make G-SIBs more resolvable.\nThis second proposed rule would impose restrictions on G-SIBs’ qualified financial contracts-including derivatives and repurchase agreements (repos)--to guard against the rapid, mass\nunwinding of those contracts during the resolution of a G-SIB. The proposed restrictions are a\nkey step toward G-SIB resolvability because rapidly unwinding these contracts could destabilize\nthe financial system by causing asset fire sales and toppling other firms.\nActing in conjunction with the FDIC, the Board has also sought to increase G-SIB\nresolvability through the living wills process. In April this year, the Board and the FDIC\nannounced the results of their review of the eight U.S. G-SIBs’ 2015 resolution plans. During\nthis review, the agencies evaluated the plans based on the firms’ capital, liquidity, governance\nmechanisms, operational capabilities, legal entity rationalization, derivatives and trading\nactivities, and responsiveness to prior agency feedback. The agencies found that five of the GSIBs’ plans fell short of the resolvability standard set by the Dodd-Frank Act and required those\nfirms to fix deficiencies in their plans by October of this year or potentially face more stringent\nprudential requirements. If the agencies jointly determine that a firm has failed to adequately\nremedy the noted deficiencies, the agencies may jointly determine that the company or its\nsubsidiaries will be subject to more stringent capital, leverage, or liquidity requirements or to\nrestrictions on the growth, activities, or operations of the firm. The agencies also identified less-\n\n\f-8severe shortcomings in the plans of all eight U.S. G-SIBs, which are expected to be addressed in\nthe next round of resolution plan submissions, due in July 2017.\nThe resolution planning process requires firms to demonstrate that they have adequately\nassessed the challenges that their structure and business activities would pose during resolution\nand that they have taken action to address those issues. Firms must also confront the resolution\nconsequences of their day-to-day management decisions on a continual basis, particularly those\nrelated to structure, business activities, capital and liquidity allocation, and governance. Firms\nare also expected to create a meaningful set of options for selling operations and business lines to\ngenerate resources and to allow for restructuring under stress, including through the sale or winddown of discrete businesses that could further minimize the direct impact of the firm’s distress or\nfailure on the broader financial system. The deficiencies and shortcomings issued in the most\nrecent plan review focus on steps necessary to ensure these objectives are met at each G-SIB on\nan ongoing basis.\nIn addition to providing the firms with our feedback on their resolution plans, the\nagencies took several steps in April to improve the transparency of the resolution planning\nexercise. These steps included publicly releasing the firm feedback letters, a paper outlining the\nresolution plan assessment framework and firm determinations, and a document detailing the\nexpectations of the agencies regarding the firms’ 2017 resolution plan submissions. The\nexpectations articulated for the 2017 plan contents build on detailed guidance previously\nprovided to the G-SIBs in 2014 and 2015.\nWhile the five firms that received joint deficiencies are required to fix those deficiencies\nby October 2016, all of the firms that received agency feedback in April are required to submit a\nfull resolution plan by July 1, 2017. In these plans, firms will be required to address all\n\n\f-9identified shortcomings, follow all guidance provided by the agencies, and meet all statutory and\nregulatory requirements for their resolution plans. In meeting these expectations, the actions that\nfirms need to take should be substantially complete by July 2017, as previously communicated\nby the agencies.\nRegulation and Supervision of Large and Regional Banking Organizations\nIn supervising banking organizations with more than $50 billion in assets but outside the\nLISCC program, the Board focuses on ensuring that companies are well managed, appropriately\ncapitalized, and prepared to withstand potential adverse developments in the business\nenvironment. However, because the distress or failure of a non-LISCC firm is unlikely to have\nthe same effect on the financial system and broader economy as that of a LISCC firm, we do not\napply the full range of rules that we apply to those in the LISCC portfolio. For example, the\nBoard’s risk-based and leverage capital surcharges, as well as the recently proposed long-term\ndebt and TLAC requirements, only apply to G-SIBs. Similarly, the advanced approaches capital\nrules, countercyclical capital buffer, supplementary leverage ratio, and full LCR only apply to\nthe largest and most internationally active banking organizations. We also scale our examination\nprocedures to reflect the lower level of systemic risk presented by banks with more than\n$50 billion in assets that are not LISCC companies.\nAs a result of the comprehensive CCAR review I described earlier, we are also\nconsidering exempting from the qualitative portions of CCAR any bank that has less than\n$250 billion in total assets and that does not have significant international or nonbank activity.\nWhile we strongly believe the CCAR qualitative review produces significant safety and\nsoundness benefits for the largest firms, we can achieve our supervisory goals at most mediumsized banking firms using our normal supervisory program combined with targeted horizontal\n\n\f- 10 assessments of particular aspects of capital planning, as many of these firms are now meeting or\nclose to meeting our supervisory expectations for capital planning processes. As required by\nstatute, these firms would still be subject to the quantitative portion of our stress testing program.\nBut even with respect to the quantitative portions of CCAR, we are considering reducing the\namount of data that these firms are required to submit for stress testing purposes.\nRegulatory and supervisory requirements are further tailored for regional banking\norganizations, defined as those with total assets between $10 billion and $50 billion. For\nexample, while regional banking organizations must comply with capital rules, they are not\nsubject to a supervisory stress test or CCAR. Rather, as required by the Dodd-Frank Act,\nregional banking organizations perform their own stress tests. Similarly, these companies are not\nsubject to enhanced prudential standards established under section 165 of the Dodd-Frank Act,\nthe LCR, or other related requirements. Instead, we conduct regular inspections of regional\nbanking organizations and evaluate their safety and soundness based on each company’s\nindividual circumstances, in addition to horizontal exams we conduct of regional banking\norganizations. Because many regional banking organizations concentrate their assets and\nactivities in banking subsidiaries that are supervised by other federal banking agencies, we\ncoordinate supervisory activities closely with the other U.S. banking agencies and rely\nsignificantly on the results of their examinations, focusing our own inspections on the parent\ncompany and its ability to serve as a source of strength to the subsidiary banks.\nCommunity Bank Supervision\nI know that community banks play a vital role in many of your districts. Let me say that\nthe experiences and challenges of community banking are not new to me. Before I became Chair\nof the Board of Governors and Vice Chair before that, I spent six years as president of the\n\n\f- 11 Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco. In that role, I was involved in the supervision of a\nsubstantial number of community banking organizations in the nine states of the San Francisco\nDistrict. Among the lessons that experience reinforced is that when it comes to bank regulation\nand supervision, one size does not fit all. To effectively promote safety and soundness and to\nensure that institutions comply with applicable consumer protection laws without creating undue\nregulatory burden, rules and supervisory approaches should be tailored to different types of\ninstitutions such as community banks.\nThe Federal Reserve supervises more than 800 community banks and more than 4,000\nholding companies that control small depository institutions. These are banking organizations\nwith total assets of $10 billion or less. In supervising community banks, we follow a riskfocused approach that aims to target examination resources to higher-risk areas of each bank’s\noperations and to ensure that banks maintain risk-management capabilities appropriate to their\nsize and complexity. In the wake of the crisis, we have taken steps to refine this process by\nusing the financial data we collect from banks to calibrate our examination procedures based on\nrisk. We believe this will help us to identify and address emerging risks and to ensure that\ncommunity bank examiners with specialized expertise are allocated to the institutions exhibiting\nthe highest risks. We also implemented a risk-focused consumer compliance examination\nframework for community banks in 2014 that is intended to allow examiners to spend less time\non low-risk compliance issues so that issues more likely to result in harm to consumers get more\nattention.\nThe Federal Reserve and the other banking agencies are currently in the process of\ncompleting the Economic Growth and Regulatory Paperwork Reduction Act (EGRPRA) review.\nUnder EGRPRA, the federal banking agencies are required to conduct a joint review of their\n\n\f- 12 regulations every 10 years to identify provisions that are outdated, unnecessary, or unduly\nburdensome. The Federal Reserve views this review as a timely opportunity to step back and\nidentify ways to reduce regulatory burden, particularly for smaller or less complex banks that\npose less risk to the U.S. financial system. In carrying out this review, the agencies sought\npublic comment on their regulations and held several roundtable discussions with bankers and\ninterested parties to gather additional feedback on sources of burden. Themes emerging from\nthese comments include streamlining the Call Report, reducing examination frequency, raising\nlong-standing dollar-based thresholds for appraisals, and reducing the complexity of capital\nrequirements for smaller banks. In response to public comments on examination frequency, the\nagencies have already approved interim rules to implement a provision of the Fixing America’s\nSurface Transportation Act (FAST Act), which raises the asset threshold for insured depository\ninstitutions that are eligible for an 18-month examination cycle from $500 million to\n$1 billion. As a result of raising the threshold, eligible institutions will be subject to fewer safety\nand soundness and Bank Secrecy Act exams. The agencies are also exploring potential options\nfor alleviating some burdens of appraisal requirements and are actively considering proposals to\nsimplify regulatory capital requirements for community banks.\nIn addition, the banking agencies, under the auspices of the Federal Financial Institutions\nExamination Council, recently issued a proposal for a new and streamlined Call Report for\ncommunity banks. The proposal would eliminate certain data items and reduce the reporting\nfrequency of many other data items. As a result, banks with less than $1 billion in total assets\nwould submit a Call Report with about 40 percent fewer data items than the existing Call Report.\nThe proposal incorporates comments the banking agencies received from community banks\n\n\f- 13 during several outreach events used to gather information on the challenges faced by community\nbanks in preparing Call Reports.\nCongress may also wish to consider carving out community banks from two sets of\nDodd-Frank Act requirements: the Volcker rule and the incentive compensation limits in section\n956. The risks addressed by these statutory provisions are far more significant at larger\ninstitutions than they are at community banks. In the event that a community bank engages in\npractices in either of these areas that raise heightened concerns, we would be able to address\nthese concerns as part of the normal safety-and-soundness supervisory process. While the\nbanking agencies have tailored the Volcker rule and have proposed significant tailoring of\nincentive compensation rules, community banks and supervisors would benefit from not having\nto focus on regulatory compliance for matters that are unlikely to pose problems at smaller\nbanks.\nCurrent Conditions\nHaving reviewed some of the major elements of our regulatory and supervisory\nprograms, let me offer a few brief remarks about the current state of the firms we regulate.\nIn response to regulatory and supervisory pressures, the financial condition of the U.S. GSIBs has strengthened considerably since the crisis. Common equity capital at the eight U.S. GSIBs alone has more than doubled since 2008, representing an increase to almost $800 billion.\nMoreover, these firms generally have developed much more stable funding positions. The\nlargest banking organizations have increased their holdings of high-quality liquid assets by over\n$1 trillion over the past five years, at the same time as they have substantially reduced their\nreliance on run-prone sources of funding. Reducing run-risk is a central goal of post-crisis\nregulation and supervision.\n\n\f- 14 Our examinations have found large and regional banks to be well capitalized. Both large\nand regional banking organizations have shown improved profitability since the depths of the\nfinancial crisis, although these banks have also faced challenges in recent years because of weak\ngrowth in interest and noninterest income. Both large and regional institutions have seen robust\ngrowth in commercial and industrial lending, which supports sustainable job creation.\nFinally, community banks are significantly healthier. More than 95 percent are now\nprofitable, and capital lost during the crisis has been largely replenished. Loan growth is picking\nup, and problem loans are now at levels last seen early in the financial crisis.\nConclusion\nIn conclusion, our post-crisis approach to regulation and supervision is both forwardlooking and tailored to the level of risk that firms pose to financial stability and the broader\neconomy. Standards for the largest, most complex banking organizations are now significantly\nmore stringent than standards for small and medium-sized banks, which is appropriate given the\nimpact that the failure or distress of those firms could have on the economy. As I have\ndiscussed, we anticipate taking additional actions in the near term to further tailor our regulatory\nand supervisory framework.\nYet even as we finalize the major elements of post-crisis reform, our work is not\ncomplete. We must carefully monitor the impact of the regulatory changes we have made and\nremain vigilant regarding the potential emergence of new risks to financial stability. We must\nstand ready to adjust our regulatory approach where changes are warranted. The work we do to\nensure the financial system remains strong and stable is designed to protect and support the real\neconomy that sustains the businesses and jobs on which American households rely.\n\n\f"

Yellen\nChair\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\n“Designing Resilient Monetary Policy Frameworks for the Future”\na symposium sponsored by the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City\nJackson Hole, Wyoming\n\nAugust 26, 2016\n\n\fThe Global Financial Crisis and Great Recession posed daunting new challenges\nfor central banks around the world and spurred innovations in the design,\nimplementation, and communication of monetary policy. With the U.S. economy now\nnearing the Federal Reserve’s statutory goals of maximum employment and price\nstability, this conference provides a timely opportunity to consider how the lessons we\nlearned are likely to influence the conduct of monetary policy in the future.\nThe theme of the conference, “Designing Resilient Monetary Policy Frameworks\nfor the Future,” encompasses many aspects of monetary policy, from the nitty-gritty\ndetails of implementing policy in financial markets to broader questions about how policy\naffects the economy. Within the operational realm, key choices include the selection of\npolicy instruments, the specific markets in which the central bank participates, and the\nsize and structure of the central bank’s balance sheet. These topics are of great\nimportance to the Federal Reserve. As noted in the minutes of last month’s Federal Open\nMarket Committee (FOMC) meeting, we are studying many issues related to policy\nimplementation, research which ultimately will inform the FOMC’s views on how to\nmost effectively conduct monetary policy in the years ahead. I expect that the work\ndiscussed at this conference will make valuable contributions to the understanding of\nmany of these important issues.\nMy focus today will be the policy tools that are needed to ensure that we have a\nresilient monetary policy framework. In particular, I will focus on whether our existing\ntools are adequate to respond to future economic downturns. As I will argue, one lesson\nfrom the crisis is that our pre-crisis toolkit was inadequate to address the range of\neconomic circumstances that we faced. Looking ahead, we will likely need to retain\n\n\f-2many of the monetary policy tools that were developed to promote recovery from the\ncrisis. In addition, policymakers inside and outside the Fed may wish at some point to\nconsider additional options to secure a strong and resilient economy. But before I turn to\nthese longer-run issues, I would like to offer a few remarks on the near-term outlook for\nthe U.S. economy and the potential implications for monetary policy.\nCurrent Economic Situation and Outlook\nU.S. economic activity continues to expand, led by solid growth in household\nspending. But business investment remains soft and subdued foreign demand and the\nappreciation of the dollar since mid-2014 continue to restrain exports. While economic\ngrowth has not been rapid, it has been sufficient to generate further improvement in the\nlabor market. Smoothing through the monthly ups and downs, job gains averaged\n190,000 per month over the past three months. Although the unemployment rate has\nremained fairly steady this year, near 5 percent, broader measures of labor utilization\nhave improved. Inflation has continued to run below the FOMC’s objective of 2 percent,\nreflecting in part the transitory effects of earlier declines in energy and import prices.\nLooking ahead, the FOMC expects moderate growth in real gross domestic\nproduct (GDP), additional strengthening in the labor market, and inflation rising to\n2 percent over the next few years. Based on this economic outlook, the FOMC continues\nto anticipate that gradual increases in the federal funds rate will be appropriate over time\nto achieve and sustain employment and inflation near our statutory objectives. Indeed, in\nlight of the continued solid performance of the labor market and our outlook for\neconomic activity and inflation, I believe the case for an increase in the federal funds rate\n\n\f-3has strengthened in recent months. Of course, our decisions always depend on the degree\nto which incoming data continues to confirm the Committee’s outlook.\nAnd, as ever, the economic outlook is uncertain, and so monetary policy is not on\na preset course. Our ability to predict how the federal funds rate will evolve over time is\nquite limited because monetary policy will need to respond to whatever disturbances may\nbuffet the economy. In addition, the level of short-term interest rates consistent with the\ndual mandate varies over time in response to shifts in underlying economic conditions\nthat are often evident only in hindsight. For these reasons, the range of reasonably likely\noutcomes for the federal funds rate is quite wide--a point illustrated by figure 1 in your\nhandout. The line in the center is the median path for the federal funds rate based on the\nFOMC’s Summary of Economic Projections in June.1 The shaded region, which is based\non the historical accuracy of private and government forecasters, shows a 70 percent\nprobability that the federal funds rate will be between 0 and 3-1/4 percent at the end of\nnext year and between 0 and 4-1/2 percent at the end of 2018. 2 The reason for the wide\nrange is that the economy is frequently buffeted by shocks and thus rarely evolves as\npredicted. When shocks occur and the economic outlook changes, monetary policy needs\n\n1\n\nThe June 2016 Summary of Economic Projections (SEP) is an addendum to the minutes of the June 2016\nFOMC meeting and is available on the Board’s website at\nwww.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/fomcminutes20160615.pdf.\n2\nThe confidence interval equals (subject to a lower bound of 12.5 basis points) the median SEP path for the\nfederal funds rate plus or minus average root mean squared prediction errors (RMSPEs) of the three-month\nTreasury bill rate, for horizons from zero to nine quarters ahead, based on forecast errors made over the\npast 20 years. Average RMSPEs are calculated as the mean of the RMSPEs of the following forecasters,\nsubject to availability for the horizon in question: the Federal Reserve Board staff (Greenbook/Tealbook),\nthe Administration, the Congressional Budget Office, the Blue Chip consensus forecast, and the Survey of\nProfessional Forecasters. Differences in predictive accuracy among these forecasters are not statistically\nsignificant. For more information on the general methodology used to construct confidence intervals using\nhistorical forecasting errors, see David Reifschneider and Peter Tulip (2007), “Gauging the Uncertainty of\nthe Economic Outlook from Historical Forecasting Errors,” Finance and Economics Discussion Series\n2007-60 (Washington: Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, November),\nwww.federalreserve.gov/pubs/feds/2007/200760/200760pap.pdf.\n\n\f-4to adjust. What we do know, however, is that we want a policy toolkit that will allow us\nto respond to a wide range of possible conditions.\nThe Pre-Crisis Toolkit\nPrior to the financial crisis, the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy toolkit was\nsimple but effective in the circumstances that then prevailed. Our main tool consisted of\nopen market operations to manage the amount of reserve balances available to the\nbanking sector.3 These operations, in turn, influenced the interest rate in the federal\nfunds market, where banks experiencing reserve shortfalls could borrow from banks with\nexcess reserves. Before the onset of the crisis, the volume of reserves was generally\nsmall--only about $45 billion or so.4 Thus, even small open market operations could\nhave a significant effect on the federal funds rate. Changes in the federal funds rate\nwould then be transmitted to other short-term interest rates, affecting longer-term interest\nrates and overall financial conditions and hence inflation and economic activity. This\nsimple, light-touch system allowed the Federal Reserve to operate with a relatively small\nbalance sheet--less than $1 trillion before the crisis--the size of which was largely\ndetermined by the need to supply enough U.S. currency to meet demand.5\nThe global financial crisis revealed two main shortcomings of this simple toolkit.\nThe first was an inability to control the federal funds rate once reserves were no longer\n\n3\n\nOpen market operations at the time were primarily repurchase agreements based on Treasury securities,\nwith primary dealers as counterparties.\n4\nReserves of depository institutions include vault cash and balances maintained with Federal Reserve\nBanks. Excess reserves are the reserves held over and above required reserves. See the Board’s webpage\n“Reserve Requirements” at www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/reservereq.htm.\n5\nPrior to the financial crisis, the size of the Fed’s balance sheet was about $900 billion. Assets consisted\nalmost entirely of Treasury securities. Liabilities included currency held by the public and a relatively\nsmall volume of reserve balances.

Starting in late 2007, faced with acute financial market distress, the\nFederal Reserve created programs to keep credit flowing to households and businesses.6\nThe loans extended under those programs helped stabilize the financial system. But the\nadditional reserves created by these programs, if left unchecked, would have pushed\ndown the federal funds rate, driving it well below the FOMC’s target. To prevent such an\noutcome, the Federal Reserve took several steps to offset (or sterilize) the effect of its\nliquidity and credit operations on reserves.7 By the fall of 2008, however, the reserve\neffects of our liquidity and credit programs threatened to become too large to sterilize via\nasset sales and other existing tools. Without sufficient sterilization capacity, the quantity\nof reserves increased to a point that the Federal Reserve had difficulty maintaining\neffective control over the federal funds rate.\nOf course, by the end of 2008, stabilizing the federal funds rate at a level\nmaterially above zero was not an immediate concern because the economy clearly needed\nvery low short-term interest rates. Faced with a steep rise in unemployment and\ndeclining inflation, the FOMC lowered its target for the federal funds rate to near zero, a\nreduction of roughly 5 percentage points over the previous year and a half. Nonetheless,\na variety of policy benchmarks would, at least in hindsight, have called for pushing the\n\nFor information on the Federal Reserve’s credit and liquidity programs that were implemented in response\nto the financial crisis, see www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/bst_crisisresponse.htm on the Board’s\nwebsite.\n7\nReserves were initially taken out of the banking system by not reinvesting principal payments from\nmaturing securities and later by selling portions of securities holdings. In September 2008, the Department\nof the Treasury announced the temporary Supplementary Financing Program, in which the proceeds of a\nseries of Treasury bill auctions, separate from Treasury’s routine borrowing, were maintained in an account\nat the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. The funds in this account served to drain reserves from the\nbanking system.\n6\n\n\f-6federal funds rate well below zero during the economic downturn.8 That doing so was\nimpossible highlights the second serious limitation of our pre-crisis policy toolkit: its\ninability to generate substantially more accommodation than could be provided by a nearzero federal funds rate.\nOur Expanded Toolkit\nTo address the challenges posed by the financial crisis and the subsequent severe\nrecession and slow recovery, the Federal Reserve significantly expanded its monetary\npolicy toolkit. In 2006, the Congress had approved plans to allow the Fed, beginning in\n2011, to pay interest on banks’ reserve balances.9 In the fall of 2008, the Congress\nmoved up the effective date of this authority to October 2008. That authority was\nessential. Paying interest on reserve balances enables the Fed to break the strong link\nbetween the quantity of reserves and the level of the federal funds rate and, in turn,\nallows the Federal Reserve to control short-term interest rates when reserves are plentiful.\nIn particular, once economic conditions warrant a higher level for market interest rates,\nthe Federal Reserve could raise the interest rate paid on excess reserves--the IOER rate.\nConsider the following policy rule: R(t) = R* + π(t) + 0.5[π(t)-π*]-2.0[U(t)-U*], where R is the federal\nfunds rate, R* is the longer-run normal value of the federal funds rate adjusted for inflation, π is the fourquarter moving average of core PCE inflation, π* is the FOMC’s target for inflation (2 percent), U is the\nunemployment rate, and U* is the longer-run normal rate of unemployment. Based on the medians of\nFOMC participants’ latest longer-run projections, R* is approximately 1 percent and U* is about\n4.8 percent. Accordingly, with the unemployment rate climbing to 10 percent and core PCE inflation\nfalling to 1 percent in 2009, this rule would have prescribed lowering the federal funds rate to minus\n9 percent at the depths of the recession. In contrast, the standard Taylor rule, which is half as responsive to\nmovements in resource utilization, would have prescribed lowering the federal funds rate to minus\n3-3/4 percent using the same estimates for R* and U*. The more aggressive rule does a reasonably good\njob of accounting for movements in the federal funds rate in the decade prior to its falling to its effective\nlower bound in late 2008, see David Reifschneider (2016), “Gauging the Ability of the FOMC to Respond\nto Future Recessions,” Finance and Economics Discussion Series 2016-068 (Washington: Board of\nGovernors of the Federal Reserve System, August),\nwww.federalreserve.gov/econresdata/feds/2016/files/2016068pap.pdf. For more information on the\nstandard Taylor rule, see John B. Taylor (1993), “Discretion versus Policy Rules in Practice,” CarnegieRochester Conference Series on Public Policy, vol. 39 (December), pp. 195-214.\n9\nPaying interest on reserves is a tool commonly used by central banks, including the Bank of England, the\nBank of Japan, and the European Central Bank.\n8\n\n\f-7A higher IOER rate encourages banks to raise the interest rates they charge, putting\nupward pressure on market interest rates regardless of the level of reserves in the banking\nsector.\nWhile adjusting the IOER rate is an effective way to move market interest rates\nwhen reserves are plentiful, federal funds have generally traded below this rate. This\nrelative softness of the federal funds rate reflects, in part, the fact that only depository\ninstitutions can earn the IOER rate. To put a more effective floor under short-term\ninterest rates, the Federal Reserve created supplementary tools to be used as needed. For\ninstance, the overnight reverse repurchase agreement (ON RRP) facility is available to a\nvariety of counterparties, including eligible money market funds, government-sponsored\nenterprises, broker-dealers, and depository institutions. Through it, eligible\ncounterparties may invest funds overnight with the Federal Reserve at a rate determined\nby the FOMC. Similar to the payment of IOER, the ON RRP facility discourages\nparticipating institutions from lending at a rate substantially below that offered by the\nFed.10\nOur current toolkit proved effective last December. In an environment of\nsuperabundant reserves, the FOMC raised the effective federal funds rate--that is, the\nweighted average rate on federal funds transactions among participants in that market--by\nthe desired amount, and we have since maintained the federal funds rate in its target\nrange.\n\n10\n\nOther tools that could help strengthen the floor under short-term interest rates but are not currently in use\ninclude the Term Deposit Facility and term reverse repurchase agreements.\n\n\f-8Two other major additions to the Fed’s toolkit were large-scale asset purchases\nand increasingly explicit forward guidance.11 Both were used to provide additional\nmonetary policy accommodation after short-term interest rates fell close to zero. Our\npurchases of Treasury and mortgage-related securities in the open market pushed down\nlonger-term borrowing rates for millions of American families and businesses. Extended\nforward rate guidance--announcing that we intended to keep short-term interest rates\nlower for longer than might have otherwise been expected--also put significant\ndownward pressure on longer-term borrowing rates, as did guidance regarding the size\nand scope of our asset purchases.\nIn light of the slowness of the economic recovery, some have questioned the\neffectiveness of asset purchases and extended forward rate guidance. But this criticism\nfails to consider the unusual headwinds the economy faced after the crisis. Those\nheadwinds included substantial household and business deleveraging, unfavorable\ndemand shocks from abroad, a period of contractionary fiscal policy, and unusually tight\ncredit, especially for housing. Studies have found that our asset purchases and extended\nforward rate guidance put appreciable downward pressure on long-term interest rates and,\nas a result, helped spur growth in demand for goods and services, lower the\nunemployment rate, and prevent inflation from falling further below our 2 percent\nobjective.12\n\n11\n\nPrior to the crisis, the Fed occasionally used forward guidance pertaining to the likely future path of\ninterest rates, but that guidance was usually confined to a relatively short time frame.\n12\nSee, for instance, Joseph Gagnon, Matthew Raskin, Julie Remache, and Brian Sack (2011), “The\nFinancial Market Effects of the Federal Reserve’s Large-Scale Asset Purchases,” International Journal of\nCentral Banking, vol. 7 (March), pp. 3-43, www.ijcb.org/journal/ijcb11q1a1.htm; and Stefania D’Amico,\nWilliam English, David López-Salido, and Edward Nelson (2012), “The Federal Reserve’s Large-Scale\nAsset Purchase Programmes: Rationale and Effects,” Economic Journal, vol. 122 (November), pp. F41546. Moreover, the Federal Reserve’s forward guidance and asset purchase policies have been estimated to\n\n\f-9Two of the Fed’s most important new tools--our authority to pay interest on\nexcess reserves and our asset purchases--interacted importantly. Without IOER\nauthority, the Federal Reserve would have been reluctant to buy as many assets as it did\nbecause of the longer-run implications for controlling the stance of monetary policy.\nWhile we were buying assets aggressively to help bring the U.S. economy out of a severe\nrecession, we also had to keep in mind whether and how we would be able to remove\nmonetary policy accommodation when appropriate. That issue was particularly relevant\nbecause we fund our asset purchases through the creation of reserves, and those\nadditional reserves would have made it ever more difficult for the pre-crisis toolkit to\nraise short-term interest rates when needed.\nThe FOMC considered removing accommodation by first reducing our asset\nholdings (including through asset sales) and raising the federal funds rate only after our\nbalance sheet had contracted substantially. But we decided against this approach because\nour ability to predict the effects of changes in the balance sheet on the economy is less\nthan that associated with changes in the federal funds rate. Excessive inflationary\npressures could arise if assets were sold too slowly. Conversely, financial markets and\nthe economy could potentially be destabilized if assets were sold too aggressively.\nIndeed, the so-called taper tantrum of 2013 illustrates the difficulty of predicting financial\nmarket reactions to announcements about the balance sheet. Given the uncertainty and\npotential costs associated with large-scale asset sales, the FOMC instead decided to begin\n\nhave helped lower unemployment and boost inflation; see Eric M. Engen, Thomas Laubach, and David\nReifschneider (2015), “The Macroeconomic Effects of the Federal Reserve’s Unconventional Monetary\nPolicies,” Finance and Economics Discussion Series 2015-005 (Washington: Board of Governors of the\nFederal Reserve System, January), http://dx.doi.org/10.17016/FEDS.2015.005.\n\n\f- 10 removing monetary policy accommodation primarily by adjusting short-term interest\nrates rather than by actively managing its asset holdings.13 That strategy--raising shortterm interest rates once the recovery was sufficiently advanced while maintaining a\nrelatively large balance sheet and plentiful bank reserves--depended on our ability to pay\ninterest on excess reserves.\nWhere Do We Go from Here?\nWhat does the future hold for the Fed’s toolkit? For starters, our ability to use\ninterest on reserves is likely to play a key role for years to come. In part, this reflects the\noutlook for our balance sheet over the next few years. As the FOMC has noted in its\nrecent statements, at some point after the process of raising the federal funds rate is well\nunder way, we will cease or phase out reinvesting repayments of principal from our\nsecurities holdings. Once we stop reinvestment, it should take several years for our asset\nholdings--and the bank reserves used to finance them--to passively decline to a more\nnormal level. But even after the volume of reserves falls substantially, IOER will still be\nimportant as a contingency tool, because we may need to purchase assets during future\nrecessions to supplement conventional interest rate reductions.14 Forecasts now show the\n\nThe FOMC’s “Policy Normalization Principles and Plans” call for reducing the Federal Reserve’s\nsecurities holdings in a “gradual and predictable manner primarily by ceasing to reinvest repayments of\nprincipal on securities held in the [System Open Market Account]” (Board of Governors of the Federal\nReserve System (2014), “Federal Reserve Issues FOMC Statement on Policy Normalization Principles and\nPlans,” press release, September 17, second bullet,\nwww.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/monetary/20140917c.htm). Consistent with those plans, the\nFederal Open Market Committee anticipates that it will maintain its current reinvestment strategy “until\nnormalization of the level of the federal funds rate is well under way” (for instance, see Board of Governors\nof the Federal Reserve System (2015), “Federal Reserve Issues FOMC Statement,” press release,\nDecember 16, paragraph 5, www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/monetary/20151216a.htm.\n14\nIf the FOMC were to again increase the size of the balance sheet markedly in response to a future\nrecession, then the ability to pay interest on reserves could be critical during the subsequent recovery period\nto help control short-term interest rates while the balance sheet remains elevated. Beyond this motivation\nfor retaining IOER, the ability to pay interest on reserves could also be important to the operation of any\nspecial liquidity and credit facilities that might be created to deal with systemic disruptions to the financial\n13\n\n\f- 11 federal funds rate settling at about 3 percent in the longer run.15 In contrast, the federal\nfunds rate averaged more than 7 percent between 1965 and 2000. Thus, we expect to\nhave less scope for interest rate cuts than we have had historically.\nIn part, current expectations for a low future federal funds rate reflect the\nFOMC’s success in stabilizing inflation at around 2 percent--a rate much lower than rates\nthat prevailed during the 1970s and 1980s. Another key factor is the marked decline over\nthe past decade, both here and abroad, in the long-run neutral real rate of interest--that is,\nthe inflation-adjusted short-term interest rate consistent with keeping output at its\npotential on average over time.16 Several developments could have contributed to this\napparent decline, including slower growth in the working-age populations of many\ncountries, smaller productivity gains in the advanced economies, a decreased propensity\nto spend in the wake of the financial crises around the world since the late 1990s, and\n\nsystem during a future emergency. In particular, such facilities could significantly expand the supply of\nreserves, which would be problematic if the FOMC wished to keep short-term interest rates from falling to\nzero.\n15\nIn the Blue Chip Financial Indicators survey released on June 1, 2016, the consensus forecast for the\nlonger-run level of the federal funds rate was 3.2 percent. FOMC participants in June 2016 generally\nanticipated a slightly lower longer-run level, in that the median of their individual forecasts was 3 percent\n(see table 1 of the June 2016 SEP, available at\nwww.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomcminutes20160615ep.htm). The latest long-run forecast from\nthe Administration (www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/budget/fy2016/assets/16msr.pdf) is also\nclose to 3 percent, as was the projection made by the Congressional Budget Office earlier in the year (see\nwww.cbo.gov/about/products/budget_economic_data).\n16\nUpdated estimates from the model developed by Laubach and Williams (2003) indicate that the real\nlong-run neutral or “equilibrium” short-term interest rate in the United States is currently about\n2-1/2 percentage points lower than it was on average in the 1980s and 1990s (see Thomas Laubach and\nJohn C. Williams (2003), “Measuring the Natural Rate of Interest,” Review of Economics and Statistics,\nvol. 85 (November), pp. 1063-70; updated estimates are available at www.frbsf.org/economicresearch/economists/john-williams/Laubach_Williams_updated_estimates.xlsx.) In addition, Holston,\nLaubach, and Williams (2016) find significant but somewhat smaller declines in equilibrium rates for the\neuro area, Canada, and the United Kingdom (see Kathryn Holston, Thomas Laubach, and John C. Williams\n(2016), “Measuring the Natural Rate of Interest: International Trends and Determinants,” Working Paper\n2016-11 (San Francisco: Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, June), www.frbsf.org/economicresearch/files/wp2016-11.pdf).\n\n\f- 12 perhaps a paucity of attractive capital projects worldwide.17 Although these factors may\nhelp explain why bond yields have fallen to such low levels here and abroad, our\nunderstanding of the forces driving long-run trends in interest rates is nevertheless\nlimited, and thus all predictions in this area are highly uncertain.18\nWould an average federal funds rate of about 3 percent impair the Fed’s ability to\nfight recessions? Based on the FOMC’s behavior in past recessions, one might think that\nsuch a low interest rate could substantially impair policy effectiveness. As shown in the\nfirst column of the table in the handout, during the past nine recessions, the FOMC cut\nthe federal funds rate by amounts ranging from about 3 percentage points to more than\n10 percentage points. On average, the FOMC reduced rates by about 5-1/2 percentage\npoints, which seems to suggest that the FOMC would face a shortfall of about\n2-1/2 percentage points for dealing with an average-sized recession. But this simple\ncomparison exaggerates the limitations on policy created by the zero lower bound. As\nshown in the second column, the federal funds rate at the start of the past seven\nrecessions was appreciably above the level consistent with the economy operating at\npotential in the longer run. In most cases, this tighter-than-normal stance of policy before\n\n17\n\nFor a discussion of the possible role played by these factors in explaining the current low level of interest\nrates in the United States and other advanced economies, see Lawrence H. Summers (2014), “U.S.\nEconomic Prospects: Secular Stagnation, Hysteresis, and the Zero Lower Bound,” Business Economics,\nvol. 49 (April), pp. 65-73; Robert J.

As a result, a large portion of the rate\ncuts that subsequently occurred during these recessions represented the undoing of the\nearlier tight stance of monetary policy. Of course, this situation could occur again in the\nfuture. But if it did, the federal funds rate at the onset of the recession would be well\nabove its normal level, and the FOMC would be able to cut short-term interest rates by\nsubstantially more than 3 percentage points.\nA recent paper takes a different approach to assessing the FOMC’s ability to\nrespond to future recessions by using simulations of the FRB/US model.19 This analysis\nbegins by asking how the economy would respond to a set of highly adverse shocks if\npolicymakers followed a fairly aggressive policy rule, hypothetically assuming that they\ncan cut the federal funds rate without limit.20 It then imposes the zero lower bound and\nasks whether some combination of forward guidance and asset purchases would be\nsufficient to generate economic conditions at least as good as those that occur under the\n\nFRB/US model simulations have several advantages for analyzing this issue. For one, the model’s\nstructure allows the public’s expectations for interest rates, inflation, and other factors to take full account\nof the implications of the effective lower bound on nominal interest rates, changes in future monetary\npolicy as signaled by forward guidance, and asset purchases. In addition, the model incorporates the low\nresponsiveness of inflation to movements in resource utilization seen in recent years as well as the effects\nof asset purchases on term premiums, and thus a variety of longer-term interest rates, equity prices, and the\nforeign exchange value of the dollar. For a further discussion about the advantages (and possible\ndisadvantages) of using the FRB/US model to study this issue, see Reifschneider, “Gauging the Ability of\nthe FOMC to Respond to Future Recessions,“ in note 8.\n20\nThe aggressive rule is R(t) = 1.0 + π(t) + 0.5 [π(t)-2] - 2.0 [U(t) - 4.8], where R is the federal funds rate,\nπ is the four-quarter moving average of core PCE inflation, and U is the unemployment rate [Note: On\nAugust 30, 2016, a typo in the equation for the aggressive rule was corrected to change “[4.8 - U(t)]” to\n“[U(t) - 4.8]”]. Note that baseline values of the equilibrium real rate, the natural rate of unemployment, and\nthe target rate of inflation used in the simulation analysis--1.0 percent, 4.8 percent, and 2.0 percent,\nrespectively--are consistent with the medians of the latest long-run projections of individual FOMC\nparticipants. As discussed by Taylor (1999), this rule appears to do a good job in stabilizing real activity\nand inflation in a wide range of economic models (see John B. Taylor (1999), “Introduction,” in John B.\nTaylor, ed., Monetary Policy Rules (Chicago: University of Chicago Press), pp. 1-14).\n19\n\n\f- 14 hypothetical unconstrained policy. In general, the study concludes that, even if the\naverage level of the federal funds rate in the future is only 3 percent, these new tools\nshould be sufficient unless the recession were to be unusually severe and persistent.\nFigure 2 in your handout illustrates this point. It shows simulated paths for\ninterest rates, the unemployment rate, and inflation under three different monetary policy\nresponses--the aggressive rule in the absence of the zero lower bound constraint, the\nconstrained aggressive rule, and the constrained aggressive rule combined with $2 trillion\nin asset purchases and guidance that the federal funds rate will depart from the rule by\nstaying lower for longer.21 As the red dashed line shows, the federal funds rate would fall\nfar below zero if policy were unconstrained, thereby causing long-term interest rates to\nfall sharply.i But despite the lower bound, asset purchases and forward guidance can\npush long-term interest rates even lower on average than in the unconstrained case\n(especially when adjusted for inflation) by reducing term premiums and increasing the\ndownward pressure on the expected average value of future short-term interest rates.\nThus, the use of such tools could result in even better outcomes for unemployment and\ninflation on average.\nOf course, this analysis could be too optimistic. For one, the FRB/US simulations\nmay overstate the effectiveness of forward guidance and asset purchases, particularly in\nan environment where long-term interest rates are also likely to be unusually low.22 In\n\n21\n\nThe forward guidance is provided at the start of the recession and has three components. First, the\nfederal funds rate will be lowered to zero more quickly than prescribed by the rule. Second, the federal\nfunds rate will remain at zero as long as the unemployment rate is greater than 5 percent. And, finally, that\nafter the initial increase in the federal funds rate, policymakers will proceed gradually in returning to the\nprescriptions of the policy rule.\n22\nAs shown in figure 2, the 10-year Treasury yield in the simulation starts out at just over 4 percent, well\nbelow its level pre-crisis, suggesting that there may be less room to push down long-term interest rates in\nthe future than in the past. Another potential source of overstatement could be the FRB/US assumption that\n\n\f- 15 addition, policymakers could have less ability to cut short-term interest rates in the future\nthan the simulations assume. By some calculations, the real neutral rate is currently close\nto zero, and it could remain at this low level if we were to continue to see slow\nproductivity growth and high global saving.23 If so, then the average level of the nominal\nfederal funds rate down the road might turn out to be only 2 percent, implying that asset\npurchases and forward guidance might have to be pushed to extremes to compensate.24\nMoreover, relying too heavily on these nontraditional tools could have unintended\nconsequences. For example, if future policymakers responded to a severe recession by\nannouncing their intention to keep the federal funds rate near zero for a very long time\nafter the economy had substantially recovered and followed through on that guidance,\nthen they might inadvertently encourage excessive risk-taking and so undermine financial\nstability.\nFinally, the simulation analysis certainly overstates the FOMC’s current ability to\nrespond to a recession, given that there is little scope to cut the federal funds rate at the\n\nchanges in long-term interest rates, whether driven by shifts in term premiums or shifts in the expected path\nof short-term interest rates, have the same influence on real activity, as there is some empirical evidence\nthat the estimated sensitivity of spending to movements in term premiums alone may be relatively small;\nsee Michael T. Kiley (2014), “The Aggregate Demand Effects of Short- and Long-Term Interest Rates,”\nInternational Journal of Central Banking, vol. 10 (December), pp. 69-104,\nwww.ijcb.org/journal/ijcb14q4a3.pdf. On the other hand, the effectiveness of forward guidance in the\nFRB/US model is materially less than it is in some other models, implying that the FRB/US simulation\nresults could potentially understate the stimulus provided by the announcement of a lower-for-longer\npolicy. See Hess Chung (2015), “The Effects of Forward Guidance in Three Macro Models,” FEDS Notes\n(Washington: Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, February 26),\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/econresdata/notes/feds-notes/2015/effects-of-forward-guidance-in-threemacro-models-20150226.html.\n23\nIn principle, the federal funds rate in the longer run could also turn out to be lower than currently\npredicted if inflation were to remain persistently below 2 percent. However, because a higher rate of\ninflation can arguably be achieved over time through a sufficiently tight labor market, this risk seems low\nto me as long as the Federal Reserve is committed to achieving its inflation objective.\n24\nIn the simulations reported by Reifschneider, “Gauging the Ability of the FOMC to Respond to Future\nRecessions,” in note 8, overcoming the effects of the zero lower bound during a severe recession would\nrequire about $4 trillion in asset purchases and pledging to stay low for even longer if the average future\nlevel of the federal funds rate is only 2 percent.\n\n\f- 16 moment. But that does not mean that the Federal Reserve would be unable to provide\nappreciable accommodation should the ongoing expansion falter in the near term. In\naddition to taking the federal funds rate back down to nearly zero, the FOMC could\nresume asset purchases and announce its intention to keep the federal funds rate at this\nlevel until conditions had improved markedly--although with long-term interest rates\nalready quite low, the net stimulus that would result might be somewhat reduced.\nDespite these caveats, I expect that forward guidance and asset purchases will\nremain important components of the Fed’s policy toolkit. In addition, it is critical that the\nFederal Reserve and other supervisory agencies continue to do all they can to ensure a\nstrong and resilient financial system. That said, these tools are not a panacea, and future\npolicymakers could find that they are not adequate to deal with deep and prolonged\neconomic downturns. For these reasons, policymakers and society more broadly may\nwant to explore additional options for helping to foster a strong economy.\nOn the monetary policy side, future policymakers might choose to consider some\nadditional tools that have been employed by other central banks, though adding them to\nour toolkit would require a very careful weighing of costs and benefits and, in some\ncases, could require legislation. For example, future policymakers may wish to explore\nthe possibility of purchasing a broader range of assets. Beyond that, some observers have\nsuggested raising the FOMC’s 2 percent inflation objective or implementing policy\nthrough alternative monetary policy frameworks, such as price-level or nominal GDP\ntargeting. I should stress, however, that the FOMC is not actively considering these\nadditional tools and policy frameworks, although they are important subjects for research.\n\n\f- 17 Beyond monetary policy, fiscal policy has traditionally played an important role\nin dealing with severe economic downturns. A wide range of possible fiscal policy tools\nand approaches could enhance the cyclical stability of the economy.25 For example, steps\ncould be taken to increase the effectiveness of the automatic stabilizers, and some\neconomists have proposed that greater fiscal support could be usefully provided to state\nand local governments during recessions. As always, it would be important to ensure that\nany fiscal policy changes did not compromise long-run fiscal sustainability.\nFinally, and most ambitiously, as a society we should explore ways to raise\nproductivity growth. Stronger productivity growth would tend to raise the average level\nof interest rates and therefore would provide the Federal Reserve with greater scope to\nease monetary policy in the event of a recession. But more importantly, stronger\nproductivity growth would enhance Americans’ living standards. Though outside the\nnarrow field of monetary policy, many possibilities in this arena are worth considering,\nincluding improving our educational system and investing more in worker training;\npromoting capital investment and research spending, both private and public; and looking\nfor ways to reduce regulatory burdens while protecting important economic, financial,\nand social goals.\nConclusion\n\n25\n\nFor further discussion of ways to enhance the effectiveness of fiscal policy in stabilizing the economy,\nsee Xavier Debrun and Radhicka Kapoor (2010), “Fiscal Policy and Macroeconomic Stability: Automatic\nStabilizers Work, Always and Everywhere,” IMF Working Paper WP/10/111 (Washington: International\nMonetary Fund, May), https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/wp/2010/wp10111.pdf; Antonio Fatás and\nIlian Mihov (2012), “Fiscal Policy as a Stabilization Tool,” B.E.

New\npolicy tools, which helped the Federal Reserve respond to the financial crisis and Great\nRecession, are likely to remain useful in dealing with future downturns. Additional tools\nmay be needed and will be the subject of research and debate. But even if average\ninterest rates remain lower than in the past, I believe that monetary policy will, under\nmost conditions, be able to respond effectively.\nNote: On August 29, 2016, a typo was corrected to change the line color cited from “blue” to “red” in the\nfollowing sentence: “As the red dashed line shows, the federal funds rate would fall far below zero if\npolicy were unconstrained, thereby causing long-term interest rates to fall sharply.”\ni\n\n\fFigure 1\nMedian of Individual FOMC Participants' June 2016 Federal Funds Rate Projections\n(shaded area shows 70% confidence interval)\n5\n\n5\n\n4\n\n4\n\n3\n\n3\n\n2\n\n2\n\n1\n\n1\n\n0\n\n0\nQ1\n\nQ2\n\nQ3\n\n2015\n\nQ4\n\nQ1\n\nQ2\n\nQ3\n\n2016\n\nQ4\n\nQ1\n\nQ2\n\nQ3\n\n2017\n\nQ4\n\nQ1\n\nQ2\n\nQ3\n\nQ4\n\n2018\n\nNote: Confidence interval equals the median of the end-of-year funds rate paths projected by individual FOMC\nparticipants (interpolated quarterly), plus or minus the average root mean squared prediction error for 0 to 9\nquarters ahead made by private and government forecasters over the past 20 years, subject to an effective\nlow er bound of 12.5 basis points.\nSource: June 2016 Summary of Economic Projections and Federal Reserve Board staff.\n\n\fConventional Monetary Easing during Past Recessions and Accompanying Economic Conditions\nPeak Rate of 12Month Core PCE\nInflation during the\nRecession\n(percent)\n\nTotal Amount of\nConventional\nMonetary Easing\n(percent)1\n\nEstimated Stance of\nMonetary Policy at\nthe Start of Easing\n(percent)2\n\nAugust 1957 to April 1958\n\n2.9\n\n—\n\n3.24\n\n-1.3\n\nApril 1960 to February 1961\n\n2.8\n\n—\n\n2.1\n\n-.3\n\nDecember 1969 to November 1970\n\n5.5\n\n0.5\n\n4.8\n\n-2.4\n\nNovember 1973 to March 1975\n\n7.7\n\n3.0\n\n10.2\n\n-1.4\n\nJanuary 1980 to July 1980\n\n4.8\n\n3.2\n\n9.1\n\n-.2\n\n10.4\n\n7.1\n\n8.8\n\n1.0\n\nJuly 1990 to March 1991\n\n5.3\n\n1.7\n\n4.3\n\n-.4\n\nMarch 2001 to November 2001\n\n4.8\n\n1.9\n\n2.0\n\n-.8\n\nDecember 2007 to June 2009\n\n5.1\n\n1.9\n\n2.3\n\n.1\n\nNational Bureau of Economic Research\nRecession Dates\n\nJuly 1981 to November 1982\n\nLabor Utilization at\nthe Start of the\nRecession3\n(percent)\n\nNote: 1.

            "content": "For release at\n10:00 a.m. EDT\nJune 21, 2016\n\nStatement by\nJanet L. Yellen\nChair\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nbefore the\nCommittee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs\nU.S. Senate\nJune 21, 2016\n\n\fChairman Shelby, Ranking Member Brown, and other members of the Committee, I am\npleased to present the Federal Reserve’s semiannual Monetary Policy Report to the Congress. In\nmy remarks today, I will briefly discuss the current economic situation and outlook before\nturning to monetary policy.\nCurrent Economic Situation and Outlook\nSince my last appearance before this Committee in February, the economy has made\nfurther progress toward the Federal Reserve’s objective of maximum employment. And while\ninflation has continued to run below our 2 percent objective, the Federal Open Market\nCommittee (FOMC) expects inflation to rise to that level over the medium term. However, the\npace of improvement in the labor market appears to have slowed more recently, suggesting that\nour cautious approach to adjusting monetary policy remains appropriate.\nIn the labor market, the cumulative increase in jobs since its trough in early 2010 has now\ntopped 14 million, while the unemployment rate has fallen more than 5 percentage points from\nits peak. In addition, as we detail in the Monetary Policy Report, jobless rates have declined for\nall major demographic groups, including for African Americans and Hispanics. Despite these\ndeclines, however, it is troubling that unemployment rates for these minority groups remain\nhigher than for the nation overall, and that the annual income of the median African American\nhousehold is still well below the median income of other U.S. households.\nDuring the first quarter of this year, job gains averaged 200,000 per month, just a bit\nslower than last year’s pace. And while the unemployment rate held steady at 5 percent over this\nperiod, the labor force participation rate moved up noticeably. In April and May, however, the\naverage pace of job gains slowed to only 80,000 per month or about 100,000 per month after\nadjustment for the effects of a strike. The unemployment rate fell to 4.7 percent in May, but that\n\n\f-2decline mainly occurred because fewer people reported that they were actively seeking work. A\nbroader measure of labor market slack that includes workers marginally attached to the\nworkforce and those working part-time who would prefer full-time work was unchanged in May\nand remains above its level prior to the recession. Of course, it is important not to overreact to\none or two reports, and several other timely indicators of labor market conditions still look\nfavorable. One notable development is that there are some tentative signs that wage growth may\nfinally be picking up. That said, we will be watching the job market carefully to see whether the\nrecent slowing in employment growth is transitory, as we believe it is.\nEconomic growth has been uneven over recent quarters. U.S. inflation-adjusted gross\ndomestic product (GDP) is currently estimated to have increased at an annual rate of only 3/4\npercent in the first quarter of this year. Subdued foreign growth and the appreciation of the\ndollar weighed on exports, while the energy sector was hard hit by the steep drop in oil prices\nsince mid-2014; in addition, business investment outside of the energy sector was surprisingly\nweak. However, the available indicators point to a noticeable step-up in GDP growth in the\nsecond quarter. In particular, consumer spending has picked up smartly in recent months,\nsupported by solid growth in real disposable income and the ongoing effects of the increases in\nhousehold wealth. And housing has continued to recover gradually, aided by income gains and\nthe very low level of mortgage rates.\nThe recent pickup in household spending, together with underlying conditions that are\nfavorable for growth, lead me to be optimistic that we will see further improvements in the labor\nmarket and the economy more broadly over the next few years. Monetary policy remains\naccommodative; low oil prices and ongoing job gains should continue to support the growth of\nincomes and therefore consumer spending; fiscal policy is now a small positive for growth; and\n\n\f-3global economic growth should pick up over time, supported by accommodative monetary\npolicies abroad. As a result, the FOMC expects that with gradual increases in the federal funds\nrate, economic activity will continue to expand at a moderate pace and labor market indicators\nwill strengthen further.\nTurning to inflation, overall consumer prices, as measured by the price index for personal\nconsumption expenditures, increased just 1 percent over the 12 months ending in April, up\nnoticeably from its pace through much of last year but still well short of the Committee’s\n2 percent objective. Much of this shortfall continues to reflect earlier declines in energy prices\nand lower prices for imports. Core inflation, which excludes energy and food prices, has been\nrunning close to 1-1/2 percent. As the transitory influences holding down inflation fade and the\nlabor market strengthens further, the Committee expects inflation to rise to 2 percent over the\nmedium term. Nonetheless, in considering future policy decisions, we will continue to carefully\nmonitor actual and expected progress toward our inflation goal.\nOf course, considerable uncertainty about the economic outlook remains. The latest\nreadings on the labor market and the weak pace of investment illustrate one downside risk--that\ndomestic demand might falter. In addition, although I am optimistic about the longer-run\nprospects for the U.S. economy, we cannot rule out the possibility expressed by some prominent\neconomists that the slow productivity growth seen in recent years will continue into the future.\nVulnerabilities in the global economy also remain. Although concerns about slowing growth in\nChina and falling commodity prices appear to have eased from earlier this year, China continues\nto face considerable challenges as it rebalances its economy toward domestic demand and\nconsumption and away from export-led growth. More generally, in the current environment of\nsluggish growth, low inflation, and already very accommodative monetary policy in many\n\n\f-4advanced economies, investor perceptions of and appetite for risk can change abruptly. One\ndevelopment that could shift investor sentiment is the upcoming referendum in the United\nKingdom. A U.K. vote to exit the European Union could have significant economic\nrepercussions. For all of these reasons, the Committee is closely monitoring global economic\nand financial developments and their implications for domestic economic activity, labor markets,\nand inflation.\nMonetary Policy\nI will turn next to monetary policy. The FOMC seeks to promote maximum employment\nand price stability, as mandated by the Congress. Given the economic situation I just described,\nmonetary policy has remained accommodative over the first half of this year to support further\nimprovement in the labor market and a return of inflation to our 2 percent objective.\nSpecifically, the FOMC has maintained the target range for the federal funds rate at 1/4 to\n1/2 percent and has kept the Federal Reserve’s holdings of longer-term securities at an elevated\nlevel.\nThe Committee’s actions reflect a careful assessment of the appropriate setting for\nmonetary policy, taking into account continuing below-target inflation and the mixed readings on\nthe labor market and economic growth seen this year. Proceeding cautiously in raising the\nfederal funds rate will allow us to keep the monetary support to economic growth in place while\nwe assess whether growth is returning to a moderate pace, whether the labor market will\nstrengthen further, and whether inflation will continue to make progress toward our 2 percent\nobjective. Another factor that supports taking a cautious approach in raising the federal funds\nrate is that the federal funds rate is still near its effective lower bound. If inflation were to\nremain persistently low or the labor market were to weaken, the Committee would have only\n\n\f-5limited room to reduce the target range for the federal funds rate. However, if the economy were\nto overheat and inflation seemed likely to move significantly or persistently above 2 percent, the\nFOMC could readily increase the target range for the federal funds rate.\nThe FOMC continues to anticipate that economic conditions will improve further and that\nthe economy will evolve in a manner that will warrant only gradual increases in the federal funds\nrate. In addition, the Committee expects that the federal funds rate is likely to remain, for some\ntime, below the levels that are expected to prevail in the longer run because headwinds—which\ninclude restraint on U.S. economic activity from economic and financial developments abroad,\nsubdued household formation, and meager productivity growth—mean that the interest rate\nneeded to keep the economy operating near its potential is low by historical standards. If these\nheadwinds slowly fade over time, as the Committee expects, then gradual increases in the federal\nfunds rate are likely to be needed. In line with that view, most FOMC participants, based on\ntheir projections prepared for the June meeting, anticipate that values for the federal funds rate of\nless than 1 percent at the end of this year and less than 2 percent at the end of next year will be\nconsistent with their assessment of appropriate monetary policy.\nOf course, the economic outlook is uncertain, so monetary policy is by no means on a\npreset course and FOMC participants’ projections for the federal funds rate are not a\npredetermined plan for future policy. The actual path of the federal funds rate will depend on\neconomic and financial developments and their implications for the outlook and associated risks.\nStronger growth or a more rapid increase in inflation than the Committee currently anticipates\nwould likely make it appropriate to raise the federal funds rate more quickly. Conversely, if the\neconomy were to disappoint, a lower path of the federal funds rate would be appropriate. We are\n\n\f-6committed to our dual objectives, and we will adjust policy as appropriate to foster financial\nconditions consistent with their attainment over time.\nThe Committee is continuing its policy of reinvesting proceeds from maturing Treasury\nsecurities and principal payments from agency debt and mortgage-backed securities. As\nhighlighted in the statement released after the June FOMC meeting, we anticipate continuing this\npolicy until normalization of the level of the federal funds rate is well under way. Maintaining\nour sizable holdings of longer-term securities should help maintain accommodative financial\nconditions and should reduce the risk that we might have to lower the federal funds rate to the\neffective lower bound in the event of a future large adverse shock.\nThank you. I would be pleased to take your questions.\n\n\f"

            "content": "For release on delivery\n12:30 p.m. EDT\nJune 6, 2016\n\nCurrent Conditions and the Outlook for the U.S. Economy\n\nRemarks by\nJanet L. Yellen\nChair\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\nThe World Affairs Council of Philadelphia\nPhiladelphia, Pennsylvania\n\nJune 6, 2016\n\n\fI am delighted to be with you today. I will discuss recent economic\ndevelopments, the outlook, and their implications for monetary policy. My message will\nbe largely favorable, although recent developments have been mixed. Most importantly,\nthe economy has registered considerable progress over the past several years toward the\nFederal Reserve’s goals of maximum employment and price stability, and, as I will\nexplain, there are good reasons to expect that we will advance further toward those goals.\nThe news from the labor market over the past year has been generally good, with\nsignificant job gains, the unemployment rate declining below 5 percent, rising household\nincomes, and tentative signs of faster wage growth. At the same time, recent signs of a\nslowdown in job creation bear close watching. Inflation has been lower than our\nobjective of 2 percent, but I expect it to move up over time for reasons that I will\ndescribe. If incoming data are consistent with labor market conditions strengthening and\ninflation making progress toward our 2 percent objective, as I expect, further gradual\nincreases in the federal funds rate are likely to be appropriate and most conducive to\nmeeting and maintaining those objectives. However, I will emphasize that monetary\npolicy is not on a preset course and significant shifts in the outlook for the economy\nwould necessitate corresponding shifts in the appropriate path of policy.\nIn particular, an important theme of my remarks today will be the inevitable\nuncertainty surrounding the outlook for the economy. Unfortunately, all economic\nprojections are certain to turn out to be inaccurate in some respects, and possibly\nsignificantly so. Will the economic situation in Europe or China take a turn for the worse\nor exceed expectations? Will U.S. productivity growth pick up and allow stronger\ngrowth of gross domestic product (GDP) and incomes or instead continue to stagnate?\n\n\f-2What will happen with the price of oil? The uncertainties are sizable, and progress\ntoward our goals and, by implication, the appropriate stance of monetary policy will\ndepend on how these uncertainties evolve. Indeed, the policy path that my colleagues\nand I judge most likely to achieve and maintain maximum employment and price stability\nhas evolved and will continue to evolve in response to developments that alter our\neconomic outlook and the associated risks to that outlook.\nThe Current Economic Situation\nThe economic expansion following the Great Recession has now been under way\nfor seven years. The recovery has not always been smooth, but overall, the gains have\nbeen impressive. In particular, the job market has strengthened substantially, and I\nbelieve we are now close to eliminating the slack that has weighed on the labor market\nsince the recession.\nI will turn to this past Friday’s labor market report in a moment, but let me begin\nwith some background: The economy added 2.7 million jobs last year, an average of\nabout 230,000 a month. In the first three months of this year, payrolls were growing only\nmodestly slower, at a little less than a 200,000 monthly pace. The unemployment rate\nhad fallen to 5 percent, down from a peak of 10 percent in 2009. In addition, the Bureau\nof Labor Statistics’ measure of the job openings rate was at a record high in March, and\nthe quits rate--the share of employees voluntarily leaving their jobs--has moved up and in\nMarch stood close to its pre-recession levels. 1 The increase in the quits rate is a sign that\nworkers are feeling more confident about the job market and are likely receiving more\njob offers.\n\n1\n\nNote, however, that the help-wanted index published by the Conference Board suggests that the rate of\njob openings has been about flat over the past year.\n\n\f-3So the overall labor market situation has been quite positive. In that context, this\npast Friday’s labor market report was disappointing. Payroll gains were reported to have\nbeen much smaller in April and May than earlier in the year, averaging only about 80,000\nper month. 2 And while the unemployment rate was reported to have fallen further in\nMay, that decline occurred not because more people had jobs but because fewer people\nreported that they were actively seeking work. A broader measure of labor market slack\nthat includes workers marginally attached to the workforce and those working part-time\nwho would prefer full-time work was unchanged. An encouraging aspect of the report,\nhowever, was that average hourly earnings for all employees in the nonfarm private\nsector increased 2-1/2 percent over the past 12 months--a bit faster than in recent years\nand a welcome indication that wage growth may finally be picking up. 3\nAlthough this recent labor market report was, on balance, concerning, let me\nemphasize that one should never attach too much significance to any single monthly\nreport. Other timely indicators from the labor market have been more positive. For\nexample, the number of people filing new claims for unemployment insurance--which\ncan be a good early indicator of changes in labor market conditions--remains quite low,\nand the public’s perceptions of the health of the labor market, as reported in various\nconsumer surveys, remain positive. That said, the monthly labor market report is an\n\n2\n\nPayroll employment is now reported to have increased 123,000 in April and 38,000 in May. According to\nthe Bureau of Labor Statistics, payrolls in May were held down about 35,000 by workers on strike at\nVerizon; thus, the strike can account for a relatively small portion of the slowdown in payroll growth in\nMay. The Verizon workers are now back on the job and should be included in the June payroll counts.\n3\nHourly compensation in the business sector (a measure that includes benefit costs as well as wages) is\nnow reported to have increased about 3 percent over the year ended in the first quarter of 2016, somewhat\nabove the average increase in this series over the preceding several years. In addition, according to the\nFederal Reserve Bank of Atlanta’s “wage growth tracker,” wage gains for continuously employed full-time\nworkers have been gradually trending higher in recent years and were 3-1/2 percent over the 12 months\nthrough April. However, the employment cost index, another broad measure of labor compensation costs,\nhas remained quite soft, rising only 1-3/4 percent over the year ended in March.\n\n\f-4important economic indicator, and so we will need to watch labor market developments\ncarefully.\nEconomic conditions here in the Philadelphia metropolitan area have improved\nbroadly in line with national trends. During the downturn, the Philadelphia area and the\ncity itself saw unemployment rise by less than it did for the nation as a whole, but\nunemployment took longer to recover thereafter. 4 In the City of Philadelphia, in\nparticular, unemployment was still running above 10 percent as recently as 2013. But\nunemployment here has fallen appreciably since then, helped by a revival in residential\nand commercial construction that is evident around the city.\nWhile the general picture of the labor market is largely positive, some people are\nstill struggling. Unemployment rates rose more during the recession for African\nAmericans and Hispanics than for the nation overall, and even though those rates have\nalso come down by more during the economic expansion, unemployment remains higher\nfor these groups. Unfortunately, those gaps have not narrowed noticeably relative to\nwhere they were before the recession. Unemployment rates for young African American\nand Hispanic men without a college degree remain especially high, and one important\nbenefit from further improvement in the labor market would be increased job\nopportunities for these men and other groups that currently still experience high\nunemployment. To be sure, many of the factors that contribute to the labor market\noutcomes of minority groups are not amenable to monetary policy, and measures beyond\nthe scope of monetary policy should be considered to alleviate the economic challenges\n\n4\n\nThe discussion refers to data for the Philadelphia-Camden-Wilmington, PA-NJ-DE-MD Metropolitan\nStatistical Area. Since 1990, the area’s unemployment rate has averaged about 1/4 percentage point lower\nthan the national rate. By contrast, in the City of Philadelphia itself, the unemployment rate has generally\nrun about 2 percentage points higher than for the broader metropolitan area.\n\n\f-5that these and other Americans face. Education and training, of course, are vital. Later\ntoday, I will visit one program that helps workers in West Philadelphia learn new skills\nand then connects them with potential employers, an initiative in which government,\nbusinesses, and local institutions are working together successfully.\nWhile the economy has made great strides toward the FOMC’s objective of\nmaximum employment, somewhat less progress has been made toward our inflation\nobjective. Inflation has run persistently below the Fed’s goal of 2 percent over the past\nseveral years even as the labor market strengthened significantly. 5 Over the 12 months\nthrough April, the price index for personal consumption expenditures rose only about 1\npercent. But I remain optimistic, because two factors that have been holding down\ninflation will likely prove only temporary. First, the sharp drop in crude oil prices since\nthe middle of 2014 has lowered prices of gasoline and other energy products,\nsignificantly restraining overall inflation. At about the same time, the foreign exchange\nvalue of the dollar strengthened, holding down prices of imported goods. But oil prices\nhave stopped declining and indeed have risen from their low point earlier this year. And,\nsince the beginning of the year, the dollar has been roughly unchanged against a broad\nbasket of currencies. As the downward pressure on prices from these two forces\ndissipates and as the labor market strengthens further, I expect inflation to move back to\n2 percent.\n\n5\nThe notion that inflation can be too low sounds strange to many people, but very low inflation typically\nmeans very low nominal interest rates, leaving little room for monetary policy to push rates down to offset\nadverse shocks to the economy, thereby increasing the chances that recessions and the associated job losses\nwould be more severe and persistent. In addition, persistent and unexpectedly low inflation may\nsignificantly raise the real cost of making mortgage and other loan payments if accompanied by (as is\ntypically the case) smaller-than-anticipated nominal income gains.\n\n\f-6The Economic Outlook\nLet me now turn to the outlook for the economy. GDP growth was reported to\nhave been relatively weak early this year, but this measure of growth in economic activity\ncan vary significantly from quarter to quarter. Indeed, while spending data for the second\nquarter are limited at present, recent data on retail sales and motor vehicle sales point to a\nsignificant step-up in consumer spending and GDP growth this quarter. 6\nStepping back from near-term indicators, I would like to focus more broadly on\nthe factors likely to affect economic performance over the coming years. Next week,\nconcurrent with our policy meeting, the FOMC participants will release a new set of\neconomic projections. Those could, of course, differ from the previous set of such\nprojections in March. But speaking for myself, although the economy recently has been\naffected by a mix of countervailing forces, I see good reasons to expect that the positive\nforces supporting employment growth and higher inflation will continue to outweigh the\nnegative ones. As a result, I expect the economic expansion to continue, with the labor\nmarket improving further and GDP growing moderately. And as I just noted, I expect to\nsee inflation moving up to 2 percent over the next couple of years.\nLet me start with the positive. The increase in employment over the past several\nyears has contributed to higher household incomes and strengthening consumer\nconfidence. If the May labor report was an aberration or reflects a temporary slowdown\nresulting from the weakness in economic activity at the start of the year, then job growth\nshould pick up and support further gains in income. In addition, rising equity and house\nprices have helped restore households’ wealth. The fall in oil prices has supported\n\n6\n\nOn a seasonally adjusted basis, sales of light motor vehicles fell to an annual rate of 16.5 million units in\nMarch but then rebounded to a pace of 17.3 million units in April and 17.4 million units in May.\n\n\f-7household purchasing power as well. Simple calculations suggest that the average\nhousehold has gained some $1,300 in purchasing power since mid-2014 from the fall in\ngasoline prices. 7 With continuing gains in disposable income and wealth, I expect\nconsumer spending to grow at a solid rate. I also expect the housing sector to make\nfurther progress. Both home sales and construction have been gradually improving, and\nresidential investment made a noticeable contribution to GDP growth over the past year.\nHousing has been supported by low mortgage rates, and while mortgage credit is still\ndifficult to obtain for households with low credit scores or hard-to-document income,\nthose with good credit histories are generally able to borrow at very favorable terms. 8\nAnd fiscal policy at the combined national, state, and local levels, which subtracted from\nGDP growth for much of recovery, is now a small positive.\nEconomists often say, “on the other hand.” So, in keeping with that tradition, I’ll\nnow turn to the less-positive. Economic developments abroad have significantly\nrestrained growth in the United States over the past year, although I am cautiously\noptimistic that these headwinds are now fading. Concerns about slowing growth in China\nand falling commodity prices, which afflicted global financial markets early this year and\nthus likely weighed on demand, appear to have eased somewhat. Indicators suggest that\nforeign economies are growing, if still at only a moderate pace, and foreign financial\nmarkets have recovered and stabilized. That said, net exports have been a drag on U.S.\nGDP growth over the past year and are likely to continue to weigh on growth over the\n\n7\n\nIn 2013, according to the Energy Information Agency, households purchased about 730 gallons per\nhousehold on average. Applying the drop in gasoline prices since the first half of 2014, savings per\nhousehold averaged about $110 in the second half of 2014, $780 in 2015, and another $420 through May of\nthis year, implying a cumulative overall gain of more than $1,300 per household on average.\n8\nHousing could receive another boost if there were a continued revival in the rate of new household\nformation, which has been depressed since the recession as young adults have delayed moving out of their\nparents’ homes.\n\n\f-8medium term. This drag, in part, reflects the prolonged effects of the significant increase\nin the foreign exchange value of the dollar since the middle of 2014, a development that\nhas been particularly challenging for U.S. manufacturers and other firms competing with\nforeign producers.\nAlthough lower oil prices have likely been a positive influence on the U.S.\neconomy overall, they also have had a negative side, given the sizable U.S. energy\nindustry. New drilling and energy-sector employment have plunged, and the effects have\nspilled over to businesses serving the energy production sector. But the largest declines\nin drilling activity are likely now behind us, and with oil prices having recovered\nsomewhat, I expect that oil prices will become less of a factor.\nBusiness investment has been weak in the past six months or so, even beyond the\nenergy sector, and investment in capital equipment is reported to have declined in the last\nquarter of 2015 and first quarter of this year. I suspect there is a transitory element to this\nweak investment performance, and I expect investment to rebound. But the latest labor\nmarket data raise the less favorable possibility that firms may instead have decided to\nexpand their operations more slowly, and I intend to continue to pay close attention to\ndevelopments in this area.\nAs I said, the positive economic forces have outweighed the negative, and despite\nthe challenges that the economy continues to face, I continue to expect further progress\ntoward our employment and inflation objectives.\nSome Important Uncertainties\nTo be sure, there is considerable uncertainty about the economic outlook that I\nhave been discussing, and, as I have already noted, we should expect to be surprised in\n\n\f-9the future just as we have been surprised in the past. Four areas of uncertainty seem\nparticularly salient at present.\nThe first involves the thrust and resilience of domestic demand. The U.S.\neconomy has performed better than many others around the globe, and that performance\nhas relied chiefly on the resilience of domestic sources of demand, consumer spending in\nparticular. So an important question is whether the U.S. economy could continue to\nmake progress amid fairly considerable global bumpiness. I continue to think that the\nanswer to that question is yes, but the weak investment performance in recent months is\nconcerning, and Friday’s employment report provides another reminder that the question\nis still relevant.\nThe second uncertainty pertains to the economic situation abroad. Even though\nthe financial stresses that had emanated from abroad at the start of this year have eased,\nglobal risks require continued attention. Much of the turmoil early this year appeared to\nbe associated with concern over the outlook for Chinese growth, which in turn has broad\nimplications for commodity prices and global economic growth. Recently, the renminbi\nhas moved in a more predictable fashion and Chinese capital outflows have abated.\nHowever, it is widely acknowledged that China faces considerable challenges as it\ncontinues to rebalance its economy toward domestic demand and consumption.\nMore generally, in the current environment of sluggish growth, low inflation, and\nalready very accommodative monetary policy in many advanced economies, investor\nperceptions of and appetite for risk can change abruptly. One development that could\nshift investor sentiment is the upcoming referendum in the United Kingdom. A U.K.\nvote to exit the European Union could have significant economic repercussions.\n\n\f- 10 A third key uncertainty for the U.S. economy is the outlook for productivity\ngrowth--that is, increases in the amount of output produced per hour worked. While the\njob market has strengthened significantly, GDP increases have been less impressive.\nThat combination of solid labor market gains and moderate GDP growth reflects the fact\nthat labor productivity growth has been unusually weak in recent years, averaging less\nthan 1/2 percent per year since 2010. 9\nOver time, productivity growth is the key determinant of improvements in living\nstandards, supporting higher pay for workers without increased costs for employers.\nRecent weak productivity growth likely helps account for the disappointing pace of wage\ngains during this economic expansion. Therefore, understanding whether, and by how\nmuch, productivity growth will pick up is a crucial part of the economic outlook. But this\nis a very difficult question, and economists are divided. Some are relatively optimistic,\npointing to the ongoing pace of innovations that promise revolutionary technologies,\nfrom genetically tailored medical therapies to self-driving cars. Others believe that the\nlow-hanging fruit of innovation largely has been picked and that there is simply less\nscope for further gains. 10\nMy position has been, and remains, cautiously optimistic. There is some evidence\nthat the deep recession had a long-lasting effect in depressing investment, research and\n\n9\n\nThe figures measure output per hour worked in the business sector. From 2007:Q4 through 2016:Q1,\nproductivity growth averaged about 1 percent per year. By comparison, business-sector productivity\ngrowth averaged 1-1/2 percent per year over the two decades from the mid-1970s to the mid-1990s, and\nthen it averaged 2¬3/4 percent per year over the next dozen years until the latest recession began.\n10\nOn the relatively optimistic side, see Mokyr (2014) or Brynjolfsson and McAfee (2014). For a less\noptimistic perspective, see Gordon (2016) or Cowen (2011). Similarly, Fernald (2014) dates the most\nrecent slowdown in measured productivity growth to before the great recession, in 2005. For evidence that\nthe recent slowdown cannot be fully explained by measurement difficulties, see Byrne, Fernald, and\nReinsdorf (2016).\n\n\f- 11 development spending, and the start-up of new firms, and that these factors have, in turn,\nlowered productivity growth. With time, I expect this effect to ease in a stronger\neconomy. 11 I also see no obvious slowdown in the pace or the potential benefits of\ninnovation in America, which likewise may bear fruit more readily in a stronger\neconomy. In the meantime, it would be helpful to adopt public policies designed to boost\nproductivity. Strengthening education and promoting innovation and investment, public\nand private, will support longer-term growth in productivity and greater gains in living\nstandards.\nA fourth important uncertainty for the economic outlook involves how quickly\ninflation will move back to 2 percent. As long as oil prices do not resume their earlier\ndeclines and the dollar does not rise substantially further, my expectation is that inflation\nwill move up to 2 percent over the next one to two years. But oil prices and the dollar\ncan move unpredictably. In addition, a further strengthening of labor market conditions\nwould typically be estimated to exert modest upward pressure on inflation over the next\ncouple of years; but such estimates are inherently imprecise, and the effect on inflation\ncould turn out to be significantly different, either upward or downward, than I expect.\nUncertainty concerning the outlook for inflation also reflects, in part, uncertainty\nabout the behavior of those inflation expectations that are relevant to price setting. For\ntwo decades, inflation has been relatively stable, reacting less persistently than before to\ntemporary factors like a recession or a swing in oil prices. The most convincing\nexplanation for this stability, in my view, is that longer-term inflation expectations have\nremained quite stable. 12 So it bears noting that some survey measures of longer-term\n\n11\n12\n\nSee Reifschneider, Wascher, and Wilcox (2015).\nFor a more detailed discussion, see Yellen (2015a).\n\n\f- 12 inflation expectations have moved a little lower over the past couple of years, while\nproxies for these expectations inferred from financial market instruments like inflationprotected securities have moved down more noticeably. It is unclear whether these\nindicators point to a true decline in those inflation expectations that are relevant for price\nsetting; for example, the financial market measures may reflect changing attitudes toward\ninflation risk more than actual inflation expectations. But the indicators have moved\nenough to get my close attention. If inflation expectations really are moving lower, that\ncould call into question whether inflation will move back to 2 percent as quickly as I\nexpect.\nPolicy Implications\nLet me now turn to the implications of the economic outlook, as well as the\nuncertainties associated with that outlook, for monetary policy. My overall assessment is\nthat the current stance of monetary policy is generally appropriate, in that it is providing\nsupport to the economy by encouraging further labor market improvement that will help\nreturn inflation to 2 percent. At the same time, I continue to think that the federal funds\nrate will probably need to rise gradually over time to ensure price stability and maximum\nsustainable employment in the longer run.\nSeveral considerations lead me to this conclusion. First, the current stance of\nmonetary policy is stimulative, although perhaps not as stimulative as might appear at\nfirst glance. One useful measure of the stance of policy is the deviation of the federal\nfunds rate from a “neutral” value, defined as the level of the federal funds rate that would\nbe neither expansionary nor contractionary if the economy was operating near potential.\nThis neutral rate changes over time, and, at any given date, it depends on a constellation\n\n\f- 13 of underlying forces affecting the economy. At present, many estimates show the neutral\nrate to be quite low by historical standards--indeed, close to zero when measured in real,\nor inflation-adjusted, terms. 13 The current actual value of the federal funds rate, also\nmeasured in real terms, is even lower, somewhere around minus 1 percent. With the\nactual real federal funds rate modestly below the relatively low neutral real rate, the\nstance of monetary policy at present should be viewed as modestly accommodative. 14\nAlthough the economy is now fairly close to the FOMC’s goal of maximum\nemployment, I view our modestly accommodative stance of policy as appropriate for\nseveral reasons. First, with inflation continuing to run below our objective, a mild\nundershooting of the unemployment rate considered to be normal in the longer run could\nhelp move inflation back up to 2 percent more quickly. Second, a stronger job market\ncould also support labor market improvement along other dimensions, including greater\nlabor force participation. A third reason relates to the risks associated with the constraint\non conventional monetary policy when the federal funds rate is near zero. If inflation\nwere to move persistently above 2 percent or the economy were to become notably\noverheated, the Committee could readily increase the target range for the federal funds\nrate. However, if inflation were to remain persistently low or the expansion were to\n\n13\n\nThe neutral rate is not directly observable and must instead be inferred from economic data, and\nestimates will vary depending on the methodology employed. However, we know that the neutral rate must\nhave been well below its historical norm in recent years, because with the actual real interest having been\nas low as it has been lately, the economy would have otherwise expanded much more than has been the\ncase. In recent years, the neutral rate has likely been held down below normal levels because of the factors\nI discussed earlier, including persistently weak growth abroad, the high exchange value of the dollar, low\nrates of household formation, and weak productivity growth. As I have noted before (see Yellen, 2015b),\nthere is empirical evidence to support the conclusion that the neutral rate is currently not far from zero.\nSee, in particular, Lubik and Matthes (2015), Laubach and Williams (2016), and Johanssen and Mertens\n(2016).\n14\nThe targeted federal funds rate, currently 0.37 percent, less the 12-month core inflation rate for personal\nconsumption expenditures through April, equals about negative 1.2 percent.\n\n\f- 14 falter, the FOMC would be able to provide only a limited amount of additional stimulus\nthrough conventional means. 15\nThese motivations notwithstanding, I continue to believe that it will be\nappropriate to gradually reduce the degree of monetary policy accommodation, provided\nthat labor market conditions strengthen further and inflation continues to make progress\ntoward our 2 percent objective. Because monetary policy affects the economy with a lag,\nsteps to withdraw this monetary accommodation ought to be initiated before the FOMC’s\ngoals are fully reached. And if the headwinds that have lingered since the crisis slowly\nabate as I anticipate, this would mean that the neutral rate of interest itself will move up,\nproviding further impetus to gradually increase the federal funds rate.\n\nBut I stress that\n\nthe economic outlook, including the pace at which the neutral rate may shift over time, is\nuncertain, so monetary policy cannot proceed on any preset path. 16\nThis point is well illustrated by events so far this year. For a time in January and\nearly February, financial markets here and abroad became turbulent and financial\nconditions tightened, reflecting and reinforcing concerns about downside risks to the\nglobal economy. In addition, data received during the winter suggested that U.S. growth\nhad weakened even as progress in the labor market remained solid. Because the\nimplications of these developments for the economic outlook were unclear, the FOMC\n\n15\n\nThere are unconventional policy tools that could be employed to provide further support to aggregate\ndemand, if necessary, and the efficacy and costs of using those tools would be weighed by the FOMC, as\nappropriate. However, so long as these tools are considered imperfect substitutes for the federal funds rate\nas an instrument of policy, the argument that the effective lower bound on nominal interest rates represents\na source of asymmetric risk remains valid.\n16\nUncertainty about where the target range for the federal funds rate will be in the long run provides\nanother reason why increases in policy rates cannot be on a preset path. I view the median value of\n3-1/4 percent from the March SEP as being a reasonable guess for the longer-run normal rate. But FOMC\nparticipants have lowered their estimates of the longer-run normal rate over time, and as new evidence\ncomes in and we see how economic conditions evolve, further changes, in either direction, are likely.\n\n\f- 15 decided at its January, March, and April meetings that it would be prudent to maintain the\nexisting target range for the federal funds rate.\nOver the past few months, financial conditions have recovered significantly and\nmany of the risks from abroad have diminished, although some risks remain. In addition,\nconsumer spending appears to have rebounded, providing some reassurance that overall\ngrowth has indeed picked up as expected. Unfortunately, as I noted earlier, new\nquestions about the economic outlook have been raised by the recent labor market data.\nIs the markedly reduced pace of hiring in April and May a harbinger of a persistent\nslowdown in the broader economy? Or will monthly payroll gains move up toward the\nsolid pace they maintained earlier this year and in 2015? Does the latest reading on the\nunemployment rate indicate that we are essentially back to full employment, or does\nrelatively subdued wage growth signal that more slack remains? My colleagues and I\nwill be wrestling with these and other related questions going forward.\nConclusion\nTo summarize, I have explained why I expect the U.S. economy will continue to\nimprove and why I expect that further gradual increases in the federal funds rate will\nprobably be appropriate to best promote the FOMC’s goals of maximum employment and\nprice stability. I have also laid out the considerable and unavoidable uncertainties that\napply to both this outlook for the economy and to the appropriate path of the federal\nfunds rate. My colleagues and I will make our policy decisions based on what incoming\ninformation implies for the economic outlook and the risks to that outlook. What is\ncertain is that monetary policy is not on a preset course, and that the Committee will\nrespond to new data and reassess risks so as to best achieve our goals.\n\n\f- 16 References\nBrynjolfsson, Erik, and Andrew McAfee (2014).

Yellen\nChair\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\nThe Economic Club of New York\nNew York, New York\n\nMarch 29, 2016\n\n\fFor more than a century, the Economic Club of New York has served as one of\nthe nation’s leading nonpartisan forums for discussion of economic policy issues. It is an\nhonor to appear before you today to speak about the Federal Reserve’s pursuit of\nmaximum employment and price stability.\nIn December, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) raised the target\nrange for the federal funds rate, the Federal Reserve’s main policy rate, by 1/4 percentage\npoint. This small step marked the end of an extraordinary seven-year period during\nwhich the federal funds rate was held near zero to support the recovery from the worst\nfinancial crisis and recession since the Great Depression. The Committee’s action\nrecognized the considerable progress that the U.S. economy had made in restoring the\njobs and incomes of millions of Americans hurt by this downturn. It also reflected an\nexpectation that the economy would continue to strengthen and that inflation, while low,\nwould move up to the FOMC’s 2 percent objective as the transitory influences of lower\noil prices and a stronger dollar gradually dissipate and as the labor market improves\nfurther. In light of this expectation, the Committee stated in December, and reiterated at\nthe two subsequent meetings, that it “expects that economic conditions will evolve in a\nmanner that will warrant only gradual increases in the federal funds rate.” 1\nIn my remarks today, I will explain why the Committee anticipates that only\ngradual increases in the federal funds rate are likely to be warranted in coming years,\nemphasizing that this guidance should be understood as a forecast for the trajectory of\npolicy rates that the Committee anticipates will prove to be appropriate to achieve its\nobjectives, conditional on the outlook for real economic activity and inflation.\n\n1\n\nBoard of Governors (2015), paragraph 4.\n\n\f-2Importantly, this forecast is not a plan set in stone that will be carried out regardless of\neconomic developments. Instead, monetary policy will, as always, respond to the\neconomy’s twists and turns so as to promote, as best as we can in an uncertain economic\nenvironment, the employment and inflation goals assigned to us by the Congress.\nThe proviso that policy will evolve as needed is especially pertinent today in light\nof global economic and financial developments since December, which at times have\nincluded significant changes in oil prices, interest rates, and stock values. So far, these\ndevelopments have not materially altered the Committee’s baseline--or most likely-outlook for economic activity and inflation over the medium term. Specifically, we\ncontinue to expect further labor market improvement and a return of inflation to our\n2 percent objective over the next two or three years, consistent with data over recent\nmonths. But this is not to say that global developments since the turn of the year have\nbeen inconsequential. In part, the baseline outlook for real activity and inflation is little\nchanged because investors responded to those developments by marking down their\nexpectations for the future path of the federal funds rate, thereby putting downward\npressure on longer-term interest rates and cushioning the adverse effects on economic\nactivity. In addition, global developments have increased the risks associated with that\noutlook. In light of these considerations, the Committee decided to leave the stance of\npolicy unchanged in both January and March.\nI will next describe the Committee’s baseline economic outlook and the risks that\ncloud that outlook, emphasizing the FOMC’s commitment to adjust monetary policy as\nneeded to achieve our employment and inflation objectives.\n\n\f-3Recent Developments and the Baseline Outlook\nReadings on the U.S. economy since the turn of the year have been somewhat\nmixed. On the one hand, many indicators have been quite favorable. The labor market\nhas added an average of almost 230,000 jobs a month over the past three months. In\naddition, the unemployment rate has edged down further, more people are joining the\nworkforce as the prospects for finding jobs have improved, and the employment-topopulation ratio has increased by almost 1/2 percentage point. Consumer spending\nappears to be expanding at a moderate pace, driven by solid income gains, improved\nhousehold balance sheets, and the ongoing effects of the increases in wealth and declines\nin oil prices over the past few years. The housing market continues its gradual recovery,\nand fiscal policy at all levels of government is now modestly boosting economic activity\nafter exerting a considerable drag in recent years.\nOn the other hand, manufacturing and net exports have continued to be hard hit\nby slow global growth and the significant appreciation of the dollar since 2014. These\nsame global developments have also weighed on business investment by limiting firms’\nexpected sales, thereby reducing their demand for capital goods; partly as a result, recent\nindicators of capital spending and business sentiment have been lackluster. In addition,\nbusiness investment has been held down by the collapse in oil prices since late 2014,\nwhich is driving an ongoing steep decline in drilling activity. Low oil prices have also\nresulted in large-scale layoffs in the energy sector and adverse spillovers to output and\nemployment in industries that support energy production.\nOn balance, overall employment has continued to grow at a solid pace so far this\nyear, in part because domestic household spending has been sufficiently strong to offset\n\n\f-4the drag coming from abroad. Looking forward however, we have to take into account\nthe potential fallout from recent global economic and financial developments, which have\nbeen marked by bouts of turbulence since the turn of the year. For a time, equity prices\nwere down sharply, oil traded at less than $30 per barrel, and many currencies were\ndepreciating against the dollar. Although prices in these markets have since largely\nreturned to where they stood at the start of the year, in other respects economic and\nfinancial conditions remain less favorable than they did back at the time of the December\nFOMC meeting. In particular, foreign economic growth now seems likely to be weaker\nthis year than previously expected, and earnings expectations have declined. By\nthemselves, these developments would tend to restrain U.S. economic activity. But those\neffects have been at least partially offset by downward revisions to market expectations\nfor the federal funds rate that in turn have put downward pressure on longer-term interest\nrates, including mortgage rates, thereby helping to support spending. For these reasons, I\nanticipate that the overall fallout for the U.S. economy from global market developments\nsince the start of the year will most likely be limited, although this assessment is subject\nto considerable uncertainty.\nAll told, the Committee continues to expect moderate economic growth over the\nmedium term accompanied by further labor market improvement. Consistent with this\nassessment, the medians of the individual projections for economic growth,\nunemployment, and inflation made by all of the FOMC participants for our March\nmeeting are little changed from December. 2 A key factor underlying such modest\n\n2\n\nSpecifically, the median projections of real GDP growth in 2016 and 2017 revised down 0.2 percentage\npoint and 0.1 percentage point, respectively; the median projections of real GDP growth in 2018 and the\nlonger run were unrevised. The median projection for the unemployment rate in late 2016 was unrevised,\nwhile the projections for late 2017, late 2018, and the longer run were revised down slightly. Finally,\n\n\f-5revisions is a judgment that monetary policy remains accommodative and will be\nadjusted at an appropriately gradual pace to achieve and maintain our dual objectives of\nmaximum employment and 2 percent inflation. Reflecting global economic and financial\ndevelopments since December, however, the pace of rate increases is now expected to be\nsomewhat slower. For example, the median of FOMC participants’ projections for the\nfederal funds rate is now only 0.9 percent for the end of 2016 and 1.9 percent for the end\nof 2017, both 1/2 percentage point below the December medians.\nAs has been widely discussed, the level of inflation-adjusted or real interest rates\nneeded to keep the economy near full employment appears to have fallen to a low level in\nrecent years. Although estimates vary both quantitatively and conceptually, the evidence\non balance indicates that the economy’s “neutral” real rate--that is, the level of the real\nfederal funds rate that would be neither expansionary nor contractionary if the economy\nwas operating near its potential--is likely now close to zero. 3 However, the current real\nfederal funds rate is even lower, at roughly minus 1-1/4 percentage point, when measured\nusing the 12-month change in the core price index for personal consumption expenditures\n\nalthough the median projection for overall inflation in 2016 was revised down 0.4 percentage point, median\nprojections for subsequent years were unrevised; in addition, median projections for core inflation were\nalmost unrevised for all years. For additional information on the Summary of Economic Projections to be\nreleased with the March 2016 FOMC minutes, see\nwww.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomcprojtabl20160316.htm.\n3\nThe neutral rate is not directly observable. However, we intuitively know that it must have run well\nbelow its historical norm in recent years because otherwise the economy would have expanded at a much\nmore rapid pace with the nominal federal funds rate near zero. As discussed in my December 2, 2015,\nspeech to the Economic Club of Washington (Yellen, 2015), empirical evidence supports this intuition. I\nshowed that model-based estimates of the “natural rate,” when the natural rate is defined as the real shortterm interest rate that would prevail in the absence of frictions that slow the adjustment of wages and prices\nto changes in the economy, are currently close to zero in four macroeconomic models used by Federal\nReserve staff. Time series estimates of a different concept of the natural rate that is more similar to the\nneutral rate definition used in this speech, such as Laubach and Williams (2016) and Lubik and Matthes\n(2015), are near historical lows. See also Johannsen and Mertens (2016) for empirical evidence of a\ndecline in the longer-run level of the natural rate, along with measures of the uncertainty attached to\nestimates of its current value.\n\n\f-6(PCE), which excludes food and energy. Thus, the current stance of monetary policy\nappears to be consistent with actual economic growth modestly outpacing potential\ngrowth and further improvements in the labor market. 4\nLooking beyond the near term, I anticipate that growth will also be supported by a\nlessening of some of the headwinds that continue to restrain the U.S. economy, which\ninclude weak foreign activity, dollar appreciation, a pace of household formation that has\nnot kept up with population and income growth and so has depressed homebuilding, and\nproductivity growth that has been running at a slow pace by historical standards since the\nend of the recession. If these headwinds gradually fade as I expect, the neutral federal\nfunds rate will also rise, in which case it will, all else equal, be appropriate to gradually\nincrease the federal funds rate more or less in tandem to achieve our dual objectives.\nOtherwise, monetary policy would eventually become overly accommodative as the\neconomy strengthened. 5\nImplicitly, this expectation of fading headwinds and a rising neutral rate is a key\nreason for the FOMC’s assessment that gradual increases in the federal funds rate over\ntime will likely be appropriate. That said, this assessment is only a forecast. The future\npath of the federal funds rate is necessarily uncertain because economic activity and\ninflation will likely evolve in unexpected ways. For example, no one can be certain\nabout the pace at which economic headwinds will fade. More generally, the economy\n\n4\n\nAssuming that the current gap between the actual federal funds rate and its neutral value is about\n125 basis points, simulations of the FRB/US model under vector-autoregression-based expectations suggest\nthat maintaining this interest rate gap for the next couple of years would lower the unemployment rate\n1/2 percentage point or so below what it otherwise would be if the gap were instead immediately closed.\nUnder rational expectations, the predicted effect would be smaller. For further information, see Brayton,\nLaubach, and Reifschneider (2014).\n5\nOf course, any gap between the real federal funds rate and the neutral rate will eventually need to be\nclosed in order to stabilize inflation at 2 percent, keep employment at its maximum level, and the economy\ngrowing in line with its potential rate.\n\n\f-7will inevitably be buffeted by shocks that cannot be foreseen. What is certain, however,\nis that the Committee will respond to changes in the outlook as needed to achieve its dual\nmandate.\nTurning to inflation, here too the baseline outlook is little changed. In December,\nthe FOMC anticipated that inflation would remain low in the near term due to the drag\nfrom lower prices for energy and imports. But as those transitory effects faded, the\nCommittee expected inflation to move up to 2 percent over the medium term, provided\nthe labor market improves further and inflation expectations are stable. This assessment\nstill seems to me to be broadly correct. PCE prices were up only 1 percent in February\nrelative to a year earlier, held down by earlier declines in the price of oil. In contrast,\ncore PCE inflation, which strips out volatile food and energy components, was up 1.7\npercent in February on a 12 month basis, somewhat more than my expectation in\nDecember. But it is too early to tell if this recent faster pace will prove durable. Even\nwhen measured on a 12-month basis, core inflation can vary substantially from quarter to\nquarter and earlier dollar appreciation is still expected to weigh on consumer prices in the\ncoming months. For these reasons, I continue to expect that overall PCE inflation for\n2016 as a whole will come in well below 2 percent but will then move back to 2 percent\nover the course of 2017 and 2018, assuming no further swings in energy prices or the\ndollar. This projection, however, depends critically on expectations for future inflation\nremaining reasonably well anchored. It is still my judgment that inflation expectations\nare well anchored, but as I will shortly discuss, continued low readings for some\nindicators of expected inflation do concern me.\n\n\f-8Risks to the Outlook for Real Economic Activity\nAlthough the baseline outlook has changed little on balance since December,\nglobal developments pose ongoing risks. These risks appear to have contributed to the\nfinancial market volatility witnessed both last summer and in recent months.\nOne concern pertains to the pace of global growth, which is importantly\ninfluenced by developments in China. There is a consensus that China’s economy will\nslow in the coming years as it transitions away from investment toward consumption and\nfrom exports toward domestic sources of growth. There is much uncertainty, however,\nabout how smoothly this transition will proceed and about the policy framework in place\nto manage any financial disruptions that might accompany it. These uncertainties were\nheightened by market confusion earlier this year over China’s exchange rate policy.\nA second concern relates to the prospects for commodity prices, particularly oil.\nFor the United States, low oil prices, on net, likely will boost spending and economic\nactivity over the next few years because we are still a major oil importer. But the\napparent negative reaction of financial markets to recent declines in oil prices may in part\nreflect market concern that the price of oil was nearing a financial tipping point for some\ncountries and energy firms. In the case of countries reliant on oil exports, the result\nmight be a sharp cutback in government spending; for energy-related firms, it could entail\nsignificant financial strains and increased layoffs. In the event oil prices were to fall\nagain, either development could have adverse spillover effects to the rest of the global\neconomy.\nIf such downside risks to the outlook were to materialize, they would likely slow\nU.S. economic activity, at least to some extent, both directly and through financial market\n\n\f-9channels as investors respond by demanding higher returns to hold risky assets, causing\nfinancial conditions to tighten. But at the same time, we should not ignore the welcome\npossibility that economic conditions could turn out to be more favorable than we now\nexpect. The improvement in the labor market in 2014 and 2015 was considerably faster\nthan expected by either FOMC participants or private forecasters, and that experience\ncould be repeated if, for example, the economic headwinds we face were to abate more\nquickly than anticipated. For these reasons, the FOMC must watch carefully for signs\nthat the economy may be evolving in unexpected ways, good or bad.\nRisks to the Inflation Outlook\nThe inflation outlook has also become somewhat more uncertain since the turn of\nthe year, in part for reasons related to risks to the outlook for economic growth. To the\nextent that recent financial market turbulence signals an increased chance of a further\nslowing of growth abroad, oil prices could resume falling, and the dollar could start rising\nagain. And if foreign developments were to adversely affect the U.S. economy by more\nthan I expect, then the pace of labor market improvement would probably be slower,\nwhich would also tend to restrain growth in both wages and prices. But even if such\ndevelopments were to occur, they would, in my view, only delay the return of inflation to\n2 percent, provided that inflation expectations remain anchored.\nUnfortunately, the stability of longer-run inflation expectations cannot be taken\nfor granted. During the 1970s, inflation expectations rose markedly because the Federal\nReserve allowed actual inflation to ratchet up persistently in response to economic\ndisruptions--a development that made it more difficult to stabilize both inflation and\nemployment. With considerable effort, however, the FOMC gradually succeeded in\n\n\f- 10 bringing inflation back down to a low and stable level over the course of the 1980s and\nearly 1990s. Since this time, measures of longer-run inflation expectations derived from\nboth surveys and financial markets have been remarkably stable, making it easier to keep\nactual inflation relatively close to 2 percent despite large movements in oil prices and\npronounced swings in the unemployment rate.\nLately, however, there have been signs that inflation expectations may have\ndrifted down. Market-based measures of longer-run inflation compensation have fallen\nmarkedly over the past year and half, although they have recently moved up modestly\nfrom their all-time lows. Similarly, the measure of longer-run inflation expectations\nreported in the University of Michigan Survey of Consumers has drifted down somewhat\nover the past few years and now stands at the lower end of the narrow range in which it\nhas fluctuated since the late 1990s.\nThe shifts in these measures notwithstanding, the argument that inflation\nexpectations have actually fallen is far from conclusive. Analysis carried out at the Fed\nand elsewhere suggests that the decline in market-based measures of inflation\ncompensation has largely been driven by movements in inflation risk premiums and\nliquidity concerns rather than by shifts in inflation expectations. 6 In addition, the longerrun measure of inflation expectations from the Michigan Survey has historically\nexhibited some sensitivity to fluctuations in current gasoline prices, which suggests that\nthis measure may be an unreliable guide to movements in trend inflation under current\ncircumstances. 7 Moreover, measures of longer-run expected inflation gleaned from\n\n6\n\nFor related background discussions, see Bauer and Rudebusch (2015), Abrahams and others (2012 [rev.\n2015), and D’Amico, Kim, and Wei (2014).\n7\nSimilarly, a monthly survey conducted by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York shows a noticeable\ndecline over the past two years in household expectations for inflation three years ahead. However, these\n\n\f- 11 surveys of business and financial economists, such as those reported in the Survey of\nProfessional Forecasters, the Blue Chip survey, and the Survey of Primary Dealers, have\nlargely moved sideways in the past year or two. Taken together, these results suggest\nthat my baseline assumption of stable expectations is still justified. Nevertheless, the\ndecline in some indicators has heightened the risk that this judgment could be wrong. If\nso, the return to 2 percent inflation could take longer than expected and might require a\nmore accommodative stance of monetary policy than would otherwise be appropriate. 8\nDespite the declines in some indicators of expected inflation, we also need to\nconsider the opposite risk that we are underestimating the speed at which inflation will\nreturn to our 2 percent objective. Economic growth here and abroad could turn out to be\nstronger than expected, and, as the past few weeks have demonstrated, oil prices can rise\nas well as fall. More generally, economists’ understanding of inflation is far from\nperfect, and it would not be all that surprising if inflation was to rise more quickly than\nexpected over the next several years. For these reasons, we must continue to monitor\nincoming wage and price data carefully.\nMonetary Policy Implications\nLet me now turn to the implications for monetary policy of this assessment of the\nbaseline outlook and associated risks.\n\nreadings on shorter-term expectations may also be influenced by current gasoline prices. Moreover,\nreadings from this survey are only available since 2013, making it difficult to determine the significance of\nthese results.\n8\nAnother risk to the inflation forecast, although one that has not changed appreciably since the turn of the\nyear, is that the Committee may have overestimated the longer-run rate of unemployment consistent with\ninflation stabilizing at 2 percent. Currently, the median of FOMC participants’ estimates of this rate is\n4.8 percent. However, this longer-run rate cannot be estimated precisely, and so it could be appreciably\nhigher or lower--although given low readings on wages in recent years, I think the latter possibility is more\nlikely than the former. If so, a lower level of unemployment might be needed to fully eliminate slack in the\nlabor market, drive faster wage growth, and return inflation to our 2 percent objective.\n\n\f- 12 The FOMC left the target range for the federal funds rate unchanged in January\nand March, in large part reflecting the changes in baseline conditions that I noted earlier.\nIn particular, developments abroad imply that meeting our objectives for employment and\ninflation will likely require a somewhat lower path for the federal funds rate than was\nanticipated in December.\nGiven the risks to the outlook, I consider it appropriate for the Committee to\nproceed cautiously in adjusting policy. This caution is especially warranted because,\nwith the federal funds rate so low, the FOMC’s ability to use conventional monetary\npolicy to respond to economic disturbances is asymmetric. If economic conditions were\nto strengthen considerably more than currently expected, the FOMC could readily raise\nits target range for the federal funds rate to stabilize the economy. By contrast, if the\nexpansion was to falter or if inflation was to remain stubbornly low, the FOMC would be\nable to provide only a modest degree of additional stimulus by cutting the federal funds\nrate back to near zero. 9\nOne must be careful, however, not to overstate the asymmetries affecting\nmonetary policy at the moment. Even if the federal funds rate were to return to near zero,\nthe FOMC would still have considerable scope to provide additional accommodation. In\nparticular, we could use the approaches that we and other central banks successfully\nemployed in the wake of the financial crisis to put additional downward pressure on longterm interest rates and so support the economy--specifically, forward guidance about the\n\n9\nResearch suggests that, all else being equal, increased uncertainty and greater downside risk in the vicinity\nof the effective lower bound on nominal interest rates call for greater gradualism under optimal policy than\nwould be the case if short-term nominal interest rates were appreciably above zero. This phenomenon is\nknown as “policy attenuation” in the economic literature. For a discussion, see, for example, Adam and\nBilli (2007), Nakata (2012), Evans and others (2015), and Gust, Johannsen, and Lopez-Salido (2015).\n\n\f- 13 future path of the federal funds rate and increases in the size or duration of our holdings\nof long-term securities. 10 While these tools may entail some risks and costs that do not\napply to the federal funds rate, we used them effectively to strengthen the recovery from\nthe Great Recession, and we would do so again if needed. 11\nOf course, economic conditions may evolve quite differently than anticipated in\nthe baseline outlook, both in the near term and over the longer run. If so, as I emphasized\nearlier, the FOMC will adjust monetary policy as warranted. As our March decision and\nthe latest revisions to the Summary of Economic Projections demonstrate, the Committee\nhas not embarked on a preset course of tightening. Rather, our actions are data\ndependent, and the FOMC will adjust policy as needed to achieve its dual objectives.\nFinancial market participants appear to recognize the FOMC’s data-dependent\napproach because incoming data surprises typically induce changes in market\nexpectations about the likely future path of policy, resulting in movements in bond yields\nthat act to buffer the economy from shocks. This mechanism serves as an important\n“automatic stabilizer” for the economy. As I have already noted, the decline in market\nexpectations since December for the future path of the federal funds rate and\naccompanying downward pressure on long-term interest rates have helped to offset the\ncontractionary effects of somewhat less favorable financial conditions and slower foreign\ngrowth. In addition, the public’s expectation that the Fed will respond to economic\n\n10\n\nWith regard to the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet, the FOMC could increase its size by resuming largescale purchases of longer-term Treasury securities and agency mortgage-backed securities. Alternatively,\nthe FOMC could increase the duration of the Federal Reserve’s holdings without expanding the size of its\nportfolio by selling assets with relatively short residual maturities and buying equal amounts of assets with\nrelatively long residual maturities. Studies suggest that either action would reduce the term premiums\nembedded in longer-term interest rates considerably.\n11\nFor an overview of the macroeconomic effects of the Federal Reserve’s unconventional policies after the\nfinancial crisis, see Engen, Laubach, and Reifschneider (2015) and the references therein. For a discussion\nof the costs and benefits of these tools, see English, Lopez-Salido, and Tetlow (2015).\n\n\f- 14 disturbances in a predictable manner to reduce or offset their potential harmful effects\nmeans that the public is apt to react less adversely to such shocks--a response which\nserves to stabilize the expectations underpinning hiring and spending decisions. 12\nSuch a stabilizing effect is one consequence of effective communication by the\nFOMC about its outlook for the economy and how, based on that outlook, policy is\nexpected to evolve to achieve our economic objectives. I continue to strongly believe\nthat monetary policy is most effective when the FOMC is forthcoming in addressing\neconomic and financial developments such as those I have discussed in these remarks,\nand when we speak clearly about how such developments may affect the outlook and the\nexpected path of policy. I have done my best to do so today, in the time you have kindly\ngranted me.\n\n12\n\nThat said, market expectations are not always well aligned with the Committee’s baseline outlook for the\nfederal funds rate. Market participants may hold different views about the economic outlook and the\nassociated risks and at times may be confused about the FOMC’s strategy. In such situations, the\nCommittee must do what it believes is appropriate while clearly explaining the rationale for its actions.\n\n\f- 15 References\nAbrahams, Michael, Tobias Adrian, Richard K.

Yellen\nChair\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nbefore the\nCommittee on Financial Services\n\nU.S. House of Representatives\nFebruary 10, 2016\n\n\fChairman Hensarling, Ranking Member Waters, and other members of the Committee, I\nam pleased to present the Federal Reserve’s semiannual Monetary Policy Report to the Congress.\nIn my remarks today, I will discuss the current economic situation and outlook before turning to\nmonetary policy.\nCurrent Economic Situation and Outlook\nSince my appearance before this Committee last July, the economy has made further\nprogress toward the Federal Reserve’s objective of maximum employment. And while inflation\nis expected to remain low in the near term, in part because of the further declines in energy\nprices, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) expects that inflation will rise to its\n2 percent objective over the medium term.\nIn the labor market, the number of nonfarm payroll jobs rose 2.7 million in 2015, and\nposted a further gain of 150,000 in January of this year. The cumulative increase in employment\nsince its trough in early 2010, is now more than 13 million jobs. Meanwhile, the unemployment\nrate fell to 4.9 percent in January, 0.8 percentage point below its level a year ago and in line with\nthe median of FOMC participants’ most recent estimates of its longer-run normal level. Other\nmeasures of labor market conditions have also shown solid improvement, with noticeable\ndeclines over the past year in the number of individuals who want and are available to work but\nhave not actively searched recently, and in the number of people who are working part time but\nwould rather work full time. However, these measures remain above the levels seen prior to the\nrecession, suggesting that some slack in labor markets remains. Thus, while labor market\nconditions have improved substantially, there is still room for further sustainable improvement.\nThe strong gains in the job market last year were accompanied by a continued moderate\nexpansion in economic activity. U.S. real gross domestic product is estimated to have increased\n\n\f-2about 1-3/4 percent in 2015. Over the course of the year, subdued foreign growth and the\nappreciation of the dollar restrained net exports. In the fourth quarter of last year, growth in the\ngross domestic product is reported to have slowed more sharply, to an annual rate of just\n3/4 percent; again, growth was held back by weak net exports as well as by a negative\ncontribution from inventory investment. Although private domestic final demand appears to\nhave slowed somewhat in the fourth quarter, it has continued to advance. Household spending\nhas been supported by steady job gains and solid growth in real disposable income--aided in part\nby the declines in oil prices. One area of particular strength has been purchases of cars and light\ntrucks; sales of these vehicles in 2015, reached their highest level ever. In the drilling and\nmining sector, lower oil prices have caused companies to slash jobs and sharply cut capital\noutlays, but in most other sectors, business investment rose over the second half of last year.\nAnd homebuilding activity has continued to move up, on balance, although the level of new\nconstruction remains well below the longer-run levels implied by demographic trends.\nFinancial conditions in the United States have recently become less supportive of growth,\nwith declines in broad measures of equity prices, higher borrowing rates for riskier borrowers,\nand a further appreciation of the dollar. These developments, if they prove persistent, could\nweigh on the outlook for economic activity and the labor market, although declines in longerterm interest rates and oil prices provide some offset. Still, ongoing employment gains and faster\nwage growth should support the growth of real incomes and therefore consumer spending, and\nglobal economic growth should pick up over time, supported by highly accommodative\nmonetary policies abroad. Against this backdrop, the Committee expects that with gradual\nadjustments in the stance of monetary policy, economic activity will expand at a moderate pace\nin coming years and that labor market indicators will continue to strengthen.\n\n\f-3As is always the case, the economic outlook is uncertain. Foreign economic\ndevelopments, in particular, pose risks to U.S. economic growth. Most notably, although recent\neconomic indicators do not suggest a sharp slowdown in Chinese growth, declines in the foreign\nexchange value of the renminbi have intensified uncertainty about China’s exchange rate policy\nand the prospects for its economy. This uncertainty led to increased volatility in global financial\nmarkets and, against the background of persistent weakness abroad, exacerbated concerns about\nthe outlook for global growth. These growth concerns, along with strong supply conditions and\nhigh inventories, contributed to the recent fall in the prices of oil and other commodities. In turn,\nlow commodity prices could trigger financial stresses in commodity-exporting economies,\nparticularly in vulnerable emerging market economies, and for commodity-producing firms in\nmany countries. Should any of these downside risks materialize, foreign activity and demand for\nU.S. exports could weaken and financial market conditions could tighten further.\nOf course, economic growth could also exceed our projections for a number of reasons,\nincluding the possibility that low oil prices will boost U.S. economic growth more than we\nexpect. At present, the Committee is closely monitoring global economic and financial\ndevelopments, as well as assessing their implications for the labor market and inflation and the\nbalance of risks to the outlook.\nAs I noted earlier, inflation continues to run below the Committee’s 2 percent objective.\nOverall consumer prices, as measured by the price index for personal consumption expenditures,\nincreased just 1/2 percent over the 12 months of 2015. To a large extent, the low average pace of\ninflation last year can be traced to the earlier steep declines in oil prices and in the prices of other\nimported goods. And, given the recent further declines in the prices of oil and other\ncommodities, as well as the further appreciation of the dollar, the Committee expects inflation to\n\n\f-4remain low in the near term. However, once oil and import prices stop falling, the downward\npressure on domestic inflation from those sources should wane, and as the labor market\nstrengthens further, inflation is expected to rise gradually to 2 percent over the medium term. In\nlight of the current shortfall of inflation from 2 percent, the Committee is carefully monitoring\nactual and expected progress toward its inflation goal.\nOf course, inflation expectations play an important role in the inflation process, and the\nCommittee’s confidence in the inflation outlook depends importantly on the degree to which\nlonger-run inflation expectations remain well anchored. It is worth noting, in this regard, that\nmarket-based measures of inflation compensation have moved down to historically low levels;\nour analysis suggests that changes in risk and liquidity premiums over the past year and a half\ncontributed significantly to these declines. Some survey measures of longer-run inflation\nexpectations are also at the low end of their recent ranges; overall, however, they have been\nreasonably stable.\nMonetary Policy\nTurning to monetary policy, the FOMC conducts policy to promote maximum\nemployment and price stability, as required by our statutory mandate from the Congress. Last\nMarch, the Committee stated that it would be appropriate to raise the target range for the federal\nfunds rate when it had seen further improvement in the labor market and was reasonably\nconfident that inflation would move back to its 2 percent objective over the medium term. In\nDecember, the Committee judged that these two criteria had been satisfied and decided to raise\nthe target range for the federal funds rate 1/4 percentage point, to between 1/4 and 1/2 percent.\nThis increase marked the end of a seven-year period during which the federal funds rate was held\nnear zero. The Committee did not adjust the target range in January.\n\n\f-5The decision in December to raise the federal funds rate reflected the Committee’s\nassessment that, even after a modest reduction in policy accommodation, economic activity\nwould continue to expand at a moderate pace and labor market indicators would continue to\nstrengthen. Although inflation was running below the Committee’s longer-run objective, the\nFOMC judged that much of the softness in inflation was attributable to transitory factors that are\nlikely to abate over time, and that diminishing slack in labor and product markets would help\nmove inflation toward 2 percent. In addition, the Committee recognized that it takes time for\nmonetary policy actions to affect economic conditions. If the FOMC delayed the start of policy\nnormalization for too long, it might have to tighten policy relatively abruptly in the future to\nkeep the economy from overheating and inflation from significantly overshooting its objective.\nSuch an abrupt tightening could increase the risk of pushing the economy into recession.\nIt is important to note that even after this increase, the stance of monetary policy remains\naccommodative. The FOMC anticipates that economic conditions will evolve in a manner that\nwill warrant only gradual increases in the federal funds rate. In addition, the Committee expects\nthat the federal funds rate is likely to remain, for some time, below the levels that are expected to\nprevail in the longer run. This expectation is consistent with the view that the neutral nominal\nfederal funds rate--defined as the value of the federal funds rate that would be neither\nexpansionary nor contractionary if the economy was operating near potential--is currently low by\nhistorical standards and is likely to rise only gradually over time. The low level of the neutral\nfederal funds rate may be partially attributable to a range of persistent economic headwinds-such as limited access to credit for some borrowers, weak growth abroad, and a significant\nappreciation of the dollar--that have weighed on aggregate demand.\n\n\f-6Of course, monetary policy is by no means on a preset course. The actual path of the\nfederal funds rate will depend on what incoming data tell us about the economic outlook, and we\nwill regularly reassess what level of the federal funds rate is consistent with achieving and\nmaintaining maximum employment and 2 percent inflation. In doing so, we will take into\naccount a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators\nof inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international\ndevelopments. In particular, stronger growth or a more rapid increase in inflation than the\nCommittee currently anticipates would suggest that the neutral federal funds rate was rising more\nquickly than expected, making it appropriate to raise the federal funds rate more quickly as well.\nConversely, if the economy were to disappoint, a lower path of the federal funds rate would be\nappropriate. We are committed to our dual objectives, and we will adjust policy as appropriate\nto foster financial conditions consistent with the attainment of our objectives over time.\nConsistent with its previous communications, the Federal Reserve used interest on excess\nreserves (IOER) and overnight reverse repurchase (RRP) operations to move the federal funds\nrate into the new target range. The adjustment to the IOER rate has been particularly important\nin raising the federal funds rate and short-term interest rates more generally in an environment of\nabundant bank reserves. Meanwhile, overnight RRP operations complement the IOER rate by\nestablishing a soft floor on money market interest rates. The IOER rate and the overnight RRP\noperations allowed the FOMC to control the federal funds rate effectively without having to first\nshrink its balance sheet by selling a large part of its holdings of longer-term securities. The\nCommittee judged that removing monetary policy accommodation by the traditional approach of\nraising short-term interest rates is preferable to selling longer-term assets because such sales\ncould be difficult to calibrate and could generate unexpected financial market reactions.\n\n\f-7The Committee is continuing its policy of reinvesting proceeds from maturing Treasury\nsecurities and principal payments from agency debt and mortgage-backed securities. As\nhighlighted in the December statement, the FOMC anticipates continuing this policy “until\nnormalization of the level of the federal funds rate is well under way.” Maintaining our sizable\nholdings of longer-term securities should help maintain accommodative financial conditions and\nreduce the risk that we might need to return the federal funds rate target to the effective lower\nbound in response to future adverse shocks.\nThank you. I would be pleased to take your questions.\n\n\f"

            "content": "For release on delivery\n10:00 a.m. EST\nDecember 3, 2015\n\nStatement by\nJanet L. Yellen\nChair\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nbefore the\nJoint Economic Committee\nU.S. Congress\nDecember 3, 2015\n\n\fChairman Coats, Ranking Member Maloney, and members of the Committee, I\nappreciate the opportunity to testify before you today. In my remarks I will discuss the current\neconomic outlook before turning to monetary policy.\nThe Economic Outlook\nThe U.S. economy has recovered substantially since the Great Recession. The\nunemployment rate, which peaked at 10 percent in October 2009, declined to 5 percent in\nOctober of this year. At that level, the unemployment rate is near the median of Federal Open\nMarket Committee (FOMC) participants’ most recent estimates of its longer-run normal level.\nThe economy has created about 13 million jobs since the low point for employment in early\n2010, and total nonfarm payrolls are now almost 4-1/2 million higher than just prior to the\nrecession. Most recently, after a couple of months of relatively modest payroll growth,\nemployers added an estimated 271,000 jobs in October. This increase brought the average\nmonthly gain since June to about 195,000--close to the monthly pace of around 210,000 in the\nfirst half of the year and still sufficient to be consistent with continued improvement in the labor\nmarket.\nAt the same time that the labor market has improved, U.S. economic output--as measured\nby inflation-adjusted gross domestic product (GDP), or real GDP--has increased at a moderate\npace, on balance, during the expansion. Over the first three quarters of this year, real GDP is\ncurrently estimated to have advanced at an annual rate of 2-1/4 percent, close to its average pace\nover the previous five years. Many economic forecasters expect growth roughly along those\nsame lines in the fourth quarter.\nGrowth this year has been held down by weak net exports, which have subtracted more\nthan 1/2 percentage point, on average, from the annual rate of real GDP growth over the past\n\n\f-2 three quarters. Foreign economic growth has slowed, damping increases in U.S. exports, and the\nU.S. dollar has appreciated substantially since the middle of last year, making our exports more\nexpensive and imported goods cheaper.\nBy contrast, total real private domestic final purchases (PDFP)--which includes\nhousehold spending, business fixed investment, and residential investment, and currently\nrepresents about 85 percent of aggregate spending--has increased at an annual rate of 3 percent\nthis year, significantly faster than real GDP. Household spending growth has been particularly\nsolid in 2015, with purchases of new motor vehicles especially strong. Job growth has bolstered\nhousehold income, and lower energy prices have left consumers with more to spend on other\ngoods and services. Increases in home values and stock market prices in recent years, along with\nreductions in debt, have pushed up the net worth of households, which also supports consumer\nspending. Finally, interest rates for borrowers remain low, due in part to the FOMC’s\naccommodative monetary policy, and these low rates appear to have been especially relevant for\nconsumers considering the purchase of durable goods.\nOther components of PDFP, including residential and business investment, have also\nadvanced this year. Indeed, gains in real residential investment spending have been faster so far\nthis year than last year, although the level of new residential construction still remains fairly low.\nAnd outside of the drilling and mining sector, where lower oil prices have led to substantial cuts\nin outlays for new structures, business investment spending has posted moderate gains.\nTurning to inflation, it continues to run below the FOMC’s longer-run objective of\n2 percent. Overall consumer price inflation--as measured by the change in the price index for\npersonal consumption expenditures--was only 1/4 percent over the 12 months ending in October.\nHowever, this number largely reflects the sharp fall in crude oil prices since the summer of 2014.\n\n\f-3 Because food and energy prices are volatile, it is often helpful to look at inflation excluding\nthose two categories--known as core inflation--which is typically a better indicator of future\noverall inflation than recent readings of headline inflation. But core inflation--which ran at\n1-1/4 percent over the 12 months ending in October--is also well below our 2 percent objective,\npartly reflecting the appreciation of the U.S. dollar, which has pushed down the prices of\nimported goods, placing temporary downward pressure on inflation. Even after taking account\nof this effect, however, inflation has been running somewhat below our objective.\nLet me now turn to where I see the economy is likely headed over the next several years.\nTo summarize, I anticipate continued economic growth at a moderate pace that will be sufficient\nto generate additional increases in employment and a rise in inflation to our 2 percent objective.\nAlthough the economic outlook, as always, is uncertain, I currently see the risks to the outlook\nfor economic activity and the labor market as very close to balanced.\nRegarding U.S. inflation, I anticipate that the drag due to the large declines in prices for\ncrude oil and imports over the past year and a half will diminish next year. With less downward\npressure on inflation from these factors and some upward pressure from a further tightening in\nU.S. labor and product markets, I expect inflation to move up to the FOMC’s 2 percent objective\nover the next few years. Of course, inflation expectations play an important role in the inflation\nprocess, and my forecast of a return to our 2 percent objective over the medium term relies on a\njudgment that longer-term inflation expectations remain reasonably well anchored.\nMonetary Policy\nLet me now turn to the implications of the economic outlook for monetary policy. In the\npolicy statement issued after its October meeting, the FOMC reaffirmed its judgment that it\nwould be appropriate to increase the target range for the federal funds rate when we had seen\n\n\f-4 some further improvement in the labor market and were reasonably confident that inflation\nwould move back to the Committee’s 2 percent objective over the medium term. That initial rate\nincrease would reflect the Committee’s judgment, based on a range of indicators, that the\neconomy would continue to grow at a pace sufficient to generate further labor market\nimprovement and a return of inflation to 2 percent, even following the reduction in policy\naccommodation. As I have already noted, I currently judge that U.S. economic growth is likely\nto be sufficient over the next year or two to result in further improvement in the labor market.\nOngoing gains in the labor market, coupled with my judgment that longer-term inflation\nexpectations remain reasonably well anchored, serve to bolster my confidence in a return of\ninflation to 2 percent as the disinflationary effects of declines in energy and import prices wane.\nCommittee participants recognize that the future course of the economy is uncertain, and\nwe take account of both the upside and downside risks around our projections when judging the\nappropriate stance of monetary policy. In particular, recent monetary policy decisions have\nreflected our recognition that, with the federal funds rate near zero, we can respond more readily\nto upside surprises to inflation, economic growth, and employment than to downside shocks.\nThis asymmetry suggests that it is appropriate to be more cautious in raising our target for the\nfederal funds rate than would be the case if short-term nominal interest rates were appreciably\nabove zero. Reflecting these concerns, we have maintained our current policy stance even as the\nlabor market has improved appreciably.\nHowever, we must also take into account the well-documented lags in the effects of\nmonetary policy. Were the FOMC to delay the start of policy normalization for too long, we\nwould likely end up having to tighten policy relatively abruptly to keep the economy from\nsignificantly overshooting both of our goals. Such an abrupt tightening would risk disrupting\n\n\f-5 financial markets and perhaps even inadvertently push the economy into recession. Moreover,\nholding the federal funds rate at its current level for too long could also encourage excessive\nrisk-taking and thus undermine financial stability.\nOn balance, economic and financial information received since our October meeting has\nbeen consistent with our expectation of continued improvement in the labor market. And, as I\nhave noted, continuing improvement in the labor market helps strengthen our confidence that\ninflation will move back to our 2 percent objective over the medium term. That said, between\ntoday and the next FOMC meeting, we will receive additional data that bear on the economic\noutlook. These data include a range of indicators regarding the labor market, inflation, and\neconomic activity. When my colleagues and I meet, we will assess all of the available data and\ntheir implications for the economic outlook in making our policy decision.\nAs you know, there has been considerable focus on the first increase in the federal funds\nrate after nearly seven years in which that rate was at its effective lower bound. We have tried to\nbe as clear as possible about the considerations that will affect that decision. Of course, even\nafter the initial increase in the federal funds rate, monetary policy will remain accommodative.\nAnd it bears emphasizing that what matters for the economic outlook are expectations\nconcerning the path of the federal funds rate over time: It is those expectations that affect\nfinancial conditions and thereby influence spending and investment decisions. In this regard, the\nCommittee anticipates that even after employment and inflation are near mandate-consistent\nlevels, economic conditions may, for some time, warrant keeping the target federal funds rate\nbelow levels the Committee views as normal in the longer run.\n\n\f-6 Summary\nIn closing, the economy has come a long way toward the FOMC’s objectives of\nmaximum employment and price stability. When the Committee begins to normalize the stance\nof policy, doing so will be a testament, also, to how far our economy has come in recovering\nfrom the effects of the financial crisis and the Great Recession. In that sense, it is a day that I\nexpect we all are looking forward to.\nThank you. I would be pleased to take your questions.\n\n\f"

Yellen\nChair\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\nThe Economic Club of Washington\nWashington, D.C.\n\nDecember 2, 2015\n\n\fThank you to the Economic Club of Washington for inviting me to speak to you\ntoday. I would like to offer my assessment of the U.S. economy, nearly six and half\nyears after the beginning of the current economic expansion, and my view of the\neconomic outlook. I will describe the progress the economy has made toward the Federal\nOpen Market Committee’s (FOMC) goals of maximum employment and stable prices\nand what the current situation and the outlook imply for how monetary policy is likely to\nevolve to best foster the attainment of those objectives.\nThe Economic Outlook\nThe U.S. economy has recovered substantially since the Great Recession. The\nunemployment rate, which peaked at 10 percent in October 2009, declined to 5 percent in\nOctober of this year. At that level, the unemployment rate is near the median of FOMC\nparticipants’ most recent estimates of its longer-run normal level.1 The economy has\ncreated about 13 million jobs since the low point for employment in early 2010, and total\nnonfarm payrolls are now almost 4-1/2 million higher than just prior to the recession.\nMost recently, after a couple months of relatively modest payroll growth, employers\nadded an estimated 271,000 jobs in October. This increase brought the average monthly\ngain since June to about 195,000--close to the monthly pace of around 210,000 in the first\nhalf of the year and still sufficient to be consistent with continued improvement in the\nlabor market.\nDespite these substantial gains, we cannot yet, in my judgment, declare that the\nlabor market has reached full employment. Let me describe the basis for that view.\n\n1\n\nSee table 1 in the Summary of Economic Projections, an addendum to the minutes of the September 2015\nFOMC meeting. See Board of Governors (2015b).\n\n\f-2 To begin with, I believe that a significant number of individuals now classified as\nout of the labor force would find and accept jobs in an even stronger labor market. To be\nclassified as unemployed, working-age people must report that they have actively sought\nwork within the past four weeks. Most of those not seeking work are appropriately not\ncounted as unemployed. These include most retirees, teenagers and young adults in\nschool, and those staying home to care for children and other dependent family members.\nEven in a stronger job market, it is likely that many of these individuals would choose not\nto work.\nBut some who are counted as out of the labor force might be induced to seek work\nif the likelihood of finding a job rose or if the expected pay was higher. Examples here\ninclude people who had become too discouraged to search for work when the prospects\nfor employment were poor and some who retired when their previous jobs ended. In\nOctober, almost 2 million individuals classified as outside the labor force because they\nhad not searched for work in the previous four weeks reported that they wanted and were\navailable for work. This is a considerable number of people, and some of them\nundoubtedly would be drawn back into the workforce as the labor market continued to\nstrengthen. Likewise, some of those who report they don’t want to work now could\nchange their minds in a stronger job market.\nAnother margin of labor market slack not reflected in the unemployment rate\nconsists of individuals who report that they are working part time but would prefer a fulltime job and cannot find one--those classified as “part time for economic reasons.” The\nshare of such workers jumped from 3 percent of total employment prior to the Great\nRecession to around 6-1/2 percent by 2010. Since then, however, the share of these part\n\n\f-3 time workers has fallen considerably and now is less than 4 percent of those employed.\nWhile this decline represents considerable progress, particularly given secular trends that\nover time may have increased the prevalence of part-time employment, I think some\nroom remains for the hours of these workers to increase as the labor market improves\nfurther.\nThe pace of increases in labor compensation provides another possible indicator,\nalbeit an imperfect one, of the degree of labor market slack. Until recently labor\ncompensation had grown only modestly, at average annual rates of around 2 to 2-1/2\npercent. More recently, however, we have seen a welcome pickup in the growth rate of\naverage hourly earnings for all employees and of compensation per hour in the business\nsector. While it is too soon to conclude whether these more rapid rates of increase will\ncontinue, a sustained pickup would likely signal a diminution of labor market slack.\nTurning to overall economic activity, U.S. economic output--as measured by\ninflation-adjusted gross domestic product (GDP), or real GDP--has increased at a\nmoderate pace, on balance, during the expansion. Over the first three quarters of this\nyear, real GDP is currently estimated to have advanced at an annual rate of 2-1/4 percent,\nclose to its average pace over the previous five years. Many economic forecasters expect\ngrowth roughly along those same lines in the fourth quarter.\nGrowth this year has been held down by weak net exports, which have subtracted\nmore than 1/2 percentage point, on average, from the annual rate of real GDP growth\nover the past three quarters. Foreign economic growth has slowed, damping increases in\nU.S. exports, and the U.S. dollar has appreciated substantially since the middle of last\nyear, making our exports more expensive and imported goods cheaper.\n\n\f-4 By contrast, total real private domestic final purchases (PDFP)--which includes\nhousehold spending, business fixed investment, and residential investment, and currently\nrepresents about 85 percent of aggregate spending--has increased at an annual rate of\n3 percent this year, significantly faster than real GDP. Household spending growth has\nbeen particularly solid in 2015, with purchases of new motor vehicles especially strong.\nJob growth has bolstered household income, and lower energy prices have left consumers\nwith more to spend on other goods and services. These same factors likely have\ncontributed to consumer confidence that is more upbeat this year than last year. Increases\nin home values and stock market prices in recent years, along with reductions in debt,\nhave pushed up the net worth of households, which also supports consumer spending.\nFinally, interest rates for borrowers remain low, due in part to the FOMC’s\naccommodative monetary policy, and these low rates appear to have been especially\nrelevant for consumers considering the purchase of durable goods.2\nOther components of PDFP, including residential and business investment, have\nalso advanced this year. The same factors supporting consumer spending have supported\nfurther gains in the housing sector. Indeed, gains in real residential investment spending\nhave been faster so far in 2015 than last year, although the level of new residential\nconstruction still remains fairly low. And outside of the drilling and mining sector, where\nlower oil prices have led to substantial cuts in outlays for new structures, business\ninvestment spending has posted moderate gains.\nOn balance, the moderate average pace of real GDP growth so far this year and\nover the entire expansion has been sufficient to help move the labor market closer to the\n\n2\n\nFor a recent empirical assessment, see Johnson, Pence, and Vine (2014).\n\n\f-5 FOMC’s goal of maximum employment. However, less progress has been made on the\nsecond leg of our dual mandate--price stability--as inflation continues to run below the\nFOMC’s longer-run objective of 2 percent. Overall consumer price inflation--as\nmeasured by the change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures--was\nonly 1/4 percent over the 12 months ending in October. However, this number largely\nreflects the sharp fall in crude oil prices since the summer of 2014 that, in turn, has\npushed down retail prices for gasoline and other consumer energy products. Because\nfood and energy prices are volatile, it is often helpful to look at inflation excluding those\ntwo categories--known as core inflation--which is typically a better indicator of future\noverall inflation than recent readings of headline inflation. But core inflation--which ran\nat 1-1/4 percent over the 12 months ending in October--is also well below our 2 percent\nobjective, partly reflecting the appreciation of the U.S. dollar. The stronger dollar has\npushed down the prices of imported goods, placing temporary downward pressure on\ncore inflation.3 The plunge in crude oil prices may also have had some small indirect\neffects in holding down the prices of non-energy items in core inflation, as producers\npassed on to their customers some of the reductions in their energy-related costs. Taking\naccount of these effects, which may be holding down core inflation by around 1/4 to\n1/2 percentage point, it appears that the underlying rate of inflation in the United States\nhas been running in the vicinity of 1-1/2 to 1-3/4 percent.\nLet me now turn to where I see the economy is likely headed over the next several\nyears. To summarize, I anticipate continued economic growth at a moderate pace that\nwill be sufficient to generate additional increases in employment, further reductions in\n\n3\n\nFor a more detailed discussion of the recent behavior of inflation, see Yellen (2015).\n\n\f-6 the remaining margins of labor market slack, and a rise in inflation to our 2 percent\nobjective. I expect that the fundamental factors supporting domestic spending that I have\nenumerated today will continue to do so, while the drag from some of the factors that\nhave been weighing on economic growth should begin to lessen next year. Although the\neconomic outlook, as always, is uncertain, I currently see the risks to the outlook for\neconomic activity and the labor market as very close to balanced.\nTurning to the factors that have been holding down growth, as I already noted, the\nhigher foreign exchange value of the dollar, as well as weak growth in some foreign\neconomies, has restrained the demand for U.S. exports over the past year. In addition,\nlower crude oil prices have reduced activity in the domestic oil sector. I anticipate that\nthe drag on U.S. economic growth from these factors will diminish in the next couple of\nyears as the global economy improves and the adjustment to prior declines in oil prices is\ncompleted.\nAlthough developments in foreign economies still pose risks to U.S. economic\ngrowth that we are monitoring, these downside risks from abroad have lessened since late\nsummer. Among emerging market economies, recent data support the view that the\nslowdown in the Chinese economy, which has received considerable attention, will likely\ncontinue to be modest and gradual. China has taken actions to stimulate its economy this\nyear and could do more if necessary. A number of other emerging market economies\nhave eased monetary and fiscal policy this year, and economic activity in these\neconomies has improved of late. Accommodative monetary policy is also supporting\neconomic growth in the advanced economies. A pickup in demand in many advanced\n\n\f-7 economies and a stabilization in commodity prices should, in turn, boost the growth\nprospects of emerging market economies.\nA final positive development for the outlook that I will mention relates to fiscal\npolicy. This year the effect of federal fiscal policy on real GDP growth has been roughly\nneutral, in contrast to earlier years in which the expiration of stimulus programs and\nfiscal policy actions to reduce the federal budget deficit created significant drags on\ngrowth.4 Also, the budget situation for many state and local governments has improved\nas the economic expansion has increased the revenues of these governments, allowing\nthem to increase their hiring and spending after a number of years of cuts in the wake of\nthe Great Recession. Looking ahead, I anticipate that total real government purchases of\ngoods and services should have a modest positive effect on economic growth over the\nnext few years.5\nRegarding U.S. inflation, I anticipate that the drag from the large declines in\nprices for crude oil and imports over the past year and a half will diminish next year.\nWith less downward pressure on inflation from these factors and some upward pressure\nfrom a further tightening in U.S. labor and product markets, I expect inflation to move up\nto the FOMC’s 2 percent objective over the next few years. Of course, inflation\nexpectations play an important role in the inflation process, and my forecast of a return to\nour 2 percent objective over the medium term relies on a judgment that longer-term\ninflation expectations remain reasonably well anchored. In this regard, recent measures\n\n4\n\nThe Congressional Budget Office estimates that current federal fiscal policies will have little effect on\neconomic growth this year, but that earlier fiscal policy actions reduced the rate of real GDP growth\nroughly 1-1/2 percentage points in 2013 and about 1/4 percentage point in 2014 relative to what it would\nhave been otherwise. See Congressional Budget Office (2015a).\n5\nSee Congressional Budget Office (2015b).\n\n\f-8 from the Survey of Professional Forecasters, the Blue Chip Economic Indicators, and the\nSurvey of Primary Dealers have continued to be generally stable. The measure of longerterm inflation expectations from the University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers, in\ncontrast, has lately edged below its typical range in recent years. However, this measure\noften seems to respond modestly, though temporarily, to large changes in actual inflation,\nand the very low readings on headline inflation over the past year may help explain some\nof the recent decline in the Michigan measure.6 Market-based measures of inflation\ncompensation have moved up some in recent weeks after declining to historically low\nlevels earlier in the fall. While the low level of these measures appears to reflect, at least\nin part, changes in risk and liquidity premiums, we will continue to monitor this\ndevelopment closely. Convincing evidence that longer-term inflation expectations have\nmoved lower would be a concern because declines in consumer and business expectations\nabout inflation could put downward pressure on actual inflation, making the attainment of\nour 2 percent inflation goal more difficult.\nMonetary Policy\nLet me now turn to the implications of the economic outlook for monetary policy.\nReflecting progress toward the Committee’s objectives, many FOMC participants\nindicated in September that they anticipated, in light of their economic forecasts at the\ntime, that it would be appropriate to raise the target range for the federal funds rate by the\nend of this year. Some participants projected that it would be appropriate to wait until\nlater to raise the target funds rate range, but all agreed that the timing of a rate increase\n\n6\n\nFor example, the University of Michigan survey measure of longer-term inflation expectations was\ntemporarily elevated relative to its usual range in 2008 when crude oil and other commodity prices spiked\nand pushed up actual headline inflation for a time.\n\n\f-9 would depend on what the incoming data tell us about the economic outlook and the\nassociated risks to that outlook.\nIn the policy statement issued after its October meeting, the FOMC reaffirmed its\njudgment that it would be appropriate to increase the target range for the federal funds\nrate when we had seen some further improvement in the labor market and were\nreasonably confident that inflation would move back to the Committee’s 2 percent\nobjective over the medium term. That initial rate increase would reflect the Committee’s\njudgment, based on a range of indicators, that the economy would continue to grow at a\npace sufficient to generate further labor market improvement and a return of inflation to\n2 percent, even after the reduction in policy accommodation. As I have already noted, I\ncurrently judge that U.S. economic growth is likely to be sufficient over the next year or\ntwo to result in further improvement in the labor market. Ongoing gains in the labor\nmarket, coupled with my judgment that longer-term inflation expectations remain\nreasonably well anchored, serve to bolster my confidence in a return of inflation to\n2 percent as the disinflationary effects of declines in energy and import prices wane.\nCommittee participants recognize that the future course of the economy is\nuncertain, and we take account of both the upside and downside risks around our\nprojections when judging the appropriate stance of monetary policy. In particular, recent\nmonetary policy decisions have reflected our recognition that, with the federal funds rate\nnear zero, we can respond more readily to upside surprises to inflation, economic growth,\nand employment than to downside shocks. This asymmetry suggests that it is appropriate\nto be more cautious in raising our target for the federal funds rate than would be the case\n\n\f- 10 if short-term nominal interest rates were appreciably above zero.7 Reflecting these\nconcerns, we have maintained our current policy stance even as the labor market has\nimproved appreciably.\nHowever, we must also take into account the well-documented lags in the effects\nof monetary policy.8 Were the FOMC to delay the start of policy normalization for too\nlong, we would likely end up having to tighten policy relatively abruptly to keep the\neconomy from significantly overshooting both of our goals. Such an abrupt tightening\nwould risk disrupting financial markets and perhaps even inadvertently push the economy\ninto recession. Moreover, holding the federal funds rate at its current level for too long\ncould also encourage excessive risk-taking and thus undermine financial stability.\nOn balance, economic and financial information received since our October\nmeeting has been consistent with our expectations of continued improvement in the labor\nmarket. And, as I have noted, continuing improvement in the labor market helps\nstrengthen confidence that inflation will move back to our 2 percent objective over the\nmedium term. That said, between today and the next FOMC meeting, we will receive\nadditional data that bear on the economic outlook. These data include a range of\nindicators regarding the labor market, inflation, and economic activity. When my\ncolleagues and I meet, we will assess all of the available data and their implications for\nthe economic outlook in making our policy decision.\n\n7\n\nSee, for example, Adam and Billi (2007), Nakata (2012), and Evans and others (2015).\nMilton Friedman famously concluded that “monetary actions affect economic conditions only after a lag\nthat is both long and variable” (1961, p. 447). Evidence that monetary policy affects inflation with a lag\ncomes in part from vector autoregressions in which monetary policy shocks have been identified under a\nvariety of identification assumptions. See, for example, Christiano, Eichenbaum and Evans (2005) and\nUhlig (2005).\n\n8\n\n\f- 11 As you know, there has been considerable focus on the first increase in the federal\nfunds rate after nearly seven years in which that rate has been at its effective lower\nbound. We have tried to be as clear as possible about the considerations that will affect\nthat decision. Of course, even after the initial increase in the federal funds rate, monetary\npolicy will remain accommodative. And it bears emphasizing that what matters for the\neconomic outlook are the public’s expectations concerning the path of the federal funds\nrate over time: It is those expectations that affect financial conditions and thereby\ninfluence spending and investment decisions. In this regard, the Committee anticipates\nthat even after employment and inflation are near mandate-consistent levels, economic\nconditions may, for some time, warrant keeping the target federal funds rate below levels\nthe Committee views as normal in the longer run.\nThis expectation is consistent with an implicit assessment that the neutral nominal\nfederal funds rate--defined as the value of the federal funds rate that would be neither\nexpansionary nor contractionary if the economy were operating near its potential--is\ncurrently low by historical standards and is likely to rise only gradually over time. One\nindication that the neutral funds rate is unusually low is that U.S. economic growth has\nbeen quite modest in recent years despite the very low level of the federal funds rate and\nthe Federal Reserve’s very large holdings of longer-term securities. Had the neutral rate\nbeen running closer to the levels that are thought to have prevailed prior to the financial\ncrisis, current monetary policy settings would have been expected to foster a very rapid\neconomic expansion, with inflation likely rising significantly above our 2 percent\nobjective.\n\n\f- 12 Empirical support for the judgment that the neutral federal funds rate is low\ncomes from both academic research and Federal Reserve staff analysis. Figure 1\nemploys four macroeconomic models used by Federal Reserve staff to estimate the\n“natural” real rate of interest, a concept closely related to the neutral rate.9 The measures\nof the natural rate shown in this figure represent the real short-term interest rate that\nwould prevail in the absence of frictions that slow the adjustment of wages and prices to\nchanges in the economy; under a variety of assumptions, this interest rate has been shown\nto promote full employment.10 The shaded blue band represents the range of the\nestimates of the natural real rate at each point in time. This analysis suggests that the\nnatural real rate fell sharply with the onset of the crisis and has recovered only partially.\nThese findings are broadly consistent with those reported in a paper by Thomas Laubach\nand John Williams, shown in figure 2.11\n\n9\n\nNote that these estimates are in real terms; to obtain estimates of the nominal natural interest rate, one\nwould add a measure of expected inflation. The four models used are (1) a dynamic stochastic general\nequilibrium (DSGE) model developed by the staff of the Federal Reserve Board and described in Kiley\n(2013); (2) a DSGE model developed by the staff of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and described\nin Del Negro and others (2013); (3) a DSGE model developed by the staff of the Federal Reserve Board\nbased on Christiano, Motto, and Rostagno (2014); and (4) a DSGE model developed by the staff of the\nFederal Reserve Board based on Guerrieri and Iacoviello (2013 [rev. 2014]).\n10\nThe concept of the natural rate goes back to Wicksell, who defined it as the rate that “tends neither to\nraise nor to lower” (1936 [1898], p. 102) commodity prices. Wicksell posited that the natural rate would be\nequal to the real interest rate that would balance supply and demand absent monetary frictions. The recent\nacademic literature draws on this notion to define the natural rate as the real interest rate that would prevail\nin the absence of sluggish adjustment in nominal prices and wages. In simple models, this interest rate\nwould result in stable prices and full employment; in some more complex models, this interest rate has\nbeen found to promote stable inflation and appropriate economic activity, although monetary policymakers\nface important tradeoffs in such settings. Importantly, the natural rate varies over time. For example, it\ngenerally rises with expected productivity growth and with “preference shocks” that capture households’\ndesire to consume today rather than save. For further discussion of the potential usefulness of the natural\nrate for monetary policy, see, for example, Barsky, Justiniano, and Melosi (2014) and Cúrdia and others\n(2015). By contrast, Laubach and Williams (2015) employ a statistical approach that defines the natural\nrate as one consistent with the economy operating at its full potential once transitory shocks to aggregate\nsupply and demand have abated. These two approaches to the measurement of the natural real rate are\ndifferent but have important similarities. Qualitatively, the two measures would be expected to move\ntogether in response to shocks to productivity growth and preferences so long as those shocks were very\npersistent.\n11\nSee Laubach and Williams (2015).\n\n\f- 13 The marked decline in the neutral federal funds rate after the crisis may be\npartially attributable to a range of persistent economic headwinds that have weighed on\naggregate demand. These headwinds have included tighter underwriting standards and\nlimited access to credit for some borrowers, deleveraging by many households to reduce\ndebt burdens, contractionary fiscal policy at all levels of government, weak growth\nabroad coupled with a significant appreciation of the dollar, slower productivity and labor\nforce growth, and elevated uncertainty about the economic outlook.12 As the restraint\nfrom these headwinds further abates, I anticipate that the neutral federal funds rate will\ngradually move higher over time. Indeed, in September, most FOMC participants\nprojected that, in the long run, the nominal federal funds rate would be near 3.5 percent,\nand that the actual federal funds rate would rise to that level fairly slowly.13\nBecause the value of the neutral federal funds rate is not directly measureable and\nmust be estimated based on our imperfect understanding of the economy and the\navailable data, I would stress that considerable uncertainty attends our estimates of its\ncurrent level and even more to its likely path going forward.14 That said, we will learn\n\n12\n\nFor analyses of how a sudden tightening in access to credit can lead to household deleveraging, pushing\ndown the neutral rate of interest, see Eggertsson and Krugman (2012) and Guerrieri and Lorenzoni (2015).\n13\nSee figure 2 in the Summary of Economic Projections, an addendum to the minutes of the September\n2015 FOMC meeting. See Board of Governors (2015b). The longer-run normal level of the federal funds\nrate reported in the SEP presumably matches participants’ assessment of the neutral nominal federal funds\nrate that will prevail in the longer run. Between June 2012 and September 2015 the median of FOMC\nparticipants’ estimates of the longer-run level of the federal funds rate declined 75 basis points, to 3.5\npercent. When revising down their estimates of the longer-run federal funds rate, participants have\ngenerally cited a lower assessment of the economy’s longer-run potential growth rate as a contributing\nfactor.\n14\nOne source of uncertainty regarding the neutral federal funds rate is so-called model uncertainty. As\nshown in figure 1, a variety of models that provide plausible descriptions of the economy give somewhat\ndifferent estimates of the neutral rate. A second source of uncertainty is the limited sample size of relevant\nmacroeconomic data: Our estimates of the neutral federal funds rate represent inferences about a moving\ntarget. As a result, although the data provide important signals about the neutral rate, our estimates are\nnecessarily imprecise. In Laubach and Williams (2003), for example, the standard error of the estimate of\nthe neutral rate in one baseline model was about 2 percentage points on average. Moreover, one-sided\n\n\f- 14 more from observing economic developments in the period ahead. It is thereby important\nto emphasize that the actual path of monetary policy will depend on how incoming data\naffect the evolution of the economic outlook. Stronger growth or a more rapid increase in\ninflation than we currently anticipate would suggest that the neutral federal funds rate is\nrising more quickly than expected, making it appropriate to raise the federal funds rate\nmore quickly as well; conversely, if the economy disappoints, the federal funds rate\nwould likely rise more slowly. Given the persistent shortfall in inflation from our\n2 percent objective, the Committee will, of course, carefully monitor actual progress\ntoward our inflation goal as we make decisions over time on the appropriate path for the\nfederal funds rate.\nIn closing, let me again thank the Economic Club of Washington for this\nopportunity to speak about the economy and monetary policy. The economy has come a\nlong way toward the FOMC’s objectives of maximum employment and price stability.\nWhen the Committee begins to normalize the stance of policy, doing so will be a\ntestament, also, to how far our economy has come in recovering from the effects of the\nfinancial crisis and the Great Recession. In that sense, it is a day that I expect we all are\nlooking forward to.\n\nestimates of the neutral rate--those available to policymakers, based only on data known at the time--are\ngenerally noisier than estimates of the neutral rate at some previous time that incorporate all the data\navailable.\n\n\f- 15 References\nAdam, Klaus, and Roberto M.

Yellen\nChair\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\n“Monetary Policy Implementation and Transmission in the Post-Crisis Period,”\na research conference sponsored by\nthe Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nWashington, D.C.\n\nNovember 12, 2015\n\n\fIt is my pleasure to welcome you to the Federal Reserve Board’s conference on\n“Monetary Policy Implementation and Transmission in the Post-Crisis Period.” The\nconference aims to bring together academic and central bank economists, financial\nmarket practitioners, and policymakers to stimulate debate and research on a topic that is\ncritically important to the Federal Reserve’s mission of conducting monetary policy in\nthe pursuit of maximum employment and stable prices.\nThe global financial crisis had profound effects on our economy, and it altered the\nway many think about monetary policy. At the peak of the crisis and during its\nimmediate aftermath, unconventional monetary policy measures were designed and\nimplemented by the Federal Reserve and other central banks around the world. The postcrisis period has offered policymakers an opportunity to assess a range of novel policy\nand operational issues associated with the conduct of monetary policy and the\neffectiveness of different policy options. Specifically, policymakers have to carefully\nweigh the advantages and disadvantages of alternative monetary implementation\nframeworks in the presence of new policy tools. Moreover, policymakers should be\nmindful of new channels for monetary policy transmission that may have emerged from\nthe intricate economic and financial linkages in our global economy that were revealed\nby the crisis. Finally, it is crucial to understand the effect of regulations and possible\nchanges in financial intermediation on monetary policy implementation and transmission.\nThe impressive conference program covers the following topics in three sessions:\nmonetary policy implementation, the transmission of monetary policy, and the effect of\nregulation and financial intermediation on monetary policy implementation and\ntransmission. The presentations and discussions of the 12 academic papers on the\n\n\f-2 conference program will surely provide a foundation for what I expect will be a\nstimulating discussion of important topics over the next two days.\nLooking ahead to later today, I am delighted that Vice Chairman Fischer will\ndeliver keynote remarks on the exchange rate mechanism in the transmission of monetary\npolicy. Tomorrow the conference concludes with two interesting policy panels on the\neffect of regulations on monetary policy and the “optimal design” of monetary policy in\nthe post-crisis world.\nLet me also say that I consider the topics covered during this conference highly\nrelevant for the Federal Reserve System’s ongoing efforts to evaluate potential long-run\nmonetary policy implementation frameworks and to assess a number of issues related to\nthe consideration of alternative frameworks. I hope the work and ideas presented and\ndiscussed over the next two days will spur subsequent research on these issues and\npromote further collaboration among all of you.\nAs I have often stressed before, in addition to its responsibilities for monetary\npolicy and financial regulation and supervision, the Federal Reserve takes very seriously\nits role as a research institution. I want to thank our research conference committee for\nputting together this high-caliber research conference, which has gathered distinguished\nspeakers and guests from around the world and, I am sure, will add to our understanding\nof the implementation and transmission of monetary policy.\nWelcome to the Federal Reserve Board. I hope you all have enjoyable and\nproductive discussions over the next two days.\n\n\f"

            "content": "For release on delivery\n10:00 a.m. EST\nNovember 4, 2015\n\nStatement by\nJanet L. Yellen\nChair\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nbefore the\nCommittee on Financial Services\nU.S. House of Representatives\nNovember 4, 2015\n\n\fChairman Hensarling, Ranking Member Waters, and other members of the committee, I\nappreciate the opportunity to testify on the Federal Reserve’s regulation and supervision of\nfinancial institutions. One of our most fundamental goals is to promote a financial system that is\nstrong, resilient, and able to serve a healthy and growing economy. We work to ensure the safety\nand soundness of the firms we supervise and also to ensure that they comply with applicable\nconsumer protection laws, so that they may, even when faced with stressful financial conditions,\ncontinue serving consumers, businesses, and communities.\nAt today’s hearing, I would like to discuss the lessons of the financial crisis and how we\nhave transformed our regulatory and supervisory approach. Before the crisis, our primary goal\nwas to ensure the safety and soundness of individual financial institutions. A key shortcoming of\nthat approach was that we did not focus sufficiently on shared vulnerabilities across firms or the\nsystemic consequences of the distress or failure of the largest, most complex firms. In the fall of\n2008, the failure or near-failure of several of these firms--many of which we did not supervise at\nthe time--sparked a panic that engulfed the financial system and much of the economy.\nToday we aim to regulate and supervise financial firms in a manner that promotes the\nstability of the financial system as a whole. This shift in focus has led to a comprehensive\nchange in our regulation and supervision of large financial institutions. As I will discuss in more\ndetail, we have introduced a series of requirements for large banking organizations that reduce\nthe risks to the system and our economy that could result from the failure or distress of these\ninstitutions. In addition, we have made changes in our supervision that now allow us to\nsupervise large financial institutions on a more coordinated, forward-looking basis.\nAt the same time, we have been careful to make more-measured changes in our approach\nto regulating and supervising firms at the other end of the spectrum. Smaller institutions did not\n\n\f-2emerge from the financial crisis unscathed, and we have identified several areas in which the\nsupervision of these institutions can be strengthened. At the same time, we are well aware that\nregulatory and compliance costs can impose a burden that is disproportionate to the risks these\ninstitutions pose to taxpayers and financial stability. We are committed to ensuring that the\nsupervision of smaller institutions is tailored appropriately to their risk.\nStrengthening the Regulation and Supervision of the Largest Financial Institutions\nRegulatory Framework\nThe regulatory reforms we have adopted since the crisis have been designed to address\nthe risks posed by large financial institutions in one of two ways. First, our reforms are designed\nto reduce the probability that large financial institutions will fail by requiring those institutions to\nmake themselves more resilient to stress. However, we recognize that we cannot eliminate the\npossibility of a large financial institution’s failure. Therefore, a second aim of our post-crisis\nreforms has been to limit the systemic damage that would result if a large financial institution\ndoes fail. This effort has involved taking steps to help ensure that authorities would have the\nability to resolve a failed firm in an orderly manner while its critical operations continue to\nfunction.\nTo reduce the probability of a large financial institution’s failure, we and the other federal\nbanking agencies have implemented a series of reforms that strengthen the firms we regulate.\nWe have implemented capital rules that require large banking organizations to hold substantially\nlarger amounts of high-quality capital. Working with the other federal banking agencies, we also\nhave adopted a liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) rule that requires large banking organizations to\nhold a buffer of high-quality liquid assets sufficient to meet net liquidity outflows during a\nperiod of severe stress. In addition, the Board has established a broader set of enhanced\n\n\f-3prudential standards for large domestic and foreign banking organizations pursuant to\nsection 165 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank\nAct), which includes risk-based and leverage capital requirements, liquidity standards, riskmanagement requirements, and stress testing. 1\nWe have also adopted risk-based and leverage capital surcharges for the handful of U.S.\nfirms that we have identified as global systemically important banking organizations (GSIBs),\nwhich require these firms to hold larger amounts of loss-absorbing capital than other firms. 2 The\nU.S. GSIBs are central intermediaries in U.S. financial markets, and their failure or distress\nwould thus likely cause the most harm to the financial system. Under the framework that the\nBoard adopted this summer, a GSIB’s risk-based capital surcharge would reflect the effect that\nits failure would have on the financial system. In effect, the risk-based capital surcharge\nconfronts each U.S. GSIB with a choice: It can hold more capital, or it can reduce its systemic\nfootprint. Although similar to the international risk-based capital surcharge framework that we\nhelped design, the rule adopted by the Board is calibrated at a level that requires U.S. GSIBs to\nhold significantly more capital than would be required under the international framework. A\nsecond important difference between the Board’s rule and the international framework is that the\nBoard’s rule incorporates a measure of each GSIB’s use of short-term wholesale funding, which\nis a key determinant of a GSIB’s systemic footprint.\nTo limit the systemic effect of a large financial institution’s failure, the Board and the\nFederal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) have adopted a resolution plan rule that requires\n\n1\n\nThe enhanced prudential standards we have established require foreign banking organizations with large U.S.\noperations to organize their U.S. subsidiaries under an intermediate holding company. This intermediate holding\ncompany requirement provides a basis for regulating and supervising the U.S. operations of foreign banking\norganizations on a more robust and consistent basis.\n2\nThe firms currently identified as U.S. GSIBs are Bank of America Corporation; The Bank of New York Mellon\nCorporation; Citigroup, Inc.; The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.; JPMorgan Chase & Co.; Morgan Stanley; State Street\nCorporation; and Wells Fargo & Company.\n\n\f-4large banking organizations to show how they could be resolved in an orderly manner under the\nbankruptcy code.\nLast week the Board proposed another reform that would establish long-term debt and\ntotal loss-absorbing capacity (TLAC) requirements for U.S. GSIBs. We see these requirements\nas critical to avoiding the choice that authorities faced in the most recent crisis between bailing\nout large financial firms and allowing those firms to fail in a manner that would impose large\ncosts on the broader economy. With the new requirements, if losses were to wipe out a firm’s\ncapital and push a firm into resolution, a sufficient amount of long-term unsecured debt would\nprovide a mechanism for absorbing additional losses and recapitalizing the firm without\ngenerating contagion across the financial system and damaging the economy. In effect, this\nrequirement provides a means for “bailing in” a firm’s long-term debt holders so that a taxpayer\nbailout will be unnecessary. These requirements also should improve market discipline by\nensuring that each GSIB has a class of creditors with clear incentive to monitor the firm’s risktaking.\nSupervisory Approach\nIn addition to strengthening the regulation of the largest, most complex financial\ninstitutions, we have also transformed our supervision of these firms. Our work is now more\nforward looking and multidisciplinary, drawing on a wide range of staff expertise. We put this\nnew approach into operation with the creation of the Large Institution Supervision Coordinating\nCommittee (LISCC). The LISCC is charged with the supervision of the firms that pose elevated\nrisk to U.S. financial stability. Those firms include the eight U.S. banking organizations that\nhave been identified as GSIBs, four foreign banking organizations with large and complex U.S.\noperations, and the four nonbank financial institutions that have been designated as systemically\n\n\f-5important by the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC). 3 The supervisory approach\nembodied in the LISCC differs from our more traditional approach to supervision in that it is\noriented toward both the safety and soundness of the individual firms, and the stability of the\nfinancial system as a whole. 4\nThe LISCC program is distinguished by several characteristics. First, the LISCC, led by\nthe Board’s director of the Division of Banking Supervision and Regulation, has implemented a\nmore centralized, multidisciplinary supervisory approach by bringing together experts from\naround the Federal Reserve System in the areas of supervision, research, legal counsel, financial\nmarkets, and payments systems. Second, the LISCC takes a forward-looking approach by\nfocusing on capital and liquidity resiliency under normal and potentially adverse conditions in\nthe future as well as governance and recovery and resolution preparedness. And, third, the\nLISCC complements traditional, firm-specific supervisory work with annual “horizontal”\nprograms that examine the same firms at the same time and on the same set of issues in order to\npromote better monitoring of trends and consistency of assessments across all of the LISCC\nfirms. The Federal Reserve conducts three major horizontal reviews of the LISCC banking firms\neach year that are focused on capital adequacy, liquidity resiliency, and preparedness for\nrecovery and resolution.\nWith regard to capital adequacy, the Federal Reserve’s Comprehensive Capital Analysis\nand Review (CCAR) is designed to ensure that large U.S. bank holding companies, including the\nLISCC firms, have rigorous, forward-looking capital planning processes and have sufficient\n\n3\n\nThe foreign banking organizations whose U.S. operations are currently supervised as part of the LISCC program\nare Barclays PLC, Credit Suisse Group AG, Deutsche Bank AG, and UBS AG. The firms designated by the FSOC\nfor supervision by the Federal Reserve are American International Group, Inc.; General Electric Capital\nCorporation, Inc.; MetLife, Inc.; and Prudential Financial, Inc.\n4\nFurther information on the LISCC, including a full list of the supervised firms, is available on the Board’s website\nat www.federalreserve.gov/bankinforeg/large-institution-supervision.htm.\n\n\f-6levels of capital to operate through times of stress, as defined by the Federal Reserve’s\nsupervisory stress scenario. The program enables us to make a quantitative and qualitative\nassessment of the resilience and capital planning abilities of the largest banking firms on an\nannual basis and to limit capital distributions for firms that exhibit weaknesses.\nWith regard to liquidity resiliency, under the Federal Reserve’s Comprehensive Liquidity\nAnalysis and Review (CLAR), LISCC firms are subject to a comprehensive review of their\nliquidity positions and liquidity risk management, including internal stress-testing practices.\nFirms with weak liquidity positions or practices are directed to improve those practices and\naugment their liquidity positions as needed. Similar to CCAR, CLAR is designed to ensure that\nLISCC firms have rigorous, forward-looking liquidity stress testing and risk-management\npractices that account for unique risks, and that the LISCC firms maintain sufficient liquidity to\ncontinue to operate through a period of acute stress. The program allows the Federal Reserve to\ncompare the range of practices across firms and form a view on liquidity vulnerabilities and\nfunding concentrations in the system as a whole. Unlike CCAR, which currently applies to all\nfirms with $50 billion or more in total assets, only firms within the LISCC portfolio are required\nto participate in CLAR.\nLISCC firms are also subject to an annual review of their recovery and resolution\npreparedness. The program evaluates progress in implementing operational capabilities and\nlegal entity rationalization that would facilitate recovery or resolution under a range of scenarios\nand provides the Federal Reserve with the ability to compare progress on recovery and resolution\nplanning across firms. We are working with the FDIC to evaluate the GSIBs’ most recent\nresolution plans, which were submitted in July.\n\n\f-7As I noted, the LISCC is also responsible for the supervision of nonbank financial\ncompanies that have been designated by the FSOC. The Federal Reserve currently conducts\nactive, on-site supervision of all four of the designated firms. We are tailoring our supervisory\nframework to the specific business lines, risk profiles, and systemic footprints of these firms.\nOur supervisory efforts to date have focused on strengthening the firms’ risk identification,\nmeasurement, and management; internal controls; and corporate governance. Our objectives for\nthe designated holding companies are to ensure that the consolidated firms operate safely and\nsoundly and to mitigate risks to financial stability. We coordinate our consolidated supervision\nof the three designated insurance companies, as well as the other insurance holding companies\nwe supervise, with state insurance regulators, who continue their established oversight of\ninsurance legal entities within the consolidated firms. We do not regulate the manner in which\ninsurance is provided by these companies or the types of insurance they provide. Those\nimportant aspects of the firms’ activities are the province of state insurance supervisors.\nRegulation and Supervision of Large and Regional Companies\nIn supervising banking organizations with more than $50 billion in assets but outside the\nLISCC program, the Board focuses on ensuring that companies are well managed, appropriately\ncapitalized, and prepared to withstand potential adverse developments in the business\nenvironment. However, because the distress or failure of a non-LISCC firm is unlikely to have\nthe same effect on financial stability as that of a LISCC firm, we do not apply the full range of\nrules that we apply to those in the LISCC portfolio. For example, the Board’s risk-based and\nleverage capital surcharges, as well as the recently proposed long-term debt and TLAC\nrequirements, only apply to GSIBs. Similarly, the advanced approaches capital rules,\ncountercyclical capital buffer, supplementary leverage ratio, and full LCR only apply to\n\n\f-8internationally active banking organizations. 5 We also scale our examination procedures to\nreflect the lower level of systemic risk presented by non-LISCC companies.\nRegulatory and supervisory requirements are further tailored for regional banking\norganizations, defined as those with total assets between $10 billion and $50 billion. For\nexample, while regional banking organizations must comply with recently implemented changes\nthat strengthened the risk-based capital rules, they are not subject to a supervisory stress test or\nCCAR. Rather, as required by the Dodd-Frank Act, regional banking organizations perform\ntheir own stress tests. Similarly, these companies are not subject to enhanced prudential\nstandards established under section 165 of the Dodd-Frank Act, the LCR, or other related\nrequirements. Instead, we conduct regular inspections and evaluate their safety and soundness\nbased on each company’s individual circumstances. Because many regional banking\norganizations concentrate their assets and activities in banking subsidiaries that are supervised by\nother federal banking agencies, we coordinate supervisory activities closely with our regulatory\ncolleagues and rely significantly on the results of their examinations, focusing our own\ninspections on the parent company and its ability to serve as a source of strength to the banks.\nCommunity Bank Supervision\nI know that community banks play a vital role in many of your districts. Let me say that\nthe experiences and challenges of community banking are not new to me. Before I became Chair\nof the Board of Governors and Vice Chair before that, I spent six years as president of the\nFederal Reserve Bank of San Francisco. In that role, I was responsible for the supervision of a\nsubstantial number of community banking organizations in the nine states of the San Francisco\nDistrict. Among the lessons that experience reinforced is that when it comes to bank regulation\n\n5\n\nAn “internationally active banking organization” is defined as a banking organization with more than $250 billion\nin total assets or $10 billion in on-balance-sheet foreign exposure.\n\n\f-9and supervision, one size does not fit all. To effectively promote safety and soundness and\nensure consumer compliance without creating undue regulatory burden, rules and supervisory\napproaches should be tailored to different types of institutions such as community banks.\nThe Federal Reserve supervises more than 830 community banks and more than\n4,000 holding companies that control small depository institutions. These are banking\norganizations with total assets of $10 billion or less. In supervising these institutions, we follow\na risk-focused approach that aims to target examination resources to higher-risk areas of each\nbank’s operations and to ensure that banks maintain risk-management capabilities appropriate to\ntheir size and complexity. In the wake of the crisis, we are taking steps to refine this process by\nusing the financial data we collect from banks to calibrate our examination procedures based on\nrisk. We believe this will help us to be more forward looking in addressing emerging risks and\nto ensure that community bank examiners with specialized expertise and experience are allocated\nto the institutions exhibiting the highest risks. We have also implemented a new risk-focused\nconsumer compliance examination framework that is intended to allow examiners to spend less\ntime on low-risk compliance issues so that issues more likely to result in harm to consumers get\nmore attention. And we continue to improve our examiner commissioning training program to\nensure that it fully reflects the lessons of the recent crisis.\nWith the Congress’s support, we have also taken action to relieve small holding\ncompanies of certain requirements by raising the asset threshold for the Board’s Small Bank\nHolding Company Policy Statement from $500 million to $1 billion, and by applying this\nstatement to small savings and loan holding companies. The Small Bank Holding Company\nPolicy Statement promotes local control of community banking organizations by acknowledging\nthat smaller companies have less access to the capital markets and allowing them to fund\n\n\f- 10 acquisitions with a higher level of debt than would otherwise be allowed. We also relieved small\nholding companies of requirements to comply with consolidated capital requirements,\nrecognizing that their bank subsidiaries make up most of their assets and are already subject to\ncapital rules. In addition, in conjunction with this change, we eliminated quarterly and more\ndetailed consolidated financial reporting requirements for holding companies with less than\n$1 billion in assets, and instead require parent-only financial statements on a semiannual basis. 6\nConsistent with the Economic Growth and Regulatory Paperwork Reduction Act\n(EGRPRA), the Board is also working with the other federal banking agencies to identify\nbanking regulations that are outdated, unnecessary, or unduly burdensome. As part of the\nEGRPRA review, the agencies have held several public outreach meetings with bankers,\nconsumer groups, and other stakeholders. 7 Several themes have emerged during the discussions.\nFor example, community bankers in rural areas have noted that it can be difficult to find an\nappraiser with knowledge about the local housing market at a reasonable fee. Bankers have\nasked the agencies to consider increasing the dollar threshold for requiring appraisals, which\ncould allow them to use a less formal valuation of collateral for a larger number of mortgage\nloans. In addition, bankers have raised concerns about the extent of the financial reporting\nrequirements established by the banking agencies. In response, the banking agencies have\nalready taken steps under the auspices of the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council\nto consider options to eliminate or revise Call Report data items and to develop a streamlined\nreporting form for community banks. 8\n\n6\n\nSee Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2015), “Federal Reserve Board Issues Final Rule to\nExpand Applicability of Small Bank Holding Company Policy Statement and Apply It to Certain Savings and Loan\nHolding Companies,” press release, April 9, www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/bcreg/20150409a.htm.\n7\nAn additional EGRPRA outreach meeting is scheduled to be held in Washington, D.C., on December 2, 2015.\n8\nSee Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (2015), “FFIEC Announces Initiative to Streamline\nReporting Requirements for Community Banks,” press release, September 8, www.ffiec.gov/press/pr090815.htm.\n\n\f- 11 Bankers have also asked whether the agencies could review the statutorily mandated\nsafety-and-soundness examination frequency for banks, which varies based on a bank’s asset\nsize and condition, as a way to ease the burden of frequent on-site examinations. Other bankers\nhave commented on the burden associated with recently implemented changes to the capital\nguidelines and have encouraged the agencies to consider simplifying requirements for\ncommunity banking organizations.\nThe Federal Reserve is giving all of these suggestions careful consideration and will be\nworking closely with the other banking agencies in developing a report to the Congress at the\nconclusion of the EGRPRA review. Given the important role that community banks play in their\ncommunities and the economic support they provide across the country, we recognize that our\nsupervision of community banks must be balanced and avoid unnecessarily constraining their\nactivities.\nCurrent Conditions\nHaving reviewed the major changes we have made to our regulatory and supervisory\nprograms, let me offer a few brief remarks about the current state of the firms we regulate.\nThe financial condition of the firms in the LISCC portfolio has strengthened considerably\nsince the crisis. Common equity capital at the eight U.S. GSIBs alone has more than doubled\nsince 2008, representing an increase of almost $500 billion. Moreover, these firms generally\nhave much more stable funding positions: The amount of high-quality liquid assets held by the\neight U.S. GSIBs has increased by roughly two-thirds since 2012, and their reliance on shortterm wholesale funding has dropped considerably. Our new regulatory and supervisory\napproaches are aimed at helping ensure these firms remain strong. Requiring these firms to plan\n\n\f- 12 for an orderly resolution has forced them to think more carefully about the sustainability of their\nbusiness models and corporate structures.\nNevertheless, while we have seen some evidence of improved risk management, internal\ncontrols, and governance at the LISCC firms, they continue to have substantial compliance and\nrisk-management issues. Compliance breakdowns in recent years have undermined confidence\nin the LISCC firms’ risk management and controls and could have implications for financial\nstability, given the firms’ size, complexity, and interconnectedness. The LISCC firms must\naddress these issues directly and comprehensively.\nOur examinations have found large and regional banks to be well capitalized. Both large\nand regional banking organizations experienced dramatic improvements in profitability since the\nfinancial crisis, although these banks have also faced challenges in recent years due to weak\ngrowth in interest and noninterest income. Both large and regional institutions have seen robust\ngrowth in commercial and industrial lending.\nFinally, community banks are significantly healthier. More than 95 percent are now\nprofitable, and capital lost during the crisis has been largely replenished. Loan growth is picking\nup, and problem loans are now at levels last seen early in the financial crisis.\nConclusion\nWhile more work remains to be done, I hope you will take away from my testimony just\nhow much has changed. Taken as a whole, the reforms we have adopted since the crisis,\nincluding those mandated by the Dodd-Frank Act, represent a substantial strengthening of the\nregulatory framework for the largest financial institutions and should help ensure that the U.S.\nfinancial system remains able to fulfill its vital role of supporting the economy. Our supervisory\n\n\f- 13 approach is more comprehensive and forward looking while also tailored to fit the level of\noversight to the risks and scope of the institution.\nWe know our work is not complete. In the coming year we anticipate moving forward on\nother rulemaking initiatives that will complement the steps we have already taken. The Federal\nReserve is committed to remaining vigilant, diligent, and forward looking as a regulator and\nsupervisor of the financial institutions that serve our economy. We will do everything we can to\nfulfill the responsibility that has been entrusted to us by the Congress and the American public.\nThank you. I would be pleased to respond to your questions.\n\n\f"

            "content": "For release on delivery\n11:00 a.m. EDT\nOctober 20, 2015\n\nRemarks by\n\nJanet L. Yellen\nChair\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat the\nInduction of Carroll D. Wright and Janet L. Norwood\ninto the Department of Labor’s Hall of Honor\n\nU.S. Department of Labor\nWashington, D.C.\n\nOctober 20, 2015\n\n\fWe are here to honor two exceptional public servants and the great institution\nthey helped build. Let’s consider for a moment why the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS)\nhas succeeded and how Carroll Wright and Janet Norwood contributed to that success.\nIn 1884, a time of great strife and mistrust between management and labor, the\nfederal government created an agency with the mission of providing detailed and\nobjective information on American workers. That task fell to Carroll Wright, who had\nwon the confidence of workers and management as chief of the Massachusetts Bureau of\nLabor Statistics in the years after that state became the first to legalize labor unions.\nAt that point, before the United States itself had recognized such rights and before\nthe federal government could agree on labor standards, the public needed an\nunimpeachable assessment of the conditions faced by workers. Under Carroll Wright,\nwhat was then called the Bureau of Labor investigated major labor disputes and issued\nreports that shaped public opinion and were the basis for executive action and legislation.\nHe initiated the collection of data on hours, wages, and prices and was responsible for\nmany important advances that successively improved the reliability of these data. The\nrespect for the thoroughness and objectivity of the research that Wright oversaw led to\nthe dismantling of damaging trade barriers in the 1890s and later raised public awareness\nabout the deplorable conditions faced by women in the workplace.\nIn the U.S. Constitution, there is not a requirement that government statistics be\naccurate and free of political influence or bias. Carroll Wright recognized that this\nsimple, powerful idea could help build public confidence for the government’s effort to\nreduce conflicts between management and workers and move our nation forward. He and\nothers are responsible for a fundamental feature of our democracy that is now often taken\n\n\f-2 for granted--the public’s expectation and insistence that information provided by the\ngovernment can be trusted. To Carroll Wright’s descendants, one of whom is with us\ntoday, thank you, on his behalf, for this valuable contribution.\nThis legacy lives on in the agency Carroll Wright founded, and few of his\nsuccessors did as much to advance this principle as Janet Norwood. One reason for this\nsuccess, I am sure, is that she rose from the ranks, and the values of the BLS were deeply\ningrained in her over the 28 years she served this agency. Those who worked with Janet\nsay she strongly believed the BLS was uniquely positioned to contribute to the economic\npolicy debate as an authoritative, unimpeachable source of information and analysis\nabout the economy.\nIn her 13 years as commissioner, Janet succeeded in winning support for an\nambitious expansion of the BLS. She launched the annual Consumer Expenditure\nSurvey, as well as many other important data series, and elevated the skills and quality of\nstatistical analysis throughout the agency. To supplement the traditional measurement of\nproductivity as output per hour of labor, she oversaw the creation of a new measure of\nmultifactor productivity in the private sector, estimating productivity as the result of both\nlabor and capital inputs. When budget pressures threatened to end important data series\ncollected elsewhere at the Department of Labor, she found the means to continue these\nseries at the BLS.\nAt the same time, Janet faced challenges to the BLS’s tradition of professionalism\nand objectivity. From 1979, when she was appointed by President Carter, to 1991, when\nshe retired, the news on employment, productivity, and inflation was often bad. In this\n\n\f-3 circumstance, the BLS was sometimes accused of overstating economic problems, and it\noccasionally came under pressure to alter the basis for its data.\nJanet Norwood fended off these challenges with a mixture of resolve and\nflexibility, channeling some of the pressure into deliberate and constructive processes that\neventually yielded improvements in the consumer price index and generated alternative\nprice measures. As commissioner and like her predecessors, Janet helped preserve the\nBLS’s deserved reputation for accuracy and integrity by continually improving the\ndesign, procedures, and techniques of data collection.\nAfter government service, Janet had a long and active retirement in which she\ncontinued her contributions to the economic profession and the science of statistics. She\npassed away on March 31 of this year.\nTo members of her family who are with us today, thank you for her extraordinary\nservice to our country. Janet’s legacy continues in the ongoing work of the exceptional\nagency she helped build, on the foundation laid by Carroll Wright, whom she so\nappropriately joins today in this Hall of Honor.\nThe Bureau of Labor Statistics is exceptional, and in that way, I hope it serves as\nan example of how effective, reliable, and trusted government can be.\n\n\f"

It is truly a pleasure for me to join President Bullard and Chairman\nCotney in welcoming you to the Community Banking Research and Policy Conference,\nwhich I am proud to say has been cosponsored since its inception by the Federal Reserve\nSystem and the Conference of State Bank Supervisors (CSBS).\nThis is the third year for this conference, which I consider a milestone. The first\ntime you organize a conference like this, all you can be sure about is that there was\nindeed enough research and interest for such a conference. The second time it is held,\nyou proved that you could do it again.\nBut the third year, this year, is when we can start to feel we have established a\ntradition. If this year’s conference comes even close to being as successful as the first\ntwo were, and I expect it will be, I hope that we have established an ongoing role for this\ngathering, which provides such a great opportunity for bankers, regulators, and academic\nresearchers to come together to share ideas and insights about the issues that matter most\nin community banking.\nBased on the agenda and conference materials I have seen, I expect participants\nover the next two days will tackle some of the most important issues facing community\nbanks, provoke discussion and debate about opportunities and challenges, and generate\nsome promising ideas about how community banks can continue to play the\nindispensable role they have played in so many communities. The lineup of speakers,\nwhich includes my Federal Reserve Board colleague, Governor Brainard, is impressive.\nShe and others will delve deeply into the important research questions and other issues\nfacing community banking.\n\n\f-2My role today is to welcome you on behalf of the Federal Reserve Board. In the\ninterest of getting to the important work of this conference, I will be brief, but if I\naccomplish anything by speaking to you today, I hope it is to convey the Board’s\nunderstanding of the unique and important role of community banks in our financial\nsystem as well as the Board’s commitment, at the highest level, to consider how our\nsupervisory and regulatory decisions affect those institutions.\nMy fellow Board members and I know that community banks provide essential\nfinancial services to households, small businesses, and farms in communities throughout\nthe country. We know that community banks serve many customers that large banks do\nnot and provide services that are not offered by large banks in many communities. This\ncircumstance is especially true in rural areas and other small communities, where\ncommunity banks are sometimes the only retail financial institutions.\nWe understand that community bankers serve members of their local communities\nwho are not just their customers, but also their neighbors and their friends. We know the\nstrong links these banks have to the people and businesses in their communities provide\nfirsthand knowledge of local economic conditions. My colleagues on the Board\nunderstand, as I do, that these close ties give community bankers special insight and\nunderstanding into local needs so that they can tailor their products and services to meet\nthose needs.\nAlthough community banks largely kept to their traditional business model of\nprudent, local lending and avoided the excessive risk-tasking that helped fuel the\nfinancial crisis, that crisis, and the deep recession that followed, devastated many\ncommunities and the banks that serve them. The significant improvement in the\n\n\f-3economy since then has helped communities and community banks, but I am well aware\nthat the challenges for this sector continue, and my Board colleagues understand this also.\nWe know and appreciate these concerns because the Board makes it our business\nto regularly and extensively meet with and talk to community bankers and industry\nleaders. The Board of Governors meets twice a year with the Community Depository\nInstitutions Advisory Council, which includes representatives of community banks,\nthrifts, and credit unions in each of the 12 Federal Reserve Districts. 1 The Board also has\na Subcommittee on Smaller Regional and Community Banking, headed by Governor\nPowell and including Governor Brainard. 2\nLet me also say that the experiences, aspirations, and challenges of community\nbanking are not new to me. Before I became Chair of the Board of Governors and Vice\nChair before that, I spent six years as president of the San Francisco Fed. In this role, I\nwas responsible for the supervision of a substantial number of community banking\norganizations in the nine states of the 12th District.\nAmong the things I learned from that experience is that, when it comes to bank\nregulation and supervision, one size does not fit all. To effectively promote safety and\nsoundness and ensure consumer compliance without creating undue regulatory burden,\nrules and supervisory approaches should be tailored to different types of institutions.\nThat is why the Congress chose to exempt community banks from many aspects of new,\npost-crisis regulations and why financial regulators, including the Fed, have otherwise\n\n1\n\nMore information on the Community Depository Institutions Advisory Council is available on the\nBoard’s website at www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/cdiac.htm.\n2\nBoard member assignments are available on the Board’s website at\nwww.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/bios/board/default.htm.\n\n\f-4recognized the differences between community banks and larger, more complex\ninstitutions.\nThe Federal Reserve is committed to this approach to community bank oversight\nand to ensuring that new and existing regulations are not unduly burdensome for\ncommunity banks. One way we are fulfilling this commitment is through the regulatory\nreview required by the Economic Growth and Regulatory Paperwork Reduction Act\n(EGRPRA). The Federal Reserve and other agencies involved in the EGRPRA process\nhave so far held four in a series of six planned outreach meetings at locations across the\ncountry. We have heard many comments about community bank concerns and are taking\nthose insights into account as we consider options for alleviating unnecessary regulatory\nburden.\nLet me conclude by returning to the occasion of this conference and what I\nbelieve it says about the Federal Reserve’s commitment to supporting the ongoing role of\ncommunity banking in America.\nIn addition to its responsibilities for monetary policy and financial regulation and\nsupervision, the Federal Reserve takes very seriously its role as a research institution.\nWe believe strongly in the idea that high-quality research can add to knowledge and\nunderstanding and help inform economic and financial policymaking to yield better\ndecisions that benefit society. The Fed instituted this conference in partnership with the\nCSBS because we believe that research can help us better understand the benefits that\ncommunity banks provide to society and the challenges they face. The work presented at\nthis conference and subsequent research that may be spurred by this work can deepen\ncommunity bankers’ understanding of their businesses, and it can help state and federal\n\n\f-5regulators make better-informed decisions. Ultimately, research can help provide\nanswers to how community banks can continue to succeed in the 21st century.\nThank you for this opportunity to speak, welcome to St. Louis, and I hope you\nenjoy the discussions of the next two days.\n\n\f"

Yellen\nChair\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\nThe Philip Gamble Memorial Lecture\nUniversity of Massachusetts, Amherst\nAmherst, Massachusetts\n\nSeptember 24, 2015\n\n\fI would like to thank Michael Ash for his kind introduction and the University of\nMassachusetts for the honor of being invited to deliver this year’s Philip Gamble\nMemorial Lecture.\nIn my remarks today, I will discuss inflation and its role in the Federal Reserve’s\nconduct of monetary policy. I will begin by reviewing the history of inflation in the\nUnited States since the 1960s, highlighting two key points: that inflation is now much\nmore stable than it used to be, and that it is currently running at a very low level. I will\nthen consider the costs associated with inflation, and why these costs suggest that the\nFederal Reserve should try to keep inflation close to 2 percent. After briefly reviewing\nour policy actions since the financial crisis, I will discuss the dynamics of inflation and\ntheir implications for the outlook and monetary policy.\nHistorical Review of Inflation\nA crucial responsibility of any central bank is to control inflation, the average rate\nof increase in the prices of a broad group of goods and services. Keeping inflation stable\nat a moderately low level is important because, for reasons I will discuss, inflation that is\nhigh, excessively low, or unstable imposes significant costs on households and\nbusinesses. As a result, inflation control is one half of the dual mandate that Congress\nhas laid down for the Federal Reserve, which is to pursue maximum employment and\nstable prices.\nThe Federal Reserve has not always been successful in fulfilling the price stability\nelement of its mandate. The dashed red line in figure 1 plots the four-quarter percent\nchange in the price index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE)--the measure of\ninflation that the Fed’s policymaking body, the Federal Open Market Committee, or\n\n\f-2FOMC, uses to define its longer-run inflation goal.1 Starting in the mid-1960s, inflation\nbegan to move higher. Large jumps in food and energy prices played a role in this\nupward move, but they were not the whole story, for, as illustrated here, inflation was\nalready moving up before the food and energy shocks hit in the 1970s and the early\n1980s.2 And if we look at core inflation, the solid black line, which excludes food and\nenergy prices, we see that it too starts to move higher in the mid-1960s and rises to very\nelevated levels during the 1970s, which strongly suggests that something more than the\nenergy and food price shocks must have been at work.\nA second important feature of inflation over this period can be seen if we examine\nan estimate of its long-term trend, which is plotted as the dotted black line in figure 1. At\neach point in time, this trend is defined as the prediction from a statistical model of the\nlevel to which inflation is projected to return in the long run once the effects of any\nshocks to the economy have fully played out.3 As can be seen from the figure, this\nestimated trend drifts higher over the 1960s and 1970s, implying that during this period\n\n1\n\nSee the Federal Open Market Committee’s Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy\nStrategy, available on the Board’s website at\nwww.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/FOMC_LongerRunGoals.pdf.\n2\nThe first jump in energy prices in the 1970s reflected a rise in crude oil prices whose proximate cause was\nthe so-called Arab oil embargo that followed the 1973 Arab-Israeli War; the first jump in food prices was\ncaused by disease and poor harvests combined with low levels of inventories (particularly for grains) in\nmany countries. The second energy price shock resulted from a jump in crude oil prices following the\n1978-79 revolution in Iran and subsequent Iraqi invasion; the second food price shock was largely\nattributable to bad weather and disease. (See Blinder and Rudd, 2013, for an assessment of the effect that\nthese and other special factors--including the imposition and removal of price controls over the 1971-74\nperiod--had on consumer price inflation in the 1970s and 1980s.)\n3\nThe predicted long-run trend shown here updates an estimate made by Peneva and Rudd (2015), which\nuses a vector autoregression (VAR) with time-varying parameters and stochastic volatility to compute a\nstochastic trend for inflation (see that paper for additional details regarding model specification and data\ndefinitions). The estimation procedure for the VAR is similar to that used by Clark and Terry (2010),\nwhich in turn follows Cogley and Sargent (2005); see also Cogley and others (2010) and Ascari and\nSbordone (2014) for related applications.\n\n\f-3there was no stable “anchor” to which inflation could be expected to eventually return--a\nconclusion generally supported by other procedures for estimating trend inflation.\nToday many economists believe that these features of inflation in the late 1960s\nand 1970s--its high level and lack of a stable anchor--reflected a combination of factors,\nincluding chronically overheated labor and product markets, the effects of the energy and\nfood price shocks, and the emergence of an “inflationary psychology” whereby a rise in\nactual inflation led people to revise up their expectations for future inflation. Together,\nthese various factors caused inflation--actual and expected--to ratchet higher over time.\nUltimately, however, monetary policy bears responsibility for the broad contour of what\nhappened to actual and expected inflation during this period because the Federal Reserve\nwas insufficiently focused on returning inflation to a predictable, low level following the\nshocks to food and energy prices and other disturbances.\nIn late 1979, the Federal Reserve began significantly tightening monetary policy\nto reduce inflation. In response to this tightening, which precipitated a severe economic\ndownturn in the early 1980s, overall inflation moved persistently lower, averaging less\nthan 4 percent from 1983 to 1990. Inflation came down further following the 1990-91\nrecession and subsequent slow recovery and then averaged about 2 percent for many\nyears. Since the recession ended in 2009, however, the United States has experienced\ninflation running appreciably below the FOMC’s 2 percent objective, in part reflecting\nthe gradual pace of the subsequent economic recovery.\nExamining the behavior of inflation’s estimated long-term trend reveals another\nimportant change in inflation dynamics. With the caveat that these results are based on a\nspecific implementation of a particular statistical model, they imply that since the mid-\n\n\f-41990s there have been no persistent movements in this predicted long-run inflation rate,\nwhich has remained very close to 2 percent. Remarkably, this stability is estimated to\nhave continued during and after the recent severe recession, which saw the\nunemployment rate rise to levels comparable to those seen during the 1981-82 downturn,\nwhen the trend did shift down markedly.4 As I will discuss, the stability of this trend\nappears linked to a change in the behavior of long-run inflation expectations--measures of\nwhich appear to be much better anchored today than in the past, likely reflecting an\nimprovement in the conduct of monetary policy. In any event, this empirical analysis\nimplies that, over the past 20 years, inflation has been much more predictable over the\nlonger term than it was back in the 1970s because the trend rate to which inflation was\npredicted to return no longer moved around appreciably. That said, inflation still varied\nconsiderably from year to year in response to various shocks.\nAs figure 2 highlights, the United States has experienced very low inflation on\naverage since the financial crisis, in part reflecting persistent economic weakness that has\nproven difficult to fully counter with monetary policy. Overall inflation (shown as the\ndashed red line) has averaged only about 1-1/2 percent per year since 2008 and is\ncurrently close to zero. This result is not merely a product of falling energy prices, as\ncore inflation (the solid black line) has also been low on average over this period.\nInflation Costs\nIn 2012 the FOMC adopted, for the first time, an explicit longer-run inflation\nobjective of 2 percent as measured by the PCE price index.5 (Other central banks,\n\n4\n\nTrend inflation estimates from univariate statistical models manifest somewhat less stability in recent\nyears; see Clark and Bednar (2015).\n5\nIn contrast, the FOMC has determined that a number of considerations preclude it from setting a fixed\nnumerical target for the other leg of its dual mandate, maximum employment. As discussed in its\n\n\f-5including the European Central Bank and the Bank of England, also have a 2 percent\ninflation target.) This decision reflected the FOMC’s judgment that inflation that\npersistently deviates--up or down--from a fixed low level can be costly in a number of\nways. Persistent high inflation induces households and firms to spend time and effort\ntrying to minimize their cash holdings and forces businesses to adjust prices more\nfrequently than would otherwise be necessary. More importantly, high inflation also\ntends to raise the after-tax cost of capital, thereby discouraging business investment.\nThese adverse effects occur because capital depreciation allowances and other aspects of\nour tax system are only partially indexed for inflation.6\nPersistently high inflation, if unanticipated, can be especially costly for\nhouseholds that rely on pensions, annuities, and long-term bonds to provide a significant\nportion of their retirement income. Because the income provided by these assets is\ntypically fixed in nominal terms, its real purchasing power may decline surprisingly\nquickly if inflation turns out to be consistently higher than originally anticipated, with\npotentially serious consequences for retirees’ standard of living as they age.7\n\nStatement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy (see note 1), the maximum level of\nemployment is something that is largely determined by nonmonetary factors that affect the structure and\ndynamics of the labor market. Moreover, the maximum level of employment, the longer-run “natural” rate\nof unemployment, and other related aspects of the labor market are not directly observable, can change\nover time, and can only be estimated imprecisely. As a result, views vary about what labor market\nconditions would be consistent with a normal level of resource utilization.\n6\nFor a general survey of the costs of high inflation, see Briault (1995). English (1999) discusses costs\nassociated with an increased need for cash management. For a discussion of costs that arise through\ninteractions of inflation with the tax system, see Feldstein (1997, 1999) and Cohen and others (1999).\nFinally, high inflation may adversely affect the economy’s allocation of resources by increasing the\nmagnitude of misalignments in relative prices that result because firms do not continually adjust all of their\nprices; for a discussion of such costs in the context of the new-Keynesian model of inflation, see Ascari and\nSbordone (2014).\n7\nMore broadly, if inflation evolves in an unpredictable manner over many years, then even financially\nsophisticated households and firms may not be able to avoid significant forecasting errors with their\nattendant costs. Such costs can arise in a wide variety of situations; for instance, any firm, union, or other\nentity that engages in a multiyear nominal contract may be adversely affected by unexpected increases or\ndecreases in inflation, although those on the other side of the contract might benefit.\n\n\f-6An unexpected rise in inflation also tends to reduce the real purchasing power of\nlabor income for a time because nominal wages and salaries are generally slow to adjust\nto movements in the overall level of prices. Survey data suggest that this effect is\nprobably the number one reason why people dislike inflation so much.8 In the longer run,\nhowever, real wages--that is, wages adjusted for inflation--appear to be largely\nindependent of the average rate of inflation and instead are primarily determined by\nproductivity, global competition, and other nonmonetary factors. In support of this view,\nfigure 3 shows that nominal wage growth tends to broadly track price inflation over long\nperiods of time.\nInflation that is persistently very low can also be costly, and it is such costs that\nhave been particularly relevant to monetary policymakers in recent years. The most\nimportant cost is that very low inflation constrains a central bank’s ability to combat\nrecessions. Normally, the FOMC fights economic downturns by reducing the nominal\nfederal funds rate, the rate charged by banks to lend to each other overnight. These\nreductions, current and expected, stimulate spending and hiring by lowering longer-term\nreal interest rates--that is, nominal rates adjusted for inflation--and improving financial\nconditions more broadly. But the federal funds rate and other nominal interest rates\ncannot go much below zero, since holding cash is always an alternative to investing in\nsecurities.9 Thus, the lowest the FOMC can feasibly push the real federal funds rate is\nessentially the negative value of the inflation rate. As a result, the Federal Reserve has\n\n8\n\nFor more on this survey, see Shiller (1997).\nBecause of the inconvenience of storing and protecting very large quantities of currency, some firms are\nwilling to pay a premium to hold short-term government securities or bank deposits instead. As a result,\nseveral foreign central banks have found it possible to push nominal short-term interest rates somewhat\nbelow zero.\n\n9\n\n\f-7less room to ease monetary policy when inflation is very low. This limitation is a\npotentially serious problem because severe downturns such as the Great Recession may\nrequire pushing real interest rates far below zero for an extended period to restore full\nemployment at a satisfactory pace.10 For this reason, pursuing too low an inflation\nobjective or otherwise tolerating persistently very low inflation would be inconsistent\nwith the other leg of the FOMC’s mandate, to promote maximum employment.11\nAn unexpected decline in inflation that is sizable and persistent can also be costly\nbecause it increases the debt burdens of borrowers. Consider homeowners who take out a\nconventional fixed-rate mortgage, with the expectation that inflation will remain close to\n2 percent and their nominal incomes will rise about 4 percent per year. If the economy\nwere instead to experience chronic mild deflation accompanied by flat or declining\nnominal incomes, then after a few years the homeowners might find it noticeably more\ndifficult to cover their monthly mortgage payments than they had originally anticipated.\nMoreover, if house prices fall in line with consumer prices rather than rising as expected,\nthen the equity in their home will be lower than they had anticipated. This situation,\nwhich is sometimes referred to as “debt deflation,” would also confront all households\nwith outstanding student loans, auto loans, or credit card debt, as well as businesses that\n\n10\nFor example, Curdia and others (2014) estimate that stabilizing the economy during the last recession\nwould have required lowering the real federal funds rate to negative 10 percent for a time; by comparison,\nthe average value of the real federal funds has been only negative 1-1/4 percent since early 2009. Of\ncourse, the FOMC was able to use other policy tools, such as large-scale asset purchases, to put additional\ndownward pressure on long-term interest rates after the nominal funds rate was cut to near zero; however,\nthose policies had potential costs and risks that made them an imperfect substitute for traditional interest\nrate policy. See Krugman (1998), Reifschneider and Williams (2000), and Eggertsson and Woodford\n(2003) for discussions of the effects that low inflation and the zero lower bound on nominal interest rates\nhave on a central bank’s ability to stimulate the economy during economic downturns. In addition, see\nEnglish, Lopez-Salido, and Tetlow (2015) and Engen, Laubach, and Reifschneider (2015) for model-based\nanalyses of the effectiveness of the Federal Reserve’s large-scale asset purchases and forward guidance in\nmitigating the effects of the zero lower bound. Finally, for a discussion of the costs and benefits of\nemploying large scale asset purchases, see Bernanke (2012) and Yellen (2013).\n11\nFor a further discussion of this point, see Mishkin (2007).\n\n\f-8had taken out bank loans or issued bonds.12 Of course, in this situation, lenders would be\nreceiving more real income. But the net effect on the economy is likely to be negative, in\nlarge part because borrowers typically have only a limited ability to absorb losses. And if\nthe increased debt-service burdens and declines in collateral values are severe enough to\nforce borrowers into bankruptcy, then the resultant hardship imposed on families, small\nbusiness owners, and laid-off workers may be very severe.13\nMonetary Policy Actions since the Financial Crisis\nAs I noted earlier, after weighing the costs associated with various rates of\ninflation, the FOMC decided that 2 percent inflation is an appropriate operational\ndefinition of its longer-run price objective.14 In the wake of the 2008 financial crisis,\n\n12\n\nSee Fisher (1933) for an early discussion of debt deflation and its effects on the economy.\nVery low inflation also can result in chronically higher unemployment by closing off an important way in\nwhich the labor market can respond to adverse shocks. In sectors where productivity is lagging or demand\nis slowing, declines in real wages might be necessary to avoid even worse outcomes, such as layoffs. For\nvarious reasons, however, employers often try to avoid nominal wage cuts. (Bewley (1999) suggests a\nnumber of reasons that firms find cutting nominal wages difficult, including the effect that such cuts have\non employee morale. Inflation is therefore often said to “grease the wheels of the labor market” because it\npermits these required adjustments in real wages to occur through a combination of unchanged nominal\nwages and rising prices.) But when inflation falls to a very low level, this passive approach to wage\nreductions may no longer be viable for many firms, causing relatively more of the burden of adjustment to\nfall on employment.\n14\nBlanchard, Dell’Ariccia and Mauro (2010), among others, have recently suggested that central banks\nshould consider raising their inflation targets, on the grounds that conditions since the financial crisis have\ndemonstrated that monetary policy is more constrained by the effective lower bound (ELB) on nominal\ninterest rates than was originally estimated. Ball (2013), for example, has proposed 4 percent as a more\nappropriate target for the FOMC. While it is certainly true that earlier analyses of ELB costs significantly\nunderestimated the likelihood of severe recessions and slow recoveries of the sort recently experienced in\nthe United States and elsewhere (see Chung and others, 2012), it is also the case that these analyses did not\ntake into account central banks’ ability to use large-scale asset purchases and other unconventional tools to\nmitigate the costs arising from the ELB constraint. In addition, it is not obvious that a modestly higher\ntarget rate of inflation would have greatly increased the Federal Reserve’s ability to support real activity in\nthe special conditions that prevailed in the wake of the financial crisis, when some of the channels through\nwhich lower interest rates stimulate aggregate spending, such as housing construction, were probably\nattenuated. Beyond these tactical considerations, however, changing the FOMC’s long-run inflation\nobjective would risk calling into question the FOMC’s commitment to stabilizing inflation at any level\nbecause it might lead people to suspect that the target could be changed opportunistically in the future. If\nso, then the key benefits of stable inflation expectations discussed below--an increased ability of monetary\npolicy to fight economic downturns without sacrificing price stability--might be lost. Moreover, if the\npurpose of a higher inflation target is to increase the ability of central banks to deal with the severe\nrecessions that follow financial crises, then a better strategic approach might be to rely on more vigorous\nsupervisory and macroprudential policies to reduce the likelihood of such events. Finally, targeting\n13\n\n\f-9however, achieving both this objective and full employment (the other leg of the Federal\nReserve’s dual mandate) has been difficult, as shown in figure 4. Initially, the\nunemployment rate (the solid black line) soared and inflation (the dashed red line) fell\nsharply. Moreover, after the recession officially ended in 2009, the subsequent recovery\nwas significantly slowed by a variety of persistent headwinds, including households with\nunderwater mortgages and high debt burdens, reduced access to credit for many potential\nborrowers, constrained spending by state and local governments, and weakened foreign\ngrowth prospects. In an effort to return employment and inflation to levels consistent\nwith the Federal Reserve’s dual mandate, the FOMC took a variety of unprecedented\nactions to help lower longer-term interest rates, including reducing the federal funds rate\n(the dotted black line) to near zero, communicating to the public that short-term interest\nrates would likely stay exceptionally low for some time, and buying large quantities of\nlonger-term Treasury debt and agency-issued mortgage-backed securities.15\nThese actions contributed to highly accommodative financial conditions, thereby\nhelping to bring about a considerable improvement in labor market conditions over time.\nThe unemployment rate, which peaked at 10 percent in 2009, is now 5.1 percent, slightly\nabove the median of FOMC participants’ current estimates of its longer-run normal level.\nAlthough other indicators suggest that the unemployment rate currently understates how\nmuch slack remains in the labor market, on balance the economy is no longer far away\n\ninflation in the vicinity of 4 percent or higher would stretch the meaning of “stable prices” in the Federal\nReserve Act.\n15\nFor a more complete listing of the Federal Reserve’s policy actions in recent years, see “The Federal\nReserve’s Response to the Financial Crisis and Action to Foster Maximum Employment and Price\nStability,” a webpage available on the Board’s website at\nwww.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/bst_crisisresponse.htm. Also see Engen, Laubach, and\nReifschneider (2015) for an analysis of the combined macroeconomic effects of the FOMC’s asset\npurchases and guidance concerning the future path of the federal funds rate.\n\n\f- 10 from full employment. In contrast, inflation has continued to run below the Committee’s\nobjective over the past several years, and over the past 12 months it has been essentially\nzero. Nevertheless, the Committee expects that inflation will gradually return to\n2 percent over the next two or three years. I will now turn to the determinants of inflation\nand the factors that underlie this expectation.\nInflation Dynamics\nModels used to describe and predict inflation commonly distinguish between\nchanges in food and energy prices--which enter into total inflation--and movements in the\nprices of other goods and services--that is, core inflation. This decomposition is useful\nbecause food and energy prices can be extremely volatile, with fluctuations that often\ndepend on factors that are beyond the influence of monetary policy, such as technological\nor political developments (in the case of energy prices) or weather or disease (in the case\nof food prices). As a result, core inflation usually provides a better indicator than total\ninflation of where total inflation is headed in the medium term.16 Of course, food and\nenergy account for a significant portion of household budgets, so the Federal Reserve’s\ninflation objective is defined in terms of the overall change in consumer prices.\nWhat, then, determines core inflation? Recalling figure 1, core inflation tends to\nfluctuate around a longer-term trend that now is essentially stable. Let me first focus on\nthese fluctuations before turning to the trend. Economic theory suggests, and empirical\nanalysis confirms, that such deviations of inflation from trend depend partly on the\n\n16\n\nSeveral other approaches are commonly used to abstract from the short-term volatility of overall inflation\nand thereby better discern its medium-term direction. For example, one procedure removes the\ncomponents of the total PCE price index with the largest or smallest price changes before computing the\naverage price change, yielding the “trimmed mean” PCE index; another uses the median price change in a\ngiven period, rather than the mean change, to represent the overall inflation rate. In practice, simply using\ncore inflation does about as well in predicting overall inflation over the coming year and beyond as these\nalternative procedures (see Detmeister, 2011, 2012).\n\n\f- 11 intensity of resource utilization in the economy--as approximated, for example, by the\ngap between the actual unemployment rate and its so-called natural rate, or by the\nshortfall of actual gross domestic product (GDP) from potential output. This\nrelationship--which likely reflects, among other things, a tendency for firms’ costs to rise\nas utilization rates increase--represents an important channel through which monetary\npolicy influences inflation over the medium term, although in practice the influence is\nmodest and gradual. Movements in certain types of input costs, particularly changes in\nthe price of imported goods, also can cause core inflation to deviate noticeably from its\ntrend, sometimes by a marked amount from year to year.17 Finally, a nontrivial fraction\nof the quarter-to-quarter, and even the year-to-year, variability of inflation is attributable\nto idiosyncratic and often unpredictable shocks.18\nWhat about the determinants of inflation’s longer-term trend? Here, it is\ninstructive to compare the purely statistical estimate of the trend rate of future inflation\nshown earlier in figure 1 with survey measures of people’s actual expectations of longrun inflation, as is done in figure 5. Theory suggests that inflation expectations--which\npresumably are linked to the central bank’s inflation goal--should play an important role\nin actual price setting.19 Indeed, the contours of these series are strikingly similar, which\n\n17\n\nAnother input cost that can affect core inflation is the price of energy; in recent decades, however, the\npass-through of energy price changes to core inflation appears much smaller than in previous periods (see\nHooker, 2002; Clark and Terry, 2010).\n18\nSome of these idiosyncratic shocks are related to identifiable factors, such as changes in Medicare\nreimbursement rates or movements in the (imputed) price of holding a checking account. (Both of these\nfactors are included in the services component of the PCE price index, but not the consumer price index\n(CPI).) However, not all idiosyncratic shocks can be reliably traced to specific factors, as a significant\nfraction represents unpredictable “noise.”\n19\nMost theoretical versions of the Phillips curve suggest that inflation should depend on short-run inflation\nexpectations, but, as an empirical matter, measures of long-run expectations appear to explain the data\nbetter.\n\n\f- 12 suggests that the estimated trend in inflation is in fact related to households’ and firms’\nlong-run inflation expectations.20\nTo summarize, this analysis suggests that economic slack, changes in imported\ngoods prices, and idiosyncratic shocks all cause core inflation to deviate from a longerterm trend that is ultimately determined by long-run inflation expectations. As some will\nrecognize, this model of core inflation is a variant of a theoretical model that is\ncommonly referred to as an expectations-augmented Phillips curve.21 Total inflation in\nturn reflects movements in core inflation, combined with changes in the prices of food\nand energy.\nAn important feature of this model of inflation dynamics is that the overall effect\nthat variations in resource utilization, import prices, and other factors will have on\ninflation depends crucially on whether these influences also affect long-run inflation\nexpectations. Figure 6 illustrates this point with a stylized example of the inflation\nconsequences of a gradual increase in the level of import prices--perhaps occurring in\nresponse to stronger real activity abroad or a fall in the exchange value of the dollar--that\ncauses the rate of change of import prices to be elevated for a time.22 First, consider the\n\n20\nSee Clark and Davig (2008); see also Faust and Wright (2013), who make a related point in the context\nof inflation forecasting. Note that the question about expected inflation in the University of Michigan\nSurveys of Consumers is not phrased in terms of a specific measure of prices, so its level--as opposed to its\ncontour--cannot be directly compared with a particular measure of inflation such as the change in the PCE\nprice index.\n21\nSee Tobin (1972) and Friedman (1968) for early discussions of the theory underpinning the expectationsaugmented Phillips curve. Theoretical descriptions of the inflation process remain an active area of\nresearch in economics. In recent years, many economic theorists have used a so-called new-Keynesian\nframework--in which optimizing agents are assumed to face constraints on price or wage setting in the form\nof adjustment costs or explicit nominal contracts--to model inflation dynamics (see Woodford, 2003,\nchapter 3, for a textbook treatment). Although these new-Keynesian inflation models can differ\nimportantly in their specifics, they all tend to assign a central role to inflation expectations and resource\nutilization as drivers of inflation dynamics.\n22\nIn this exercise, we ignore any inflation effects that might arise because of shifts in resource utilization\ninduced by the change in import prices, which are expressed relative to core prices.\n\n\f- 13 situation shown in panel A, in which households’ and firms’ expectations of inflation are\nnot solidly anchored, but instead adjust in response to the rates of inflation that are\nactually observed.23 Such conditions--which arguably prevailed in the United States from\nthe 1970s to the mid-1990s--could plausibly arise if the central bank has, in the past,\nallowed significant and persistent movements in inflation to occur. In this case, the\ntemporary rise in the rate of change of import prices results in a permanent increase in\ninflation. This shift occurs because the initial increase in inflation generated by a period\nof rising import prices leads households and firms to revise up their expectations of future\ninflation. A permanent rise in inflation would also result from a sustained rise in the\nlevel of oil prices or a temporary increase in resource utilization.\nBy contrast, suppose that inflation expectations are instead well anchored, perhaps\nbecause the central bank has been successful over time in keeping inflation near some\nspecified target and has made it clear to the public that it intends to continue to do so.\nThen the response of inflation to a temporary increase in the rate of change of import\nprices or any other transitory shock will resemble the pattern shown in panel B. In this\ncase, inflation will deviate from its longer-term level only as long as import prices are\nrising. But once they level out, inflation will fall back to its previous trend in the absence\nof other disturbances.24\nA key implication of these two examples is that the presence of well-anchored\ninflation expectations greatly enhances a central bank’s ability to pursue both of its\n\n23\nAn expectations-augmented Phillips curve in which expectations of inflation are assumed to eventually\nrespond one-for-one to actual past inflation is typically referred to as an accelerationist Phillips curve.\n24\nQualitatively similar results obtain in fully specified structural models with rational expectations-including the FRB/US, EDO, and SIGMA models maintained at the Federal Reserve Board--in which the\nlong-term behavior of inflation and inflation expectations is governed by the central bank’s (fixed) inflation\nobjective.\n\n\f- 14 objectives--namely, price stability and full employment. Because temporary shifts in the\nrate of change of import prices or other transitory shocks have no permanent influence on\nexpectations, they have only a transitory effect on inflation. As a result, the central bank\ncan “look through” such short-run inflationary disturbances in setting monetary policy,\nallowing it to focus on returning the economy to full employment without placing price\nstability at risk. Indeed, the Federal Reserve has done just that in setting monetary policy\nover the past decade or more. Moreover, as I will discuss shortly, these inflation\ndynamics are a key reason why the FOMC expects inflation to return to 2 percent over\nthe next few years.\nOn balance, the evidence suggests that inflation expectations are in fact well\nanchored at present. Figure 7 plots the two survey measures of longer-term expected\ninflation I presented earlier, along with a measure of longer-term inflation compensation\nderived as the difference between yields on nominal Treasury securities and inflationindexed ones, called TIPS. Since the late 1990s, survey measures of longer-term\ninflation expectations have been quite stable; this stability has persisted in recent years\ndespite a deep recession and concerns expressed by some observers regarding the\npotential inflationary effects of unconventional monetary policy. The fact that these\nsurvey measures appear to have remained anchored at about the same levels that\nprevailed prior to the recession suggests that, once the economy has returned to full\nemployment (and absent any other shocks), core inflation should return to its\npre-recession average level of about 2 percent.\nThis conclusion is tempered somewhat by recent movements in longer-run\ninflation compensation, which in principle could reflect changes in investors’\n\n\f- 15 expectations for long-run inflation. This measure is now noticeably lower than in the\nyears just prior to the financial crisis.25 However, movements in inflation compensation\nare difficult to interpret because they can be driven by factors that are unique to financial\nmarkets--such as movements in liquidity or risk premiums--as well as by changes in\nexpected inflation.26 Indeed, empirical work that attempts to control for these factors\nsuggests that the long-run inflation expectations embedded in asset prices have in fact\nmoved down relatively little over the past decade.27 Nevertheless, the decline in inflation\ncompensation over the past year may indicate that financial market participants now see\nan increased risk of very low inflation persisting.\nAlthough the evidence, on balance, suggests that inflation expectations are well\nanchored at present, policymakers would be unwise to take this situation for granted.\nAnchored inflation expectations were not won easily or quickly: Experience suggests\nthat it takes many years of carefully conducted monetary policy to alter what households\nand firms perceive to be inflation’s “normal” behavior, and, furthermore, that a persistent\nfailure to keep inflation under control--by letting it drift either too high or too low for too\n\n25\n\nIn evaluating the potential implications of this decline for expected PCE inflation, one also needs to keep\nin mind that TIPS are indexed to the CPI. CPI inflation generally runs a few tenths of a percentage point\nhigher than PCE inflation, though that differential can vary materially over time.\n26\nAnother complication is that we do not know whose expectations “matter” for determining inflation.\nInflation expectations of professional forecasters (such as those collected in the Blue Chip Economic\nIndicators, the Survey of Professional Forecasters, or the Survey of Primary Dealers) or inflation\nexpectations derived from asset prices probably capture the views of participants in financial markets but\nneed not reflect the views of households and firms more broadly. As an empirical matter, the little\ninformation available on the longer-term inflation expectations of firms from the Atlanta Federal Reserve\nBusiness Inflation Expectations survey suggests that firms’ expectations more closely resemble\nexpectations from the University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers than the expectations of professional\nforecasters. Similarly, preliminary data from a New Zealand study suggests that inflation forecasts of firms\nare much more similar to those of households than those of professional forecasters (see Coibion and\nGorodnichenko, 2015).\n27\nD’Amico, Kim, and Wei (2014) examine a number of models that use TIPS yields to back out expected\ninflation estimates. The best-fitting models show only a small decline in longer-term inflation expectations\nsince 2005.\n\n\f- 16 long--could cause expectations to once again become unmoored.28 Given that inflation\nhas been running below the FOMC’s objective for several years now, such concerns\nreinforce the appropriateness of the Federal Reserve’s current monetary policy, which\nremains highly accommodative by historical standards and is directed toward helping\nreturn inflation to 2 percent over the medium term.29\nBefore turning to the implications of this inflation model for the current outlook\nand monetary policy, a cautionary note is in order. The Phillips-curve approach to\nforecasting inflation has a long history in economics, and it has usefully informed\nmonetary policy decisionmaking around the globe. But the theoretical underpinnings of\nthe model are still a subject of controversy among economists. Moreover, inflation\nsometimes moves in ways that empirical versions of the model, which necessarily are a\n\n28\n\nMy interpretation of the historical evidence is that long-run inflation expectations become anchored at a\nparticular level only after a central bank succeeds in keeping actual inflation near some target level for\nmany years. For that reason, I am somewhat skeptical about the actual effectiveness of any monetary\npolicy that relies primarily on the central bank’s theoretical ability to influence the public’s inflation\nexpectations directly by simply announcing that it will pursue a different inflation goal in the future.\nAlthough such announcements might potentially persuade some financial market participants and\nprofessional forecasters to shift their expectations, other members of the public are probably much less\nlikely to do so. Hence, actual inflation would probably be affected only after the central bank has had\nsufficient time to concretely demonstrate its sustained commitment and ability to generate a new norm for\nthe average level of inflation and the behavior of monetary policy--a process that might take years, based\non U.S. experience. Consistent with my assessment that announcements alone are not enough, Bernanke\nand others (1999) found no evidence across a number of countries that the initial disinflation which follows\nthe adoption of inflation targeting is any less costly than disinflations carried out under alternative\nmonetary regimes.\n29\nSome might be surprised that the preceding discussion of inflation determinants makes no mention of\nlabor costs. In the past, wages provided a good empirical indicator of the future direction of price inflation;\nindeed, the presence of a so-called wage-price spiral--in which higher price inflation led workers to push\nfor higher wage growth, thereby in turn leading to even faster price increases as firms’ labor costs\naccelerated--was often invoked to explain the inflationary dynamics of the 1970s. The wage-price spiral no\nlonger seems to provide a useful description of the U.S. inflation process. In fact, some evidence suggests\nthat, like inflation, the rate of growth of labor costs is now characterized by a stable long-run trend; again, a\nlikely explanation for this empirical finding is the improved anchoring of long-term inflation expectations.\n(See Peneva and Rudd, 2015, for some suggestive evidence along these lines.) More generally, movements\nin labor costs no longer appear to be an especially good guide to future price movements. (This\ndevelopment does not imply that wage developments carry no useful information: Because wage growth is\ninfluenced by labor market slack, observed movements in compensation gains can provide an indication of\nhow close the economy is to full employment.)\n\n\f- 17 simplified version of a complicated reality, cannot adequately explain. For this reason,\nsignificant uncertainty attaches to Phillips curve predictions, and the validity of forecasts\nfrom this model must be continuously evaluated in response to incoming data.\nPolicy Implications\nAssuming that my reading of the data is correct and long-run inflation\nexpectations are in fact anchored near their pre-recession levels, what implications does\nthe preceding description of inflation dynamics have for the inflation outlook and for\nmonetary policy?\nThis framework suggests, first, that much of the recent shortfall of inflation from\nour 2 percent objective is attributable to special factors whose effects are likely to prove\ntransitory. As the solid black line in figure 8 indicates, PCE inflation has run noticeably\nbelow our 2 percent objective on average since 2008, with the shortfall approaching\nabout 1 percentage point in both 2013 and 2014 and more than 1-1/2 percentage points\nthis year. The stacked bars in the figure give the contributions of various factors to these\ndeviations from 2 percent, computed using an estimated version of the simple inflation\nmodel I just discussed.30 As the solid blue portion of the bars shows, falling consumer\nenergy prices explain about half of this year’s shortfall and a sizable portion of the 2013\nand 2014 shortfalls as well. Another important source of downward pressure this year\nhas been a decline in import prices, the portion with orange checkerboard pattern, which\n\n30\n\nFor a technical explanation of the procedure used to produce this decomposition, see the appendix. In the\ndecomposition procedure, movements in core inflation affect headline inflation one-for-one; as a result, the\ncontributions of food and energy price inflation are defined as each component’s price change relative to\nthe core, weighted by its share in total nominal consumer spending. (Note that the “other” category\nincludes the effects of changes in food prices.) The estimated contribution of movements in import prices\nis also computed relative to core inflation; thus, if import prices are rising at the same rate as core inflation,\nthey have no estimated effect on the shortfall of overall inflation from 2 percent. In addition, the\ndecomposition takes account of lags in the adjustment of core inflation to movements in resource utilization\nand other factors.\n\n\f- 18 is largely attributable to the 15 percent appreciation in the dollar’s exchange value over\nthe past year. In contrast, the restraint imposed by economic slack, the green dotted\nportion, has diminished steadily over time as the economy has recovered and is now\nestimated to be relatively modest.31 Finally, a similarly small portion of the current\nshortfall of inflation from 2 percent is explained by other factors (which include changes\nin food prices); importantly, the effects of these other factors are transitory and often\nswitch sign from year to year.\nAlthough an accounting exercise like this one is always imprecise and will depend\non the specific model that is used, I think its basic message--that the current near-zero\nrate of inflation can mostly be attributed to the temporary effects of falling prices for\nenergy and non-energy imports--is quite plausible. If so, the 12-month change in total\nPCE prices is likely to rebound to 1-1/2 percent or higher in 2016, barring a further\nsubstantial drop in crude oil prices and provided that the dollar does not appreciate\nnoticeably further.\nTo be reasonably confident that inflation will return to 2 percent over the next few\nyears, we need, in turn, to be reasonably confident that we will see continued solid\neconomic growth and further gains in resource utilization, with longer-term inflation\nexpectations remaining near their pre-recession level. Fortunately, prospects for the U.S.\neconomy generally appear solid. Monthly payroll gains have averaged close to 210,000\nsince the start of the year and the overall economy has been expanding modestly faster\n\n31\n\nAs discussed later, the current difference between the unemployment rate and its normal longer-run level\nlikely understates the actual amount of slack that remains in the labor market. If so, the estimates reported\nin figure 8 somewhat understate the contribution of slack to the current shortfall of inflation from 2 percent\nand, correspondingly, overstate the contribution from other factors. For example, if the standard\nunemployment gap currently understates the true level of slack by 1/2 percentage point, then the\ncontribution of slack to this year’s inflation shortfall is roughly 0.1 percentage point larger than the estimate\nreported in figure 8.\n\n\f- 19 than its productive potential. My colleagues and I, based on our most recent forecasts,\nanticipate that this pattern will continue and that labor market conditions will improve\nfurther as we head into 2016.\nThe labor market has achieved considerable progress over the past several years.\nEven so, further improvement in labor market conditions would be welcome because we\nare probably not yet all the way back to full employment. Although the unemployment\nrate may now be close to its longer-run normal level--which most FOMC participants\nnow estimate is around 4.9 percent--this traditional metric of resource utilization almost\ncertainly understates the actual amount of slack that currently exists: On a cyclically\nadjusted basis, the labor force participation rate remains low relative to its underlying\ntrend, and an unusually large number of people are working part time but would prefer\nfull-time employment.32 Consistent with this assessment is the slow pace at which hourly\nwages and compensation have been rising, which suggests that most firms still find it\nrelatively easy to hire and retain employees.\nReducing slack along these other dimensions may involve a temporary decline in\nthe unemployment rate somewhat below the level that is estimated to be consistent, in the\nlonger run, with inflation stabilizing at 2 percent. For example, attracting discouraged\nworkers back into the labor force may require a period of especially plentiful\nemployment opportunities and strong hiring. Similarly, firms may be unwilling to\nrestructure their operations to use more full-time workers until they encounter greater\ndifficulty filling part-time positions. Beyond these considerations, a modest decline in\n\n32\n\nFor a further discussion of the current level of resource utilization, see the Federal Reserve Board’s most\nrecent Monetary Policy Report, dated July 15, 2015, available on the Board’s website at\nwww.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/mpr_default.htm.\n\n\f- 20 the unemployment rate below its long-run level for a time would, by increasing resource\nutilization, also have the benefit of speeding the return to 2 percent inflation. Finally,\nalbeit more speculatively, such an environment might help reverse some of the significant\nsupply-side damage that appears to have occurred in recent years, thereby improving\nAmericans’ standard of living. 33\nConsistent with the inflation framework I have outlined, the medians of the\nprojections provided by FOMC participants at our recent meeting show inflation\ngradually moving back to 2 percent, accompanied by a temporary decline in\nunemployment slightly below the median estimate of the rate expected to prevail in the\nlonger run. These projections embody two key judgments regarding the projected\nrelationship between real activity and interest rates. First, the real federal funds rate is\ncurrently somewhat below the level that would be consistent with real GDP expanding in\nline with potential, which implies that the unemployment rate is likely to continue to fall\nin the absence of some tightening. Second, participants implicitly expect that the various\nheadwinds to economic growth that I mentioned earlier will continue to fade, thereby\nboosting the economy’s underlying strength. Combined, these two judgments imply that\nthe real interest rate consistent with achieving and then maintaining full employment in\nthe medium run should rise gradually over time. This expectation, coupled with inherent\nlags in the response of real activity and inflation to changes in monetary policy, are the\nkey reasons that most of my colleagues and I anticipate that it will likely be appropriate\nto raise the target range for the federal funds rate sometime later this year and to continue\n\n33\n\nFor a discussion of the supply-side damage that has occurred since 2007 and the potential benefits of\npartially reversing it through more accommodative monetary policy, see Reifschneider, Wascher, and\nWilcox (2015) and Van Zandweghe (forthcoming).\n\n\f- 21 boosting short-term rates at a gradual pace thereafter as the labor market improves further\nand inflation moves back to our 2 percent objective.\nBy itself, the precise timing of the first increase in our target for the federal funds\nrate should have only minor implications for financial conditions and the general\neconomy. What matters for overall financial conditions is the entire trajectory of shortterm interest rates that is anticipated by markets and the public. As I noted, most of my\ncolleagues and I anticipate that economic conditions are likely to warrant raising shortterm interest rates at a quite gradual pace over the next few years. It’s important to\nemphasize, however, that both the timing of the first rate increase and any subsequent\nadjustments to our federal funds rate target will depend on how developments in the\neconomy influence the Committee’s outlook for progress toward maximum employment\nand 2 percent inflation.\nThe economic outlook, of course, is highly uncertain and it is conceivable, for\nexample, that inflation could remain appreciably below our 2 percent target despite the\napparent anchoring of inflation expectations. Here, Japan’s recent history may be\ninstructive: As shown in figure 9, survey measures of longer-term expected inflation in\nthat country remained positive and stable even as that country experienced many years of\npersistent, mild deflation.34 The explanation for the persistent divergence between actual\nand expected inflation in Japan is not clear, but I believe that it illustrates a problem faced\nby all central banks: Economists’ understanding of the dynamics of inflation is far from\nperfect. Reflecting that limited understanding, the predictions of our models often err,\n\n34\n\nIn addition, we cannot count on expectations remaining anchored if the Federal Reserve were to permit\nactual inflation to continue to run noticeably below its announced objective after the real economy has\nsubstantially recovered.\n\n\f- 22 sometimes significantly so. Accordingly, inflation may rise more slowly or rapidly than\nthe Committee currently anticipates; should such a development occur, we would need to\nadjust the stance of policy in response.\nConsiderable uncertainties also surround the outlook for economic activity. For\nexample, we cannot be certain about the pace at which the headwinds still restraining the\ndomestic economy will continue to fade. Moreover, net exports have served as a\nsignificant drag on growth over the past year and recent global economic and financial\ndevelopments highlight the risk that a slowdown in foreign growth might restrain U.S.\neconomic activity somewhat further. The Committee is monitoring developments\nabroad, but we do not currently anticipate that the effects of these recent developments on\nthe U.S. economy will prove to be large enough to have a significant effect on the path\nfor policy. That said, in response to surprises affecting the outlook for economic activity,\nas with those affecting inflation, the FOMC would need to adjust the stance of policy so\nthat our actions remain consistent with inflation returning to our 2 percent objective over\nthe medium term in the context of maximum employment.\nGiven the highly uncertain nature of the outlook, one might ask: Why not hold\noff raising the federal funds rate until the economy has reached full employment and\ninflation is actually back at 2 percent? The difficulty with this strategy is that monetary\npolicy affects real activity and inflation with a substantial lag. If the FOMC were to\ndelay the start of the policy normalization process for too long, we would likely end up\nhaving to tighten policy relatively abruptly to keep the economy from significantly\novershooting both of our goals. Such an abrupt tightening would risk disrupting financial\nmarkets and perhaps even inadvertently push the economy into recession. In addition,\n\n\f- 23 continuing to hold short-term interest rates near zero well after real activity has returned\nto normal and headwinds have faded could encourage excessive leverage and other forms\nof inappropriate risk-taking that might undermine financial stability. For these reasons,\nthe more prudent strategy is to begin tightening in a timely fashion and at a gradual pace,\nadjusting policy as needed in light of incoming data.\nConclusion\nTo conclude, let me emphasize that, following the dual mandate established by\nthe Congress, the Federal Reserve is committed to the achievement of maximum\nemployment and price stability. To this end, we have maintained a highly\naccommodative monetary policy since the financial crisis; that policy has fostered a\nmarked improvement in labor market conditions and helped check undesirable\ndisinflationary pressures. However, we have not yet fully attained our objectives under\nthe dual mandate: Some slack remains in labor markets, and the effects of this slack and\nthe influence of lower energy prices and past dollar appreciation have been significant\nfactors keeping inflation below our goal. But I expect that inflation will return to\n2 percent over the next few years as the temporary factors that are currently weighing on\ninflation wane, provided that economic growth continues to be strong enough to complete\nthe return to maximum employment and long-run inflation expectations remain well\nanchored. Most FOMC participants, including myself, currently anticipate that achieving\nthese conditions will likely entail an initial increase in the federal funds rate later this\nyear, followed by a gradual pace of tightening thereafter. But if the economy surprises\nus, our judgments about appropriate monetary policy will change.\n\n\f- 24 References\nAscari, Guido, and Argia M.

In addition, the original version of the appendix incorrectly reported that the adjustment factor\nused to convert historical readings on expected long-run inflation from a CPI basis to a PCE basis was\n50 basis points.\n\n\f- 29 points prior to 2007 to put the CPI forecasts on a PCE basis. (Prior to 1991:Q4, this\nseries is based on the long-run inflation expectations reported in the Hoey survey.) The\nrelative import price term, 𝑅𝑃𝐼𝑀𝑡 , is defined as the annualized growth rate of the price\nindex for core imported goods (defined to exclude petroleum, natural gas, computers, and\nsemiconductors), less the lagged four-quarter change in core PCE inflation, all multiplied\nby the share of nominal core imported goods in nominal GDP.36\nTo decompose recent movements in inflation into its various components, the\nseries used in the inflation model--for which data are available only through 2015:Q2 in\nmost cases--are first extended through the end of 2015. In the case of inflation, the\nextensions are consistent with the medians of FOMC participants’ projections for total\nand core PCE inflation in 2015 that were reported at the press conference following the\nSeptember FOMC meeting.37 Similarly, 𝑆𝐿𝐴𝐶𝐾𝑡 over the second half of 2015 is defined\nto be consistent with the median of FOMC projections for the 2015:Q4 unemployment\nrate, less the CBO’s estimates of the historical path of the long-run natural rate; the\nCBO’s 2015 estimate is almost identical to the median of FOMC participants’ most\nrecent projections of the normal longer-run level of the unemployment rate. For changes\nin the prices of consumer energy and core imports, the 2015:H2 extrapolations are based\non regressions of these two series on current and lagged changes in, respectively, crude\noil prices and exchange rates. This approach predicts that energy prices should decline at\nannual rates of about 6 percent in 2015:Q3 and 18 percent in 2015:Q4, while core import\n\n36\n\nThis measure of core import prices is constructed by Board staff using published and unpublished data\nprovided by the Bureau of Economic Analysis and the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n37\nThe information on participants’ forecasts provided at the September 17, 2015, press conference is\navailable on the Board’s website at\nwww.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/fomcprojtabl20150917.pdf.\n\n\f- 30 prices should fall about 2-1/2 percent at an annual rate in both quarters.38 Food prices are\nassumed to remain flat at their 2015:Q2 level; this assumption ensures that the combined\ncontribution of food and energy prices to inflation in 2015 is consistent with the median\ndifference between FOMC participants’ projections for total and core inflation. Finally,\nnominal spending shares for food, energy, and core imports are assumed to remain\nunchanged at their 2015:Q2 levels, and long-run inflation expectations are assumed to\nremain constant at 2 percent.\nAfter computing historical 𝜖𝑡 tracking errors for the two equations of the model,\nthe final step in the decomposition procedure is to run a sequence of counter-factual\nsimulations of the model from 1990:Q1 through 2015:Q4. One by one, each explanatory\nvariable of the model is set to zero and the model is simulated; the resulting difference\nbetween actual inflation and its simulated value equals the historical contribution of that\nparticular factor. Importantly, the simulations are all dynamic in that the lagged inflation\nterm in the core inflation equation is set equal to its simulated value in the preceding\nperiod, rather than its actual value. As a result, the decompositions incorporate the\neffects of changes in lagged inflation that are attributable to previous movements in the\nexplanatory variables.\n\n38\n\nThe level of core import prices, expressed relative to core consumer prices, displayed a modest\ndownward trend from 1990 through 2001 but since then has displayed little persistent trend, particularly if\none controls for shifts related to recent changes in the real exchange rate. If the post-2001 pattern persists\nin coming years, then 𝑅𝑃𝐼𝑀𝑡 would be expected to converge to zero within a few quarters and core PCE\ninflation to converge to 2 percent within two or three years, assuming that the unemployment rate remains\nclose to 5 percent (the CBO estimate of the natural rate) and there are no further shocks to the exchange\nrate and other factors. If, however, core import prices were expected to resume trending down relative to\nconsumer prices, then the model as specified would imply that the unemployment rate consistent with\ninflation stabilizing at 2 percent in the longer run would be somewhat lower than 5 percent.\n\n\fFigure 1\n\nU.S. Inflation since the 1960s\n4-quarter percent change\n14\n\n14\nTotal PCE price index\n\n12\n\n12\n\n10\n\n10\n\n8\n\n8\nCore PCE price index\n\n6\n\n6\n\n4\n\n4\n\n2\n\nLong-term trend\n\nQ2\n\n0\n\n2\n0\n\n-2\n\n-2\n1960\n\n1965\n\n1970\n\n1975\n\n1980\n\n1985\n\n1990\n\n1995\n\n2000\n\n2005\n\n2010\n\n2015\n\n2\n\nNote: The data are quarterly.

            "content": "For release at\n8:30 a.m. EDT\nJuly 15, 2015\n\nStatement by\nJanet L. Yellen\nChair\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nbefore the\nCommittee on Financial Services\n\nU.S. House of Representatives\nJuly 15, 2015\n\n\fChairman Hensarling, Ranking Member Waters, and members of the Committee, I am\npleased to present the Federal Reserve’s semiannual Monetary Policy Report to the Congress. In\nmy remarks today, I will discuss the current economic situation and outlook before turning to\nmonetary policy.\nCurrent Economic Situation and Outlook\nSince my appearance before this Committee in February, the economy has made further\nprogress toward the Federal Reserve’s objective of maximum employment, while inflation has\ncontinued to run below the level that the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) judges to be\nmost consistent over the longer run with the Federal Reserve’s statutory mandate to promote\nmaximum employment and price stability.\nIn the labor market, the unemployment rate now stands at 5.3 percent, slightly below its\nlevel at the end of last year and down more than 4-1/2 percentage points from its 10 percent peak\nin late 2009. Meanwhile, monthly gains in nonfarm payroll employment averaged about 210,000\nover the first half of this year, somewhat less than the robust 260,000 average seen in 2014 but\nstill sufficient to bring the total increase in employment since its trough to more than 12 million\njobs. Other measures of job market health are also trending in the right direction, with noticeable\ndeclines over the past year in the number of people suffering long-term unemployment and in the\nnumbers working part time who would prefer full-time employment. However, these measures-as well as the unemployment rate--continue to indicate that there is still some slack in labor\nmarkets. For example, too many people are not searching for a job but would likely do so if the\nlabor market was stronger. And, although there are tentative signs that wage growth has picked\nup, it continues to be relatively subdued, consistent with other indications of slack. Thus, while\n\n\f-2labor market conditions have improved substantially, they are, in the FOMC’s judgment, not yet\nconsistent with maximum employment.\nEven as the labor market was improving, domestic spending and production softened\nnotably during the first half of this year. Real gross domestic product (GDP) is now estimated to\nhave been little changed in the first quarter after having risen at an average annual rate of\n3-1/2 percent over the second half of last year, and industrial production has declined a bit, on\nbalance, since the turn of the year. While these developments bear watching, some of this\nsluggishness seems to be the result of transitory factors, including unusually severe winter\nweather, labor disruptions at West Coast ports, and statistical noise. The available data suggest a\nmoderate pace of GDP growth in the second quarter as these influences dissipate. Notably,\nconsumer spending has picked up, and sales of motor vehicles in May and June were strong,\nsuggesting that many households have both the wherewithal and the confidence to purchase bigticket items. In addition, homebuilding has picked up somewhat lately, although the demand for\nhousing is still being restrained by limited availability of mortgage loans to many potential\nhomebuyers. Business investment has been soft this year, partly reflecting the plunge in oil\ndrilling. And net exports are being held down by weak economic growth in several of our major\ntrading partners and the appreciation of the dollar.\nLooking forward, prospects are favorable for further improvement in the U.S. labor\nmarket and the economy more broadly. Low oil prices and ongoing employment gains should\ncontinue to bolster consumer spending, financial conditions generally remain supportive of\ngrowth, and the highly accommodative monetary policies abroad should work to strengthen\nglobal growth. In addition, some of the headwinds restraining economic growth, including the\neffects of dollar appreciation on net exports and the effect of lower oil prices on capital spending,\n\n\f-3should diminish over time. As a result, the FOMC expects U.S. GDP growth to strengthen over\nthe remainder of this year and the unemployment rate to decline gradually.\nAs always, however, there are some uncertainties in the economic outlook. Foreign\ndevelopments, in particular, pose some risks to U.S. growth. Most notably, although the\nrecovery in the euro area appears to have gained a firmer footing, the situation in Greece remains\ndifficult. And China continues to grapple with the challenges posed by high debt, weak property\nmarkets, and volatile financial conditions. But economic growth abroad could also pick up more\nquickly than observers generally anticipate, providing additional support for U.S. economic\nactivity. The U.S. economy also might snap back more quickly as the transitory influences\nholding down first-half growth fade and the boost to consumer spending from low oil prices\nshows through more definitively.\nAs I noted earlier, inflation continues to run below the Committee’s 2 percent objective,\nwith the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index up only 1/4 percent over the\n12 months ending in May and the core index, which excludes the volatile food and energy\ncomponents, up only 1-1/4 percent over the same period. To a significant extent, the recent low\nreadings on total PCE inflation reflect influences that are likely to be transitory, particularly the\nearlier steep declines in oil prices and in the prices of non-energy imported goods. Indeed,\nenergy prices appear to have stabilized recently.\nAlthough monthly inflation readings have firmed lately, the 12-month change in the PCE\nprice index is likely to remain near its recent low level in the near term. My colleagues and I\ncontinue to expect that as the effects of these transitory factors dissipate and as the labor market\nimproves further, inflation will move gradually back toward our 2 percent objective over the\nmedium term. Market-based measures of inflation compensation remain low--although they\n\n\f-4have risen some from their levels earlier this year--and survey-based measures of longer-term\ninflation expectations have remained stable. The Committee will continue to monitor inflation\ndevelopments carefully.\nMonetary Policy\nRegarding monetary policy, the FOMC conducts policy to promote maximum\nemployment and price stability, as required by our statutory mandate from the Congress. Given\nthe economic situation that I just described, the Committee has judged that a high degree of\nmonetary policy accommodation remains appropriate. Consistent with that assessment, we have\ncontinued to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent and have kept\nthe Federal Reserve’s holdings of longer-term securities at their current elevated level to help\nmaintain accommodative financial conditions.\nIn its most recent statement, the FOMC again noted that it judged it would be appropriate\nto raise the target range for the federal funds rate when it has seen further improvement in the\nlabor market and is reasonably confident that inflation will move back to its 2 percent objective\nover the medium term. The Committee will determine the timing of the initial increase in the\nfederal funds rate on a meeting-by-meeting basis, depending on its assessment of realized and\nexpected progress toward its objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation. If the\neconomy evolves as we expect, economic conditions likely would make it appropriate at some\npoint this year to raise the federal funds rate target, thereby beginning to normalize the stance of\nmonetary policy. Indeed, most participants in June projected that an increase in the federal funds\ntarget range would likely become appropriate before year-end. But let me emphasize again that\nthese are projections based on the anticipated path of the economy, not statements of intent to\nraise rates at any particular time.\n\n\f-5A decision by the Committee to raise its target range for the federal funds rate will signal\nhow much progress the economy has made in healing from the trauma of the financial crisis.\nThat said, the importance of the initial step to raise the federal funds rate target should not be\noveremphasized. What matters for financial conditions and the broader economy is the entire\nexpected path of interest rates, not any particular move, including the initial increase, in the\nfederal funds rate. Indeed, the stance of monetary policy will likely remain highly\naccommodative for quite some time after the first increase in the federal funds rate in order to\nsupport continued progress toward our objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent\ninflation. In the projections prepared for our June meeting, most FOMC participants anticipated\nthat economic conditions would evolve over time in a way that will warrant gradual increases in\nthe federal funds rate as the headwinds that still restrain real activity continue to diminish and\ninflation rises. Of course, if the expansion proves to be more vigorous than currently anticipated\nand inflation moves higher than expected, then the appropriate path would likely follow a higher\nand steeper trajectory; conversely, if conditions were to prove weaker, then the appropriate\ntrajectory would be lower and less steep than currently projected. As always, we will regularly\nreassess what level of the federal funds rate is consistent with achieving and maintaining the\nCommittee’s dual mandate.\nI would also like to note that the Federal Reserve has continued to refine its operational\nplans pertaining to the deployment of our various policy tools when the Committee judges it\nappropriate to begin normalizing the stance of policy. Last fall, the Committee issued a detailed\nstatement concerning its plans for policy normalization and, over the past few months, we have\nannounced a number of additional details regarding the approach the Committee intends to use\nwhen it decides to raise the target range for the federal funds rate.\n\n\f-6Federal Reserve Transparency and Accountability\nThese statements pertaining to policy normalization constitute recent examples of the\nmany steps the Federal Reserve has taken over the years to improve our public communications\nconcerning monetary policy. As this Committee well knows, the Board has for many years\ndelivered an extensive report on monetary policy and economic developments at semiannual\nhearings such as this one. And the FOMC has long announced its monetary policy decisions by\nissuing statements shortly after its meetings, followed by minutes of its meetings with a full\naccount of policy discussions and, with an appropriate lag, complete meeting transcripts.\nInnovations in recent years have included quarterly press conferences and the quarterly release of\nFOMC participants’ projections for economic growth, unemployment, inflation, and the\nappropriate path for the Committee’s interest rate target. In addition, the Committee adopted a\nstatement in 2012 concerning its longer-run goals and monetary policy strategy that included a\nspecific 2 percent longer-run objective for inflation and a commitment to follow a balanced\napproach in pursuing our mandated goals.\nTransparency concerning the Federal Reserve’s conduct of monetary policy is desirable\nbecause better public understanding enhances the effectiveness of policy. More important,\nhowever, is that transparent communications reflect the Federal Reserve’s commitment to\naccountability within our democratic system of government. Our various communications tools\nare important means of implementing monetary policy and have many technical elements. Each\nstep forward in our communications practices has been taken with the goal of enhancing the\neffectiveness of monetary policy and avoiding unintended consequences. Effective\ncommunication is also crucial to ensuring that the Federal Reserve remains accountable, but\n\n\f-7measures that affect the ability of policymakers to make decisions about monetary policy free of\nshort-term political pressure, in the name of transparency, should be avoided.\nThe Federal Reserve ranks among the most transparent central banks. We publish a\nsummary of our balance sheet every week. Our financial statements are audited annually by an\noutside auditor and made public. Every security we hold is listed on the website of the Federal\nReserve Bank of New York. And, in conformance with the Dodd-Frank Act, transaction-level\ndata on all of our lending--including the identity of borrowers and the amounts borrowed--are\npublished with a two-year lag. Efforts to further increase transparency, no matter how well\nintentioned, must avoid unintended consequences that could undermine the Federal Reserve’s\nability to make policy in the long-run best interest of American families and businesses.\nSummary\nIn sum, since the February 2015 Monetary Policy Report, we have seen, despite the soft\npatch in economic activity in the first quarter, that the labor market has continued to show\nprogress toward our objective of maximum employment. Inflation has continued to run below\nour longer-run objective, but we believe transitory factors have played a major role. We\ncontinue to anticipate that it will be appropriate to raise the target range for the federal funds rate\nwhen the Committee has seen further improvement in the labor market and is reasonably\nconfident that inflation will move back to its 2 percent objective over the medium term. As\nalways, the Federal Reserve remains committed to employing its tools to best promote the\nattainment of its dual mandate.\nThank you. I would be pleased to take your questions.\n\n\f"

Given the limited time I have, I will try to lay out some broad themes concerning the\nimplications of the financial crisis for regulatory reform and monetary policy. My comments are\nmy own and do not necessarily reflect the views of my Federal Reserve colleagues. I look\nforward to the extended discussion we shall have later tonight when we will be able to delve\nmore deeply into these critical issues.\nIn the past, monetary and regulatory policies have generally been viewed as separate\ndomains with distinct objectives. The primary focus of monetary policy has been on attaining\nthe macroeconomic goals of low inflation and a stable economy. In the United States, these\ngoals find their expression in the Federal Reserve’s dual mandate of maximum employment and\nprice stability. By contrast, regulatory policy has generally pursued significantly different ends:\nprotecting the safety and soundness of individual financial institutions and reducing systemic\nrisk.\n1\n\nI would like to thank John Williams and Sam Zuckerman for assistance in preparing these remarks.\n\n1\n\n\fOf course, monetary and regulatory policies do not exist in total isolation and the Federal\nReserve, an institution with responsibilities in both domains, has long recognized some important\nlinkages. For example, it’s clear that the effectiveness of monetary policy and the performance\nof the macroeconomy depend greatly on maintaining a stable and healthy financial system. And\na sound economy makes the work of regulators much easier because economic downturns put\nconsiderable stress on the financial system. In addition, the insights we derive from our\nsupervision of banking organizations are helpful in formulating monetary policy. And the\neconomic analysis that underpins monetary policy improves our understanding of the risks\nconfronting financial institutions. Nonetheless, policymakers have generally viewed monetary\nand regulatory questions as separate disciplines, and we have designed our strategies and carried\nout our policies accordingly. 2\nF\n\nThe painful events of the past two years have fundamentally challenged this\ndichotomization of monetary and regulatory policies. It is no longer obvious that setting policies\nto stabilize the economy on the one hand and to safeguard the financial system on the other can\nbe cleanly separated—either in conception or implementation. 3 This experience has important\nF\n\nF\n\nimplications for both monetary and regulatory policy. Here I will focus on the conceptual issues,\nleaving aside vital questions concerning implementation, such as the appropriate division of\nauthority among different regulatory bodies—a subject that is under discussion in the United\nStates.\n\n2\n\nAt times, the connections between monetary policy and regulation have become more apparent. For example, the\nabolition of Regulation Q in the United States had a direct bearing on how monetary policy affected the economy\nand the appropriate monetary policy response to shocks (see Mauskopf 1990).\n\n3\n\nSee Shirakawa (2009) for further discussion on this point.\n\n2\n\n\fLet me start by considering our regulatory responsibilities. Government agencies have\nlong practiced micro-prudential supervision and regulation—that is, oversight of individual\nfinancial institutions aimed at preserving their safety and soundness. Indeed, micro-prudential\nsupervision—including on-site examinations, surveillance, guidance, regulations, and\nenforcement—is the first line of defense against systemic risk. The crisis has taught us valuable\nlessons on how to strengthen supervision going forward. For example, we need to develop\nstronger and more effective capital and liquidity standards, strengthen our oversight of risk\nmanagement practices, and insure that compensation arrangements do not create incentives that\ncould compromise safety and soundness. 4 In the United States, we also gleaned important\nF\n\nF\n\ninsights on how to improve our consolidated supervision of bank holding companies through this\nyear’s stress test of the 19 largest banking organizations, as part of the Supervisory Capital\nAssessment Program. We intend to make such horizontal institutional reviews involving\nmultidisciplinary teams an important component of our supervision going forward. Currently,\nwe are conducting a horizontal assessment of internal processes for evaluating capital adequacy\nat the largest U.S. banking organizations and will shortly undertake a similar horizontal review\nof incentive compensation practices.\nOverall, the crisis has exposed serious deficiencies in our micro-prudential regulatory\nstructure. We clearly need to address gaps, such as inadequate authority or tools to properly\nsupervise the so-called shadow banking system, including major investment banks, nonbank\nlenders, and vital financial insurance providers such as AIG.\nA broad consensus exists that we need to make these changes. But, it is critical to\nrecognize that carrying bigger sticks as micro-prudential supervisors entails tradeoffs between\n\n4\n\nSee, for example, Crockett (2009) and Tarullo (2009) for discussions of these issues.\n\n3\n\n\fstability and efficiency—that is, between managing systemic risk and cultivating a fertile\nenvironment for economic growth. Admittedly, we may well have been operating far off the\noptimal tradeoff curve in recent years! Still, in designing a new regulatory framework, we must\nbe aware that stronger capital standards that reduce leverage might hamper the flow of funds to\nbusinesses and households in ways that could impede investment and consumption. Of course,\nfinding the right balance is an immense challenge.\nTo strike that balance between stability and growth, we should examine what other policy\nweapons should be in our arsenal. Perhaps the most important are in the area of macroprudential oversight, which we increasingly understand is an essential complement to microprudential supervision. Now, what exactly does macro-prudential supervision entail? To me, it\nmeans identifying and correcting behaviors and structures in financial markets that create\nexcessive risk before they mushroom into something that threatens the entire financial system.\nThis requires real-time collection and analysis of data from a wide variety of financial\ninstitutions and markets, the deployment of tools to mitigate the inherent pro-cyclical tendencies\nof financial markets, and new resolution powers to deal with the failure of any institution that\nposes a threat to financial stability.\nMacro-prudential supervision takes a very different perspective than its micro-prudential\nsibling. It’s akin to caring for an entire ecosystem rather than individual trees. It is targeted at\nspillovers and externalities that contribute to systemic risk even when they don’t directly harm\nindividual institutions. An example is an investment strategy that is highly positively correlated\nacross institutions. Taken in isolation, each institution may appear to be adequately managing\nliquidity, capital, and exposure to risk. But, when many large institutions invest in the same\nclass of assets, a downturn in that asset class can cause a rush to the exits as everyone tries to sell\n\n4\n\n\fat the same time. That’s exactly what happened in 2007 and 2008 in the markets for mortgagerelated securities, with disastrous effects that we know too well. In the worst case, correlation\ncan feed contagion that spreads across the globe as institutions seek to rapidly deleverage and\nprotect liquidity. This presents a regulatory challenge of the first order: How are we to measure\nand safeguard against such highly correlated investment strategies? Research is under way now\nto provide some answers. 5 One promising strategy is to implement a system that would require\nF\n\nF\n\nbanking organizations to build capital buffers in good times that could be run down under\nstressful conditions. Such a system could serve as an automatic stabilizer, mitigating the buildup\nof leverage in booms and the destabilizing impact of broad-based deleveraging in downturns.\nOther practices may also be ripe for macro-prudential supervision. They include procyclical underwriting standards, shortcomings in the provision of liquidity and credit risk\nprotection during crises, and payment and clearing systems. 6 For example, markets for over-theF\n\nF\n\ncounter derivatives, including credit default swaps, lack the stabilizing mechanisms associated\nwith central exchanges. 7\nF\n\nF\n\nA key issue in macro-prudential supervision concerns the too-big-to-fail problem of\nsystemically important financial institutions. A number of approaches have been suggested to\nlimit the systemic risk from large, interconnected financial institutions. These include capping\nthe size of these institutions, moving some activities to exchanges or clearing firms, requiring\nthem to hold more capital, and reducing their odds of failure by requiring them to hold debt that\nautomatically converts to equity in a crisis situation. It is also essential to devise effective means\n\n5\n\nSee Caruana (2009) and Adrian and Brunnermeier (2009).\n\n6\n\nSee Bernanke (2009) and Dudley (2009) for further discussion of these and related issues of macro-prudential\nregulation.\n\n7\n\nSee Duffie and Zhu (2009) for an analysis of the problems associated with clearing credit default swap contracts.\n\n5\n\n\fto resolve large, highly interconnected financial institutions in an orderly manner to minimize the\ndamage to the financial system. In the United States, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation\nuses a well-tested and highly effective procedure for resolving commercial banks and thrifts.\nBut, for nondepository financial institutions, the standard bankruptcy process is all that’s\navailable. We’ve seen that the mere hint a financial institution is headed for bankruptcy can set\noff a run, depriving it of vital short-term funding and leaving it incapable of paying creditors. As\nrecent events attest, in the cases of systemically important institutions, the end result can be\nmarket turmoil, cascading declines in valuations, and panic.\nMacro-prudential supervision has the potential to lower systemic risk and thereby create a\nmore secure financial system that will contribute to macroeconomic goals as well. But,\nmonetary policy may also play a role in managing systemic risk. One notable feature of boomand-bust cycles has been highly pro-cyclical leverage at primary dealers, such as investment\nbanks. Recent research by Tobias Adrian and Hyun Shin suggests that monetary policy affects\nthese cycles in asset growth. 8 Specifically, they find that periods when monetary policy is\nF\n\nF\n\n“tight” relative to the predictions of an estimated Taylor rule are associated with weaker growth\nin holdings of repurchase agreements by primary dealers. 9 By contrast, “easy” monetary policy\nF\n\nF\n\nis associated with rapid increases in financial institution balance sheets that can add to systemic\nrisk. 10\nF\n\nThese results suggest that monetary policy could play a role in restraining undesirable\nswings in leverage and, by extension, reduce systemic risk. In particular, interest rate cuts in a\n8\n\nSee Adrian and Shin (2008a).\n\n9\n\nTaylor (2007) describes a different channel, but comes to the same conclusion that monetary policy can contribute\nto undesirable booms and busts.\n\n10\n\nSee Adrian and Shin (2008b, 2009). They also find evidence that asset growth is linked to housing construction.\n\n6\n\n\ftime of market disruption can be effective at stopping a deleveraging cycle from turning into an\nuncontrolled crash. And higher rates than called for based on purely macroeconomic conditions\nmay help forestall a potentially damaging buildup of leverage and an asset price boom.\nThis raises the broader—and very contentious—issue of whether monetary policy should\nseek to lean against potentially dangerous swings in asset prices. The answer is far from clear,\nbecause the use of monetary policy for these ends necessarily compromises the attainment of\nother macroeconomic goals. Because such use of monetary policy is costly, high priority should\nbe assigned to developing regulatory tools to address systemic risk. Even so, the crisis of the\npast two years has prompted many of us to reexamine the widely held view that monetary policy\nshould respond to asset prices only to the extent that they influence the anticipated trajectories of\ninflation and unemployment. Further research into the connections among monetary policy, the\nbanking and financial sectors, and systemic risk is needed to help answer this question. 11\nF\n\nIn summary, the events of the past few years compel us to reexamine many of our longheld ideas and practices in both monetary and regulatory policy. I am gratified that researchers\naround the world are looking hard at these questions. In addition, I am encouraged by the sense\nof purpose and cooperation exhibited by my colleagues at central banks, governments, and\ninternational organizations in their efforts to develop policies that will help us avoid the kind of\ncrisis we have just experienced. Thank you.\n\n11\n\nIncreasingly macroeconomists are incorporating banking and financial frictions in their macroeconomic models.\nSee, for example, Curdia and Woodford (2009) and Gertler and Karadi (2009).\n\n7\n\n\fReferences\nAdrian, Tobias, and Markus K.

Yellen, President and CEO, Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco\nFor delivery on November 10, 2009, 8:05 AM Mountain Standard Time, 10:05 AM Eastern\n\nThe Outlook for the Economy and Real Estate 1\nF\n\nThank you very much Sheila. It’s a great pleasure to see you again and to join all of you\nthis morning. I want to express my appreciation to Sheila for her excellent service as a member\nand as deputy chair of the San Francisco Federal Reserve Bank’s board of directors from 1999 to\n2004. I am very pleased to have the chance to speak to a group of professionals dedicated to\nadvancing the understanding of land economics. As you know, problems in real estate were\ncentral to the financial crisis and ongoing developments in this sector bear importantly on the\neconomy’s prospects for recovery. So my comments will focus on the economic outlook and I\nwill emphasize the role of real estate in shaping it.\nThroughout my remarks, I will compare the situation in the nation as a whole with that\nhere in Phoenix. I’m always struck when I visit Phoenix by the beauty of your natural setting\nand the great vitality of the city that has grown in this magnificent place. Phoenix demonstrates\na spirit of entrepreneurship, a sense of optimism about the future, and an eagerness to build\nsomething new. But, as the housing market collapsed and the nation fell into financial crisis and\nrecession, your desert metropolis was set back on its heels. Just as you grew faster than the\nnation as a whole during the boom years in the middle of the decade, so did you fall harder when\nthe bust came. I can only imagine what it’s like for those who’ve been blessed with one of the\n\n1\n\nI would like to thank Fred Furlong, John Judd, David Wright, and Sam Zuckerman for assistance in\npreparing these remarks.\n1\n\n\fnation’s most vibrant economies to suffer a setback of this magnitude. I’m pleased to say that I\nthink you will find much in my message this morning that is encouraging.\nThis is the first talk I’ve given since the economy has officially been reported to be\ngrowing again. The economy’s return to growth after a year and a half of recession marks a\nmajor turn and it looks like more than a flash in the pan. It seems to me that the economy has\nentered a sustained period of expansion. We’ve seen meaningful upturns in areas as diverse as\nhousing, consumer spending, industrial production, and foreign trade. And, a number of factors\nbode well for the future, including a better functioning financial system, low mortgage interest\nrates, a resurgent stock market, a stabilization of house prices, and stronger growth abroad.\nAll the same, I am not going to paint an entirely rosy picture for you. The strength and\ndurability of the expansion is in question. Some of the rebound is due to temporary government\nprograms and a swing in inventory investment that will not provide an ongoing source of growth.\nFinancial conditions have improved markedly in some respects, but many financial institutions\nare still hobbled with bad loans. The outlook for consumer spending is in doubt because\nhouseholds remain burdened with debt, and they have taken enormous hits to their wealth from\ndeclines in house and stock prices in recent years. And it’s particularly sobering that labor\nmarkets continue to deteriorate badly, leaving many millions of our fellow Americans unable to\nfind jobs. Just last week, we found out that the unemployment rate passed 10 percent in October.\nThe 10.2 percent jobless rate is the highest since 1983. Today I will consider this mixed picture\nin some detail and focus on two subjects of professional interest to many of you—the residential\nand commercial real estate markets. I want to stress that my comments are my own and do not\nnecessarily reflect the views of my Federal Reserve colleagues.\n\n2\n\n\fAs we look at the national economy, it’s important to keep things in perspective. It’s not\nfun to ponder a subdued recovery. But a year ago, after the near collapse of the global financial\nsystem, there was a real possibility of an outright depression. Fortunately, we avoided that. But\nwhat we did suffer through was bad enough—the worst downturn since the Great Depression of\nthe 1930s. The recession began at the end of 2007. Economic output has dropped by just over\n3½ percent. Over seven million jobs have been lost in the nonfarm sector of the economy. And\nthe unemployment rate has soared by over five percentage points. Few, if any, parts of the\neconomy were unscathed. The labor market was devastated, and housing, consumer spending,\nbusiness investment, exports, and imports all fell off the table.\nPhoenix was particularly hard-hit. In May 2007, the area unemployment rate was an\nextraordinarily low 2.9 percent. By September 2009, the rate had roughly tripled to 8.5 percent.\nThat’s lower than the national rate, but it’s a huge 5.6 percentage point swing. Construction\nrepresented a higher-than-average share of the Arizona economy, and the drag from real estate\nover the past two years has been especially severe in the state.\nAgainst this backdrop, the nation’s third-quarter return to growth was a great relief. Real\ngross domestic product—which is the economy’s total output of goods and services—increased\nat a solid annual rate of 3½ percent. The recession hasn’t officially been declared over, but a\nwide array of data suggests that the corner has been turned. In the third quarter, residential\ninvestment—which was at the center of the downturn—rose at nearly a 25 percent annual rate,\nalbeit from a very low level. Home sales, prices, and housing starts are once again climbing.\nMeanwhile, manufacturing is also beginning to show signs of strength. This was helped by a\nrebound in motor vehicle production, boosted by the government’s temporary cash-for-clunkers\n\n3\n\n\fprogram. Our exports surged as growth abroad picked up. And, importantly, consumer spending\nfinally is growing.\nTo me, the explanation for this turnaround is clear: Massive and concerted responses by\ngovernments and central banks around the world rescued the financial system, brought down\ninterest rates, provided emergency support, and broke the economy’s downward spiral. On the\nmonetary policy side, the Fed has pushed its traditional interest rate lever—the federal funds\nrate—close to zero. And, in order to provide additional stimulus, we put in place an array of\nunconventional programs to spur the flow of credit to households and businesses. These\nmeasures provided funding to banks and restored liquidity to a range of markets. We’ve\nincreased the flow of credit for securities backed by small business loans, consumer loans, and\nother assets. Our large-scale purchases of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac debt and mortgagebacked securities (MBS) helped lower mortgage rates and bolstered the housing market. We’ve\nalso bought longer-term U.S. Treasury debt to help bring private borrowing rates down.\nThese initiatives appear to have eased financial conditions. Clearly, the financial system\nis not yet back to normal, but it has bounced back notably. The stock market has soared since its\nlow in the winter. That rally has helped households recover some of their lost wealth and\nprovided a much-needed psychological boost. Investors perceive that economic risks are not as\ndire as they once seemed to be. Interest rates on corporate bonds—especially for less-than-prime\nfirms—have dropped sharply and issuance has been brisk. And the markets that financial\ninstitutions and corporations rely on for short-term funding are functioning reasonably well\nagain, due in part to Fed intervention.\n\n4\n\n\fFederal government policies also have contributed, including the fiscal stimulus program\npassed by Congress in February. Tax cuts have raised disposable income and government\nspending is directly adding to payrolls. Much of the stimulus money authorized by Congress\nremains to be spent and will spur growth in coming quarters. Other government initiatives\ncontributed to the third-quarter expansion as well, including the cash-for-clunkers program and\nthe $8,000 tax credit for first-time homebuyers.\nThe normal dynamics of the business cycle have also turned more favorable. Demand for\nhouses, durable goods such as autos, and business equipment is beginning to revive as\nhouseholds and businesses replace or upgrade needed equipment and structures. A particularly\nhopeful sign is that inventories of unsold goods, which have been shrinking rapidly, now seem to\nbe in better alignment with sales. Manufacturers had slashed production dramatically in the face\nof slumping sales. Recent data suggest that this correction may be near an end, setting the stage\nfor more production.\nThe big issue is how strong the upturn will be. With such enormous reservoirs of slack in\nthe form of high unemployment and idle productive capacity, we need a strong rebound to put\nunemployed people back to work and get underutilized factories, offices, and stores humming\nagain. Unfortunately, my own forecast envisions a less-than-robust recovery for several reasons.\nAs the impetus from government programs and inventories diminishes in the quarters ahead,\nprivate final demand will have to fill the breach. The danger is that demand may grow at too\nanemic a pace to support vigorous expansion.\nFirst, it may take quite a while for financial institutions to heal to the point that normal\ncredit flows are restored. The credit crunch hasn’t entirely gone away. In the face of massive\n\n5\n\n\floan losses, banks have clamped down on underwriting and credit terms for both businesses and\nconsumers. Smaller businesses without direct access to capital markets are particularly feeling\nthe pinch. Lenders have had to run hard just to stay in place: Rising unemployment, business\nfailures, and delinquencies in real estate markets have fed additional credit losses and made it\nmore difficult for financial institutions to get their balance sheets in good order.\nSecond, households have been pummeled and prospects for consumer spending are\ncloudy. Consumers have surprised us in the past with their free-spending ways and it’s not out\nof the question that they will do so again. But I wouldn’t count on them leading a strong\nrecovery. They face high and rising unemployment, stagnant wages, and heavy debt burdens.\nTheir nest eggs have shrunk dramatically as house and stock prices have fallen, and their access\nto credit has been squeezed.\nIt may be that we are witnessing the start of a new era for consumers following the harsh\nfinancial blows they have endured. 2 We often hear the word “deleveraging” used to describe the\nF\n\nF\n\npush by financial institutions to scale back debt and build equity. Households too have now\nbegun to pay down debt and rebuild their savings. This phenomenon can be seen not only in the\nUnited States, but in most countries that experienced similar housing booms. The United States\nwas hardly the only country where households borrowed heavily just before a severe housing\nbust set in. And those countries with greater increases in debt relative to income before the crisis\nexperienced greater declines in consumption spending once the crisis began.\nIn the United States, the personal saving rate, which had fallen to an incredibly low 1\npercent in early 2008, has averaged 4 percent so far this year and may well rise higher. In the\n\n2\n\nSee Glick and Lansing (2009).\n\n6\n\n\fcurrent environment, such belt-tightening makes great sense from the standpoint of individual\nhouseholds. In fact, some households may have no other option because their access to credit\nhas been crimped. Over the long run, higher saving is surely a good thing for our economy\nbecause it provides capital that can be devoted to modern infrastructure, technology, and other\nproductive investments that enhance our standard of living. All the same, the transition to a\nhigher saving plane could be painful if it reduces the growth rate of consumer spending for an\nextended period.\nWeakness in the labor market is another factor that may keep the recovery sluggish for\nquite some time. Payroll employment has been plummeting for more than a year and a half, and,\neven though the pace of the decline has slowed, unemployment now stands at its highest level\nsince 1983. In addition, many workers have seen their hours cut or are experiencing involuntary\nfurloughs. To bolster earnings in the face of weak revenue growth, employers have been\naggressive in cutting labor costs and jobs, and my business contacts say they will be reluctant to\nhire again until they see clear evidence of a sustained recovery. Weak demand for workers is\nalso putting a lid on paychecks. Wages are barely rising. A well-known measure of overall\nemployment costs rose by only 1¼ percent over the past year, the smallest increase in the history\nof the series. High unemployment, weak job growth, and paltry wage increases are a recipe for\nsluggish consumer spending growth and a tepid recovery.\n\nThe U.S. experienced so-called jobless recoveries following the previous two recessions\nin 1991 and 2001, when job creation remained weak for several years following the business\ncycle trough. In both cases, output growth was less robust than in the typical recovery and,\nunfortunately, things seem to be shaping up similarly this time around.\n\n7\n\n\fNow I’d like to take a close look at real estate markets, both residential and commercial.\nYou may be getting weary of my “on-the-one-hand, on-the-other-hand” message, but I’m afraid I\nhave more of that to offer when it comes to housing. To put it bluntly, the outlook for the\nresidential market is uncertain. And uncertain is much better than the prospects for commercial\nreal estate, which clearly are weak.\n\nLet me begin with housing. We have gone through many boom-and-bust cycles, but\nnone in the past half century have had such far-reaching effects as the wild ride of residential real\nestate during this decade. House prices soared from 2002 through 2005, moving dramatically\nout of line with fundamentals. By one measure, house prices on average peaked more than 50\npercent above the level that could be supported by underlying rental values. Since the market\ntop three years ago, the nation has experienced roughly a 30 percent collapse in average house\nprices, depending on the index used. That’s a terrible plunge, but there’s some good news in it\nfor the future: Prices are approaching a range where valuations are more in line with\nfundamentals. Such an adjustment is essential for a sustained revival of housing activity.\n\nIndeed, there are indications that the sickening market plunge has ended, with prices\nbeginning to edge up. At the same time, home sale volumes are advancing briskly. The supply\nof new houses on the market has been brought down from over 12 months to about 7½ months.\nThat’s still well above the four-month supply that was typical in the period right before the bust,\nbut the adjustment seems to have been enough to kick some life back into construction. In the\nthird quarter, real residential investment surged, though from an admittedly low level. For the\nfirst time in more than three years, housing construction actually added to GDP growth.\n\n8\n\n\fWhat I’ve said about the national housing market can be seen in even sharper relief here\nin Arizona, and especially in the Phoenix area. The metropolitan area’s residential boom-andbust cycle was considerably more pronounced than that of the nation as a whole. Gains in house\nprices were simply spectacular. Fast population and job growth following the 2001 recession\nexplains part of the story. However, the truly exceptional price jumps in 2004 and 2005, just\nbefore the collapse, look to be outsized even given the strong demographic and labor trends.\nSubprime loans represented an especially high proportion of mortgage lending in the region. Not\nsurprisingly, the house price collapse in this area has been especially severe. Price declines are\nas high as 50 percent or more, about 1½ times that of the nation, bringing values back to 2001\nlevels.\nFortunately, things are beginning to look up in Arizona as they are for the nation.\nExisting home sales are up sharply in recent months, although a large share of those are\nforeclosed properties. In the Phoenix area, home prices are now above their lows. A widely\nwatched forecasting survey predicts that 2009 will be the trough for housing permits in Phoenix\nand that 2010 will see significant increases. 3\nF\n\nStill, the Phoenix housing market is nowhere near a return to health. In the face of high\nand rising unemployment, mortgage delinquency and foreclosure rates are still increasing in the\narea. The share of mortgage loans in foreclosure or 60 days or more past due is nearly three\ntimes the national median. And this is by no means largely a subprime problem. Prime\nborrowers now account for the lion’s share of new foreclosures.\n\n3\n\nBlue Chip Economic Forecast Phoenix, Arizona State University, Third Quarter 2009.\nhttp://wpcarey.asu.edu/bluechip/phoenix/index.cfm\n9\n\n\fMeanwhile, developers and their creditors have been caught with excess raw land, lots\nthat are partially completed, or completed but still vacant. Values for finished but vacant lots\nacross the country are reported to be off about 50 percent from their peak, with some hard-hit\nregions in the West down even more. Over the past year and a half, developers and their bankers\nhave been working through this inventory and recognizing the associated losses. As write-offs\non these loans flow through community and regional banks, we can expect more failures.\nTurning back to the national picture, the bottom line is that the outlook for housing has\nturned up in response to favorable mortgage rates, lower house prices, and a lower overhang of\nunsold houses. And growth in this sector should contribute to the overall economic recovery.\nThese developments represent real gains, but it’s important not to get carried away. Some of the\nadvance reflects temporary government support in the form of tax credits for first-time home\nbuyers, and the impact of loan modification programs and foreclosure moratoriums that reduced\nthe pace of distressed sales. Moreover, foreclosure notices surged earlier this year and distressed\nproperty sales may rise once again in the months ahead. If so, we could see renewed pressure on\nhouse prices. Of course, continuing high unemployment will also fuel additional foreclosures.\nAnd the supply of credit for nonconforming mortgages remains extremely tight. Financial\ninstitutions are reluctant to place them on their books when they are trying to reduce leverage\nand we have yet to see any revival of the market for private mortgage-backed securities.\nWhen we turn to commercial real estate, the prospects are worrisome. Commercial\nproperty didn’t turn down until well after housing did. The sector’s problems appear to stem in\nlarge part from the effects of the recession and the credit crunch, rather than the type of building\nboom and lax underwriting standards that tripped up housing. Still, there are some parallels\nbetween the two sectors. As in the residential market, commercial real estate values posted\n10\n\n\fenormous price gains, with office values roughly doubling from the end of the 2001 recession to\nthe peak. Since then, values have plunged an estimated 35 to 40 percent and vacancy rates are\nrising for office, retail, warehouse, and other income-producing properties. In Arizona, office\nvacancy rates started moving up in the second part of 2006 as job growth decelerated abruptly\nfrom an exceptionally fast pace. Vacancies in Phoenix are near 25 percent, about a 13\npercentage point rise from the recent low.\nAs I indicated, credit market conditions are weighing heavily on this sector. Risk\npremiums on commercial real estate financing remain elevated, although they’re down a bit from\nthe peak of the financial crisis. Average commercial real estate capitalization rates have seen\nrisk spreads more than double over the past two years to more than 4 percentage points over 10year Treasury securities. The market for commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS)\nremains deeply distressed and issuance is meager despite support from the Fed’s Term AssetBacked Securities Loan Facility (TALF) and the Treasury’s Public-Private Investment Program\n(PPIP). Banks and thrifts, which account for more than half of commercial real estate financing,\nhave significantly raised rates and tightened credit terms. That, combined with higher investor\ndemands for returns and weakening operating income, points to further downward pressure on\nproperty values.\nCommercial real estate borrowers are increasingly hard-pressed to stay current on their\nloans. CMBS delinquency rates rose from about half a percent in August 2008 to over 3 percent\nthis July. Weakening loan quality is particularly damaging in Arizona where commercial real\nestate accounts for a much larger share of the average bank loan portfolio than in the nation. A\nlarge volume of commercial real estate loans and securities are coming up for renewal over the\nnext several years. This will prompt lenders and investors to review terms for continued\n11\n\n\fextension of credit. In many instances, banks are asking borrowers to either repay loans, provide\nmore equity, or agree to modified terms and conditions. These adverse trends recently prompted\nfederal regulators to issue guidance on commercial real estate to banks and thrifts, with a focus\non sound practices for loan workouts.\nNationwide, the commercial real estate downturn has been a drag on economic growth,\nsubtracting about 1 percent at an annual rate over the first three quarters of this year, compared\nwith a roughly neutral effect in 2008. All indications are that commercial real estate will\ncontinue weighing down the recovery going forward.\nWhen the weakness of the commercial property market is combined with the muted\noutlook for housing and consumer spending, you can see why I believe that the overall economic\nrecovery is likely to be gradual and remain vulnerable to shocks. It’s popular to pick a letter of\nthe alphabet to describe the likely course of the economy. The letter I would choose doesn’t\nexist in our alphabet, but if I were to describe it, it would look something like an “L” with a\ngradual upward tilt of the base. With such a slow rebound, unemployment could well stay high\nfor several years to come. In other words, our recovery is likely to feel like something well short\nof good times.\nThis brings me to inflation, a topic that has been hotly debated. 4 Some people worry\nF\n\nF\n\nabout the long-term inflationary implications of sustained federal budget deficits. Others fear\nthat economic slack and downward wage pressure are pushing inflation below rates that are\nconsistent with price stability. I am in the second camp. Persistent large budget deficits may be\nharmful once the economy recovers because they are apt to boost interest rates and absorb\n\n4\n\nSee Leduc, Rudebusch and Weidner (2009).\n\n12\n\n\fprivate savings that would otherwise finance productive investments. But experience teaches us\nthat budget deficits do not cause inflation in advanced economies with independent central banks\nthat pursue appropriate monetary policies. 5 As for the Fed, you can be 100 percent certain that\nF\n\nF\n\nprice stability will remain our objective, regardless of the stance of fiscal policy.\nI believe that the more significant threat to price stability over the next several years\nstems from enormous slack in the economy that is pushing inflation lower. Today, inflation is\nalready very low. Over the past 12 months, consumer prices as measured by the personal\nconsumption price index actually fell by one-half percent. After removing the effects of volatile\nfood and energy prices, core prices rose by 1¼ percent. That’s below the 2 percent rate that I\nand most of my fellow Fed policymakers on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC)\nconsider an appropriate long-term price stability objective. The public’s inflation expectations,\nwhich can independently influence inflation, remain well anchored, which is appropriate given\nthe Fed’s record and its commitment to price stability. And with slack likely to persist for years\nand wages barely rising, it seems probable that core inflation will move even lower over the next\nfew years.\nThis landscape presents clear challenges for monetary policy. We face an economy with\nsubstantial slack, prospects for only moderate growth, and low and declining inflation. With the\nfederal funds rate already at zero for all practical purposes, the Fed’s traditional policy tool is as\naccommodative as it can be. To provide more stimulus, the Fed has used unconventional policy\ntools, including emergency lending programs to promote liquidity and push longer-term interest\nrates lower. However, many of these programs are winding down or nearing completion. That\n5\n\nSee Fischer, Sahay, and Vegh (2002) and Catao and Terrones (2005) for analysis of the relationship between\ndeficits and inflation in the post-World War II period.\n\n13\n\n\fis why the FOMC stated that “economic conditions, including low rates of resource utilization,\nsubdued inflation trends, and stable inflation expectations, are likely to warrant exceptionally\nlow levels of the federal funds rate for an extended period” following our meeting last week.\nAt some point, of course, we will have to tighten policy—and we certainly have the\nmeans and the will to do so. We are—and always will be—steadfast in our determination to\nachieve both of our statutory goals of full employment and price stability. Until that time comes\nthough, we need to provide the monetary accommodation necessary to spur job creation and\nprevent inflation from falling any further below rates that are consistent with price stability.\nThank you very much.\n\nReferences\nCatao, Luis A.V., and Marco E.

Yellen, President and CEO, Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco\nFor delivery on September 14, 2009, 12:50 PM Pacific, 3:50 PM Eastern\n\nThe Outlook for Recovery in the U.S. Economy 1\nF\n\nIt’s a pleasure to appear before a group of professionals who spend as much time trying\nto understand the financial markets and the economy as I do. It’s fair to say that the last two or\nthree years have provided all of us an education—a far-from-welcome one—of just how\ncomplex these subjects are. We have had to rethink old assumptions and question conventional\nwisdom in the face of a crisis whose dimensions few of us might have imagined.\nI am hugely relieved that our financial system appears to have survived this near-death\nexperience. And, as painful as this recession has been, I believe that we succeeded in avoiding\nthe second Great Depression that seemed to be a real possibility. Much of the recent economic\ndata suggest that the economy has bottomed out and that the worst risks are behind us. The\neconomy seems to be brushing itself off and beginning its climb out of the deep hole it’s been in.\nThat’s the good news. But I regret to say that I expect the recovery to be tepid. What’s\nmore, the gradual expansion gathering steam will remain vulnerable to shocks. The financial\nsystem has improved but is not yet back to normal. It still holds hazards that could derail a\nfragile recovery. Even if the economy grows as I expect, things won’t feel very good for some\ntime to come. In particular, the unemployment rate will remain elevated for a few more years,\nmeaning hardship for millions of workers. Moreover, the slack in the economy, demonstrated by\nhigh unemployment and low utilization of industrial capacity, threatens to push inflation lower at\n1\n\nI would like to thank John Judd, Rob Valletta, and Sam Zuckerman for assistance in preparing these remarks.\n\n1\n\n\fa time when it is already below the level that, in the view of most members of the Federal Open\nMarket Committee (FOMC) best promotes the Fed’s dual mandate for full employment and price\nstability. As a result, monetary policy makers will continue to face a difficult task in the years\nahead.\nDuring the rest of my talk this afternoon, I will try to give a more detailed picture of the\nfinancial and economic landscapes. My comments are my own and do not necessarily reflect the\nviews of my Federal Reserve colleagues.\nAs I noted, we’ve come a long way since last year when the financial system was\nteetering on the edge of collapse. To me, it’s plain that the extraordinary and aggressive\nresponse of governments and central banks around the world saved the day—heading off the\nkind of financial meltdown that would have inflicted catastrophic damage on the economy.\nSome are skeptical about the effectiveness of emergency programs such as TARP, TAF, and\nTALF. But, in my view, these programs staved off disaster. And they have been keeping the\npatient on essential life support as little by little it begins to breathe again on its own.\nWhile the worst was avoided, the financial shock that did hit the economy was awful\nenough. The economy finally fell into recession at the end of 2007 when, on top of an ongoing\ndrag from a contracting housing sector, the ever-dependable American consumer—who had\nshrugged off one shock after another in years past—finally succumbed to the fallout from the\nfinancial crisis. Since the beginning of the downturn, real GDP has fallen by a bit short of 4\npercent and the unemployment rate has jumped by nearly 5 percentage points. Few, if any, parts\nof the economy have escaped the devastation. In addition to the setbacks in housing and\nconsumer spending, business investment, exports, and imports all fell off the table.\n\n2\n\n\fI’m happy to report that the downturn has probably now run its course. This summer\nlikely marked the end of the recession and the economy should expand in the second half of this\nyear. A wide array of data supports this view. However, payrolls are still shrinking at a rapid\npace, even though the momentum of job losses has slowed in the past few months. The housing\nsector finally seems to be improving. Home sales and starts are once again rising from very low\nlevels, and home prices appear to be stabilizing, even rising in recent months according to some\nnational measures. Meanwhile, manufacturing is also beginning to show signs of life, helped\nparticularly by a rebound in motor vehicle production. Importantly, consumer spending finally is\nbottoming out.\nA particularly hopeful sign is that inventories, which have been shrinking rapidly, now\nseem to be in better alignment with sales. That’s occurred because firms slashed production\nrapidly and dramatically in the face of slumping sales. Recent data suggest that this correction\nmay be near an end and firms are now poised to step up production to match sales. In fact, I\nexpect the biggest source of expansion in the second half of this year to come from a diminished\npace of inventory liquidation by manufacturers, wholesalers, and retailers. Such a pattern is\ntypical of business cycles. Inventory investment often is the catalyst for economic recoveries.\nTrue, the boost is usually fairly short-lived, but it can be quite important in getting things going.\nNowhere is this cycle more evident than in the auto sector. Production cutbacks this year have\nled to sharp reductions in inventories. Recently, sales of light vehicles have begun to rise, in part\ndue to the government’s cash-for-clunkers program. As a result, auto manufacturing has picked\nup and, with inventories lean, prospects are good for further production increases.\nIn all of these sectors, improved financial conditions have played a vital part in\nstimulating greater activity. To be sure, the financial system is not yet back to normal and credit\n3\n\n\fis still tight. But there have been notable improvements. The stock market rally has helped\nhouseholds recover some of their lost wealth and provided a much-needed psychological boost.\nInvestors have regained some of their appetite for risk. Interest rates on corporate bonds—\nespecially for less-than-prime firms—have dropped sharply and issuance has been brisk. Federal\nReserve programs to support the mortgage market have helped push rates down. And other Fed\nprograms have helped jump-start issuance of securities backed by consumer and small business\nloans. In the short-term wholesale funding markets, measures of stress have also diminished.\nThe fiscal stimulus program passed by Congress in February also deserves credit for\nhelping the economy turn the corner. Its tax cuts have raised disposable income, and\ngovernment spending is directly adding to payrolls, providing another source of household\nincome. Much of the stimulus money remains to be spent and will add to growth as the year\nproceeds.\nThe normal dynamics of the business cycle have also turned more favorable. Some\neconomic sectors are growing again simply because they sank so low. The inventory adjustment\nI just discussed is one factor, although the biggest part of those benefits usually is only felt for a\nfew quarters. But other business cycle patterns can be longer lasting. Demand for houses,\ndurable goods such as autos, and business equipment is beginning to revive as households and\nfirms replace or upgrade needed equipment and structures.\nI’d like to pause for a moment to make a few observations about the Bay Area economy.\nThe recession has been felt keenly here. Employment is down about 6 percentage points from its\npeak in late 2007. The unemployment rate has risen by more than 6 percentage points to just\nover 10 percent from its low point in late 2006, outstripping the national increase.\n\n4\n\n\fA harsh slump in information technology, due to plunging business spending on tech\nequipment and services, has prompted extensive job cuts and been a key factor driving down the\narea economy. Employment has fallen especially steeply on the hardware side, although IT\nservice providers have cut back as well.\nFortunately, IT seems to be on the mend. Sales of U.S.-made semiconductors are up\nsubstantially in recent months, prompting some prominent companies to bump up earnings\noutlooks for the remainder of the year. My local contacts have noted an uptick in venture capital\ninvestment, and they say that companies that received venture funding in the past are doing\nbetter at meeting performance benchmarks. Overall, the area’s IT industry is in much better\nshape than it was following the dot-com bust of the early 2000s. Clearly, it has struggled during\nthis downturn. But, this time around, it is not recovering from bubble-driven overexpansion, so\nit is well-positioned to take advantage of an economic upswing.\nThe area’s housing market is also showing signs of life. Sales of existing homes have\nbeen rising since late last year. Of course, the pickup has been propelled in part by sales of\nforeclosed homes and widespread availability of properties at bargain-basement prices. As we\nall know, Bay Area home prices have been decimated. Estimates of the cumulative decline over\nthe past few years range from about 15 percent to as high as 45 percent. Many local\nhomeowners are under water, and that’s helped feed the foreclosure wave. While it’s too soon to\nbe sure, this pernicious process may finally be coming to an end. Some recent data show price\nincreases and a notable pickup in sales of higher-end properties over the past few months.\nReturning to the national economy, the all-important question is how strong the upturn\nwill be. With unemployment at 9.7 percent of the workforce and capacity utilization at its lowest\n\n5\n\n\flevel of the post-World War II period, the economy has an enormous amount of slack. That\ngives us plenty of room to grow rapidly over the next few years. Indeed, we need to grow\nrobustly to alleviate the enormous human toll resulting from high unemployment and the waste\nof so much idle industrial capacity. At first glance, history suggests that a vigorous expansion\ncould very well take place. Following previous deep recessions, the United States typically saw\nV-shaped recoveries. For example, the economy grew at an average rate of nearly 6 percent\nduring the two years following the severe recession in 1981-82.\nThis time though rapid growth does not seem to be in store. My own forecast envisions a\nfar less robust recovery, one that would look more like the letter U than V. And I’m not alone.\nThe Blue Chip consensus forecast, reflecting the views of nearly 50 professional forecasters,\nanticipates by far the weakest recovery of the postwar era over the next year and a half. A large\nbody of evidence supports this guarded outlook. It is consistent with experiences around the\nworld following recessions caused by financial crises. 2 That seems to be because it takes quite a\nF\n\nF\n\nwhile for financial systems to heal to the point that normal credit flows are restored. That is\nwhat I expect this time. In the buildup to the recession, financial institutions became highly\nleveraged, a vulnerability compounded by investments in complex and risky assets funded with\nshort-term debt. In an attempt to improve credit quality and reduce risk, banks have now\ntightened business and consumer lending standards. They have been doing so at the same time\nthat rising unemployment and falling house prices have fed additional credit losses.\n\nUnfortunately, more credit losses are in store even as the economy improves and overall\nfinancial conditions ease. Certainly, households remain stressed. In the face of high and rising\nunemployment, delinquencies and foreclosures are showing no sign of turning around. The\n2\n\nSee Reinhart and Rogoff (2009) for evidence on this issue.\n\n6\n\n\fdelinquency rate on adjustable-rate mortgages is now up to about 18 percent, and, on fixed-rate\nloans, it’s about 6 percent. 3 Delinquencies on both types of loans have increased sharply over\nF\n\nF\n\nthe past year and are still rising. This trend is consistent across other major loan categories, and\nis affecting high- and low-quality borrowers alike. Even recent-vintage loans are experiencing\nrising delinquency rates.\n\nWhile it is important for economic recovery that lenders provide credit to worthy\nhouseholds and businesses, they also must maintain enough capital to withstand losses—even if\neconomic conditions turn out to be worse than anticipated. In the face of continuing credit\nlosses, moves by lenders to shrink assets, reduce leverage, and conserve capital are restricting the\nprovision of credit in the economy. For example, the Fed’s Senior Loan Officer Survey on Bank\nLending Practices conducted in July showed that, for consumer loans, far more banks are\ntightening standards than easing them, despite some improvements in this measure in recent\nmonths.\n\nNormally, if credit flows were restricted by these types of financial headwinds, the Fed\nwould ease the stance of monetary policy by cutting its federal funds rate target. But the funds\nrate is already at zero for all practical purposes, leaving the Fed’s traditional policy tool as\naccommodative as it can be. In fact, many versions of the Taylor rule, a well-known policy\nbenchmark based on the state of the economy and inflation, indicate that we should lower the\nfunds rate well below this zero bound—if such a thing were possible. To provide more\naccommodation, the Fed has used unconventional policy tools. Collectively, these programs,\nwhich have provided us a slew of new acronyms, appear to be helping. But we have little\n\n3\n\nThese figures refer to mortgages that are delinquent for 60 or more days or are in foreclosure.\n\n7\n\n\fexperience with them and the extent of their effectiveness is highly uncertain. So here’s the\nbottom line: Financial conditions have clearly eased compared to the darkest days of the\nfinancial crisis. But the financial system is still far from healthy and tight credit is likely to put a\ndamper on growth for some time to come.\n\nA sputtering financial system is not the only challenge before us. The chances are slim\nfor a robust rebound in consumer spending, which represents around 70 percent of economic\nactivity. Of course, consumers are getting a boost from the fiscal stimulus package. But this\nprogram is temporary. Over the long term, consumers face daunting issues of their own. In fact,\nit’s easy to draw a comparison between the financial state of households and that of financial\ninstitutions. For years prior to the recession, households went on a spending spree. This\noccurred during a period that economists call the “Great Moderation,” about two decades when\nrecessions were infrequent and mild, and inflation was low and stable. Credit became ever easier\nto get and consumers took advantage of this to borrow and buy. Stock and home prices rose year\nafter year, giving households additional wherewithal to keep spending. In this culture of\nconsumption, the personal saving rate fell from around 10 percent in the mid-1980s to 1½\npercent or lower in recent years. At the same time, households took on larger proportions of\ndebt. From 1960 to the mid-1980s, debt represented a manageable 65 percent of disposable\nincome. Since then, it has risen steadily, with a notable acceleration in the last economic\nexpansion. By 2008, it had doubled to about 130 percent of income.\n\nIt may well be that we are witnessing the start of a new era for consumers following the\ntraumatic financial blows they have endured. 4 The destruction of their nest eggs caused by\nF\n\nF\n\nfalling house and stock prices is prompting them to rebuild savings. The personal saving rate is\n4\n\nSee Glick and Lansing (2009).\n\n8\n\n\ffinally on the rise, averaging almost 4½ percent so far this year. While certainly sensible from\nthe standpoint of individual households, this retreat from debt-fueled consumption could reduce\nthe growth rate of consumer spending for years. An increase in saving should ultimately support\nthe economy’s capacity to produce and grow by channeling resources from consumption to\ninvestment. And higher investment is the key to greater productivity and faster growth in living\nstandards. But the transition could be painful if subpar growth in consumer spending holds back\nthe pace of economic recovery.\n\nWeakness in the labor market is another factor that may keep the recovery in low gear for\na while. As I mentioned, payroll employment has been plummeting for a year and a half. While\nthe August employment report offered more evidence that the pace of the decline has slowed,\nunemployment now stands at its highest level since 1983. My business contacts indicate that\nthey will be very reluctant to hire again until they see clear evidence of a sustained recovery, and\nthat suggests we could see another so-called jobless recovery in which employment growth lags\nthe improvement in overall output. What’s more, wage growth has slowed sharply. Over the\nfirst half of this year, the employment cost index for private-industry workers has risen by a\nmeager three-quarters of one percent. Unemployment, job insecurity, and low growth in\nincomes will undoubtedly take a toll on consumption. When the array of problems facing\nconsumers is considered, it is hard to see how we can avoid sluggish spending growth.\n\nPutting the whole puzzle together, the main impetus to growth in the second half of this\nyear will be inventory investment. The boost it provides will be a big help for a while, but we\nwill need to look to other sectors to sustain growth. The fact that the largest sector of the\neconomy—consumer spending—is likely to be lackluster implies a less-than-robust expansion.\n\n9\n\n\fEven the gradual recovery we expect will be vulnerable to shocks, especially from the financial\nsector. As I said, financial conditions are better, but not back to normal. And the likelihood of\ncontinuing losses by financial institutions will add new fuel to the credit crunch. In particular,\nsmall and medium-size banks could experience damaging losses on commercial real estate loans.\nThus far, the largest losses have been on loans for construction and land development. Going\nforward, however, rising loan losses on other commercial real estate lending is likely because\nproperty values are falling, office vacancy rates are rising, and credit remains tight or nonexistent\nfor those many property owners that will need to refinance mortgages over the next few years.\nFinancial contagion from this sector is one of the most important threats to recovery.\n\nThe slow recovery I expect means that it could still take several years to return to full\nemployment. The same is true for capacity utilization in manufacturing. It will take a long time\nbefore these human and capital resources are put to full use.\nThis brings me to the complex topic of inflation. In my career, I have never witnessed a\nsituation like the one that exists now, when views about inflation risks have coalesced into two\ndiametrically opposed camps. On the one hand, one group worries about the long-term\ninflationary implications of a seemingly endless procession of massive federal budget deficits.\nAt the same time, others fear that economic slack and downward wage pressure are pushing\ninflation below rates that are considered consistent with price stability and even raising the\nspecter of outright deflation. This dichotomy is on display among the participants in the Survey\nof Professional Forecasters. The lowest quartile of forecasters focuses on disinflation over the\nnext five years. The top quartile is preoccupied with the possibility of rising inflation five to ten\nyears out.\n\n10\n\n\fThe fear of higher long-term inflation reflects, to a large degree, worries about Fed\nmonetary policy. Our array of new programs to spur the economy have pumped up our balance\nsheet and created a huge quantity of bank reserves in the process. Some worry that we won’t be\nable to shrink our balance sheet because of political pressures, and in the process we will end up\nmonetizing the government debt. This fear is real, growing, and disruptive. That’s why it’s so\nimportant for me to say the following loud and clear: We at the Fed are and will remain fiercely\nindependent from politics. We have the means—and we certainly have the will—to tighten\npolicy when the time is right. In fact, by raising the interest rate that we pay on excess reserves\nwe can tighten monetary policy even before our balance sheet shrinks. And we are, as always,\nsteadfast in our determination to achieve both of our statutory goals of full employment and price\nstability.\nMy personal belief is that the more significant threat to price stability over the next\nseveral years stems from the disinflationary forces unleashed by the enormous slack in the\neconomy. The 1980s provides a useful historical comparison. During that period, fears about\nburgeoning federal deficits and an unsustainable fiscal situation were widespread, as they are\ntoday. Moreover, the Fed was under significant political pressure, and some worried whether it\nwould be able to safeguard its independence. But those circumstances didn’t ignite a renewed\nbout of inflation. Unemployment nearly hit 11 percent in 1982 and oil prices were sinking. Core\npersonal consumption expenditure (PCE) inflation—the Fed’s preferred measure—fell about 6\npercentage points during the first half of the 1980s.\nOf course, that period differed from ours in one critical respect. Then, inflation was\ncoming down from unacceptably high levels. Monetary policy was designed to be tight enough\nto bring inflation down to price stability, a goal we accomplished and have maintained for two11\n\n\fand-a-half decades. Today, we are starting with very low inflation. Core PCE price inflation has\naveraged just under 1½ percent over the past twelve months, which is already below the 2\npercent rate that I and most of my FOMC colleagues consider an appropriate long-term price\nstability objective. With slack likely to persist for years, it seems likely that core inflation will\nmove even lower, departing yet farther from our price stability objective.\nFrom a monetary policy point of view, the landscape will continue to present challenges.\nWe face an economy with substantial slack, prospects for only moderate growth, and low and\ndeclining inflation. With our policy rate already as low as it can go, it’s no wonder that the\nFOMC’s last statement indicated that “economic conditions are likely to warrant exceptionally\nlow levels of the federal funds rate for an extended period.” I can assure you that we will be\nready, willing, and able to tighten policy when it’s necessary to maintain price stability. But,\nuntil that time comes, we need to defend our price stability goal on the low side and promote full\nemployment. Thank you very much.\n\n12\n\n\fReferences\nGlick, Reuven, and Kevin J.

Yellen, President and CEO, Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco\nFor delivery on Tuesday, July 28, 2009, 9:35 AM Pacific time, 12:35 PM Eastern\n\nThe Outlook for the U.S. Economy and Community Banks 1\nF\n\nThank you very much. I’m delighted to be able to talk to an audience of community\nbankers in such a beautiful setting. The 12th Federal Reserve District stretches from Utah to\nHawaii, and from Arizona to Alaska. As I travel around this region, I often think how lucky I am\nto be able to visit some of the most breathtaking places in the United States. Coeur d’Alene is\nclearly among them.\nI will speak today about the difficult economic landscape lying before us and what that\nmeans for community banks. It’s fair to say that you have been caught in a financial and\neconomic crisis that you did not create, one precipitated in part by exotic financial engineering\ncarried out mainly by large financial institutions, not banks like yours. Community banks\ngenerally steered clear of the market for credit default swaps and didn’t create structured\ninvestment vehicles to keep assets off of balance sheets. Now though all of us must live with the\nconsequences of the culture of risk that permeated the global financial system. The near collapse\nof that system and the severe recession that continues today have created an exceptionally\nstressful environment even for well-run banks. That leaves little choice except to take the proper\nsteps to manage through this storm, a point I will expand on later in my talk.\n\n1\n\nI would like to thank Teresa Curran, John Judd, Maureen O’Byrne, and Sam Zuckerman for assistance in preparing\nthese remarks.\n\n\fI’ll start my remarks by giving you my perspective on the current economic landscape\nand prospects for recovery. I will then offer some thoughts about inflation, a subject I know\nconcerns many of you. And I will finish by reviewing the situation faced by community banks in\nthe Pacific Northwest and the 12th District as a whole. As always, my comments represent my\nown views and not necessarily those of my colleagues in the Federal Reserve System.\nEconomic and financial conditions\nIt was less than a year ago that the financial system found itself on the very brink of\ncollapse. As home prices tumbled, loan losses cascaded through our financial system. These\nlosses started in subprime markets but spread broadly across nearly all sectors, exposing\nweaknesses in market structures and the practices of many financial institutions. When Lehman\nBrothers failed in September 2008, vital wholesale funding markets seized up, precipitating the\nmost catastrophic liquidity crisis since the 1930s. Only the most aggressive intervention by\ngovernments and central banks around the world prevented outright financial meltdown. Some\npeople grumble about programs such as TARP, TAF, TALF, and the rest of the alphabet soup.\nBut it’s important to remember how close we were to something unimaginable. Those initiatives\nmay not have been perfect, but I believe they succeeded in supporting the system until a measure\nof confidence returned.\nFinancial trauma of this magnitude could have nothing but the direst effects on economic\nactivity. As we all know, the financial earthquake of the summer and fall was quickly followed\nby aftershocks that rocked the broader economy, intensifying a credit crunch, and producing\nprecipitous drops in employment and economic output. The interaction between the economy\n\n2\n\n\fand the credit crunch—often described as an adverse feedback loop—led to what could become\nthe most severe recession since the Great Depression.\nThat’s the backdrop to our current situation. And here the picture turns brighter, as we\nglimpse the first solid signs since the recession started more than a year and a half ago that\neconomic growth may be poised to resume. Indeed, I expect that to happen sometime this year.\nFinancial conditions have improved markedly in recent months. The stock market has rallied\nand investor appetite for corporate bonds and other assets has rebounded, restoring access to\ncapital at reasonable rates for many healthy companies, including financial institutions.\nMeasures of stress in the markets for short-term funding have also diminished. At the same time,\nthe housing sector finally seems to be stabilizing. Housing starts have leveled off and, in an\nencouraging sign, sales are beginning to improve. Meanwhile, house price declines may finally\nbe abating. Consumer spending may also be stabilizing. Payrolls are still shrinking at a dreadful\npace, but at least the momentum of job losses has slowed a bit in the past two months.\nOregon and Idaho have been hit hard by the recession, with unemployment rising in both\nstates at a faster pace than in the nation as a whole. 2 Both Oregon and Idaho have large\nF\n\nF\n\nproportions of technology manufacturing jobs, which have been vulnerable to the sharp\ndownturn in that sector. And Oregon is highly dependent on international trade, 3 which has\nF\n\nF\n\nexperienced a historic contraction. Oregon’s unemployment rate was 12.2 percent in June, the\nthird highest in the nation.\n\n2\n\nOregon’s unemployment rate has risen from a low of 5 percent in April 2007 to 12.2 percent in June 2009, an\nincrease of 7.2 percentage points. Idaho’s rate has jumped from 2.8 percent in May 2007 to 8.4 percent in June 2009,\nan increase of 5.6 percentage points. By comparison, the U.S. unemployment rate went from 4.4 percent in March\n2007 to 9.5 percent in the latest period, an increase of 5.1 percentage points.\n\n3\n\nThe value of merchandise exports as a share of gross state product was 12 percent in Oregon in 2008. For the\nUnited States, the comparable percentage was 9.1 percent.\n\n3\n\n\fLooking ahead at the national economy, a variety of sources will fuel growth in the\nmonths ahead, including expansionary fiscal and monetary policies, and the normal dynamics of\nthe business cycle. The fiscal stimulus program passed by Congress in February provides tax\ncuts that have raised household income. In addition, government spending is directly adding to\npayrolls and boosting demand. More stimulus will come on line as the year proceeds. This\nprogram wasn’t designed to produce an economic recovery by itself, but rather to cushion our\nfall. In that sense, it’s doing its job.\nMonetary policy too has contributed to recovery. As you know, the Fed is using both\ntraditional and nontraditional tools to boost the economy. We have set our federal funds rate\ntarget close to zero and indicated that economic conditions are likely to warrant keeping it there\nfor an “extended period.” We have provided liquidity to previously dysfunctional markets, such\nas the asset-backed commercial paper market. And we’ve purchased Treasury and agencyrelated securities for our own portfolio to help push longer-term private borrowing costs lower,\nthereby stimulating demand.\nMeanwhile, the normal dynamics of the business cycle are turning more favorable. Some\nsectors are poised to rebound simply because they have sunk so low. For example, the auto\nindustry has cut production so far that inventories have begun to shrink, even in the face of\nhistorically weak demand. Just slowing the pace of inventory liquidation will bolster economic\nactivity. This story holds for many sectors of the economy where spikes in inventories occurred\nas cautious consumers cut back on purchases of durable goods, and businesses slashed spending\non equipment and software. Looking forward, the demand for houses and durables should also\neventually revive as old and broken-down goods need to be replaced. The resulting demand will\nhelp the economy recover.\n4\n\n\fBut that recovery is likely to be painfully slow. History teaches that it often takes a long\nwhile to recover from downturns caused by financial crises. 4 Financial institutions and markets\nF\n\nF\n\nwon’t heal overnight. And it will take quite some time before households have repaired their\ntattered finances. Until recently, households were saving less and borrowing more in response to\nwealth gains in both stocks and housing. This pattern made their balance sheets vulnerable to\nadverse developments and the crashes in both house and stock prices during the last two years\ndestroyed trillions of dollars of their wealth. Not surprisingly, the personal saving rate has now\nshot higher and I expect to see subdued consumer spending for some time. 5 The unprecedented\nF\n\nF\n\nglobal nature of the recession also will act as a drag. 6 Countries recovering from financial crises\nF\n\nF\n\noften receive a boost from foreign demand, but neither the United States nor its trading partners\ncan count on such external stimulus this time.\nA gradual recovery means that things won’t feel very good for some time to come. The\nunemployment rate currently is 9½ percent, and this figure is likely to rise further. Moreover,\neven after the economy begins to grow, it could still take several years to return to full\nemployment. The same is true for capacity utilization in manufacturing, which has declined so\nfar that it has fallen “off the charts”—now standing at its lowest level in the postwar period.\nFinally, even though downside risks to the outlook have diminished, there remains some\nchance that economic conditions could turn out worse than what I’ve sketched. High on my\nworry list is the possibility of another shock to the still-fragile financial system. Commercial real\nestate is a particular danger zone, but I will hold my discussion of that topic until I turn to\nbanking conditions.\n4\n\nReinhart and Rogoff (2009).\nGlick and Lansing (2009).\n6\nInternational Monetary Fund (2009).\n5\n\n5\n\n\fLet me now address another issue that is garnering attention—inflation. This is a subject\nrife with contradiction. Almost without exception, my business contacts report downward\npressure on wages and prices. At the same time, they tell me they worry that the United States is\non the threshold of serious inflation. They see large federal budget deficits today and more\nlooming on the horizon. They also note that the Fed has pumped up bank reserves and expanded\nits balance sheet to fund its financial support programs. They worry that this may amount to\nfinancing deficits with money creation. Surely, they say, these things will eventually have to\nlead to higher inflation.\nI’ll begin with budget deficits. The gap in the federal budget for the current and the next\nfiscal years are projected to exceed $1 trillion, far larger than anything we’ve ever seen before.\nBut a large part of these current deficits are temporary. A portion stems from the impact of the\nweak economy on the budget. In a recession, tax collections fall and spending on programs such\nas unemployment insurance rise automatically. A significant portion is due to the fiscal stimulus\nthat has been put in place over the next few years to address the recession. Antirecessionary\nfiscal policy, in my view, is entirely appropriate. Since that stimulus is temporary by design, the\nresulting deficits will shrink as the stimulus phases out. But federal deficits will not disappear\ncompletely even when the economy has recovered and the stimulus program has phased out. On\nthe contrary, these ongoing or “structural” deficits are anticipated to stretch indefinitely into the\nfuture and to escalate over time in a manner that ultimately is not sustainable. The long-term\nprojected structural budget deficit mainly reflects the impact of an aging population and rapidly\nrising health-care costs on spending for federal entitlement programs, particularly Medicare and\nMedicaid.\n\n6\n\n\fEconomists have known, worried, and warned the public about the damaging\nconsequences of escalating long-term budget deficits in the United States for decades. It’s high\ntime for our country to tackle the problem head-on. But the main concern with these deficits\nrelates to productivity and living standards, and not high inflation. Large budget deficits do not\ncause high inflation automatically. In fact, since World War II, large deficits have been\nassociated with high inflation only in developing countries. That’s because developing countries\noften have central banks that are under the sway of the government, which sometimes induces\nthem to print money to finance government spending. 7 The connection isn’t found in countries\nF\n\nF\n\nsuch as ours with advanced financial systems and independent central banks. Remember that, in\nthe 1980s, the United States ran large deficits just as inflation was coming down. And Japan has\nhad huge deficits through much of the past two decades, yet its problem is persistent deflation—\nprecisely the opposite of inflation. The United States and most other industrialized countries\nhave central banks with long traditions of independence and deep-seated support for keeping\npolitics out of monetary policy. In those countries, the monetary authorities generally have stuck\nto their inflation objectives, even when governments ran large budget deficits.\nIn advanced countries, the problem isn’t that large deficits cause inflation. Rather it’s\nthat they raise long-term interest rates, thereby crowding out private investment, which holds\nback advances in productivity and living standards. Right now, private investment spending is\nextremely weak, so financing for the large federal deficits is readily available. But once private\nspending recovers, the competition for funds between the government and private sectors could\ndrive interest rates up. A decline in productivity growth is a serious problem—one we should\nstrive to avoid—but it is not the same as inflation.\n\n7\n\nFischer et al. (2002) and Catao and Terrones (2005).\n\n7\n\n\fSo what about the Fed’s unprecedented balance sheet expansion? Our strong steps to\navert financial and economic meltdown have caused our assets to more than double, from under\n$900 billion at the start of the recession to over $2 trillion now. This expansion is largely\nfinanced by increases in excess reserves that banks deposit with us.\nNow we come to the crux of the issue: Will this expansion of credit and bank reserves\ncreate high inflation? My answer is no. And the reason again is because of current economic\nconditions. Monetary policy fosters inflation when it loosens the stance of policy enough to\ncreate excess demand for goods and services. Right now, we have exactly the opposite—an\nexcess supply of goods and services. We need more demand—not less—to offset slack in labor\nand product markets. We have seen a noticeable slowdown in wage growth and reports of wage\ncuts have become increasingly prevalent. Businesses are cutting prices to boost sales. As a\nresult, core inflation—a measure that excludes volatile food and energy prices—has drifted\nbelow 2 percent, a level that I and most of my colleagues consider consistent with price stability.\nWith unemployment already substantial and likely to rise further, and industrial capacity\nutilization at record low levels, downward pressure on wages and prices isn’t likely to go away\nsoon. I expect core inflation to remain below 2 percent for several more years.\nOf course, the economy will eventually recover and we will need to withdraw monetary\naccommodation. If we were to fail to do so, we would indeed have higher inflation. The Fed is\nkeenly aware of this. We have the tools to tighten policy when the time is right and we have the\nwill to use them. First, many of our emergency programs are already tapering off as market\nconditions improve. Second, many of the assets that we have accumulated during the crisis—\nsuch as Treasury and mortgage-backed agency securities—have ready markets and can be easily\nsold. Finally, the Fed can push up the federal funds rate and tighten policy by raising the rate of\n8\n\n\finterest paid to banks on the reserves they deposit with us—authority granted by Congress last\nyear. An increase in the interest rate on reserves will induce banks to lend money to us rather\nthan to other banks, thereby pushing up rates in the interbank market and, by extension, other\ninterest rates throughout the economy. This is an important tool because, even if the economy\nrebounds nicely, the credit crunch might not be fully behind us and some financial markets might\nstill need Fed support. This tool will enable us to tighten credit conditions even if we maintain a\nlarge balance sheet for a time. The experience of central banks in Europe, Japan, and Canada\nsuggests that this approach can be effective. 8\nF\n\nLet me be clear: In our conduct of monetary policy, we are guided by our statutory\nmandates of maximum employment and price stability. We are committed to doing everything\nin our power to foster both goals. Our institution was created as a politically independent central\nbank, and that tradition is deeply embedded in our culture and practice. When the economy does\ncome back, I can assure you that we will act decisively and appropriately to tighten the stance of\npolicy and maintain price stability.\nBanking\nLet me shift now to a review of banking conditions. As I noted earlier, when the\nfinancial crisis intensified last fall, the Fed worked jointly with Treasury and other regulators to\nstabilize the banking system and restore confidence in financial markets more broadly.\nThe Troubled Asset Relief Program, or TARP, injected capital into the banking system at\na time when confidence in the system’s soundness was eroding and private funding was\nunavailable. I believe that it made a positive contribution. One indication of the significance of\n\n8\n\nBernanke (2009a).\n\n9\n\n\fTARP capital for community banks in the West is that about one in five banks in the 12th Federal\nReserve District took advantage of the program. Participating banks augmented their capital by\nan average of 2 percentage points. I certainly recognize that some bankers don’t like the\n“strings” attached to TARP and perceive that the goals of the program have shifted over time.\nBut there’s no denying that the program measurably strengthened the capitalization of many\ncommunity banks, putting them in a stronger position to weather difficult times. The stability of\nbank funding has also been bolstered by the FDIC’s temporary liquidity guarantee program and\nthe expansion of deposit insurance limits. Another program that should be helpful to banks is the\njoint Fed-Treasury initiative known as the Term Asset-Backed Securities Lending Facility, or\nTALF. This initiative is designed to revive critical securitization markets and help boost the\nissuance of a wide range of securitized loan products. The Fed’s recent expansion of the\nprogram to include both legacy and new commercial mortgage-backed securities should enhance\nthe availability of credit for commercial real estate and benefit both large and small banks with\nsignificant exposure to this sector by preventing defaults and facilitating the sale of distressed\nproperties.\nAll in all, I believe that the aggressive responses of the Fed and other agencies served to\nease the funding pressures facing a broad range of banks and to stabilize the financial system.\nThe restoration of confidence in the financial system has benefited all banks.\n\nOf course, the crisis has made it self-evident that we must reform our regulatory\nframework and improve supervisory practice so that a catastrophe of this magnitude never\nhappens again. As you know, the Obama administration has submitted a comprehensive reform\nbill to Congress, which is holding hearings over the summer on the proposal. Last week,\nChairman Bernanke and Governor Tarullo testified before Congress, laying out the Fed’s views\n10\n\n\fon regulatory restructuring. 9 Let me mention just two key areas where our regulatory framework\nF\n\nF\n\nmust be strengthened.\n\nFirst, we need a better way to manage systemic risk. By that I mean improved oversight\nof the financial system as a whole. Focusing on systemic risk is different than our traditional\ninstitution-oriented approach to supervision. It has become painfully clear that when regulators\nfocus exclusively on individual institutions, they can miss broader risks building in the system.\nIn particular, we need to do a better job of assessing how the practices of large institutions may\naffect their counterparties and the system as a whole. I know that many community bankers\nconsider it unfair that small banks—which did not cause the financial mess—are allowed to fail,\nwhile larger banks that took the biggest risks are rescued. That’s an understandable reaction.\nBut we can’t escape the reality that certain institutions, by virtue of their size or their linkages to\nkey markets, pose unique risks to the system and can bring others down with them. One lesson\nfrom the crisis is that it’s dangerous to have large, systemic institutions operating outside the\nregulatory framework or with inadequate capital and liquidity buffers. It’s essential that we\nidentify these systemic institutions and subject them to a robust framework of consolidated\nsupervision as well as more stringent standards for capital, liquidity, and governance.\n\nProtecting consumers is a second area where our current system failed in many respects.\nThis is not only a matter of fairness for individuals. It’s also a key element in the performance of\nour economy. Abuses such as inadequate consumer disclosures and unfair and deceptive\nmortgage lending practices by some institutions contributed to record foreclosure rates that\nmagnified the financial crisis. Given what we’ve learned about the pernicious effects of\n\n9\n\nTarullo (2009) and Bernanke (2009b).\n\n11\n\n\fconsumer loan defaults on the banking sector and the economy, it’s critical that we strengthen\nour regulation and supervision in this area for both bank and nonbank financial players.\n\nNow let me turn to the business environment facing banks. The industry is going through\none of the most difficult periods in modern times. First-quarter data show that the 12th District\nhas been hit harder than any other area of the country. Bank profits are down, loan delinquencies\nare up, and failures are climbing.\n\nIn Oregon and Idaho, community banks are underperforming the nation and have\nsignificantly riskier profiles. In terms of return on assets, Oregon was the eighth and Idaho was\nthe eleventh worst performing state in the nation. 10 Moreover, a relatively large fraction of\nF\n\nF\n\nbanks in each state lost money in the first quarter—about 40 percent in Oregon and 20 percent in\nIdaho. Loan quality indicators tell a similar story. Recent net charge-off rates at banks in each\nstate are much higher than the national average. Recessionary effects normally take some time\nto work their way through loan portfolios. So, even though I expect economic growth to resume\nin the second half of this year, banking conditions are likely to remain quite weak for another\nyear or two.\n\nTo date, the community banks under greatest financial stress are those with high real\nestate concentrations in construction and land development lending. Banks that liberally funded\nspeculative housing and condominium construction, and those that funded land acquisition and\ndevelopment, have been hardest hit. Over 20 District financial institutions have failed since last\nyear. The vast majority of them had high concentrations in residential construction and\ndevelopment lending. In fact, these banks had construction loans that averaged about 40 percent\n10\n\nThese and other statistics on bank performance are from Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco (2009).\n\n12\n\n\fof their loan portfolio, well above the District average of 16 percent. Unfortunately, some banks\nthat aggressively pursued these loans had weak appraisal and risk-monitoring systems.\n\nThe next area of significant vulnerability for the banking system, particularly for\ncommunity and regional banks with real estate concentrations, is income-producing office,\nwarehouse, and retail commercial property. Market fundamentals in most western states are\ndeteriorating. Vacancy rates are rising and rent pressures are hurting property cash flows.\nOffice vacancy rates in both Boise and Portland are expected to reach or exceed 20 percent over\nthe next year or two, the highest rates these cities have seen in many years. Retail shopping\ncenters are struggling with falling occupancy rates and pressures to grant rent concessions.\nProperty values are falling sharply across wide areas of the country, including the Pacific\nNorthwest. Some analysts forecast that commercial property values could experience falls\nsimilar to housing of 30 to 40 percent.\nRegrettably, a number of banks failed to implement risk management steps outlined in\nthe guidance on commercial real estate loan concentrations that was issued by regulators in 2006.\nBanks need to take proactive steps to address emerging credit problems, obtain new appraisals,\nand recognize impairment when warranted. But we also encourage banks to work out problem\nloans with troubled borrowers when this is prudent.\nOur biggest concern now is with maturing loans on depreciated commercial properties.\nIn many cases, borrowers seeking to refinance will be expected to provide additional equity and\nto have underwriting and pricing adjusted to reflect current market conditions. In some cases,\nborrowers won’t have the resources to refinance loans. TALF and the Treasury’s Public-Private\n\n13\n\n\fInvestment Program can support the commercial real estate market. But the economic forces\nhammering commercial property are unlikely to reverse anytime soon.\nAnother area I’d like to touch on is liquidity. For most banks, funding has stabilized\nsince last fall but remains quite fragile. We’ve seen rapid growth in the use of noncore funding\nchannels, such as brokered deposits and Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) advances. Brokered\ndeposits constitute an average of less than 4 percent of deposits nationally. But in Idaho, that\nconcentration is more than double. And, in Oregon, it’s more than three times higher. 11\nF\n\nF\n\nAlthough many banks have managed their liquidity positions effectively, one lesson of the\ncurrent period is that funding options can evaporate when a bank is facing declining asset\nquality, diminished earnings capacity, and falling capital. And that holds for brokered deposits,\ncorrespondent lines, and FHLB advances.\nI know this sounds woeful, but my advice is to hope for the best and plan for the worst.\nThat means anticipating a range of bad and worst-case scenarios that reflect local economic\nconditions and a bank’s particular risk profile. It can be helpful to perform stress tests based on\nthese scenarios to assess potential effects on earnings and capital, and to develop appropriate\ncontingency plans. The commercial real estate guidance that I mentioned earlier emphasizes the\nimportance of stress tests. The testing that the largest 19 banks recently conducted offers\nexamples of techniques that community banks can adopt, such as two-year portfolio loss\nestimates and methods of estimating revenue. Appropriately designed stress tests can help bank\nmanagements and boards make decisions about loan-loss provisioning, capital planning, and\nstrategic initiatives.\n\n11\n\nThe Idaho concentration is 8 percent; Oregon is 13 percent.\n\n14\n\n\fIt also makes sense to perform liquidity risk analyses that assess potential funding\npressures. These analyses should include forward-looking metrics such as cash-flow projections,\nand should examine a range of possibilities, such as reduced correspondent borrowing lines,\nhigher FHLB haircuts, and loss of access to brokered deposits. Banks would be well advised to\nhave in place well-tested backup plans before any potential funding crisis, including procedures\nfor using the Fed’s discount window.\nOn the subject of capital, regulatory minimums are just that—minimums. They’re not\nguarantees that a bank will have enough capital to weather a future storm. The Fed and other\nregulators are placing much more emphasis on forward-looking capital analyses that consider a\nrange of difficult economic scenarios and include earnings and loss estimates, and assessments of\nan institution’s ability to raise private capital. Capital retention is an integral part of this\nequation, and that implies a rigorous review of dividend policy. I encourage bank managements\nto consult with their primary regulators about dividends in the context of capital planning\ndiscussions.\nAlthough my message is that you should plan for the worst and exercise caution, I want\nto stress that it is also critical that you continue to make loans to creditworthy borrowers. The\nprofits that quality loans generate will serve you well as you safeguard capital. They are the core\nearning assets that will power bank profitability as we head out of this recession. And, of course,\nthe credit provided by prudent, well-functioning depository institutions will play an important\nrole in supporting the broader economic recovery that now seems to be on the horizon.

Yellen, President and CEO, Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco\nFor delivery on Tuesday, June 30, 2009, 6:00 PM Pacific time, 9 PM Eastern.\nA View of the Economic Crisis and the Federal Reserve’s Response 1\nF\n\nThank you very much. I’m very glad to be here before this thoughtful and engaged\naudience to talk about the economy and the Federal Reserve’s response. The Fed has faced\nextraordinary challenges over the past two years and these challenges continue as this very\npainful recession grinds on. I don’t have to tell you how difficult these times have been for the\nAmerican people. You are reminded of it every time you look at your retirement portfolio or\nhear about rising foreclosures and plunging home values. Your businesses may be squeezed as\ncustomers retreat and credit remains scarce. You may have seen colleagues get pink slips or you\nyourselves may be struggling to find a job. I’m happy to offer some good news: We’ve seen\nencouraging signs lately that the economy is poised to turn the corner. But as California’s 11.5\npercent unemployment rate attests, we still find ourselves slogging through the starkest economic\nlandscape most of us have known in our lifetimes.\nFor economic policymakers, this crisis has been like a hundred-year flood—a disaster of\nthe highest order which has put us on a continuous emergency footing. That is especially true at\nthe Federal Reserve—the institution where I serve as one of 12 regional bank presidents—which\nis charged with promoting maximum employment and controlling inflation. Later in my talk, I’ll\ndescribe how we’ve responded to what not so long ago seemed perilously close to financial and\neconomic meltdown. For now, all I’ll say is that, in the face of unprecedented challenges, we’ve\n\n1\n\nI would like to thank John Williams and Sam Zuckerman for assistance in preparing these remarks.\n\n\fdeveloped a number of creative programs far beyond the confines of our usual focus on interest\nrates to make sure that everything that reasonably could be done to get the economy turned\naround is being done.\nI want to start by discussing where the economy has been and where I see it going over\nthe next few years. As always, my comments represent my own views and not necessarily those\nof my colleagues in the Federal Reserve System. To understand where we’re headed, it’s useful\nto review how we got to the present situation. I think it’s helpful to divide the recent turmoil,\nlike a play, into three acts. I hope the curtain is now rising on the final act, one defined by\neconomic recovery.\nThe first act began early in the new century, amid a frenzied housing boom and a\nmortgage market where loans were available to just about everyone on unbelievably generous\nterms. Interest rates were unusually low, partly because of a huge supply of foreign savings that\nflooded the U.S. market and partly because the Fed promoted very low interest rates after the\ntech bubble burst to prevent deflation. 2 With money so cheap, investors borrowed to the hilt and\nF\n\nF\n\ntook ever-greater risks in search of higher returns.\nIt may be that investors—and regulators too—got overly complacent. Many had come to\nbelieve that the new and mind-bendingly complex forms of financial engineering that had swept\nWall Street virtually guaranteed the safety of banks and investment firms. A new era had\ndawned: financial innovation and sophisticated risk management had changed the rules. What’s\nmore, the business cycle had been tamed. For two decades, recessions had been rare and mild.\n\n2\n\nSee Bernanke (2005) for a discussion of the global influences on interest rates. See Taylor (2009) for a critical\nevaluation of U.S. monetary policy during this period.\n\n2\n\n\fThis whole process fed on itself. In the housing market, loan standards became\nincreasingly lax. Investors had an insatiable appetite for securities created from home loans,\nbuying them by the truckload from the institutions that made the loans, even though they offered\nreturns just a shade higher than ultra-safe U.S. Treasury securities. These risky practices spread\nfar beyond the subprime mortgage market where they were most visible, reaching into all kinds\nof credit products around the world.\nThis brings us to the second act of the play. House prices leaped higher every year,\nthanks to this frothy financial market. But they couldn’t go up forever. Once they started to fall\nin 2006, loan delinquencies surged and the sophisticated financial engineering collapsed. The\nfinancial system spread those losses like a runaway infection. Banks and investment firms\naround the world saw the value of their housing-related investments plummet, in some cases\nthreatening their solvency. The financial engineering was so unfathomable that it was nearly\nimpossible to identify which institutions were safe and which were in jeopardy. That prompted\nfinancial firms to hunker down and avoid lending money to anybody.\nThis all came to a head last fall. The weakest links in the financial chain were unable to\nborrow the money they needed to meet day-to-day obligations—a classic liquidity crisis. And\nwhen the venerable Wall Street firm Lehman Brothers collapsed, the system broke down\nentirely. The financial markets that banks and businesses rely on to fund daily operations froze\nup. The value of investments held by financial institutions plunged as everyone tried to sell\nwhatever they could to raise cash. Even the most solid institutions feared for their lives.\nSuch a breakdown of the financial system had the direst implications for the broader\neconomy, threatening to choke off credit to households and Main Street businesses. For\n\n3\n\n\fCongress, the Fed, the Treasury Department, and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, it\nwas a signal to take emergency steps to keep credit flowing to the economy. Congress approved\nthe TARP program and it was quickly used to provide capital to banks. And the Fed created\nnever-before-seen programs to stabilize money market mutual funds and the short-term\ncommercial paper market. In addition, the Fed and Treasury jointly intervened to support\nimportant institutions whose collapse was judged to threaten the entire financial system.\nI am not going to go into detail about the alphabet soup of Fed programs created during\nthis period. But I want to stress that these policies—in some cases improvised in very short\norder—did succeed in averting a full-blown meltdown. The panic of 2008 subsided.\nIncreasingly, banks and corporations have been able to raise funds on reasonable terms.\nConfidence in the financial system is slowly returning.\nStill, our brush with financial collapse came at great cost. As financial institutions\nstruggled to survive, they cut back on lending. And private securitization markets seized up\nentirely. These are markets in which a variety of types of loans, including auto, student, credit\ncard, Small Business Administration, jumbo mortgage, and commercial real estate loans, are\npackaged as securities and sold to investors. The resulting massive credit crunch caused the\neconomy to nosedive in the final quarter of last year and the first quarter of this year. Job losses\nreached more than 700,000 per month and the unemployment rate skyrocketed to levels not seen\nsince the early 1980s, reaching 9.4 percent in May. Some 6 million jobs vaporized during the\nrecession. Each of these was once held by a real human being, who likely depended on that\npaycheck to pay the mortgage, buy the groceries, and put gas in the car. The loss of these jobs is\nan immense tragedy. We should never forget that this awful recession is a flesh-and-blood thing\nthat robs our families, neighbors, and friends of their livelihood.\n4\n\n\fEarlier I described some of the emergency measures the Fed has taken to prop up the\nfinancial system. Now I’d like to talk about the policies we’ve adopted to fight the recession\ndirectly. Our policymaking body is called the Federal Open Market Committee, or FOMC. It\nconsists of the presidents of the Fed’s regional banks, like me, plus the governors of the Federal\nReserve Board in Washington, including Chairman Ben Bernanke. Traditionally, our main\nmonetary policy tool is the federal funds rate, which is what banks charge each other for\novernight loans. We control this rate by pumping cash into the banking system or withdrawing\nit. This is a powerful tool because the interest banks pay to borrow determines what they charge\nfor loans and ultimately works its way through to the rates businesses and households pay for\ncredit. This December, we cut the federal funds rate essentially to zero—an extraordinary step\non its own—and we’ve said repeatedly that low rates would likely be warranted “for an extended\nperiod.” As a result, many other interest rates in the economy are at very low levels. Other\nmajor central banks have taken similar steps.\nStill, given the depth of the crisis we’ve faced, a near-zero federal funds rate hasn’t been\nenough to turn the economy around. So we’ve developed a variety of alternative ways to\nstimulate the economy. For example, we’ve become a major buyer of securities issued by the\ngiant mortgage companies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, a move that has helped push\nconforming mortgage interest rates to near-record low levels—a support to the housing sector,\nwhich is under tremendous duress. In addition, the FOMC launched a program to purchase large\nquantities of longer-term Treasury debt, to help bring down corporate bond and other rates that\nare linked to Treasury yields. In total, the FOMC has committed up to $1.75 trillion—that is,\ntrillion with a “T”—for these asset purchases by the end of this year.\n\n5\n\n\fThe Fed and other government bodies have also worked hard to put our banking sector on\na more secure footing. The recent stress tests of the 19 largest U.S. banks provided a thorough\nevaluation of their financial health and capital needs. Since these tests, many banks have raised\ncapital or issued debt without FDIC guarantees—a very encouraging sign.\nIn addition, the Fed and Treasury Department jointly developed the Term Asset-Backed\nSecurities Loan Facility, or TALF, program to help revive vital securitization markets.\nSecuritization is one of the great financial innovations of the last generation, greatly expanding\nthe market for these loans and reducing their cost compared with the days when banks and other\nfront-line lenders had to keep such credits in their own portfolios. There’s no question that\nsecuritization of certain types of loans like subprime mortgages contributed to the crisis. But we\nmust not throw out the baby with the bath water. Securitization markets will continue to play a\nmajor role in our financial system. As I mentioned, in the midst of the financial storm late last\nyear, these markets froze up entirely, with the exception of the market for mortgage-backed\nsecurities issued by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. That made it tough, if not impossible, for\nordinary people to borrow to buy a car, pay college tuition, or finance a business. Restoring\nsecuritization markets to health is one of the key challenges we face. Our TALF program got off\nto a slow start, but is now clearly helping to bring rates down and increase the issuance of a wide\nrange of securitized loan products.\nWe now come to the present—the third act—in which the economy hopefully recovers.\nRight now, we’re like a patient in intensive care whose condition has stabilized and whose fever\nis just starting to come down. We’re just completing the sixth quarter of recession, but the pace\nof decline has slowed markedly. The news during the past few months has been encouraging.\nEven though house prices are continuing to fall in most markets, housing sales and new\n6\n\n\fconstruction appear to have stabilized. Consumers have recovered some spirit and their spending\nhas also stabilized, thanks in part to government stimulus programs. Payrolls are still shrinking\nat an awful pace, but the momentum of job losses has slowed considerably in the past two\nmonths.\nFinancial markets are in much better shape today than we ever would have dreamed six\nmonths ago. Investors have gone from disregarding risk, to being paralyzed by it, to once again\nbeing willing to take on a reasonable bit. The stock market has rallied and investor appetite for\ncorporate bonds and other assets has rebounded, restoring access to capital for healthy\ncompanies. Even so, I am concerned that mortgage rates, which have risen of late, could place a\ndrag on a still very sick housing market, potentially driving home prices still lower and pushing\nmore borrowers into foreclosure. The recent run-up in oil prices may also reflect greater\nconfidence in the global outlook. But it too is troublesome because it impedes recovery by\nforcing consumers and businesses to pay more for gas and energy, thereby reducing their ability\nto buy other goods and services.\nStill, I expect the recession will end sometime later this year. That would make it the\nlongest and probably deepest downturn since the Great Depression. Growth will come from a\nvariety of sources. One is federal government spending resulting from the stimulus program\npassed by Congress earlier this year. This package provides tax cuts that leave more cash in\nconsumers’ pockets, as well as direct government spending increases that add to payrolls and\nboost economic output. But it will take more than fiscal policy to really get the economy moving\nforward.\n\n7\n\n\fFortunately, some sectors are poised to rebound. For example, the auto industry has cut\nback production so far that inventories have begun to shrink—even in the face of historically\nweak demand for motor vehicles. As the economy stabilizes, just slowing the pace of this\ninventory shrinkage will boost gross domestic product, or GDP, which is the nation’s total output\nof goods and services. This story holds through broad sectors of the economy, where cautious\nconsumers and businesses have cut back on purchases of durable goods, such as computers and\nappliances. Eventually, old and broken-down goods will need to be replaced, and the resulting\ndemand will add to economic growth.\nThe housing sector too will eventually rise from the ashes. Home construction has fallen\ndramatically over the past few years as the nation works off the massive overbuilding of the\nboom years. But, once this adjustment is complete, housing construction will need to increase\nsignificantly just to keep pace with the growth in the number of households. Finally, the vicious\ncycle of tight credit and a weak economy can turn into a virtuous cycle. Once the economy starts\ngrowing and jobs and income are increasing, fewer borrowers will default and lenders will be\nwilling to increase the supply of credit.\nI don’t like taking the wind out of the sails of our economic expansion, but a few\ncautionary points should be considered. I expect the pace of the recovery will be frustratingly\nslow. It’s often the case that growth in the first year after a recession is very rapid. That’s what\nhappened as we came out of a very deep downturn in the early 1980s. Although I sincerely wish\nwe would repeat that performance, I don’t think we will. In past deep recessions, the Fed was\nable to step on the accelerator by cutting the federal funds rate sharply, causing the economy to\nshoot ahead. This time, we already have our foot planted firmly on the floor. We can’t take the\nfederal funds rate any lower than zero. I believe that the Fed’s novel programs are stimulating\n8\n\n\fthe flow of credit, but they simply aren’t as powerful levers as large rate cuts, so this time\nmonetary policy alone can’t power a rapid recovery.\nHistory also teaches us that it often takes a long time to recover from downturns caused\nby financial crises. 3 In particular, financial institutions and markets won’t heal overnight. Our\nF\n\nF\n\nmajor banks have made excellent progress in establishing the capital buffers needed to continue\nlending even through a downturn that is more serious than we anticipate. But they are still\nnursing their wounds and credit will remain tight for some time to come.\nI also think that a massive shift in consumer behavior is under way—one that will\nproduce great benefits in the long run but slow our recovery in the short term. 4 American\nF\n\nF\n\nhouseholds entered this recession stretched to the limit with mortgage and other debt. The\npersonal saving rate fell from around 8 percent of disposable income two decades ago to almost\nzero. Households financed their lifestyles by drawing on increasing stock market and housing\nwealth, and taking on higher levels of debt. But falling house and stock prices have destroyed\ntrillions of dollars in wealth, cutting off those ready sources of cash. What’s more, the stark\nrealities of this recession have scared many households straight, convincing them that they need\nto save larger fractions of their incomes. In the long run, higher saving promises to channel\nresources from consumption to investment, making capital more readily available to retool\nindustry and fix our infrastructure. But, in the here and now, such a rediscovery of thrift means\nfewer sales at the mall, and fewer jobs on assembly lines and store counters.\n\n3\n4\n\nSee Reinhart and Rogoff (2009) for evidence on this issue.\nSee Glick and Lansing (2009) for a discussion of household deleveraging.\n\n9\n\n\fA fourth factor that could slow recovery is the unprecedented global nature of the\nrecession. 5 Neither we nor our trading partners can count on a boost from strong foreign\nF\n\nF\n\ndemand. Finally, developments in the labor market suggest it could take several years to return\nto full employment. During this recession, an unusually high proportion of layoffs have been\npermanent as opposed to temporary, meaning workers won’t get called back when conditions\nimprove. Also, we’ve seen an unprecedented level of involuntary part-time work, such as state\nworkers on furlough a few days per month. Those workers are likely to return to full-time status\nbefore new workers are hired. To summarize, I expect that we will turn the growth corner\nsometime later this year, but I am not optimistic that the economy will spring back to normal\nanytime soon. What’s more, I expect the unemployment rate to remain painfully high for several\nmore years.\nThat’s a dreary prediction, but there is also some risk that things could turn out worse.\nHigh on my worry list is the possibility of another shock to the still-fragile financial system.\nCommercial real estate is a particular danger zone. Property prices are falling and vacancy rates\nare rising in many parts of the country. Given the weak economy, prices could fall more rapidly\nand developers could face tough times rolling over their loans. Many banks are heavily exposed\nto commercial real estate loans. An increase in defaults could add to their financial stress,\nprompting them to tighten credit. The Fed and Treasury are providing loans to investors in\nsecuritized commercial mortgages, which should be a big help. But a risk remains of a severe\nshakeout in this sector.\nLet me now turn to an issue that has lately garnered a great deal of attention—inflation.\nJust a short time ago, most economists were casting a wary eye on the risk of deflation—that is\n5\n\nSee IMF (2009) for a discussion of the global economic outlook.\n\n10\n\n\fthat prices might drop, perhaps falling into a downward spiral that would squeeze the life out of\nthe economy. Now, though, all I hear about is the danger of an outbreak of high inflation.\nI’ll put my cards on the table right away. I think the predominant risk is that inflation\nwill be too low, not too high, over the next several years. I take 2 percent as a reasonable\nbenchmark for the rate of inflation that is most compatible with the Fed’s dual mandate of price\nstability and maximum employment. This is also the figure that a majority of FOMC members\ncited as their long-run forecast for inflation, according to the minutes of the committee’s April\nmeeting.\nFirst of all, this very weak economy is, if anything, putting downward pressure on wages\nand prices. We have already seen a noticeable slowdown in wage growth and reports of wage\ncuts have become increasingly prevalent—a sign of the sacrifices that some workers are making\nto keep their employers afloat and preserve their jobs. Businesses are also cutting prices and\nprofit margins to boost sales. Core inflation—a measure that excludes volatile food and energy\nprices—has drifted down below 2 percent. With unemployment already substantial and likely to\nrise further, the downward pressure on wages and prices should continue and could intensify.\nFor these reasons, I expect core inflation will dip to about 1 percent over the next year and\nremain below 2 percent for several years.\nIf the economy fails to recover soon, it is conceivable that this very low inflation could\nturn into outright deflation. Worse still, if deflation were to intensify, we could find ourselves in\na devastating spiral in which prices fall at an ever-faster pace and economic activity sinks more\nand more. But I don’t view this as likely. The vigorous policy actions of the Fed and other\ncentral banks, combined with sizable fiscal stimulus here and abroad, have sent a clear message\n\n11\n\n\fthat deflation won’t be tolerated. Based on measures of inflation expectations, the public appears\nconfident that the Fed will adopt policies that will maintain a low, positive rate of inflation.\nEvidently, the credibility that the Fed and other central banks have built over the past few\ndecades in bringing inflation down has spilled over into a belief that we won’t allow inflation to\nget too low either. This does not mean that a short episode of deflation couldn’t occur, but it\nmakes a prolonged and devastating deflationary spiral less likely.\nNone of what I just said will satisfy those who worry about inflation. Indeed, if you\nlisten to popular business news channels, you might hear a drumbeat of concern that the Fed\ncould let inflation get too high. Those who hold this view point to the rise in Treasury yields and\ncommodity prices this year as signs that runaway inflation is on the horizon. They muster three\narguments. The first is that the Fed has pumped up the money supply and expanded its balance\nsheet to fund its financial rescue programs, potentially igniting inflation. The second is that the\nFed runs the risk of repeating the errors of the 1970s by focusing on mistaken views of economic\nslack rather than rising prices. The third is that large fiscal budget deficits will create higher\ninflation. I take all of these concerns very seriously and will address each in turn.\nFirst, I’ll talk about the Fed’s balance sheet. As I discussed earlier, the Fed has taken a\nnumber of strong steps to avert a financial and economic meltdown, and to support the flow of\ncredit. These policies have caused the assets on the Fed’s balance sheet to more than double,\nfrom under $900 billion at the start of the recession to over $2 trillion now. This expansion is\nlargely financed by increases in bank reserves, that is, surplus cash that banks deposit with us.\nSome worry that the Fed’s balance sheet expansion is pumping money into the economy and will\nbe inflationary. But, as I will explain in a moment, we have the tools needed to tighten policy\nand head off future inflation. There is also some concern that the Fed could be trapped by\n12\n\n\fconflicting goals if, at some point, a growing economy requires a higher federal funds rate,\nbefore credit markets are fully healed. Finally, some worry that the Fed may lack the political\nwill to tighten policy when the time comes.\nI will be the first to say that it is always difficult to get monetary policy just right. But the\nFed’s analytical prowess is top-notch and our forecasting record is second to none. The FOMC\nis committed to price stability and has a solid track record in achieving it. With respect to our\ntool kit, we certainly have the means to unwind the stimulus when the time is right. Many of the\nspecial programs we developed to provide emergency credit to the financial system are already\ntapering off as market conditions improve. Many of the assets that we have accumulated during\nthe crisis, such as Treasury and mortgage-backed agency securities, have ready markets. And\nthe Fed can push up the federal funds rate by raising the rate of interest that we pay to banks on\nthe reserve balances they have on deposit with us—authority that was granted to us by Congress\nlast year. An increase in the interest rate on reserves will induce banks to lend money to us\nrather than to other banks and borrowers, thereby pushing up the federal funds rate and other\nrates charged to private borrowers throughout the economy. The ability to pay interest on\nreserves is an important tool because, as I mentioned, it’s conceivable that, even if the economy\nrebounds nicely, the credit crunch might not be fully behind us and some financial markets might\nstill need Fed support. This tool will enable us to tighten credit conditions even though our\nbalance sheet wouldn’t shrink.\nLet me turn to the second concern, that we could have a rerun of the stagflation of the\n1970s. Some economists have argued that the Fed misjudged how low the unemployment rate\ncould go without igniting inflation and, as a result, lowered the federal funds rate too far for too\n\n13\n\n\flong, an overly accommodative stance that contributed to runaway prices. 6 This is an issue we\nF\n\nF\n\nhave studied in great depth, looking at a wide range of data sources and using a variety of\ntechniques to estimate slack in labor and product markets. Not surprisingly, these estimates\nvary. But they all plainly show that labor and product markets are currently operating well\nbelow the levels that would trigger inflation. We must beware of overconfidence that we have\ntoo precise a handle on these questions. But, to me, the evidence is clear that the economy has\nsubstantial slack and we are far from the kinds of unemployment rates that would make inflation\na danger.\nThe third concern is that big federal budget deficits might eventually be inflationary. In\nmy years of teaching at Berkeley, I regularly lectured on the relationship between fiscal deficits\nand inflation. A glance at history shows that many countries with massive structural deficits and\nwithout an independent central bank turned to the printing press to pay off their debts. That’s a\nrecipe for high inflation and, in some cases, hyperinflation.\nBut I don’t believe the United States faces that threat. Looking back in history, runaway\nfiscal deficits have often been accompanied by high inflation. 7 But, since World War II, such a\nF\n\nF\n\nrelationship has only held in developing countries. 8 In countries with advanced financial\nF\n\nF\n\nsystems and histories of low inflation, no such connection is found.\nSo where exactly do the dangers with fiscal deficits lie? To answer that question, it’s\nimportant to distinguish between cyclical deficits and long-run or structural deficits. The recent\nsharp rise in the federal deficit in large part stems from the government’s appropriate response to\n\n6\n\nSee, for example, Orphanides (2002).\nSee Sargent (1982) for a discussion of the fiscal sources of high inflation.\n8\nSee Fischer et al. (2002) and Catao and Terrones (2005) for analysis of the relationship between deficits and\ninflation in the post-World War II period.\n7\n\n14\n\n\fa severe recession and financial crisis. These near-term cyclical deficits vastly overstate the\nproblem of ongoing structural deficits. But the United States does have a large structural budget\ndeficit, and it will remain when the economy finally recovers. To a great extent, the structural\nbudget gap reflects demographic shifts resulting in an aging population coupled with a chronic\nescalation in health-care costs. The issue of rising entitlement and health-care spending is not\nnew. In fact, I spent many of my waking hours grappling with these problems a decade ago\nwhen I chaired the Council of Economic Advisers in the Clinton administration.\nIt is essential that we come to grips with structural budget deficits, but not because such\ndeficits will cause inflation. It’s because large, sustained structural deficits vacuum up savings\nthat could be put to more productive uses. Once the economy is back on track, these deficits will\nmake capital more expensive for private borrowers, crowding out the investments that are\nessential to boost productivity and fuel growth in real wages and living standards.\nConsider the case of the large deficits in the United States in the 1980s. We did not see a\nrun-up in inflation then. On the contrary, the deficits soared just as inflation was coming down.\nThose deficits did, however, contribute to higher interest rates, which made education and\ninvestment more expensive. Japan provides another example. Japan has run very large fiscal\ndeficits through much of the past two decades, yet its problem is persistent deflation—precisely\nthe opposite of inflation.\nFinally, there’s the matter of whether the Fed’s resolve is firm enough to tighten policy\nwhen the time comes to do so. Let me be unequivocal. The Fed is committed to doing\neverything in its power to foster recovery while maintaining price stability. When it’s necessary\nto withdraw the extraordinary stimulus we have put in place, we won’t hesitate. The Fed was\n\n15\n\n\fcreated as a politically independent central bank, and that tradition is deeply embedded in our\nculture and practice. We have worked closely with the Treasury and other agencies during this\ncrisis, and it was appropriate to do so. But, in our conduct of monetary policy, we are guided\nsolely by our statutory mandates of maximum employment and price stability. In March, the\nTreasury Department and the Fed signed an accord reaffirming our independence in setting\nmonetary policy.\nIn sum, although I take these concerns about inflation seriously, I do not believe that\nthere is a real threat of high inflation in the current situation. Monetary policy fosters inflation\nwhen it loosens financial conditions enough to create excess demand for goods and services.\nWhat could be clearer than the fact that right now we need more demand—not less—to offset the\nslack in labor and product markets?\nIf anything, I’m more concerned that we will be tempted to tighten policy too soon,\nthereby aborting recovery. That’s just what happened in 1936 when, following two years of\nrobust recovery, the Fed tightened policy because it was worried about large quantities of excess\nreserves in the banking system. The result? In 1937, the economy plunged back into a deep\nrecession. 9 Japan too learned that hard lesson in the 1990s, when both monetary and fiscal\nF\n\nF\n\npolicies were tightened in the mistaken belief that the economy was rebounding.\nThese episodes teach us a valuable lesson that we should heed in the present situation.\nLet this not be another 1937, but a time when policymakers have the wisdom and patience to\nnurse the economy back to health. And, when the economy does come back, let it be built on a\nfoundation of sound private investment and sustainable public policies.

Yellen, President and CEO, Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco\nFor delivery on Friday, June 5, 2009 at 2:15 PM Eastern time, 11:15 AM Pacific\nClosing Panel Presentation\nI’m delighted to have this opportunity to help wrap up what has been a fascinating and timely\nmacro-finance research conference. Cataclysmic events, like the current economic and financial crisis,\noften fundamentally alter the focus—and even the paradigm—for economic research and for monetary\npolicymaking. The Keynesian paradigm, with its activist policy prescriptions, grew out of the pain and\nsuffering of the Great Depression, which dealt a blow to the classical view that markets readily\nequilibrate. The Great Inflation of the 1970s, in turn, exposed inadequacies in the substance and\nmethodology of Keynesian macroeconometric modeling, and helped usher in the real business cycle\nresearch program with its prescription that monetary policy should leave the economy to its own devices\nand focus mainly on keeping inflation low and stable. Just a decade later, the Great Disinflation of the\nearly 1980s reminded us that monetary policy has real consequences, and a New Keynesian synthesis\nfocused policy on both full employment and price stability, as approximately described by a Taylor rule.\nDuring the relatively stable Great Moderation, the quintessence of that synthesis—namely, the DSGE\nmodel with nominal rigidities—ascended to the position of reigning macroeconomic orthodoxy. But few\nthings are permanent in our world. The current financial crisis raises questions about the relevance and\nusefulness of this paradigm too. I’d like to focus today on three of these questions.\n\nThe monetary policy transmission mechanism\nThe first has to do with the transmission mechanism of monetary policy. In most models used for\nmonetary policy analysis today, “optimal” policies can be designed for pursuing full employment, and\nlow and stable inflation. While these models allow for various real and nominal rigidities, they treat\n1\n\n\ffinancial markets as frictionless and efficient. As a consequence, monetary policy affects the economy\nthrough a single tool—a short-term interest rate—that transmits itself across credit, equity, derivatives,\nand foreign exchange markets through arbitrage.\nBut, the hand we have been dealt today doesn’t look anything like the textbook ideal that I just\ndescribed. Instead, we are experiencing pervasive financial market failures with devastating\nmacroeconomic effects. The normal monetary transmission mechanism has been hobbled by\ndysfunctional money and credit markets. Risk spreads have ballooned on supposedly safe assets like\nagency debt and mortgage-backed securities (MBS). What does optimal monetary policy look like in this\nsituation? How do we gauge the effectiveness of policy actions, and how can we implement and\ncommunicate systematic policy responses under these conditions?\nThis question of how to conduct monetary policy when financial markets aren’t working well is\nillustrated by our large-scale asset purchase program. With the funds rate pinned near zero and spreads\non mortgages over Treasuries very elevated, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) embarked on\na program of purchases of agency-insured MBS, agency debt, and longer-term Treasury debt totaling\n$1.75 trillion. This program’s goal is to bring down private borrowing rates and thereby stimulate the\neconomy. In the ideal world of frictionless financial markets, such actions would be ineffective because\nprivate investors would simply readjust their portfolios to accommodate changes in the Fed’s portfolio.\nBut, in a world where financial markets are impaired, such balance sheet policies may influence asset\nprices and the economy.\nA market test of these policies came on March 18 when the FOMC’s announcement of an\nexpansion of these purchases was met with an immediate and sharp decline in interest rates on both\nTreasury securities and agency-backed MBS. Rates on corporate bonds and mortgages came down as\nwell. Similar effects on interest rates were felt in the United Kingdom after the Bank of England\nannounced a program to buy long-term government debt there. Despite these initial successes, there is\n\n2\n\n\fstill a lot we don’t know about the magnitude and duration of the effects of these policies. Our standard\nmonetary policy models do not incorporate financial frictions that lead to asset purchases having real\neffects. We lack both the data and theory to provide strong guidance on these policies. Truly, we are\nsailing in uncharted waters, marking our maps with every bit of information along the way.\nAsset price bubbles and monetary policy\nMy second point concerns asset prices. The role of the house price bubble in precipitating the\ncurrent financial crisis places new urgency on a long-standing question: Should central banks attempt to\ndeflate asset price bubbles before they grow large enough to cause big problems? Until recently, most\ncentral bankers would have said monetary policy should respond to an asset price only to the extent that it\nwill affect the future path of output and inflation. In essence, if you believe that financial markets work\nwell most of the time, then you would be highly reluctant to target asset prices, let alone pop asset price\nbubbles. But, as I have discussed, we have vivid proof that markets sometimes don’t work, and that the\nunwinding of a bubble can dramatically harm economic performance and threaten financial stability.\nFour main issues define this debate, and the current crisis bears on each of them. 1 First, some\nquestion whether bubbles even exist. They argue that asset prices reflect the collective wisdom of traders\nin organized markets who best understand the fundamental factors underlying asset prices. It seems to me\nthat this argument is difficult to defend in light of the poor decisions and widespread dysfunction we have\nseen in many markets during the current turmoil.\nSecond, it’s an open question whether policymakers can identify bubbles in time to act effectively\ngiven that our models of underlying fundamentals are imprecise. For example, fundamental values of\n\n1\n\nGlenn D. Rudebusch, “Monetary Policy and Asset Price Bubbles,” FRBSF Economic Letter 2005-18, August 5,\n2005. http://www.frbsf.org/publications/economics/letter/2005/el2005-18.html\n\n3\n\n\fhousing often are estimated by comparing the ratio of house prices to rents with a long-run average. 2\nThis is a rather crude method, and some experts doubted that a bubble existed even when this ratio\nreached record highs in 2006. That said, by 2005 I think most people understood that—at a minimum—\nthere was a substantial risk that houses were overvalued, although few anticipated that house prices would\nfall as sharply as they have. 3\nThird, even if we can identify bubbles as they happen, using monetary policy to address them will\nreduce our ability to attain other goals, so it makes sense for monetary policy to intervene only if the\nfallout is likely to be quite severe and difficult to deal with after the fact. For example, fluctuations in\nequity prices generally affect wealth and consumer demand quite gradually. A central bank may prefer to\nadjust short-term interest rates after the bubble bursts to counter the depressing effects on demand. The\ntech stock bubble seems to fit this mold. Still, some bursting bubbles are more virulent than others. It\nmay be that credit booms, such as the one that spurred recent house price and bond price increases, hold\nmore dangerous systemic risks than other asset bubbles. By their nature, credit booms are especially\nprone to generating powerful adverse feedback loops between financial markets and real economic\nactivity. 4 If all asset bubbles are not created equal, policymakers could decide to intervene in those cases\nthat seem especially dangerous.\nFourth, if a dangerous asset price bubble is detected and action to rein it in is warranted, is\nconventional monetary policy the best tool to use? Going forward, I am hopeful that capital standards and\nother tools of macroprudential supervision will be deployed to modulate destructive boom-bust cycles,\n\n2\n\nJoshua Gallin, “The Long-Run Relationship between House Prices and Rents,” Finance and Economics Discussion\nSeries 2004-50, Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Washington, D.C.

In the current episode,\nhigher short-term interest rates probably would have restrained the demand for housing by raising\nmortgage interest rates, and this might have slowed the pace of house price increases. In addition, tighter\nmonetary policy may be associated with reduced leverage and slower credit growth, especially in\nsecuritized markets. 6 Thus, monetary policy that leans against bubble expansion may also enhance\nfinancial stability by slowing credit booms and lowering overall leverage.\nCertainly there are pitfalls to trying to deflate bubbles. At the same time, policymakers often\nmust act on the basis of incomplete knowledge, and it is now patently obvious that not dealing with some\nbubbles can have grave consequences. I would not advocate making it a regular practice to lean against\nasset price bubbles. But, in my view, recent painful experience strengthens the case for using such\npolicies, especially when a credit boom is the driving factor.\nThe inflation objective and the zero bound\nFinally, I will turn to the question of the appropriate long-run inflation objective—that is, the rate\nthat best promotes the dual goals of maximum sustainable employment and price stability. This is a topic\n\n5\n\nThere is now widespread agreement among policymakers and in Congress on the need to overhaul our supervisory\nand regulatory system, and broad agreement on the basic elements of reform.

In the past, I had spoken in favor of a 1½ percent rate of PCE price inflation. In\nmy view, though, recent events provide reason to reexamine this critical subject.\nThe choice of an appropriate inflation objective depends on an evaluation of the costs and\nbenefits of very low inflation. The financial crisis and global recession have not qualitatively changed\nthese costs and benefits, but they may affect their quantitative evaluation, which in turn might influence\nhow policymakers view their inflation objectives. The benefits of low and stable inflation are abundantly\nclear to this audience and have not changed in any material way because of the recession. On the cost\nside, the zero lower bound on nominal interest rates is a critical concern. Japan’s experience with\ndeflation starting in the 1990s generated a large body of research on monetary policy strategy that takes\naccount of the zero lower bound. 7 Researchers emphasize the benefits of aggressively cutting rates when\nthe prospect of reaching the zero bound emerges, and of using clear communication about the central\nbank’s future policy intentions and its long-run inflation goals. The FOMC took this research to heart\nduring the deflation scare of the early 2000s and the current crisis.\nOne conclusion of the research is that, even if monetary policy acts appropriately, an inflation\nobjective of 1 percent or lower entails some costs in terms of stabilizing output, but the impact on average\nmacroeconomic performance at higher inflation objectives is minimal. 8 However, I have not found the\nexperience of the past several years at all reassuring on this point. We have had two deflation scares and\na severe global recession in a span of seven years, with several major central banks now confronting the\nzero bound. Of course, this may simply reflect very bad luck that is unlikely to be repeated. But, a\nnumber of considerations make me hesitant to endorse this view. Indeed, concern about the ability of the\n\n7\n\nFor example, see the special conference volume, “Monetary Policy in a Low-Inflation Environment,” in the\nJournal of Money, Credit, and Banking 32(4, part 2), November 2000.\n\n8\n\nSee David Reifschneider and John C. Williams, “Three Lessons for Monetary Policy in a Low Inflation Era,”\nJournal of Money, Credit, and Banking, November 2000, and Guenter Coenen, Athanasios Orphanides, and Volker\nWieland, “Price Stability and Monetary Policy Effectiveness when Nominal Interest Rates are Bounded at Zero,”\nAdvances in Macroeconomics 4(1) 2004. http://www.bepress.com/bejm/advances/vol4/iss1/art1/\n\n6\n\n\fFed to support employment following large negative shocks may explain why most FOMC members now\njudge a PCE inflation rate of 2 percent to be most consistent with the Committee’s dual mandate.\nCalculations of the effects of the zero bound depend crucially on assumptions regarding the\nmagnitude of disturbances that hit the economy, the level of the natural rate of interest, and the behavior\nof the rest of the global economy. Recent experience raises the possibility that the Great Moderation is\nbehind us, so we must be prepared for substantial shocks. Thus, an analysis of the zero bound needs to\nincorporate greater volatility than experienced over the past quarter century. With respect to the\nequilibrium real interest rate, the global savings glut that helped restrain real interest rates may persist or\neven intensify after the recession is over, leaving us with only a small cushion against reaching the zero\nbound. And, the theory that the global economy was decoupled did not hold up in the current recession.\nThis has weakened the transmission of monetary policy by short-circuiting the exchange rate channel in\nany one country. When all other countries are in recession and cutting rates, it is harder to stabilize the\neconomy and avoid deflation.\nFinally, the Fed’s experience with nontraditional monetary policy tools cuts two ways in\nanalyzing the effectiveness of monetary policy near the zero bound. On the one hand, the apparent\nsuccess of the Fed’s longer-term asset purchases and broader credit easing programs in lowering\nborrowing costs and stimulating spending suggests that the zero bound problem may not be as costly as\npreviously thought. On the other hand, the deployment of these new policy tools comes with its own set\nof risks and costs. In particular, we do not yet have good estimates of the quantitative impact of such\ninterventions. In addition, the use of nonstandard monetary policy instruments necessarily brings with it\nthe uncertainty and risks of unintended consequences. For example, some observers worry that the\nballooning of the Fed’s balance sheet may raise inflation because the Fed may face political and technical\nchallenges when it tries to unwind these policies—especially if the recession ends before the need for\n\n7\n\n\fsupport of the financial markets fades. 9 While I have not found these arguments convincing so far, the\nrecent rise in Treasury rates, if it is reflective of such concerns, is disconcerting.\nClearly, the events and monetary policy dilemmas of the past two years have laid before us an\nurgent and compelling research agenda. We simply must understand better—and ultimately develop\nreliable models of—the extraordinary financial and macro linkages that produced the current crisis. In\naddition, we need to more fully evaluate the costs and benefits of nonstandard monetary policy actions.\nI’ll close with an encouraging note. As the papers at this conference attest, researchers in the academic\nand policy worlds are rising to the occasion. These are vitally important tasks and I’m glad to see so many\nof my colleagues rolling up their sleeves.\n\n9\n\nSee Jeffrey Lacker, “Government Lending and Monetary Policy,” remarks to the National Association for Business\nEconomics, 2009 Washington Economic Policy Conference, Alexandria, VA, March 2, 2009\n(http://www.richmondfed.org/press_room/speeches/president_jeff_lacker/2009/lacker_speech_20090302.cfm); and\nCharles I.

Yellen, President and CEO, Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco\nFor delivery on, May 6, 2009, 3:00 PM Pacific, (May 7, 2009, 8:00 AM local time, Sydney,\nAustralia)\nIssues Raised by the Credit Crunch and Global Recession 1\nIt is a great pleasure to speak to this audience of distinguished Australian business\neconomists. While you are having your breakfast, we here in San Francisco are more than half\nway through our business day, although that day is yesterday for you. My topic is the U.S.\neconomy—where we stand, where we’re going, and what the Federal Reserve and the federal\ngovernment are doing to restore growth. A few years ago, there was much talk of “decoupling,”\nmeaning that what happened in the United States didn’t matter so much to the rest of the world.\nNow—after we’ve seen the bursting of housing and credit bubbles in the United States trigger\nthe deepest worldwide recession since the Great Depression—we know that theory was wrong.\nThe state of the U.S. economy matters very much in Singapore, Santiago and, of course, in\nSydney.\n\nI think the most useful thing I can do today is to give you my views on the current\neconomic situation and then examine some key issues that will shape the course of the economy\nas we try to dig out from a very deep hole. The story I’m going to tell involves many\ncrosscurrents and uncertainties. This murky picture may actually be good news. I’ve spent the\nlast year or so being so downbeat that I could actually see the faces in my audiences sink as I\nspoke. The fact that I can now talk about crosscurrents may mean that the economy is reaching\nan inflection point. It’s too soon for me to be convinced of that, and I see a lot of downside risk,\nbut at least there is some basis for optimism. That said, I expect the recovery, whenever it does\n1\n\nI would like to thank John Judd and Sam Zuckerman for assistance in preparing these remarks.\n1\n\n\fbegin, to be quite gradual compared with those following previous deep recessions. As always,\nmy comments represent my own views and not necessarily those of my colleagues in the Federal\nReserve System.\n\nThe recession is now in its sixth quarter and it’s shaping up as the most severe downturn\nsince the Great Depression. Last week we found out that real GDP contracted at an annual rate\nof slightly more than 6 percent in the first quarter, according to the Commerce Department’s\nadvance estimate. That is about the same pace of decline registered in the final quarter of last\nyear. These are the largest consecutive declines in real GDP since 1958. The recession is also\nvery broad-based. Housing, business fixed investment, exports, and imports are all falling at\neye-popping rates—down more than 30 percent each. The one sector that held up surprisingly\nwell in the first quarter is the largest—consumer spending—which rose by a respectable 2¼\npercent.\n\nWhether this is a harbinger of good things to come is uncertain, in part because, after\nadjusting for inflation, consumption slowed over the months of the quarter and declined\nabsolutely in March. Still, it does offer a glimmer of hope. In addition, business inventories fell\nby a very large amount in the first quarter. That too is a positive signal. When spending\ncontracted last year, inventories ballooned relative to sales and firms have been struggling to\nbring them into better alignment. The first-quarter data suggest that the necessary inventory\ncorrection may be quite far along. Recent data also offer some hints of stabilization in the\nhousing sector. Home construction contracted sharply in the first quarter as a whole, but we saw\nsigns of improvement late in the period. In the past couple of months, home sales and housing\n\n2\n\n\fstarts have leveled off. Meanwhile, depending on the index, home prices have either increased\nslightly or fallen at a slower pace.\n\nWhile output is at least showing potential for improvement going forward, recent news\nfrom the labor market is still very weak. The unemployment rate has risen by 1.7 percentage\npoints over the past four months and, as bad as that is, I think it actually understates the true\nmagnitude of the labor market deterioration. For one thing, the incidence of permanent, as\nopposed to temporary, layoffs is unusually high compared with past downturns. In addition,\ninvoluntary part-time work has increased during this recession far more than we would expect\nrelative to the rise in unemployment. My business contacts tell me, and the data confirm, that the\nuse of furloughs is now widespread. The result is that nationally, we have seen a surge in parttime work for economic reasons occurring broadly across occupations. The underemployment\nrate, a broad measure that adds individuals working part time for economic reasons to the\nunemployed, now stands at 14¼ percent. This is a whopping 6½ percentage points higher than at\nthe start of the recession, nearly twice the increase in the standard unemployment rate.\n\nLooking forward, my personal forecast for output growth is similar to the Blue Chip\nconsensus. I believe the most likely scenario is that real GDP will advance at a low, but positive,\nrate in the second half of this year followed by trend-like growth in 2010. A forecast that the\neconomy will soon switch from contraction to expansion strikes some people as optimistic. But,\nit takes less than you might think for real GDP growth rates to turn positive. Positive growth\nbecomes likely if some of the economy’s weak sectors stop dragging down GDP going forward.\nResidential construction in particular has been declining for several years, subtracting about 1\npercentage point from real GDP growth. This spending can sink only so far, and, as I said,\n\n3\n\n\fwe’ve seen some tentative signs of stabilization recently. If housing starts level out, the sector\nwould no longer weigh down the economy and faster growth would ensue. Similarly, as I noted\nearlier, inventory liquidation has been unusually severe in recent months, especially in motor\nvehicles. A reduction in the pace of liquidation also would raise the GDP growth rate. Finally,\nif consumers become more confident—and there is evidence from surveys that they have\nrecently—pent-up demand actually could boost spending on autos, durable goods, and even\nhousing, providing some real “juice” to economic growth.\n\nOf course, monetary and fiscal policy are also sharply focused on promoting economic\nrecovery. On the monetary side, the Federal Reserve has pushed its traditional policy lever—the\nfederal funds rate—close to zero. And we haven’t stopped there. We have put in place an array\nof unconventional approaches to spur the flow of credit to households and businesses. These\ninclude measures to improve liquidity and financial market functioning, and facilities to support\nthe issuance of asset-backed securities. Moreover, we are undertaking large-scale purchases of\nTreasury and agency-related debt. These initiatives appear to be lowering longer-term interest\nrates and easing financial conditions more generally. Mortgage and other private borrowing\nrates have fallen, and, as those who’ve been bold enough to open their 401(k) statements again\nwill attest, stock prices have risen: they’re up around 35 percent from the lows reached in March.\nWe’ve also seen improvements in key measures of financial market functioning, such as spreads\nof Libor over the expected federal funds rate. On the fiscal side, the stimulus package passed by\nCongress in February will provide an important economic shot in the arm. While the program\ndoes not appear large enough to solve the economy’s problems on its own, the support it will\nprovide to aggregate demand is significant and helpful. We will likely begin seeing its effects on\nthe economy this quarter.\n4\n\n\fSo, to summarize, I am hopeful that the recession will end in the second half of this year\ndue to aggressive monetary and fiscal policies, and the operation of typical business cycle\nmechanisms, such as inventory dynamics. Unfortunately, this combination of ingredients is not a\nrecipe for a resounding rebound. My forecast that output growth will turn positive in 2009 and\nproceed near trend in 2010 implies that the unemployment rate will rise from 8½ percent now to\naround 9½ percent by the end of this year, and remain at about that level through 2010. An\nimplication is that inflation is likely to decline below the 2 percent pace that I and most of my\ncolleagues consider most consistent with our congressional mandate to strive for full\nemployment and price stability. Substantial slack in labor and product markets combined with\nlower commodity prices is already restraining overall price increases for goods and services. If,\nas seems likely, this downward pressure continues, core consumer inflation is apt to fall from\nabout 2 percent last year to around 1½ percent this year, and go even lower in 2010. I’ll have\nmore to say about inflation later.\n\nThe forecast I just described implies that I am not in the ranks of those who believe that\n“V” is the letter that will best describe the economy’s trajectory going forward. Those who\nanticipate a V-shaped recovery argue that growth in the first year after a business-cycle trough\nhas typically been very rapid in previous U.S. downturns, including the deep recession that\noccurred in 1981 and 82. My own forecast, in contrast, implies a far less robust recovery. In my\nview, the explanation for the V-shaped pattern typical of past recessions relates to monetary\npolicy. Most deep recessions in the postwar era happened after the Fed tightened policy to fight\ninflation. Once the inflation scare passed, the central bank was able to cut its policy rate sharply,\nand the economy snapped back. But, of course, the current recession is far different, having been\ntriggered by a historic housing bust, and a banking and financial crisis. Carmen Reinhart and\n5\n\n\fKen Rogoff have compared recessions around the world and shown that it takes a long time to\nrecover from downturns caused by financial crises. 2 And that is what I expect this time as well.\n\nI can point to a number of specific factors in this recession that are likely to weaken\nrecovery. First, despite signs that consumer spending is stabilizing, the chance of strong and\nsustained consumption growth appears low. For years prior to the recession, households went on\na spending spree of major proportions. This occurred during what has come to be called the\n“great moderation,” a period of about two decades when recessions were infrequent and mild,\nand inflation was low and stable. This may have lulled households into a false sense of security.\nThe personal saving rate fell from around 8 percent two decades ago to almost zero in recent\nyears as households financed their lifestyles by drawing on increasing stock market and housing\nwealth, and taking on higher levels of debt.\n\nNow, the era of such low saving may be over. Falling house and stock prices have\nvaporized trillions of dollars in household wealth. The destruction of their nest eggs is\nprompting households to rebuild savings. The deleveraging of household balance sheets could\nrestrain spending for years. Indeed, the personal saving rate is finally on the rise, averaging\nmore than 4 percent so far this year. It wouldn’t surprise me if this effect persists, as the shock\nof the financial crisis convinces many households that they need to save higher fractions of their\nincomes for the long term. Of course, ultimately this would be good for economic growth,\nchanneling resources from consumption to investment. That said, the transition could be painful\nif subpar consumption growth restrains the pace of economic recovery.\n\n2\n\nCarmen M. Reinhart and Kenneth S. Rogoff, “Is the 2007 Sub-Prime Financial Crisis So Different? An\nInternational Historical Comparison,” unpublished manuscript, February 5, 2008.\nhttp://www.economics.harvard.edu/files/faculty/51_Is_The_US_Subprime_Crisis_So_Different.pdf\n6\n\n\fMeanwhile, the story for banks and other financial firms is eerily similar. In the buildup\nto the recession, financial institutions, like consumers, became highly leveraged. Their\nvulnerability was compounded because they often invested in complex and risky assets that were\nfunded with short-term debt. Since the crisis hit, in an attempt to increase the soundness of their\nindividual balance sheets, banks have tightened lending standards, trying to improve credit\nquality at the same time that rising unemployment and falling house prices have led to more\ncredit losses. The attempts by banks to cut back the volume of their assets to reduce leverage\nand conserve capital, combined with a breakdown in the flow of lending through securitization,\nhas constricted the provision of credit in the economy. One important purpose of the stress tests,\nnow nearing completion by banking regulators, is to ensure that our largest banking\norganizations establish capital buffers that are large enough for them to withstand losses, while\ncontinuing to provide credit to households and businesses, even if the recession turns out to be\nsignificantly worse than currently anticipated. Such lending is critical to recovery.\n\nThe challenges facing monetary policy makers are another factor that makes a strong\nrecovery uncertain. With the federal funds rate essentially at zero, the Fed’s traditional policy\ntool has reached its maximum degree of accommodation. Many versions of the Taylor rule, a\nwell-known policy benchmark, indicate that we ought to lower the funds rate well below this\nzero bound, if such a thing were possible. As I noted, the Fed has turned to unconventional\npolicy tools. Through a variety of programs, the Fed has augmented the flow of credit to the\neconomy, provided a reliable source of liquidity to the financial system, and helped prevent the\nfailure of systemically important depository and nondepository institutions. Most of the action\nrecently has involved boosting credit flows through large-scale asset purchases. To support the\nhousing sector, the Fed announced last November that it would start buying agency-insured\n7\n\n\fmortgage-backed securities (MBS) and agency debt. In March, this program was expanded\nsubstantially. In addition, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) launched a new\nprogram to purchase large quantities of longer-term Treasury debt. These asset purchases have\nthe potential to stimulate aggregate demand through a number of channels, most obviously by\nreducing yields on securities included in the program. Indeed, when the FOMC announced in\nMarch that the Fed would expand these purchases, interest rates declined on both Treasury\nsecurities and agency-backed MBS. Still, even though these programs appear to be having a\nuseful effect, we have little experience with them and the magnitude of their impact is uncertain.\nIn other words, it is difficult to tell if unconventional monetary policies will be as effective in\npromoting recovery as easing the funds rate has been in the past.\n\nFinally, the global nature of the recession is likely to hold back the pace of our recovery.\nWe haven’t seen anything like this global downturn since the Great Depression. Virtually all\nadvanced economies and many emerging economies are in recession. Financial systems around\nthe globe are under stress, housing markets in some countries have collapsed, and trade has\nshriveled. The International Monetary Fund recently forecast that the global economy would\nrecover very gradually. This makes sense. As I said, recessions caused by financial crises are\ngenerally followed by more measured upswings. In addition, when recessions occur in many\nregions simultaneously, recoveries are slower than when downturns are confined to just a few\ncountries. 3 Now we have a double whammy—a highly synchronized global recession and a\nfinancial crisis. That’s a daunting combination.\n\n3\n\nInternational Monetary Fund, World Economic Outlook, April 2009.\nhttp://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/weo/2009/01/index.htm\n8\n\n\fFor all of these reasons—the need for balance sheet repair by households and financial\nfirms, uncertainties about unconventional monetary policy tools, and the global nature of the\nrecession—I expect the U.S. recovery to be frustratingly tepid once it does get started. It likely\nwill take several more years to bring unemployment back to its long-run equilibrium value.\n\nAs we think about the course of the economy, we must also be wary of developments that\ncould derail recovery. I see the economy as vulnerable to a number of downside risks, including\nthe possibility of another disruptive financial event—another “shoe” dropping, if you will.\nCommercial real estate is an area that seems vulnerable. Nonresidential construction declined\nsharply in the first quarter as business activity slowed; new buildings came on line; vacancy rates\non office, industrial, and retail space rose; and property values fell. For developers, financing is\nextremely hard to get. The market for commercial MBS has all but dried up and banks are\ntightening lending standards. Many developers will have trouble rolling over debt when it comes\ndue. Banks—especially community banks—are major lenders to this sector and are vulnerable\nto losses.\n\nWe must also keep an eye on developing nations, which face stark challenges as markets\nfor their products shrink and capital inflows dry up. Emerging market defaults could trigger\nfurther financial turmoil. The downturn in eastern Europe poses especially significant financial\nrisks to western European banks, whose exposure amounts to an estimated $1.5 trillion. With\nconfidence in the global financial system already fragile, these problems easily could spill over\nto the United States.\n\nAnother risk I’d like to discuss is inflation—or perhaps I should say deflation. This is an\nextraordinary time when you can hear a warning about inflation from one quarter and a dire\n9\n\n\fprediction of deflation from another quarter. I hear from both sides, though more often from\nthose worried about inflation. Concerns about an inflationary surge focus on the expansion of\nthe Fed’s balance sheet, which has increased from under $900 billion in mid-2007 to over $2\ntrillion now, largely financed by increases in bank reserves. The inflation worriers may be\nfocused on these excess reserves as a potential source of inflation down the road. Their fears are\ncompounded because federal budget deficits are ballooning. While I understand that the\ncombination of Fed expansion and big federal budget deficits might seem scary, I don’t see a\nsurge in inflation as very likely. Expansionary monetary policy creates inflation by loosening\nfinancial conditions enough to create excess demand for goods and services. That’s obviously\nnot the problem we face now. In spite of the Fed’s best efforts to enhance the flow of credit,\nfinancial conditions, while somewhat improved, overall remain abnormally tight. In our current\nrecession, we need more demand—not less—to offset the slack in labor and product markets.\n\nThat said, in theory there’s one way inflation could rise before the economy recovers\nfrom the recession: inflation expectations might increase because of fears that the Fed will not\nshift gears quickly enough when the recession and credit crunch are over. Some people have\nargued that the Fed might find it politically difficult to stop lending to the private sector\nborrowers it has supported during the crisis. 4 I don’t find this argument persuasive and I don’t\nsee evidence that the broad public finds it convincing either. The Fed has accumulated\n\n4\n\nJeffrey Lacker, “Government Lending and Monetary Policy,” remarks to the National Association for Business\nEconomics, 2009 Washington Economic Policy Conference, Alexandria, VA, March 2, 2009\n(http://www.richmondfed.org/press_room/speeches/president_jeff_lacker/2009/lacker_speech_20090302.cfm); and\nCharles I. Plosser, “Ensuring Sound Monetary Policy in the Aftermath of Crisis,” speech to the U.S. Monetary\nPolicy Forum, The Initiative on Global Markets, New York City, February 27, 2009\n(http://www.philadelphiafed.org/publications/speeches/plosser/2009/02-27-09_us-monetary-policy-forum.cfm).\n\n10\n\n\fconsiderable anti-inflation credibility over the past 25 years or so. 5 This credibility was evident\na few years ago when prices for energy, food, and other commodities soared to historically high\nlevels. While the direct effects of those price increases showed up in headline consumer\ninflation, very little was passed through to core inflation. Right now, there’s little evidence that\ninflation expectations have deteriorated. Market indicators and survey measures of longer-run\nexpectations have been quite stable.\n\nOf course, the inflation worriers are correct in an important respect: The Federal Reserve\nwill need to remove monetary accommodation once the credit crunch eases, private spending\nrevives, and the economy picks up steam. If the Fed were to fail to tighten the stance of\nmonetary policy quickly enough, we would see higher inflation. But I want to assure you that\nthe Fed is well aware of this danger and is readying the tools even now. Most importantly, the\nFed is committed to maintaining price stability and, when the time to remove accommodation\ncomes, we have a number of tools in our kit bag that could be quite effective.\n\nThe simplest approach—the one that we have used traditionally—would be to shrink our\nbalance sheet by selling the Treasuries, agency debt, and agency MBS we accumulated during\nthe crisis. Many of the special liquidity and credit facilities we have developed will be phased\nout as financial markets recover. But it is conceivable that, even with the economy rebounding\nnicely, the credit crunch might not be fully behind us and some financial markets might still need\nFed support. In this case, we could increase the interest rate we pay on bank reserves. This\nwould induce banks to remove funds from the federal funds market and lend them to us, thereby\nincreasing the federal funds rate and longer-term interest rates that are more relevant to private\n\n5\n\nJohn C. Williams, “Inflation Persistence in an Era of Well-Anchored Inflation Expectations,” FRBSF Economic\nLetter 2006-27 (October 13, 2006). http://www.frbsf.org/publications/economics/letter/2006/el2006-27.html\n11\n\n\fborrowers. Importantly, this approach provides us with the flexibility to tighten monetary policy\nin response to an improving macroeconomic picture without shrinking the size of our balance\nsheet or our support to financial markets. It is the main method employed by many central banks\nto influence financial conditions. An alternative approach that could accomplish the same goal,\nand perhaps do it better, would be something completely new for the Federal Reserve—that’s to\nissue interest-bearing debt broadly to private investors. Let’s call this debt Fed bills. Congress\nwould have to authorize this, but it too is a tool available to many central banks. The sale of Fed\nbills would reduce the reserves of the banking system, as in a typical contractionary open-market\noperation. As with interest on reserves, we could accomplish a tightening of policy while\nmaintaining our support of credit markets. But Fed bills would have an advantage over interest\non reserves. The loans to the Fed would come from investors throughout the economy, not just\nfrom banks. At a time when we need banks to lend to the private sector to fight a credit crunch,\nthis is a decided plus.\n\nAs you can tell, I’m quite skeptical about the risk of higher inflation. My thoughts about\nthe possibility of deflation are more complex. At first blush, there is cause for concern. We are\nstarting from a situation where core inflation is already a bit below 2 percent. The economy has\na great deal of slack and unemployment is likely to rise further, which would put more\ndownward pressure on wage growth and inflation. Indeed, we have already seen evidence that\nwages are rising less rapidly and there have been some outright wage cuts. Furthermore, as I\nnoted, with the funds rate at the zero bound, monetary policy has been forced to ease its stance\nthrough unconventional instruments that are hardly tried and true. If deflation were to occur with\nthe funds rate near zero, the effects could be severe. In the textbook case, with no way of\nlowering the nominal funds rate, real interest rates would rise as prices fell. That could drive the\n12\n\n\feconomy into a spiral of larger and larger price decreases, with economic activity sinking more\nand more.\n\nThe risk of such a deflationary spiral depends crucially on the nature of inflation\nexpectations. 6 If expectations are unanchored, meaning that people have variable expectations\ndepending on the recent behavior of inflation, then the lower inflation that’s characteristic of\nrecessions can convince them that inflation will go still lower in the future. If a recession is\nsevere and long enough, this process eventually will cause prices to fall, and then create a\ndownward spiral. But I don’t think this is a likely scenario in the United States. I believe that\ninflation expectations are well anchored, in the sense that people expect inflation to be consistent\nwith the Feds’ goals and policies. Based on measures of inflation expectations, people appear to\nthink we will take policy actions that will maintain a positive rate of inflation. This expectation\nacts as a buttress holding inflation up. This does not mean that a short episode of deflation\ncouldn’t occur, but it does help to avoid a prolonged deflationary spiral.\n\nTo reinforce our commitment to price stability, the FOMC recently began releasing longrun inflation forecasts based on the assumption of appropriate monetary policy. These figures,\nwhich indicate where FOMC members would like inflation to settle in the longer run, show, as I\nmentioned, a consensus of 2 percent for consumer inflation. 7 Such words, backed by appropriate\nactions, help keep inflation expectations well anchored and reduce the chances of a deflationary\nspiral. So, for me the bottom line is this: I see little basis to worry that we will develop an\n\n6\n\nJohn C.

There is more of a reason to think that we could experience some deflation,\nbut the chances of a severe bout of that ailment seem remote.\n\nYou may have gotten a case of whiplash hearing me say that, although conditions are\npoor, some hopeful signs are visible, but significant risks remain. Your necks may not have felt\nany better when I said that I hear worries about inflation and deflation at the same time.\nHowever, that’s the situation we find ourselves in now. The good news is that, for the first time\nin a while, there is some good news to savor. But, when it comes to assessing the future of the\neconomy, the dominant theme is uncertainty. The one thing that is sure is that policymakers\naround the globe are working hard to restore economic growth. As for the Federal Reserve, it\nremains fully committed to doing everything in its power to foster recovery while maintaining\nprice stability.\n\n14\n\n\f"

Yellen, President and CEO, Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco\nFor delivery on May 5, 2009, 7:30 PM Pacific time, 10:30 PM Eastern\nIssues Raised by the Credit Crunch and Global Recession 1\nI’m delighted to be with you at the Haas School and be hosted by my friend Rich Lyons.\nAs you know, this is a homecoming for me. I spent almost 25 rewarding years of my\nprofessional life as a faculty member here. And I will always think of the Haas and broader\nBerkeley communities with great fondness. Now, of course, I am with the Federal Reserve, and\nthat’s another institution that means a great deal to me because it’s a place where many of the\nideas and issues that were central to both my teaching and research here at Haas are translated\ninto real-world policy. The decisions we make at the Fed have taken on added significance with\nthe nation and most of the world going through a deep and worrisome recession, one that has\ncaused millions of people to lose their jobs or homes, and threatened or destroyed businesses\nlarge and small.\n\nI think the most useful thing I can do tonight is to give you my views on the current\neconomic situation and then examine some key issues that will shape the course of the economy\nas we try to dig out from a very deep hole. The story I’m going to tell involves many\ncrosscurrents and uncertainties. This murky picture may actually be good news. I’ve spent the\nlast year or so being so downbeat that I could actually see the faces in my audiences sink as I\nspoke. The fact that I can now talk about crosscurrents may mean that the economy is reaching\nan inflection point. It’s too soon for me to be convinced of that, and I see a lot of downside risk,\nbut at least there is some basis for optimism. That said, I expect the recovery, whenever it does\n1\n\nI would like to thank John Judd and Sam Zuckerman for assistance in preparing these remarks.\n1\n\n\fbegin, to be quite gradual compared with those following previous deep recessions. As always,\nmy comments represent my own views and not necessarily those of my colleagues in the Federal\nReserve System.\n\nThe recession is now in its sixth quarter and it’s shaping up as the most severe downturn\nsince the Great Depression. Last week we found out that real GDP contracted at an annual rate\nof slightly more than 6 percent in the first quarter, according to the Commerce Department’s\nadvance estimate. That is about the same pace of decline registered in the final quarter of last\nyear. These are the largest consecutive declines in real GDP since 1958. The recession is also\nvery broad-based. Housing, business fixed investment, exports, and imports are all falling at\neye-popping rates—down more than 30 percent each. The one sector that held up surprisingly\nwell in the first quarter is the largest—consumer spending—which rose by a respectable 2¼\npercent.\n\nWhether this is a harbinger of good things to come is uncertain, in part because, after\nadjusting for inflation, consumption slowed over the months of the quarter and declined\nabsolutely in March. Still, it does offer a glimmer of hope. In addition, business inventories fell\nby a very large amount in the first quarter. That too is a positive signal. When spending\ncontracted last year, inventories ballooned relative to sales and firms have been struggling to\nbring them into better alignment. The first-quarter data suggest that the necessary inventory\ncorrection may be quite far along. Recent data also offer some hints of stabilization in the\nhousing sector. Home construction contracted sharply in the first quarter as a whole, but we saw\nsigns of improvement late in the period. In the past couple of months, home sales and housing\n\n2\n\n\fstarts have leveled off. Meanwhile, depending on the index, home prices have either increased\nslightly or fallen at a slower pace.\n\nWhile output is at least showing potential for improvement going forward, recent news\nfrom the labor market is still very weak. The unemployment rate has risen by 1.7 percentage\npoints over the past four months and, as bad as that is, I think it actually understates the true\nmagnitude of the labor market deterioration. For one thing, the incidence of permanent, as\nopposed to temporary, layoffs is unusually high compared with past downturns. In addition,\ninvoluntary part-time work has increased during this recession far more than we would expect\nrelative to the rise in unemployment. My business contacts tell me, and the data confirm, that the\nuse of furloughs is now widespread. I know that they are under consideration here at Berkeley as\na way to address the budget crunch. The result is that nationally, we have seen a surge in parttime work for economic reasons occurring broadly across occupations. The underemployment\nrate, a broad measure that adds individuals working part time for economic reasons to the\nunemployed, now stands at 14¼ percent. This is a whopping 6½ percentage points higher than at\nthe start of the recession, nearly twice the increase in the standard unemployment rate.\n\nLooking forward, my personal forecast for output growth is similar to the Blue Chip\nconsensus. I believe the most likely scenario is that real GDP will advance at a low, but positive,\nrate in the second half of this year followed by trend-like growth in 2010. A forecast that the\neconomy will soon switch from contraction to expansion strikes some people as optimistic. But,\nit takes less than you might think for real GDP growth rates to turn positive. Positive growth\nbecomes likely if some of the economy’s weak sectors stop dragging down GDP going forward.\nResidential construction in particular has been declining for several years, subtracting about 1\n\n3\n\n\fpercentage point from real GDP growth. This spending can sink only so far, and, as I said,\nwe’ve seen some tentative signs of stabilization recently. If housing starts level out, the sector\nwould no longer weigh down the economy and faster growth would ensue. Similarly, as I noted\nearlier, inventory liquidation has been unusually severe in recent months, especially in motor\nvehicles. A reduction in the pace of liquidation also would raise the GDP growth rate. Finally,\nif consumers become more confident—and there is evidence from surveys that they have\nrecently—pent-up demand actually could boost spending on autos, durable goods, and even\nhousing, providing some real “juice” to economic growth.\n\nOf course, monetary and fiscal policy are also sharply focused on promoting economic\nrecovery. On the monetary side, the Federal Reserve has pushed its traditional policy lever—the\nfederal funds rate—close to zero. And we haven’t stopped there. We have put in place an array\nof unconventional approaches to spur the flow of credit to households and businesses. These\ninclude measures to improve liquidity and financial market functioning, and facilities to support\nthe issuance of asset-backed securities. Moreover, we are undertaking large-scale purchases of\nTreasury and agency-related debt. These initiatives appear to be lowering longer-term interest\nrates and easing financial conditions more generally. Mortgage and other private borrowing\nrates have fallen, and, as those who’ve been bold enough to open their 401(k) statements again\nwill attest, stock prices have risen: they’re up around 35 percent from the lows reached in March.\nWe’ve also seen improvements in key measures of financial market functioning, such as spreads\nof Libor over the expected federal funds rate. On the fiscal side, the stimulus package passed by\nCongress in February will provide an important economic shot in the arm. While the program\ndoes not appear large enough to solve the economy’s problems on its own, the support it will\n\n4\n\n\fprovide to aggregate demand is significant and helpful. We will likely begin seeing its effects on\nthe economy this quarter.\n\nSo, to summarize, I am hopeful that the recession will end in the second half of this year\ndue to aggressive monetary and fiscal policies, and the operation of typical business cycle\nmechanisms, such as inventory dynamics. Unfortunately, this combination of ingredients is not a\nrecipe for a resounding rebound. My forecast that output growth will turn positive in 2009 and\nproceed near trend in 2010 implies that the unemployment rate will rise from 8½ percent now to\naround 9½ percent by the end of this year, and remain at about that level through 2010. An\nimplication is that inflation is likely to decline below the 2 percent pace that I and most of my\ncolleagues consider most consistent with our congressional mandate to strive for full\nemployment and price stability. Substantial slack in labor and product markets combined with\nlower commodity prices is already restraining overall price increases for goods and services. If,\nas seems likely, this downward pressure continues, core consumer inflation is apt to fall from\nabout 2 percent last year to around 1½ percent this year, and go even lower in 2010. I’ll have\nmore to say about inflation later.\n\nThe forecast I just described implies that I am not in the ranks of those who believe that\n“V” is the letter that will best describe the economy’s trajectory going forward. Those who\nanticipate a V-shaped recovery argue that growth in the first year after a business-cycle trough\nhas typically been very rapid in previous U.S. downturns, including the deep recession that\noccurred in 1981 and 82. My own forecast, in contrast, implies a far less robust recovery. In my\nview, the explanation for the V-shaped pattern typical of past recessions relates to monetary\npolicy. Most deep recessions in the postwar era happened after the Fed tightened policy to fight\n\n5\n\n\finflation. Once the inflation scare passed, the central bank was able to cut its policy rate sharply,\nand the economy snapped back. But, of course, the current recession is far different, having been\ntriggered by a historic housing bust, and a banking and financial crisis. Carmen Reinhart and\nKen Rogoff have compared recessions around the world and shown that it takes a long time to\nrecover from downturns caused by financial crises. 2 And that is what I expect this time as well.\n\nI can point to a number of specific factors in this recession that are likely to weaken\nrecovery. First, despite signs that consumer spending is stabilizing, the chance of strong and\nsustained consumption growth appears low. For years prior to the recession, households went on\na spending spree of major proportions. This occurred during what has come to be called the\n“great moderation,” a period of about two decades when recessions were infrequent and mild,\nand inflation was low and stable. This may have lulled households into a false sense of security.\nThe personal saving rate fell from around 8 percent two decades ago to almost zero in recent\nyears as households financed their lifestyles by drawing on increasing stock market and housing\nwealth, and taking on higher levels of debt.\n\nNow, the era of such low saving may be over. Falling house and stock prices have\nvaporized trillions of dollars in household wealth. The destruction of their nest eggs is\nprompting households to rebuild savings. The deleveraging of household balance sheets could\nrestrain spending for years. Indeed, the personal saving rate is finally on the rise, averaging\nmore than 4 percent so far this year. It wouldn’t surprise me if this effect persists, as the shock\nof the financial crisis convinces many households that they need to save higher fractions of their\nincomes for the long term. Of course, ultimately this would be good for economic growth,\n2\n\nCarmen M. Reinhart and Kenneth S. Rogoff, “Is the 2007 Sub-Prime Financial Crisis So Different? An\nInternational Historical Comparison,” unpublished manuscript, February 5, 2008.\nhttp://www.economics.harvard.edu/files/faculty/51_Is_The_US_Subprime_Crisis_So_Different.pdf\n6\n\n\fchanneling resources from consumption to investment. That said, the transition could be painful\nif subpar consumption growth restrains the pace of economic recovery.\n\nMeanwhile, the story for banks and other financial firms is eerily similar. In the buildup\nto the recession, financial institutions, like consumers, became highly leveraged. Their\nvulnerability was compounded because they often invested in complex and risky assets that were\nfunded with short-term debt. Since the crisis hit, in an attempt to increase the soundness of their\nindividual balance sheets, banks have tightened lending standards, trying to improve credit\nquality at the same time that rising unemployment and falling house prices have led to more\ncredit losses. The attempts by banks to cut back the volume of their assets to reduce leverage\nand conserve capital, combined with a breakdown in the flow of lending through securitization,\nhas constricted the provision of credit in the economy. One important purpose of the stress tests,\nnow nearing completion by banking regulators, is to ensure that our largest banking\norganizations establish capital buffers that are large enough for them to withstand losses, while\ncontinuing to provide credit to households and businesses, even if the recession turns out to be\nsignificantly worse than currently anticipated. Such lending is critical to recovery.\n\nThe challenges facing monetary policy makers are another factor that makes a strong\nrecovery uncertain. With the federal funds rate essentially at zero, the Fed’s traditional policy\ntool has reached its maximum degree of accommodation. Many versions of the Taylor rule, a\nwell-known policy benchmark, indicate that we ought to lower the funds rate well below this\nzero bound, if such a thing were possible. As I noted, the Fed has turned to unconventional\npolicy tools. Through a variety of programs, the Fed has augmented the flow of credit to the\neconomy, provided a reliable source of liquidity to the financial system, and helped prevent the\n\n7\n\n\ffailure of systemically important depository and nondepository institutions. Most of the action\nrecently has involved boosting credit flows through large-scale asset purchases. To support the\nhousing sector, the Fed announced last November that it would start buying agency-insured\nmortgage-backed securities (MBS) and agency debt. In March, this program was expanded\nsubstantially. In addition, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) launched a new\nprogram to purchase large quantities of longer-term Treasury debt. These asset purchases have\nthe potential to stimulate aggregate demand through a number of channels, most obviously by\nreducing yields on securities included in the program. Indeed, when the FOMC announced in\nMarch that the Fed would expand these purchases, interest rates declined on both Treasury\nsecurities and agency-backed MBS. Still, even though these programs appear to be having a\nuseful effect, we have little experience with them and the magnitude of their impact is uncertain.\nIn other words, it is difficult to tell if unconventional monetary policies will be as effective in\npromoting recovery as easing the funds rate has been in the past.\n\nFinally, the global nature of the recession is likely to hold back the pace of our recovery.\nWe haven’t seen anything like this global downturn since the Great Depression. Virtually all\nadvanced economies and many emerging economies are in recession. Financial systems around\nthe globe are under stress, housing markets in some countries have collapsed, and trade has\nshriveled. The International Monetary Fund recently forecast that the global economy would\nrecover very gradually. This makes sense. As I said, recessions caused by financial crises are\ngenerally followed by more measured upswings. In addition, when recessions occur in many\nregions simultaneously, recoveries are slower than when downturns are confined to just a few\n\n8\n\n\fcountries. 3 Now we have a double whammy—a highly synchronized global recession and a\nfinancial crisis. That’s a daunting combination.\n\nFor all of these reasons—the need for balance sheet repair by households and financial\nfirms, uncertainties about unconventional monetary policy tools, and the global nature of the\nrecession—I expect the U.S. recovery to be frustratingly tepid once it does get started. It likely\nwill take several more years to bring unemployment back to its long-run equilibrium value.\n\nAs we think about the course of the economy, we must also be wary of developments that\ncould derail recovery. I see the economy as vulnerable to a number of downside risks, including\nthe possibility of another disruptive financial event—another “shoe” dropping, if you will.\nCommercial real estate is an area that seems vulnerable. Nonresidential construction declined\nsharply in the first quarter as business activity slowed; new buildings came on line; vacancy rates\non office, industrial, and retail space rose; and property values fell. For developers, financing is\nextremely hard to get. The market for commercial MBS has all but dried up and banks are\ntightening lending standards. Many developers will have trouble rolling over debt when it comes\ndue. Banks—especially community banks—are major lenders to this sector and are vulnerable\nto losses.\n\nWe must also keep an eye on developing nations, which face stark challenges as markets\nfor their products shrink and capital inflows dry up. Emerging market defaults could trigger\nfurther financial turmoil. The downturn in eastern Europe poses especially significant financial\nrisks to western European banks, whose exposure amounts to an estimated $1.5 trillion. With\n\n3\n\nInternational Monetary Fund, World Economic Outlook, April 2009.\nhttp://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/weo/2009/01/index.htm\n9\n\n\fconfidence in the global financial system already fragile, these problems easily could spill over\nto the United States.\n\nAnother risk I’d like to discuss is inflation—or perhaps I should say deflation. This is an\nextraordinary time when you can hear a warning about inflation from one quarter and a dire\nprediction of deflation from another quarter. I hear from both sides, though more often from\nthose worried about inflation. Concerns about an inflationary surge focus on the expansion of\nthe Fed’s balance sheet, which has increased from under $900 billion in mid-2007 to over $2\ntrillion now, largely financed by increases in bank reserves. The inflation worriers may be\nfocused on these excess reserves as a potential source of inflation down the road. Their fears are\ncompounded because federal budget deficits are ballooning. While I understand that the\ncombination of Fed expansion and big federal budget deficits might seem scary, I don’t see a\nsurge in inflation as very likely. Expansionary monetary policy creates inflation by loosening\nfinancial conditions enough to create excess demand for goods and services. That’s obviously\nnot the problem we face now. In spite of the Fed’s best efforts to enhance the flow of credit,\nfinancial conditions, while somewhat improved, overall remain abnormally tight. In our current\nrecession, we need more demand—not less—to offset the slack in labor and product markets.\n\nThat said, in theory there’s one way inflation could rise before the economy recovers\nfrom the recession: inflation expectations might increase because of fears that the Fed will not\nshift gears quickly enough when the recession and credit crunch are over. Some people have\nargued that the Fed might find it politically difficult to stop lending to the private sector\nborrowers it has supported during the crisis. 4 I don’t find this argument persuasive and I don’t\n\n4\n\nJeffrey Lacker, “Government Lending and Monetary Policy,” remarks to the National Association for Business\nEconomics, 2009 Washington Economic Policy Conference, Alexandria, VA, March 2, 2009\n10\n\n\fsee evidence that the broad public finds it convincing either. The Fed has accumulated\nconsiderable anti-inflation credibility over the past 25 years or so. 5 This credibility was evident\na few years ago when prices for energy, food, and other commodities soared to historically high\nlevels. While the direct effects of those price increases showed up in headline consumer\ninflation, very little was passed through to core inflation. Right now, there’s little evidence that\ninflation expectations have deteriorated. Market indicators and survey measures of longer-run\nexpectations have been quite stable.\n\nOf course, the inflation worriers are correct in an important respect: The Federal Reserve\nwill need to remove monetary accommodation once the credit crunch eases, private spending\nrevives, and the economy picks up steam. If the Fed were to fail to tighten the stance of\nmonetary policy quickly enough, we would see higher inflation. But I want to assure you that\nthe Fed is well aware of this danger and is readying the tools even now. Most importantly, the\nFed is committed to maintaining price stability and, when the time to remove accommodation\ncomes, we have a number of tools in our kit bag that could be quite effective.\n\nThe simplest approach—the one that we have used traditionally—would be to shrink our\nbalance sheet by selling the Treasuries, agency debt, and agency MBS we accumulated during\nthe crisis. Many of the special liquidity and credit facilities we have developed will be phased\nout as financial markets recover. But it is conceivable that, even with the economy rebounding\nnicely, the credit crunch might not be fully behind us and some financial markets might still need\n\n(http://www.richmondfed.org/press_room/speeches/president_jeff_lacker/2009/lacker_speech_20090302.cfm); and\nCharles I.

In this case, we could increase the interest rate we pay on bank reserves. This\nwould induce banks to remove funds from the federal funds market and lend them to us, thereby\nincreasing the federal funds rate and longer-term interest rates that are more relevant to private\nborrowers. Importantly, this approach provides us with the flexibility to tighten monetary policy\nin response to an improving macroeconomic picture without shrinking the size of our balance\nsheet or our support to financial markets. It is the main method employed by many central banks\nto influence financial conditions. An alternative approach that could accomplish the same goal,\nand perhaps do it better, would be something completely new for the Federal Reserve—that’s to\nissue interest-bearing debt broadly to private investors. Let’s call this debt Fed bills. Congress\nwould have to authorize this, but it too is a tool available to many central banks. The sale of Fed\nbills would reduce the reserves of the banking system, as in a typical contractionary open-market\noperation. As with interest on reserves, we could accomplish a tightening of policy while\nmaintaining our support of credit markets. But Fed bills would have an advantage over interest\non reserves. The loans to the Fed would come from investors throughout the economy, not just\nfrom banks. At a time when we need banks to lend to the private sector to fight a credit crunch,\nthis is a decided plus.\n\nAs you can tell, I’m quite skeptical about the risk of higher inflation. My thoughts about\nthe possibility of deflation are more complex. At first blush, there is cause for concern. We are\nstarting from a situation where core inflation is already a bit below 2 percent. The economy has\na great deal of slack and unemployment is likely to rise further, which would put more\ndownward pressure on wage growth and inflation. Indeed, we have already seen evidence that\nwages are rising less rapidly and there have been some outright wage cuts. Furthermore, as I\nnoted, with the funds rate at the zero bound, monetary policy has been forced to ease its stance\n12\n\n\fthrough unconventional instruments that are hardly tried and true. If deflation were to occur with\nthe funds rate near zero, the effects could be severe. In the textbook case, with no way of\nlowering the nominal funds rate, real interest rates would rise as prices fell. That could drive the\neconomy into a spiral of larger and larger price decreases, with economic activity sinking more\nand more.\n\nThe risk of such a deflationary spiral depends crucially on the nature of inflation\nexpectations. 6 If expectations are unanchored, meaning that people have variable expectations\ndepending on the recent behavior of inflation, then the lower inflation that’s characteristic of\nrecessions can convince them that inflation will go still lower in the future. If a recession is\nsevere and long enough, this process eventually will cause prices to fall, and then create a\ndownward spiral. But I don’t think this is a likely scenario in the United States. I believe that\ninflation expectations are well anchored, in the sense that people expect inflation to be consistent\nwith the Feds’ goals and policies. Based on measures of inflation expectations, people appear to\nthink we will take policy actions that will maintain a positive rate of inflation. This expectation\nacts as a buttress holding inflation up. This does not mean that a short episode of deflation\ncouldn’t occur, but it does help to avoid a prolonged deflationary spiral.\n\nTo reinforce our commitment to price stability, the FOMC recently began releasing longrun inflation forecasts based on the assumption of appropriate monetary policy. These figures,\nwhich indicate where FOMC members would like inflation to settle in the longer run, show, as I\nmentioned, a consensus of 2 percent for consumer inflation. 7 Such words, backed by appropriate\n\n6\n\nJohn C. Williams, “The Risk of Deflation,” FRBSF Economic Letter 2009-12 (March 27, 2009).\nhttp://www.frbsf.org/publications/economics/letter/2009/el2009-12.html\n7\n\nThe price index for personal consumption expenditures is used for this calculation.\n13\n\n\factions, help keep inflation expectations well anchored and reduce the chances of a deflationary\nspiral. So, for me the bottom line is this: I see little basis to worry that we will develop an\ninflation problem. There is more of a reason to think that we could experience some deflation,\nbut the chances of a severe bout of that ailment seem remote.\n\nYou may have gotten a case of whiplash hearing me say that, although conditions are\npoor, some hopeful signs are visible, but significant risks remain. Your necks may not have felt\nany better when I said that I hear worries about inflation and deflation at the same time.\nHowever, that’s the situation we find ourselves in now. The good news is that, for the first time\nin a while, there is some good news to savor. But, when it comes to assessing the future of the\neconomy, the dominant theme is uncertainty. The one thing that is sure is that policymakers\naround the globe are working hard to restore economic growth. As for the Federal Reserve, it\nremains fully committed to doing everything in its power to foster recovery while maintaining\nprice stability.\n\n14\n\n\f"

Minsky Conference on the State of the U.S. and\nWorld Economies—“Meeting the Challenges of the Financial Crisis”\nOrganized by the Levy Economics Institute of Bard College\nNew York City\nBy Janet L. Yellen, President and CEO, Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco\nFor delivery on April 16, 2009, 8:00 PM Eastern Time, 5:00 PM Pacific\n\nA Minsky Meltdown:\nLessons for Central Bankers 1\n\nIt’s a great pleasure to speak to this distinguished group at a conference named for\nHyman P. Minsky. My last talk here took place 13 years ago when I served on the Fed’s Board\nof Governors. My topic then was “The ‘New’ Science of Credit Risk Management at Financial\nInstitutions.” It described innovations that I expected to improve the measurement and\nmanagement of risk. My talk today is titled “A Minsky Meltdown: Lessons for Central\nBankers.” I won’t dwell on the irony of that. Suffice it to say that, with the financial world in\nturmoil, Minsky’s work has become required reading. It is getting the recognition it richly\ndeserves. The dramatic events of the past year and a half are a classic case of the kind of\nsystemic breakdown that he—and relatively few others—envisioned.\nCentral to Minsky’s view of how financial meltdowns occur, of course, are “asset price\nbubbles.” This evening I will revisit the ongoing debate over whether central banks should act to\ncounter such bubbles and discuss “lessons learned.” This issue seems especially compelling now\nthat it’s evident that episodes of exuberance, like the ones that led to our bond and house price\nbubbles, can be time bombs that cause catastrophic damage to the economy when they explode.\nIndeed, in view of the financial mess we’re living through, I found it fascinating to read Minsky\n\n1\n\nI would like to thank John Judd and Sam Zuckerman for exceptional assistance in preparing these remarks.\n\n1\n\n\fagain and reexamine my own views about central bank responses to speculative financial booms.\nMy thoughts on this have changed somewhat, as I will explain. 2\nAs always, my comments are my own and do not necessarily reflect those of my\ncolleagues in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nMinsky and the current crisis\nOne of the critical features of Minsky’s world view is that borrowers, lenders, and\nregulators are lulled into complacency as asset prices rise.3 It was not so long ago—though it\nseems like a lifetime—that many of us were trying to figure out why investors were demanding\nso little compensation for risk. For example, long-term interest rates were well below what\nappeared consistent with the expected future path of short-term rates. This phenomenon, which\nended abruptly in mid-2007, was famously characterized by then-Chairman Greenspan as a\n“conundrum.” 4 Credit spreads too were razor thin. But for Minsky, this behavior of interest\nrates and loan pricing might not have been so puzzling. He might have pointed out that such a\nsense of safety on the part of investors is characteristic of financial booms. The incaution that\nreigned by the middle of this decade had been fed by roughly twenty years of the so-called “great\nmoderation,” when most industrialized economies experienced steady growth and low and stable\ninflation. Moreover, the world economy had shaken off the effects of the bursting of an earlier\nasset price bubble—the technology stock boom—with comparatively little damage.\n\n2\n\nI want to give credit to PIMCO’s always-astute Paul McCulley—who gave last year’s keynote address—for\nleading the Minsky revival and pointing out the relevance of Minsky’s work to our current financial troubles.\n3\nFor example, see Hyman P. Minsky, “The Financial Instability Hypothesis,” The Jerome Levy Economics Institute\nof Bard College, Working Paper No. 74, May 1992 (http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=161024);\nand Robert Pollin, “The Relevance of Hyman Minsky,” Challenge, March/April 1997.\n4\nAlan Greenspan, “Federal Reserve Board’s semiannual Monetary Policy Report to the Congress,” testimony\nbefore the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, U.S. Senate, February 16, 2005.\n(http://www.federalreserve.gov/Boarddocs/hh/2005/february/testimony.htm)\n2\n\n\fChairman Bernanke has argued that other factors besides complacency were responsible\nfor low interest rates in this period. 5 A glut of foreign saving mainly generated in developing\ncountries such as China and India fueled demand for dollar-denominated assets. This ample\nsupply of foreign savings combined with a low U.S. personal saving rate, large U.S. government\ndeficits, and high productivity gains to produce a huge current account deficit. As a result, vast\nquantities of funds began “sloshing around” in our economy seeking investment projects.\nFed monetary policy may also have contributed to the U.S. credit boom and the\nassociated house price bubble by maintaining a highly accommodative stance from 2002 to\n2004. 6 This accommodative stance was motivated by what Greenspan called “risk management\npolicy,” in which, to reduce the possibility of deflation, the funds rate was held below the level\nthat would otherwise have been chosen to promote a return to full employment. 7 In effect, the\nFed took a calculated risk. It took out some insurance to lower the chances of a potentially\ndevastating deflationary episode. The cost of that insurance was an increased possibility of\noverheating the economy. These policy actions arguably played some role in our house price\nbubble. But they clearly were not the only factor, since such bubbles appeared in many countries\nthat did not have highly accommodative monetary policies.\nAs Minsky’s financial instability hypothesis suggests, when optimism is high and ample\nfunds are available for investment, investors tend to migrate from the safe hedge end of the\nMinsky spectrum to the risky speculative and Ponzi end. Indeed, in the current episode,\n\n5\n\nBen S.

Taylor, “The Financial Crisis and the Policy Responses: An Empirical Analysis of What Went Wrong,”\nNBER Working Paper No. 14631, January 2009. (http://www.nber.org/papers/w14631)\n7\nAlan Greenspan, “Monetary Policy under Uncertainty,” remarks at a symposium sponsored by the Federal Reserve\nBank of Kansas City, Jackson Hole, Wyoming, August 29, 2003.\n(http://www.federalreserve.gov/boarddocs/speeches/2003/20030829/default.htm)\n\n3\n\n\finvestors tried to raise returns by increasing leverage and sacrificing liquidity through shortterm—sometimes overnight—debt financing. Simultaneously, new and fancy methods of\nfinancial engineering allowed widespread and complex securitization of many types of assets,\nmost famously in subprime lending. In addition, exotic derivatives, such as credit default swaps,\nwere thought to dilute risk by spreading it widely. These new financial products provided the\nbasis for an illusion of low risk, a misconception that was amplified by the inaccurate analyses of\nthe rating agencies. This created a new wrinkle that even Minsky may not have imagined. Some\nof the investors who put money into highly risky assets were blithely unaware of how far out on\na limb they had gone. Many of those who thought they were in the hedge category were shocked\nto discover that, in fact, they were speculative or Ponzi units.\nAt the same time, securitization added distance between borrowers and lenders. As a\nresult, underwriting standards were significantly relaxed. Much of this financing was done in\nthe “shadow banking system,” consisting of entities that acted a lot like banks—albeit very\nhighly leveraged and illiquid banks—but were outside the bank regulatory net. Although these\ndevelopments reached an extreme state in the U.S. subprime mortgage market, risky practices\nwere employed broadly in the U.S. financial system. And this activity extended far beyond our\nborders as players throughout the global financial system eagerly participated. As banks and\ntheir large, nonbank competitors became involved in ever more complicated securitizations, they\nbegan to employ sophisticated “new tools” to measure and manage the credit risks flowing from\nthese transactions. But those tools—which I described in my speech 13 years ago—proved\ninsufficient for the task.\nThis cult of risky behavior was not limited to financial institutions. U.S. households\nenthusiastically leveraged themselves to the hilt. The personal saving rate, which had been\n\n4\n\n\ffalling for over a decade, hovered only slightly above zero from mid-2005 to mid-2007. A good\ndeal of this leverage came in the form of mortgage debt. The vast use of exotic mortgages—such\nas subprime, interest-only, low-doc and no-doc, and option-ARMs—offers an example of\nMinsky’s Ponzi finance, in which a loan can only be refinanced if the price of the underlying\nasset increases. In fact, many subprime loans were explicitly designed to be good for the\nborrower only if they could be refinanced at a lower rate, a benefit limited to those who\nestablished a pattern of regular payments and built reasonable equity in their homes.\nIn retrospect, it’s not surprising that these developments led to unsustainable increases in\nbond prices and house prices. Once those prices started to go down, we were quickly in the\nmidst of a Minsky meltdown. The financial engineering that was thought to hedge risks\nprobably would have worked beautifully if individual investors had faced shocks that were\nuncorrelated with those of their counterparties. But declines in bond and house prices hit\neveryone in the same way, inflicting actual and expected credit losses broadly across the\nfinancial system. Moreover, the complexity of securitized credit instruments meant that it was\ndifficult to identify who the actual loan holders might be. Meanwhile, asset write-downs reduced\nequity cushions of financial firms and increased their leverage just when growing risks made\nthose firms seek less leverage, not more. When they tried to sell assets into illiquid markets,\nprices fell further, generating yet more selling pressure in a loss spiral that kept intensifying. We\nexperienced a “perfect storm” in financial markets: runs on highly vulnerable and systemically\nimportant financial institutions; dysfunction in most securitized credit markets; a reduction in\ninterbank lending; higher interest rates for all but the safest borrowers, matched by near-zero\nyields on Treasury bills; lower equity values; and a restricted supply of credit from financial\ninstitutions.\n\n5\n\n\fOnce this massive credit crunch hit, it didn’t take long before we were in a recession.\nThe recession, in turn, deepened the credit crunch as demand and employment fell, and credit\nlosses of financial institutions surged. Indeed, we have been in the grips of precisely this adverse\nfeedback loop for more than a year. A process of balance sheet deleveraging has spread to\nnearly every corner of the economy. Consumers are pulling back on purchases, especially on\ndurable goods, to build their savings. Businesses are cancelling planned investments and laying\noff workers to preserve cash. And, financial institutions are shrinking assets to bolster capital\nand improve their chances of weathering the current storm. Once again, Minsky understood this\ndynamic. He spoke of the paradox of deleveraging, in which precautions that may be smart for\nindividuals and firms—and indeed essential to return the economy to a normal state—\nnevertheless magnify the distress of the economy as a whole.\nThe U.S. economy just entered the sixth quarter of recession. Economic activity and\nemployment are contracting sharply, with weakness evident in every major sector aside from the\nfederal government. Financial markets and institutions remain highly stressed, notwithstanding a\nfew welcome signs of stability due mainly to Federal Reserve and federal government credit\npolicies. The negative dynamics between the real and financial sides of the economy have\ncreated severe downside risks. While we’ve seen some tentative signs of improvement in the\neconomic data very recently, it’s still impossible to know how deep the contraction will\nultimately be.\nAs I mentioned earlier, the Minsky meltdown is global in nature, reflecting the everincreasing interconnectedness of financial markets and institutions around the world. The\nrecession is the first during the postwar period to see simultaneous contractions in output in\nEurope, Japan, and North America. Economic growth in these areas has weakened sharply as the\n\n6\n\n\ffinancial pain has spread and the U.S. recession has spilled over to our trading partners.\nForecasts for growth in Europe and Japan in 2009 are now even weaker than for the United\nStates. What’s more, many developing nations face stark challenges as markets for their\nproducts have dried up and capital inflows have abruptly halted, making debt refinancing—if\nnecessary—difficult, if not impossible. The global nature of the downturn raises the odds that\nthe recession will be prolonged, since neither we nor our trade partners can look to a boost from\nforeign demand.\n\nBubbles and monetary policy\nThe severity of these financial and economic problems creates a very strong case for\ngovernment and central bank action. I’m encouraged that we are seeing an almost\nunprecedented outpouring of innovative fiscal and monetary policies aimed at resolving the\ncrisis. Of course, fiscal stimulus played a central role in Minsky’s policy prescriptions for\ncombating economic cycles. Minsky also emphasized the importance of lender-of-last-resort\ninterventions by the Federal Reserve, and this is a tool we have relied on heavily. I believe that\nMinsky would also approve of the Fed’s current “credit easing” policies. Since the\nintensification of the financial crisis last fall, the Fed has expanded its balance sheet from around\n$850 billion to just over $2 trillion and has announced programs that are likely to take it yet\nhigher. In effect, the government is easing the financial fallout resulting from virulent\ndeleveraging throughout the private sector by increasing its own leverage in a partial and\ntemporary offset. 8\n\n8\n\nPaul McCulley has emphasized the importance of such a government role to address what he refers to as the\n“reverse Minsky journey.” See “Saving Capitalistic Banking from Itself,” Global Central Bank Focus, PIMCO,\nFebruary 2009.\n7\n\n\fHowever, as I said at the beginning of my talk, this evening I want to address another\nquestion that has been the subject of much debate for many years: Should central banks attempt\nto deflate asset price bubbles before they get big enough to cause big problems? Until recently,\nmost central bankers would have said no. They would have argued that policy should focus\nsolely on inflation, employment, and output goals—even in the midst of an apparent asset-price\nbubble. 9 That was the view that prevailed during the tech stock bubble and I myself have\nsupported this approach in the past. However, now that we face the tangible and tragic\nconsequences of the bursting of the house price bubble, I think it is time to take another look.\nLet me briefly review the arguments for and against policies aimed at counteracting\nbubbles. The conventional wisdom generally followed by the Fed and central banks in most\ninflation-targeting countries is that monetary policy should respond to an asset price only to the\nextent that it will affect the future path of output and inflation, which are the proper concerns of\nmonetary policy. 10 For example, a surging stock market can be expected to lead to stronger\ndemand for goods and services by raising the wealth of households and reducing the cost of\ncapital for businesses. As a result, higher stock prices mean that the stance of monetary policy\nneeds to be tighter, but only enough to offset the macroeconomic consequences on aggregate\ndemand created by a larger stock of wealth. In other words, policy would not respond to the\nstock market boom itself, but only to the consequences of the boom on the macroeconomy.\n\n(http://www.pimco.com/LeftNav/Featured+Market+Commentary/FF/2009/GCB+February+2009+McCulley+Savin\ng+Capitalistic+Banking.htm)\n9\nDonald L.

Rudebusch, “Monetary Policy and Asset Price Bubbles,” FRBSF Economic Letter 2005-18, August 5,\n2005. (http://www.frbsf.org/publications/economics/letter/2005/el2005-18.html)\n8\n\n\fHowever, other observers argue that monetary authorities must consider responding\ndirectly to an asset price bubble when one is detected. This is because—as we are witnessing—\nbursting bubbles can seriously harm economic performance, and monetary policy is hard-pressed\nto respond effectively after the fact. Therefore, central banks may prefer to try to eliminate, or at\nleast reduce the size of, this threat directly. Under this approach, policymakers would push\ninterest rates higher than would be indicated under conventional policy. The result, of course,\nwould be that output and employment would be reduced in the near-term, which is the price of\nmitigating the risk of serious financial and economic turmoil later on.\nWhat are the issues that separate the anti-bubble monetary policy activists from the\nskeptics? First, some of those who oppose such policy question whether bubbles even exist.\nThey maintain that asset prices reflect the collective information and wisdom of traders in\norganized markets. Trying to deflate an apparent bubble would go against precisely those\n“experts” who best understand the fundamental factors underlying asset prices. It seems to me\nthough that this argument is particularly difficult to defend in light of the poor decisions and\nwidespread dysfunction we have seen in many markets during the current turmoil.\nSecond, even if bubbles do occur, it’s an open question whether policymakers can\nidentify them in time to act effectively. Bubbles are not easy to detect because estimates of the\nunderlying fundamentals are imprecise. For example, in the case of house prices, it is common\nto estimate fundamental values by looking at the ratio of house prices to rents, which can be\nthought of as equivalent to a dividend-price ratio for the stock market. 11 If this ratio rises\nsignificantly above its fundamental, or long-run, value, the possibility of a bubble should be\nconsidered. Indeed, from 2002 to early 2006, this ratio zoomed to about 90 percent above its\n11\n\nJoshua Gallin, “The Long-Run Relationship between House Prices and Rents,” Finance and Economics\nDiscussion Series 2004-50, Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Washington, D.C. (forthcoming in\nReal Estate Economics). (http://www.federalreserve.gov/pubs/feds/2004/200450/200450abs.html)\n9\n\n\flong-run value, far outstripping any previous level. Nonetheless, even when house prices were\nsoaring, some experts doubted that a bubble existed. That said, by 2005 I think most people\nunderstood that—at a minimum—there was a substantial risk that houses had become\novervalued. Even at that point though, many thought the correction in house prices would be\nslow, not the rapid adjustment that did occur. 12\nNow, even if we accept that we can identify bubbles as they happen, another question\narises: Is the threat so serious that a monetary response is imperative? It would make sense for\nmonetary policy makers to intervene only if the fallout were likely to be quite severe and\ndifficult to deal with after the fact. We know that the effects of booms and busts in asset prices\nsometimes show themselves with significant lags. In those cases, conventional policy\napproaches can be effective. For example, fluctuations in equity prices generally affect wealth\nand consumer demand quite gradually. A central bank may prefer to adjust short-term interest\nrates after the bubble bursts to counter the depressing effects on demand. The tech stock bubble\nseems to fit this mold. The price-dividend ratio for these stocks reached dizzying heights and\nmany observers were convinced that a crash was inevitable. But monetary policy makers did not\ntry to stop the relentless climb of tech stock prices, although they raised interest rates toward the\nend of the period to dampen emerging inflationary pressures. Instead, it was only after tech\nstocks collapsed that policy eased to offset the negative wealth effect and, as unemployment\nrose, to help return the economy to full employment. The recession at the beginning of the\ndecade was fairly mild and did not involve pervasive financial market disruptions.\n\n12\n\nKristopher Gerardi, Andreas Lehnert, Shane M. Sherlund, and Paul Willen, “Making Sense of the Subprime\nCrisis,” Brookings Papers on Economic Activity, Fall 2008, pp. 69–160.\n(http://www.brookings.edu/economics/bpea/~/media/Files/Programs/ES/BPEA/2008_fall_bpea_papers/2008_fall_b\npea_gerardi_sherlund_lehnert_willen.pdf)\n10\n\n\fStill, just like infections, some bursting asset price bubbles are more virulent than others.\nThe current recession is a case in point. As house prices have plunged, the turmoil has been\ntransmitted to the economy much more quickly and violently than interest rate policy has been\nable to offset.\nYou’ll recognize right away that the assets at risk in the tech stock bubble were equities,\nwhile the volatile assets in the current crisis involve debt instruments held widely by global\nfinancial institutions. It may be that credit booms, such as the one that spurred house price and\nbond price increases, hold more dangerous systemic risks than other asset bubbles. By their\nnature, credit booms are especially prone to generating powerful adverse feedback loops between\nfinancial markets and real economic activity. It follows then, that if all asset bubbles are not\ncreated equal, policymakers could decide to intervene only in those cases that seem especially\ndangerous.\nThat brings up a fourth point: even if a dangerous asset price bubble is detected and\naction to rein it in is warranted, conventional monetary policy may not be the best approach. It’s\ntrue that moderate increases in the policy interest rate might constrain the bubble and reduce the\nrisk of severe macroeconomic dislocation. In the current episode, higher short-term interest rates\nprobably would have restrained the demand for housing by raising mortgage interest rates, and\nthis might have slowed the pace of house price increases. In addition, as Hyun Song Shin and\nhis coauthors have noted in important work related to Minsky’s, tighter monetary policy may be\nassociated with reduced leverage and slower credit growth, especially in securitized markets. 13\nThus, monetary policy that leans against bubble expansion may also enhance financial stability\nby slowing credit booms and lowering overall leverage.\n13\n\nTobias Adrian and Hyun Song Shin, “Money, Liquidity, and Monetary Policy,” American Economic Review\nPapers and Proceedings, forthcoming.\n\n11\n\n\fNonetheless, these linkages remain controversial and bubbles may not be predictably\nsusceptible to interest rate policy actions. And there’s a question of collateral damage. Even if\nhigher interest rates take some air out of a bubble, such a strategy may have an unacceptably\ndepressing effect on the economy as a whole. There is also the harm that can result from “type 2\nerrors,” when policymakers respond to asset price developments that, with the benefit of\nhindsight, turn out not to have been bubbles at all. For both of these reasons, central bankers\nmay be better off avoiding monetary strategies and instead relying on more targeted and lowercost alternative approaches to manage bubbles, such as financial regulatory and supervisory\ntools. I will turn to that topic in just a minute.\nIn summary, when it comes to using monetary policy to deflate asset bubbles, we must\nacknowledge the difficulty of identifying bubbles, and uncertainties in the relationship between\nmonetary policy and financial stability. At the same time though, policymakers often must act\non the basis of incomplete knowledge. What has become patently obvious is that not dealing\nwith certain kinds of bubbles before they get big can have grave consequences. This lends more\nweight to arguments in favor of attempting to mitigate bubbles, especially when a credit boom is\nthe driving factor. I would not advocate making it a regular practice to use monetary policy to\nlean against asset price bubbles. However recent experience has made me more open to action.\nI can now imagine circumstances that would justify leaning against a bubble with tighter\nmonetary policy. Clearly further research may help clarify these issues. 14\n\n14\n\nThe following conference volumes provide an introduction and references to the research literature now available:\nAsset Price Bubbles: The Implications for Monetary, Regulatory, and International Policies, ed.

I am\nheartened that there is now widespread agreement among policymakers and in Congress on the\nneed to overhaul our supervisory and regulatory system, and broad agreement on the basic\nelements of reform. 15\nMany of the proposals under discussion are intended to strengthen micro-prudential\nsupervision. Micro-prudential supervision aims to insure that individual financial institutions,\nincluding any firm with access to the safety net, but particularly those that are systemically\nimportant, are well managed and avoid excessive risk. The current system of supervision is\ncharacterized by uneven and fragmented supervision, and it’s riddled with gaps that enhance the\nopportunity for regulatory arbitrage. Such arbitrage was a central component in the excessive\nrisk-taking that led to our current problems. It is now widely agreed that such gaps and overlaps\nmust be eliminated, and systemically important institutions—whether banks, insurance firms,\ninvestment firms, or hedge funds—should be subject to consolidated supervision by a single\nagency. Systemic institutions would be defined by key characteristics, such as size, leverage,\nreliance on short-term funding, importance as sources of credit or liquidity, and\n15\n\nSee, for example, Timothy Geithner, Testimony before the House Financial Services Committee, March 26, 2009\n(http://www.ustreas.gov/press/releases/tg67.htm); Ben S.

Another\ncritical shortcoming of the current system is that it lacks any legal process to enable supervisors\nof financial conglomerates and nonbanks to wind down the activities of failed firms in an orderly\nfashion. The need for a resolution framework that would permit such wind-downs of\nsystemically important firms is also widely accepted.\nThe current crisis has afforded plentiful opportunities for supervisors to reflect on the\neffectiveness of our current system of micro-prudential supervision. The “lessons learned” will\nundoubtedly enhance its conduct going forward. 16 But, regardless of how well micro-prudential\nsupervision is executed, on its own it will never be adequate to safeguard the economy from the\ndestructive boom and bust cycles that Minsky considered endemic in capitalistic systems.\nAnalogous to Keynes’ paradox of thrift, the assumption that safe institutions automatically result\nin a safe system reflects a fallacy of composition. Thus, macro-prudential supervision—to\nprotect the system as a whole—is needed to mitigate financial crises.\nThe roles of micro- and macro-prudential supervision are fundamentally different. In\nprinciple, many individual institutions could be managing risk reasonably well, while the system\nas a whole remained vulnerable due to interconnections among financial institutions that could\nlead to contagious cycles of loss and illiquidity. For example, it is prudent for institutions to sell\nrisky assets and pay off debt when a decline in asset prices depletes capital. But the\nsimultaneous behavior of many institutions to protect themselves in this way only intensifies the\ndecline in prices. Moreover, when many institutions try to de-lever simultaneously, market\n16\n\nSee President’s Working Group on Financial Markets, “Policy Statement on Financial Market Developments,”\nMarch 13. 2008 (http://www.treas.gov/press/releases/reports/pwgpolicystatemktturmoil_03122008.pdf); Financial\nStability Forum, “Report of the Financial Stability Forum on Enhancing Market and Institutional Resilience,” April\n7, 2008 (http://www.fsforum.org/publications/r_0804.pdf); Senior Supervisors Group, “Observations on Risk\nManagement Practices during the Recent Market Turbulence,” March 6, 2008.\n(http://www.newyorkfed.org/newsevents/news/banking/2008/SSG_Risk_Mgt_doc_final.pdf)\n\n14\n\n\fliquidity can instantly evaporate. Systemic risk is endogenous to the working of the financial\nsystem.\nCapital requirements could serve as a key tool of macro-prudential supervision. Most\nproposals for regulatory reform would impose higher capital requirements on systemically\nimportant institutions and also design them to vary in a procyclical manner. In other words,\ncapital requirements would rise in economic upswings, so that institutions would build strength\nin good times, and they would fall in recessions. This pattern would counteract the natural\ntendency of leverage to amplify business cycle swings—serving as a kind of “automatic\nstabilizer” for the financial system. Financial stability might also be enhanced by reforming the\naccounting rules governing loan loss reserves. A more forward-looking system for reserving\nagainst such losses could make regulatory capital less sensitive to economic fluctuations. 17 In\naddition, most proposals for financial reform emphasize the need for stronger liquidity standards.\nThe funding of long-term assets with short-term, often overnight liabilities, is a source of\nsystemic vulnerability. One interesting recent proposal would disincent overreliance on shortterm funding by relating an institution’s capital charges to the degree of maturity mismatch\nbetween its assets and liabilities. 18 There has been considerable discussion recently of the need\nfor a new macro-prudential or “financial stability” supervisor—whether the Fed or some other\nagency—with responsibility to monitor, assess, and mitigate systemic risks in the financial\nsystem as a whole.\nAt this stage, the proposed reforms involve broad principles. The translation of those\nprinciples into a detailed supervisory program will be challenging, to say the least. But I am\n\n17\n\nSee Eric S.

Yellen, President and CEO, Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco\nFor delivery on March 25, 2009, 1:00 PM EDT, 10:00 AM PDT\n\nThe Uncertain Economic Outlook and the Policy Responses 1\nGood afternoon and thank you for inviting me. I’m delighted to speak before a group of\nsuch distinguished forecasters. As a member of the Federal Open Market Committee, I too must\nregularly predict the course of the economy and lately that has become a particularly hazardous\noccupation. We are struggling to assess the effects of conditions we haven’t seen before,\nincluding a near-collapse of the financial system, and to predict the impacts of policies that\nhaven’t been tried before, including an array of new Fed initiatives designed to improve\nconditions in private credit markets.\nI share the guarded optimism of most professional forecasters that the economy may\nbegin to grow again within the next several quarters. But I must admit that I see considerable\ndownside risk, and my confidence in this outlook is greatly diminished by the nearly\nunprecedented set of circumstances we face, circumstances that severely challenge our ability to\nuse historical economic relationships to anticipate future developments. We face an\nextraordinarily uncertain future, and our main hope for economic recovery lies in the sorts of\ninnovative and aggressive economic policy responses that are being carried out by Federal\nReserve and federal government policymakers. We must use all available tools to fight off the\nsignificant forces for contraction now hitting the economy.\nLast week, the FOMC took some rather dramatic steps to ease the stance of monetary\npolicy. We decided to expand our program to purchase agency mortgage-backed securities\n1\n\nI would like to thank John Judd and Sam Zuckerman for assistance in preparing these remarks.\n1\n\n\f(MBS) and agency debt by up to $850 billion, and initiated a program to purchase up to $300\nbillion of longer-term Treasury securities. These actions again demonstrate the Federal\nReserve’s commitment to do whatever it takes to get the economy moving forward. I’ll have\nmore to say about Fed policy at the end of my talk.\nThe economic situation\nWith that, let me begin with my best effort at an appraisal of the current economic\nsituation. As always, my comments represent my own views and not necessarily those of my\ncolleagues in the Federal Reserve System.\nYou are well aware of how downbeat most of the economic news has been, despite some\nscattered positive signals. We are in the fifth quarter of recession and economic activity and\nemployment are contracting sharply, with weakness evident in every major sector aside from the\nfederal government. At the same time, financial markets remain highly stressed and the adverse\nfeedback loop between the economy and the financial sector shows little sign of slackening.\nThese negative dynamics create severe downside economic risks. A process of balance sheet\ndeleveraging has spread to nearly every corner of the economy: consumers are pulling back on\npurchases, especially on durable goods, to build their savings; businesses are cancelling planned\ninvestments and laying off workers to preserve cash; and financial institutions are shrinking their\nassets to bolster capital and improve their chances of weathering the current storm. Such\nprecautions may be smart for individuals and firms, but they intensify economic distress for the\neconomy as a whole.\nHousing construction and prices remain at the center of the storm and rising\nunemployment and the reduced availability of mortgage credit weigh on demand.\nUnfortunately, even though housing starts have fallen precipitously, we have yet to see any clear\n\n2\n\n\fsign that the contraction in home building is near its end. The recent news that housing starts\nand permits had jumped in February provides a ray of hope, but it’s too soon to know if this is\nnoise or a signal that the contraction will soon end. The ongoing decline in house prices poses\nsignificant downside risk to future consumer spending and the health of the financial system.\nThis correction in house prices, especially in combination with rising unemployment, has fueled\nmortgage delinquencies and foreclosures and the associated losses are seriously weakening\nbanks and the financial system more broadly. Of course, foreclosures also harm the affected\ncommunities.\nMortgage rates are a potent influence on housing demand, and it is encouraging that the\nrates on conforming mortgages backed by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have declined. The\nevidence suggests that the Fed’s decision to purchase mortgage-backed securities guaranteed by\nthese agencies played a role in bringing rates down, and the further rate declines following last\nweek’s FOMC announcement of expanded purchases is a hopeful sign that conforming mortgage\nrates may decline even more. The rates charged to borrowers seeking nonconforming jumbos\nhave come down too, although not nearly as much as those on conforming loans. However,\nmortgages are still all but unavailable to borrowers with less-than-stellar credit histories and\nthose who can’t make large down payments.\nThe burdens afflicting consumers are both serious and numerous, so it is hardly\nsurprising that consumer confidence is at a 30-year low and consumer spending has been weak.\nFollowing an outright contraction in the second half of last year, spending has shown signs of\nstabilizing recently. In addition to soaring unemployment, household balance sheets have\nimploded. The combined impact on household wealth of falling house prices and plummeting\nequity prices has been staggering. Household wealth fell by $5 trillion last quarter alone, and by\n\n3\n\n\f$13 trillion—or nearly 25 percent—since the peak in mid-2007. Unfortunately, households were\nnot well positioned for such a hit to their wealth, since many had leveraged to the hilt. The\ncombination of the loss in wealth and the overhang of household debt portends years of subdued\nspending as households go through an extended process of deleveraging. Households are likely\nto recognize the benefits of stronger balance sheets for precautionary purposes and for meeting\nlonger-term goals, such as down-payment requirements and retirement. Downward pressure on\nhousehold leverage will come not just from households themselves but also from lenders, as they\ndemand more collateral for loans—collateral that has been devastated by the collapse of housing\nand other wealth. The one partially offsetting positive for consumer spending is the sharp\ndecline in energy prices since the middle of last year. The bottom line though is that the private\nsaving rate is finally moving up from an exceptionally low level. It is difficult, but critical to the\nforecast, to judge just how far that rebound will ultimately go.\nSharp cutbacks in investment spending have reinforced the economic drag resulting from\nthe retrenchment in consumer spending. Outlays for equipment and software and structures\ndeclined sharply in the fourth quarter of 2008 and firms liquidated inventories at a sizeable pace.\nThe contraction in all of these spending categories appears to have intensified this quarter. This\nweakness in business investment spending reflects shrinking sales, uncomfortably high\ninventory-sales ratios, a higher cost of capital, and dysfunctional credit markets. Our business\ncontacts also emphasize that pervasive uncertainty about the length and severity of the current\ndownturn is causing them to defer commitments and more generally hunker down. They have\nbecome exceptionally cautious in undertaking commitments to capital spending projects, even\nwhen those projects are expected to be profitable in the long term. And they are hoarding\nliquidity to meet unexpected revenue shortfalls or financing needs.\n\n4\n\n\fThe budgetary problems facing my home state of California have been well publicized\nand are exceptionally severe, but state and local governments across the nation face similar\nproblems. Their budgets have been thrown into crisis by the financial and economic turmoil.\nReductions in tax collections due to falling income and the downturns in the housing and stock\nmarkets have been coupled with tighter credit conditions, making it harder to issue bonds. Many\nstates are cutting spending, drawing down rainy day funds, and, to a lesser extent, raising taxes in\nresponse. Fortunately, the recently enacted fiscal stimulus package included a substantial dose\nof funding for state and local projects, and this should provide meaningful relief. It is especially\nencouraging that this aid is going disproportionately to states with severe budgetary pressures,\nwhich are more likely to put the funds to immediate use.\nMore broadly, with the passage of the fiscal stimulus package, the federal government is\nlikely to boost its contribution to real GDP this year and next. The Congressional Budget Office\nestimates that real GDP will be lifted by between 1 and 3½ percent by the end of next year, and\nthat translates into a reduction in the unemployment rate of between ½ and 1¼ percentage points.\nWhile a program of this size is not sufficient on its own to solve the economy’s problems, the\nstimulus is welcome, and likely to start hitting the economy as soon as next quarter.\nThe final factor affecting the outlook for growth is net exports, but significant impetus\nfrom this source seems unlikely in coming quarters. Indeed, a truly sobering feature of the\ncurrent recession is its global nature. This recession is the first during the postwar period to see a\nsimultaneous contraction in output in Europe, Japan, and North America. Economic growth in\nthese areas has weakened sharply as the financial meltdown has spread and the U.S. recession\nhas spilled over to our trading partners. Forecasts for growth in Europe and Japan in 2009 are\nnow even weaker than for the United States. Many developing nations face stark challenges as\n\n5\n\n\fmarkets for their products have dried up and capital inflows have abruptly halted, making debt\nrefinancing—if necessary—difficult, if not impossible. Emerging market defaults would trigger\nfurther financial turmoil. The downturn in eastern Europe poses especially significant financial\nrisks to western European banks, whose exposure amounts to an estimated $1.5 trillion. Bank\nloans in Austria exceed 80 percent of GDP, while the exposure of banks in Sweden and Belgium\nexceed 30 percent of GDP.\nFinally, let me to turn to inflation. With the global recession putting downward pressure\non commodity prices and slack in both labor and product markets swelling, we’ve seen an\noutright decline in consumer prices over the past six months. I anticipate that unemployment\nwill continue to increase before peaking in 2010, and, as a consequence, I expect inflation to be\nextremely subdued for quite some time. It seems likely, in fact, that headline consumer inflation\nwill be barely positive for 2009 as a whole and core inflation could remain below 1 percent for\nthe next several years. Such rates are notably below the 2 percent pace that most FOMC\nmembers consider appropriate to best promote the Committee’s dual mandate for full\nemployment and price stability.\nSo let me put all of these observations together into an overall view of future economic\ngrowth. With the caveat that my forecast is subject to exceptional uncertainty in the present\nenvironment, my best guess is similar to that of most forecasters, who expect to see moderately\npositive real GDP growth rates beginning later this year or early in 2010, followed by a gradual\nrecovery. 2\nHowever, I am well aware that my views are strikingly more optimistic than those I hear\nfrom the vast majority of my business contacts. They tend to see conditions as dire and getting\n2\n\nFor example, the Blue Chip consensus shows modest positive growth rates in both the third and\nfourth quarters. Even the average of the lowest ten Blue Chip forecasters shows a small positive number\nin the fourth quarter.\n6\n\n\fworse. In fact, many of them can’t believe I would even suggest what they see as such a patently\nrosy scenario! So why is it that so many of us who prepare forecasts seem to be more optimistic\nthan many others? I think there are several reasons. First, as forecasters, we distinguish between\ngrowth rates and levels. It’s true that the Blue Chip consensus shows moderate positive growth\nrates in output in the second half of this year. But even so, the level of the unemployment rate\nwould still rise throughout 2009 and into 2010. So, in this sense, the worst of the recession is not\nexpected to occur until next year. And, even by the end of 2011, I would expect the\nunemployment rate to be above its full-employment level. So I wouldn’t call this a particularly\nrosy scenario.\nSecond, it takes less than many people think for real GDP growth rates to turn positive.\nJust the elimination of drags on growth can do it. For example, residential construction has been\ndeclining for several years, subtracting about 1 percentage point from real GDP growth. Even if\nthis spending were only to stabilize at today’s very low levels—not a robust performance at all—\na 1 percentage point subtraction from growth would convert into a zero, boosting overall growth\nby 1 percentage point. A decline in the pace of inventory liquidation is another factor that could\ncontribute to a pickup in growth. Inventory liquidation over the last few months has been\nunusually severe, especially in motor vehicles—a typical recession pattern. All it would take is a\nreduction in the pace of liquidation—not outright inventory building—to raise the GDP growth\nrate. In addition, pent-up demand for autos, durable goods, or even housing could emerge and\nboost demand for these items once their stocks have declined to low enough levels.\nThird, policies are in place that could jump-start the economy, including the fiscal\nstimulus package, the Administration’s housing program, and a growing list of Federal Reserve\nand Treasury credit programs that aim to improve financial market function and the flow of\n\n7\n\n\fcredit. These programs offer the prospect that financial distress may gradually give way to more\nnormal functioning over the course of the year.\nFinally, at some point, negative feedback loops can turn positive. For example, if federal\ngovernment and Federal Reserve policies were to jump-start the economy, credit losses of\nfinancial institutions could diminish and lenders might increase the supply of credit available to\nfinance spending. More credit, and better consumer and business confidence, could further boost\nthe economy and employment, which would feed back positively on credit conditions. In other\nwords, the negative feedback loop that is currently in play could be replaced by self-reinforcing\npositive dynamics.\nHeightened uncertainty\nWhile there are good reasons to think the economy could begin to recover fairly soon,\nI’m far from confident and thus don’t want to press the case too strongly. Indeed, in all humility,\nmost of us have failed to anticipate the depth of this downturn and have had to mark down our\nforecasts repeatedly. For example, the Blue Chip consensus for real GDP growth in 2009 has\nshown negative revisions in 12 of the past 13 months. Even Chairman Bernanke recently\ncompared his forecasting record to that of the losing Washington Nationals baseball team. The\nimponderables in forecasting are always large—and it’s always tempting to think that we face\nmore than the usual amount of uncertainty. But, for a host of reasons, this sentiment is actually\ntrue right now!\nFirst, the shocks hitting the economy from housing and the financial markets have pushed\nit well outside of the normal range of experience that allows for analysis based on history. For\nexample, research suggests that, in normal times, factors such as consumer and business\nconfidence do not warrant special attention in developing an outlook because they essentially\n\n8\n\n\fsummarize information, like income and equity prices, that are already taken into account. In\ncontrast, in these exceptional circumstances, psychological factors such as consumer and\nbusiness confidence may exert a large and independent influence.\nSecond, our models take for granted that financial markets are working normally and are\nlinked together through arbitrage, so that financial conditions can be captured with a few\nvariables such as equity prices, the exchange rate, and a short- and long-term interest rate. That\nassumption is obviously invalid now, so the historical relationships in our models linking the\nfinancial and the real sides of the economy may provide a less accurate characterization of the\ntransmission mechanism. As a consequence, they now may be less reliable forecasting guides.\nFinally, the Federal Reserve and the federal government are deploying policy tools that\nare unconventional, to say the least, and few, if any, models are prepared to tell us what macro\neffects they might have. For example, it’s very difficult to gauge the quantitative impact of such\npolicy actions as equity injections into banks, programs to prevent home foreclosures, purchases\nof mortgage-backed securities and longer-term Treasuries, and facilities to boost issuance in\ndysfunctional markets for asset-backed securities.\nEconomic policies\nFor me, this extreme uncertainty about the future creates a very strong case for bold\npolicy actions on a broad front—by both the monetary and fiscal authorities—to stimulate\neconomic activity and prevent inflation from falling any further. I am heartened by the\naggressive and innovative actions that policymakers are taking.\nTo address this crisis, the federal government has taken a number of steps to get the\neconomy moving again. In addition to the nearly $800 billion fiscal stimulus plan that was\nenacted into law recently, the administration has initiated a number of other programs. One\n\n9\n\n\fhelps homeowners restructure or refinance their mortgages to avoid possible foreclosure. In\naddition, a multifaceted Financial Stability Plan (FSP), involving the Treasury, the Fed, the\nFederal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and other financial agencies, provides additional capital\nto commercial banks and a mechanism for taking so-called toxic financial assets off private\nsector balance sheets. With regard to these assets, the Treasury earlier this week announced more\ndetails of its Public-Private Investment Program (PPIP), which facilitates the purchase of\nexisting, or legacy loans, and legacy securities. The goal of the PPIP is to facilitate price\ndiscovery and market liquidity.\nThe Fed has also acted vigorously to turn the economy around. In particular, the FOMC\ncut its federal funds rate target by roughly 5 full percentage points, establishing a target range of\n0 to ¼ percent since its December 2008 meeting. Although, for all practical purposes, this\ninterest rate cannot be pushed any lower, the Fed also has stated that an exceptionally low level\nof the funds rate would likely be warranted “for an extended period” due to weak economic\nconditions. By offering guidance about the likely course of future short-term interest rates,\nconditioned on the Committee’s economic forecast, the Committee hopes to influence longerterm interest rates and asset prices, which in turn affect the spending decisions of households and\nfirms.\nBeyond interest-rate policy, the Fed is using other tools to improve the functioning of\nfinancial markets and to lower longer-term interest rates. A variety of new unconventional\nprograms rely on the Fed’s balance sheet. These programs serve three basic purposes. First,\nthey provide a reliable source of liquidity to financial institutions so that they are better able to\nextend credit. Second, in cooperation with the Treasury, they have helped to prevent the failure\n\n10\n\n\fof several systemically important financial institutions. Third, again in concert with the\nTreasury, they work to augment the flow of credit to the economy.\nI would like to focus most of my attention on the third category, since that currently is\ntaking center stage. To open the flow of credit to the private sector, the Fed has taken several\napproaches. First, the Commercial Paper Funding Facility (CPFF) provides a liquidity backstop\nto U.S. issuers of highly rated three-month unsecured and asset-backed commercial paper. This\nfacility holds a substantial volume of this paper, and borrowing rates in these markets have fallen\nnoticeably.\nSecond, the Fed has developed the Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility (TALF)\nprogram jointly with the Treasury to help restore functioning in other impaired markets that\nprovide credit to households and businesses. The TALF supports the issuance of securities\ncollateralized by auto, student, credit card, and Small Business Administration loans—sectors\nwhere the issuance of new securities has slowed to a trickle. This approach may be expanded to\ninclude additional asset classes, such as commercial and residential mortgages. Purchases of\nnewly issued securities under this program began this month, but are still fairly small in scale. In\naddition, the TALF will be expanded to include legacy securities as part of the PPIP.\nTo support the housing sector, the Fed announced last November that it would begin to\npurchase agency-insured mortgage-backed securities and agency debt. And, of course, last week\nthis program was expanded substantially. In addition, the FOMC took the very significant step\nof launching a new program to purchase large quantities of longer-term Treasury debt.\nPurchases of such longer-term assets have the potential to stimulate aggregate demand through a\nnumber of channels, most obviously by reducing the yields on those securities included in the\nprogram. Indeed, last week’s announcement resulted in an immediate and sharp decline in\n\n11\n\n\finterest rates on both Treasury securities and agency-backed MBS. Similar effects on interest\nrates were felt in the United Kingdom after the Bank of England announced a program to buy\nlong-term government debt there.\nThere are good reasons to expect that the Fed’s longer-term asset purchases will also spill\nover broadly to other credit markets because many types of long-term debt are substitutes for\nTreasuries and agency MBS in private portfolios. Not surprisingly, corporate borrowing rates\nalso declined last Wednesday in tandem with the rates on Treasuries and agency MBS. Lower\ninterest rates should raise the demand for consumer durables, housing, and business investment.\nMoreover, lower rates should boost asset valuations, such as equity and house prices, providing\nadditional impetus to consumer spending through wealth effects. A reduction in mortgage rates,\nat the same time that the Administration has loosened loan-to-value requirements to refinance\nconforming mortgages, may spur many households to refinance in the coming months, which\nwould raise their disposable income and support more spending. But while it’s easy to\nenumerate the relevant channels, the sizes of the impacts through them are highly uncertain. We\nare using new policy tools and we simply don’t have the experience needed to pin down the\nmagnitude of the impacts. In light of these uncertainties, I fully support our diversified approach\nof using a variety to strategies and programs to spur the provision of credit in a wide range of\nmarkets.\nHowever, the wisdom of this diversified program is the subject of considerable debate.\nCritics of the current Fed strategy argue that monetary policy should address only overall credit\nconditions and should avoid influencing the allocation of credit across particular markets. The\njoint Treasury-Fed TALF initiative—and even the Fed’s purchases of agency debt and mortgagebacked securities—are controversial because arguably they do affect credit allocation.\n\n12\n\n\fA second concern is that close policy coordination between the legislative and executive\nbranches of government may compromise the independence of the Fed, and its credibility and\ncommitment to fulfill its dual mandate of price stability and full employment. For example, at\nsome point, monetary policy goals might require a less accommodative stance of policy, even\nthough credit markets might not be fully healed. The Fed might then face political pressure to\nkeep supplying credit to certain markets. 3\nAnother concern that I hear expressed with increasing frequency is that the huge expansion\nof Fed lending will trigger a surge in inflation. The worry seems to be that the Fed has financed\nits credit programs by increasing the excess reserves of commercial banks, and these reserves\ncould eventually fuel an inflationary surge. The Fed is therefore seen as needing a well-defined\nexit strategy from its current highly accommodative policy stance.\nI understand these concerns, but I don’t believe they warrant a retreat from our current\nbroad approach. In fact, I believe that the seriousness of our current economic problems argues\nfor using all available tools, including the purchase of Treasuries, agency debt, and agencybacked securities, along with lending programs—some joint with Treasury—to support a range\nof private credit markets. The Fed’s role in these joint programs is to lend against satisfactory\ncollateral while avoiding credit risk. The programs are necessitated by today’s extreme or, in the\nwords of the Federal Reserve Act, “unusual and exigent” circumstances, and are designed to\nimprove private credit conditions broadly, rather than to benefit narrowly defined sectors and\nclasses of borrowers.\n\n3\n\nMarvin Goodfriend, “Why We Need an ‘Accord’ for Federal Reserve Credit Policy: A Note,” Federal\nReserve Bank of Richmond Economic Quarterly, Winter (2001). See also Jeffrey Lacker, “Government Lending\nand Monetary Policy,” (remarks, National Association for Business Economics, 2009 Washington Economic Policy\nConference, Alexandria, VA, March 2, 2009); and Charles I. Plosser, “Ensuring Sound Monetary Policy in the\nAftermath of Crisis,” (speech, U.S. Monetary Policy Forum, The Initiative on Global Markets, University of\nChicago Booth School of Business, February 27, 2009).\n\n13\n\n\fThe principle that a central bank, charged with controlling inflation, should be\nindependent from the government is unassailable. It may also be true that it’s easier for the\ncentral bank to guard its independence from political pressure when it mainly holds government\nsecurities. I believe that we should return to such a balance sheet structure once the financial\nmarkets and the economy are back to normal. However, as I said, I also am convinced that, in\nthe current crisis, we must employ all available tools, and that includes bolstering private credit\nmarkets. In fact, actions to increase the supply of credit can be expected to have especially large\neffects in reducing interest rates in dysfunctional private markets, like the ones targeted by the\nFed’s commercial paper program and the TALF. I therefore support the joint statement issued\nby the Treasury and the Fed earlier this week that, “As long as unusual and exigent\ncircumstances persist, the Federal Reserve will continue to use all its tools working closely and\ncooperatively with the Treasury and other agencies … to foster stabilization and repair of the\nfinancial system.”\nWith regard to inflation, I think fears that inflation will jump once the economy begins to\nrecover are overdone for several reasons. First, and most important, the Fed is fully committed\nto maintaining price stability within its dual mandate. The recent Treasury-Fed joint statement\ncodifies the key principle that actions resulting in an expansion of the Fed’s balance sheet “must\nnot constrain the exercise of monetary policy as needed to foster maximum sustainable\nemployment and price stability.” As the economy recovers, the Fed will eventually have to\nreduce the quantity of excess reserves. To some extent, this will occur naturally as markets heal\nand some programs consequently shrink. It can also be accomplished, in part, through outright\nasset sales. And finally, several exit strategies may be available that would allow the Fed to\ntighten monetary policy even as it maintains a large balance sheet to support credit markets.\n\n14\n\n\fIndeed, the joint Treasury-Fed statement indicated that legislation will be sought to provide such\ntools. One possibility is that Congress could give the Fed the authority to issue interest-bearing\ndebt in addition to currency and bank reserves. Issuing such debt would reduce the volume of\nreserves in the financial system and push up the funds rate without shrinking the total size of our\nbalance sheet.\nSecond, for some time to come, disinflation, and even deflation, will represent greater\nrisks than inflation. With economic activity weakening, economic slack is likely to be substantial\nfor several more years. We need to be sure that we avoid the kind of deflation that Japan\nexperienced during its lost decade. While I don’t think such an outcome is likely, it should be on\nour list of concerns.\nIn sum, we face serious challenges as we try to right the economy, and the resumption of\ngrowth that we expect by the end of 2009 is far from assured. The best hope for recovery lies in\na diversified array of effective fiscal and monetary policy programs. I am heartened by the fact\nthat the federal government and the central bank have both reacted with creativity and vigor in\ncarrying out their responsibilities. And I’m convinced that this is no time to relax our efforts.\nThank you very much.\n\n15\n\n\f"

Yellen, President and CEO, Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco\nFor delivery on February 27, 2009, 10:45 AM Eastern time, 7:45 AM Pacific\n\nDiscussion of “Oil and the Macroeconomy: Lessons for Monetary Policy” 1\nIt’s a pleasure to discuss this thoughtful and comprehensive report on the macroeconomic\nimplications of oil price movements. 2 Even though we are no longer faced with sky-high oil\nprices, the issues discussed here remain important and policy relevant. It is hard to believe that\noil prices will not go up again sometime in the future, so it is vital that we learn from the last\nepisode, both about how the economy is likely to be affected and how monetary policy should\nrespond.\nPerhaps not surprisingly, most of my discussion relates to the latter topic, namely the\nFed’s policy response to the swings in oil prices over the last seven years. But I would like to\nstart by commenting on the paper’s discussion of the relationship between the market price of oil\nand the value of oil in the ground. Thinking of this relationship in terms of Tobin’s q is an\nelegant and insightful contribution. As the authors point out, oil in the ground is like any other\nirreproducible asset, which should be described by Hotelling’s theory that the price of such an\nasset minus marginal cost increases at a rate equal to the prevailing interest rate. But oil above\nthe ground has distinct characteristics. And a number of factors can cause its price to depart—\nfor some time—from the value implied by Hotelling’s model. Thus, q—the ratio of the market\n1\n\nI would like to thank Bharat Trehan, John Fernald, John Judd, John Williams, and Sam Zuckerman for\nassistance in preparing these remarks.\n\n2\n\nHarris, Kasman, Shapiro, and West (2009)\n\n\fprice of oil to its value in the ground—can and does deviate from unity. The authors provide an\nimportant and informative example of such a departure, which uses data on mergers and\nacquisitions to calculate the value of the oil in the ground and compare it to the market price of\noil over the last few years. This exercise, together with one based on the stock prices of large oil\ncompanies, suggests that the market price of oil was temporarily high in 2007, and that the jump\nin the first part of 2008 represented a further departure from the long-term value. I will return to\nthis topic later.\nLet me now turn to the paper’s discussion of oil prices and monetary policy, a topic that\nhas sparked much debate among academic economists and policymakers during my two stints as\na Fed policymaker. The authors have accurately summarized the main issues involved in the\ndebate that took place during 2002–2008, both inside and outside the Fed. As is well known, an\noil price shock typically poses a dilemma for policymakers: Higher oil prices depress output and\nraise inflation. While the reduction in output provides a reason for policy to ease, the uptick in\ninflation pushes policy in the opposite direction. It is rarely obvious which element deserves\ngreater weight in policy decisions, and that leads to debate about the appropriate response. The\noil shocks of the past several years were no exception.\nI agree with the authors’ assessment that the Fed focused primarily on core rather than\nheadline inflation to gauge the extent of underlying inflationary pressures during this period.\nThis strategy, as the authors note, can be justified on theoretical grounds. Since core inflation\nrose only slightly, the Fed’s main inflation gauge did not signal a need to tighten policy\ndramatically. But as energy costs soared, the economy did experience an uncomfortable increase\nin headline inflation. The authors argue that the Fed should have paid more attention to the\nacceleration in headline inflation and raised interest rates by more than it did from 2004 to 2006.\n\n2\n\n\fTheir argument is buttressed by two exercises, one of which examines some data on\nexpected inflation while the other is based on model simulations. I will comment on each of\nthese, in turn. Using a small vector autoregression model—where the price of oil is assumed to\nbe exogenous—the authors show that changes in the price of oil help predict (or, more\nspecifically, Granger cause) the Michigan survey’s measure of expected inflation and also one of\ntwo expectations measures based on Treasury yields. This result suggests to the authors that the\nFed may have lost, or been on the verge of losing, at least some of its inflation-fighting\ncredibility. Such a loss of credibility would obviously be problematic. For one thing, it would\nincrease the amount by which the Fed would have to increase rates to offset any given\ninflationary shock. 3\nIt’s not clear to me, however, that the Fed’s credibility was actually under such serious\nthreat. Even taking the results at face value, the increase in expected inflation was small.\nFigure 5.3 in the paper reveals, in particular, that for three of their four measures, expected\ninflation in 2008 was only about one-tenth of a percentage point higher than what it would have\nbeen in the absence of any increase in the price of oil over this period.\nBut I think there are good reasons not to take these results at face value. Consider, first,\nthe authors’ choice of survey measures. They argue that an increase in readings from the\nMichigan survey—following years of stability—reflects increasing inflation expectations. But\nthey discount the stability of inflation expectations in the Survey of Professional Forecasters\n(SPF), arguing that it indicates “…forecast inertia rather than a super-credible central bank.” I\nfind the authors’ preference for consumer surveys over those of professional forecasters\nsurprising since it is usually argued that households pay less attention to the latest data than do\n\n3\n\nSee, for example, Orphanides and Williams (2004, 2007).\n\n3\n\n\fthe professionals who are paid to make these forecasts. Moreover, households probably update\ntheir forecasts of inflation less frequently than professionals. It’s also worth pointing out that the\nlack of responsiveness of professional forecasts to relative price shocks appears to be a recent\nphenomenon, likely due, in my view, to increased Fed credibility and not some newly acquired\ninertia on the part of the forecasters. Research by my staff shows that while the SPF forecasts\nwere sensitive to headline inflation data in the past, these forecasts have responded in recent\nyears to core rather than headline inflation data. 4 This finding suggests that professional\nforecasters no longer expect relative price changes to have a persistent effect on inflation.\nI would also take issue with the authors’ assumption that oil prices are exogenous. For\none thing, this assumption is at odds with the paper’s extended discussion about how the price of\noil is determined by economic developments in the U.S. and other countries. Moreover, the\nassumption is probably not innocuous: previous research has shown that treating oil as\nendogenous in such models can greatly reduce the estimated effects of oil shocks. 5\nLast, and certainly not least, I would question the authors’ conclusion that inflation\nexpectations have become unanchored based on their finding that oil prices help predict the\nMichigan survey measures of expected inflation. This finding does imply that a jump in the\nprice of oil causes expected inflation to increase for a time. But it does not prove that the\nincrease is permanent rather than transitory. A permanent response of expected inflation to a\nchange in oil prices requires either that the expectations process be nonstationary or that oil\nprices be expected to continue rising forever. In other words, the authors’ finding of a link\nbetween oil prices and survey measures of expected inflation is perfectly consistent with a\n\n4\n\nTrehan (2009).\n\n5\n\nSee Trehan (1986) and Barsky and Kilian (2004) for discussions of this issue.\n\n4\n\n\ftemporary impact of oil price shocks on both inflation and inflation expectations. Importantly,\nthese are precisely the responses that are consistent with well-anchored expectations—except, of\ncourse, if consumers believe that the Fed would absorb the hit of an oil shock entirely in the form\nof reduced output.\nLet me turn now to the second exercise in the paper, which involves simulating a new\nKeynesian model to examine the effects of oil shocks. As the authors point out, their\nspecification reproduces a standard feature of such models, which is that it is better for monetary\npolicy to target core inflation than headline inflation. But the authors then proceed to conduct an\nunusual simulation. To mimic the pattern of oil price increases from 2002 to 2008, they subject\nthe model to a sequence of 26 quarterly shocks in which the average increase in the price of oil is\nabout 7½ percent. While they present results for several different parameter combinations, the\ntypical outcome entails a core inflation rate that is about 2 to 4 percentage points higher than the\nassumed inflation target of around 1¾ percent. The authors argue that such a sequence of oil\nprice and inflation increases could cause inflation expectations to become unanchored. The\nimplication is that the Fed should have tightened policy more than it did to keep expectations\nfrom being cast adrift.\nA key element of their simulation is the assumption of a long period of increasing oil\nprices. Was it reasonable to expect such an outcome on a priori grounds? We can use the\nauthors’ elegant framework to answer this question. The first factor that is relevant in\nforecasting oil prices in that framework is the price of oil in the ground, as determined by the\nHotelling model. However, the authors do not argue that this price changed substantially over\nthe last five years or so. The second relevant factor is the behavior of q. In the authors’\nframework, q should be expected to converge toward unity in the medium to long term. Thus,\n\n5\n\n\fthe theory of the oil market presented in the paper suggests that forecasters during the 2002–\n2008 period should have expected oil prices to gradually revert to more “normal” levels over\ntime, once q exceeded one. Of course, the model does not pin down precisely what might\nhappen to the market price of oil for the next four, six or even eight quarters. Oil prices are\nnotoriously hard to predict at these (and indeed at all) horizons, and there is plenty of room to\nargue about the role played by fundamentals, special factors, speculation, etc. But throughout\nmost of this period, futures prices were predicting, even as oil prices rose, that oil prices would\nnot rise further—and certainly not for six years running. And these were the most important\nreal-time indicators of market expectations available to the Fed. Of course, futures-market\nforecasts proved wrong, ex post. But it seems to me now, as it did at the time, that there were\nneither strong empirical nor theoretical reasons to forecast that oil prices would continue rising\nfor six years.\nSince the improbable did in fact come to pass and the Fed tightened less than the authors\nconsider optimal, it seems entirely appropriate to consider the costs of the Fed’s policy judgment.\nThe authors note that the onset of the recession makes it all but impossible to get an\nunambiguous answer, and I agree. But I still think we can form some judgments based on the\nbehavior of inflation during the more-than-five-year period, ending in mid-2008, during which\noil prices kept moving higher. In 2001—the year before oil prices began to rise—core PCE price\ninflation was 1.9 percent. It averaged 2.2 percent over 2005–2007 and registered 2.2 percent\nduring the first half of 2008. So, core inflation did rise somewhat. We can debate just how\nmuch of that increase should be attributed to oil shocks, rising capacity utilization levels, and the\nwearing-off of the unusual sequence of productivity shocks of the late 1990s, which had helped\nto push inflation to an unusually low level for a time. The important point, though, is that the\n\n6\n\n\factual increase in core inflation fell far short of the increase predicted by the model simulations\npresented in the paper.\nDuring the period of rising oil prices and high headline inflation, policymakers paid\nclose attention to the behavior of wages for possible signs that higher inflationary expectations\nmight be spilling over into wage bargains. Reassuringly, there was little evidence of any\nincrease in the rate of wage growth, a linkage that I consider necessary for a sustained increase in\nthe inflation rate. For instance, after increasing at a 4.3 percent pace in 2001—the year before oil\nprices began their sustained increase—the Employment Cost Index rose by an average of a little over 3.2\npercent per year over 2005–2007 and at an annual rate of 2.8 percent in the first half of 2008. Other\n\ncompensation measures also reveal relatively steady wage growth during this period. 6 So, data\non wages, like those on core inflation, reveal little evidence of any impact resulting from the long\nsequence of large oil price shocks.\nThe authors attribute the lack of any sizable run-up in core inflation to other shocks that\nmay have hit the economy at the same time. But it is important to emphasize that a significant\nbody of recent research instead suggests that the measured effect of oil price shocks has\ndiminished over the last several decades. Over a decade ago, Hooker (1996) showed that the\neffect of oil price shocks had diminished since the early 1980s and subsequent research has\nverified this finding. In fact, this influential research has shifted the academic debate concerning\noil shocks, with some authors now questioning whether such shocks were ever actually as\nimportant as was believed in the 1970s (Barsky and Kilian, 2004, Bernanke, Gertler, Watson,\n\n6\n\nOther wage and compensation measures reveal the same general behavior. Total compensation per hour in the\nnonfarm business sector rose by 4.1 percent in 2001, an average of 4 percent over 2005–2007, and by 2.4 percent at\nan annual rate in the first half of 2008. Average hourly earnings rose by 3.8 percent in 2001, an average of 3.6\npercent per year over 2005–2007, and at a 3.8 percent rate in the first half of 2008.\n\n7\n\n\f1997) and others investigating what structural changes in the economy may have diminished the\nimpact of such shocks (Blanchard and Gali, 2007).\nIt seems to me that a change in the conduct of monetary policy following the experience\nof the 1970s has probably caused inflation expectations to become better anchored, explaining\nwhy recent oil shocks have inflicted relatively little damage on the economy. This hypothesis\ncould at least partly explain why the huge run-up in energy prices through the middle of last year\nwas not accompanied by rising wage demands. That in turn enabled the Fed to follow an easier\nmonetary policy that gave greater weight to the output effect of rising oil prices than would have\notherwise been possible.\nSince mid-2008, oil prices have, of course, plummeted. But the extraordinary weakness\nin the economy means that the usual trade-offs associated with such supply shocks are absent\nright now. Any boost to spending from falling oil prices will be more than welcome in the\ncurrent circumstances. And with inflation now below desirable levels, a decline in inflationary\nexpectations that could push core inflation down over time would be most unwelcome. I argued\nearlier that the Fed’s inflation credibility helped over a number of years to keep inflationary\nexpectations anchored in the face of rising oil prices and high headline inflation. My hope is that\ninflationary expectations will remain similarly well-anchored now, serving to stabilize core\ninflation. The FOMC’s recently released longer-run inflation projections should be useful in this\nregard, helping to reinforce inflation expectations of around 2 percent.\nTo conclude, let me emphasize that I enjoyed reading the paper and found the discussion\nof recent developments quite informative. But, the arguments in this paper did not persuade me\nto change my opinion of recent Fed policy. As I noted, during the period of rising oil prices,\nthere was little evidence that policy was inappropriate: labor compensation growth remained well\n\n8\n\n\fcontained and inflation persistence appeared to be low, most likely because of increased Fed\ncredibility. The Fed must always be vigilant in guarding its inflation credibility. But I did not\nthink then, and I do not think now with the benefit of hindsight, that expectations became or\nwere close to becoming unanchored at any point. Nor do I think that the Fed should have taken\nout substantial insurance against the possible consequences of a highly unlikely sequence of\nshocks, especially when a growing body of research suggested that the impact of oil shocks had\ndeclined substantially since the 1970s.\n\nReferences\n\nBarsky, Robert B., and Lutz Kilian. 2004. “Oil and the Macroeconomy Since the 1970s.” Journal of\nEconomic Perspectives 18(4), pp. 115–134.\nBernanke, Ben S., Mark Gertler, and Mark Watson. 1997. “Systematic Monetary Policy and the Effects of\nOil Price Shocks.” Working Paper 97-25, C.V.

            "content": "Presentation to the 128th Assembly for Bank Directors\nBig Island, Hawaii\nBy Janet L. Yellen, President and CEO, Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco\nFor delivery on February 6, 2009, 12:45 PM Hawaii time, 2:45 PM Pacific, 5:45 PM Eastern\n\nThe Economic Outlook for 2009 and Community Banks 1\nGood afternoon and thank you for asking me to speak at your assembly. I’m glad to\nappear before bank directors because—as you know all too well—your industry is at the center\nof the turbulence now swirling around our economy. I look forward to your insights and\nquestions.\nI don’t need to tell you that our financial system has, in many important areas, broken\ndown, and this has precipitated a very serious credit crunch. Banks have played a role in the\ncredit crunch by tightening their terms and standards for lending. Tighter credit terms are a\nnatural response by banks to the losses they have suffered and the deterioration in the economic\nclimate. But diminished access to credit for households and businesses is intensifying the\neconomic contraction and, in turn, exacerbating financial distress. These negative dynamics are\ncreating the perception of intense uncertainty about the future, prompting a loss in confidence\nthat has left households and firms extremely wary about spending. In this environment,\ngovernment policies to restore confidence, create jobs by boosting the demand for goods and\nservices, and improve the functioning of our financial system, represent our main hope of\navoiding a very severe economic contraction. Fortunately, many innovative and bold policy\nsteps have already been implemented, or are being considered, by the Federal Reserve and the\n\n1\n\nI would like to thank John Judd, David Wright, and Sam Zuckerman for assistance in preparing these\nremarks.\n\n1\n\n\ffederal government, and this provides me with a measure of optimism that we may avoid the\nsignificant downside risks that we face.\nToday, I will give you my perspective on financial and economic conditions, and discuss\nthe implications for community banks. As always, my comments represent my own views and\nnot necessarily those of my colleagues in the Federal Reserve System.\nEconomic conditions\nLet me turn to the current economic situation. Unfortunately, there is not much good\nnews to report. Over a year into the recession, the U.S. economy is contracting sharply, and that\nweakness is evident in every sector.\nLet’s begin with the largest sector—consumer spending, which represents about 70\npercent of gross domestic product. It fell sharply in the third and fourth quarters of last year. As\na consequence, retailers experienced a dreadful holiday season and many are now shuttering\nstores and even declaring bankruptcy. Such retrenchment in consumer spending is\nunderstandable, given the truly tough conditions that households face. This morning’s dismal\nemployment data show that nonfarm jobs have declined for 13 months in a row. Since peaking\nin December 2007, some 3.6 million jobs have been lost. The unemployment rate now stands at\n7.6 percent, up from just under 5 percent a year ago. With respect to wealth, the combined\nimpact of falling equity and house prices has been staggering. Household wealth has declined by\nan estimated $10 trillion. Nor can households easily borrow to fund spending—consumer credit\nis both costlier and harder to get. Not surprisingly, consumer confidence is at a 30-year low.\nThe recent plunge in vehicle sales, in spite of lower gas prices and huge price incentives, reflects\nthis lack of confidence, as well as the difficulty of getting auto loans. These negative factors far\n2\n\n\foutweigh the boost to consumer spending from the sharp decline in energy prices since the\nmiddle of last year.\nHouseholds are hunkering down. The personal saving rate has jumped from around zero\nearly last year to about 3½ percent recently, as people have tried to rebuild lost wealth and some\ncushion to weather adversities, including possible job loss. While more personal saving\nstrengthens household balance sheets and makes sense for individual families, in current\ncircumstances it is magnifying the depth of the economic contraction.\nThe steep decline in residential investment that began three years ago was the leading\nedge of our current economic and financial problems. Unfortunately, there is no end in sight.\nHousing starts have plummeted over the past year, falling by nearly one-half. It’s hard to see\nwhen starts will bottom out, since inventories of unsold new and existing homes remain at high\nlevels relative to sales. Indeed, the possibility of ongoing contraction in this sector is intensified\nby the economic downturn, the loss in jobs, and the reduced availability of mortgage credit.\nWith the demise of the market for private-label mortgage-backed securities, Fannie Mae and\nFreddie Mac are now the main sources of funding for conventional conforming mortgages.\nVirtually the only piece of good news for housing is that interest rates on these mortgages have\ncome down recently in response to a new Federal Reserve program to purchase agency debt and\nagency-guaranteed mortgage-backed securities. However, the spreads above Treasury rates\ncharged to borrowers seeking nonconforming jumbos have risen sharply, and mortgages are all\nbut unavailable to borrowers with imperfect credit histories or those who can’t make large down\npayments.\n\n3\n\n\fEven beyond its negative implications for the pace of home construction, the ongoing\ndecline in house prices is a concern because it poses downside risks to future consumer spending\nand the health of the financial system. House prices in some of the largest metropolitan areas are\ndown by as much as 35 to 40 percent from their 2006 peak. Unfortunately, futures contracts for\nhouse prices suggest that further declines are likely this year and next. The correction in house\nprices has contributed to delinquencies and foreclosures on subprime and other mortgages. With\nan estimated 15 to 20 percent of homeowners underwater on their mortgages, it is likely that\nforeclosures will continue at a rapid pace throughout this year. The associated losses are\nseriously weakening banks and the financial system more broadly. And, of course, foreclosures\nare extremely painful for homeowners and create negative spillovers for neighbors and afflicted\ncommunities.\nBusiness capital investment is also dropping sharply, as firms face weak demand for their\nproducts, a higher cost of capital, restricted credit, and a high level of uncertainty about the\nfuture. With regard to credit, many companies, especially those with lower credit ratings, must\nnow pay extraordinarily high rates in the bond market. Bank lines of credit are more difficult to\nnegotiate, trade credit is being restricted, and many firms have become cautious in managing\nliquidity and in committing to capital spending projects. Some companies are drawing down\nexisting credit lines to have cash on hand in case these lines are capped by their banks. It is not\nsurprising that many of my business contacts report cancelling or delaying capital investment\nplans and paring back on their workforces in order to avoid being locked into commitments that\nmight prove burdensome.\nNonresidential construction declined modestly at the end of last year but, surprisingly\nenough, has not yet shown the steep declines that have been expected for some time. However,\n4\n\n\fsuch declines are almost surely imminent. With business activity slowing and new buildings\ncoming on line, vacancy rates on office, industrial, and retail space are all on the rise. For\ndevelopers, financing is indeed extremely hard to get. The market for commercial mortgagebacked securities has all but dried up. Banks and other traditional lenders have also become less\nwilling to extend funding. It’s no wonder that my contacts are talking about substantial cutbacks\non new projects and planned capital improvements on existing buildings. I know that this sector\nis of special interest to many community banks, and I will have more to say about this later in my\npresentation.\nThe budgets of many state and local governments have been thrown into crisis by the\nfinancial and economic mess. The downturns in housing, the stock market, and incomes have\nbitten into tax collections at the same time that financial market turmoil has made it harder to\nissue bonds. The aggregate budget deficit for the 50 states as a whole is growing. In response,\nmany states are cutting spending. Of course, the Obama administration’s plans for fiscal\nstimulus include a large dose of funding for state and local projects, and this should provide\nconsiderable support to this sector.\nUnfortunately, the economic downturn is hardly confined to the United States. Economic\ngrowth in the rest of the world—including Europe and Japan—has weakened sharply for a\nnumber of reasons, including spillovers from the U.S. recession and the financial meltdown that\nnow has spread globally. For these reasons, the world economy appears to have entered\nrecession in late 2008, and it seems likely that this contraction may last for some time, especially\nin some important industrial countries. Moreover, the dollar has appreciated over the past year,\nespecially against the euro and the British pound, making U.S. exports more expensive. It is\napparent that we cannot count on strong foreign demand for our exports to offset weakness in\n5\n\n\fdomestic demand. Indeed, real exports fell sharply in the final quarter of last year after years of\nstrong growth.\nNow, let me to turn to inflation. Not so long ago soaring commodity prices were pushing\ninflation to unacceptably high rates. However, things have changed dramatically, as weaker\neconomic activity around the world has reduced the demand for commodities, pushing their\nprices, and inflationary pressures, down substantially. At the same time, rising unemployment\nand unused industrial capacity are also putting downward pressure on inflation. Thus, in the\nfinal quarter of last year, our main measure of consumer inflation—the personal consumption\nexpenditures price index—fell at a 5½-percent rate; and when excluding food and energy prices,\nthis measure rose at only a ½-percent rate, the slowest pace since early 1961. With slack in labor\nand product markets likely to build significantly over the next couple of years, it seems likely\nthat inflation will remain, for some time, below levels that are consistent with price stability.\nAs I have indicated, the economy is in the midst of a downward spiral, and that calls for\nstrong policy responses. Economic weakness and a shortage of credit are inducing increasingly\ncautious households and businesses to spend less to strengthen their balance sheets and “weather\nthe storm.” These spending cuts serve to spread the pain, triggering additional job losses that\ndamage spending and intensifying the distress that weakens the financial system. The case for\npolicy actions—by both the monetary and fiscal authorities—to arrest this cycle and reverse the\ndownward spiral is exceptionally strong. There’s no question that the spiral presents\nextraordinary challenges for policymakers—challenges that, in my view, are the most significant\nand complex since the Great Depression. However, I am encouraged that bold actions are being\ntaken both here and abroad.\n\n6\n\n\fTo address the crisis, the Federal Reserve has taken a panoply of strong actions. In\nparticular, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) has cut its federal funds rate target by\nroughly 5 full percentage points, establishing a target range of 0 to ¼ percent at its December\nmeeting. Although, for all practical purposes, this interest rate cannot be pushed any lower, the\nFed also announced after both its December and January meetings that an exceptionally low\nlevel of the federal funds rate would likely be warranted for some time due to weak economic\nconditions. By offering guidance about the likely course of future short-term interest rates,\nconditional on the Committee’s economic forecast, the Committee hopes to influence longerterm interest rates and asset prices, which in turn affect the spending decisions of households and\nfirms.\nBeyond interest-rate policy, the Fed is using other tools to improve the functioning of\nfinancial markets and to lower longer-term interest rates in support of private spending. A\nvariety of new nonconventional programs rely on the Fed’s balance sheet. These programs serve\ntwo basic purposes. First, they provide a reliable source of liquidity to financial institutions and\nmarkets so that they are more willing to extend credit. Second, these programs directly augment\nthe flow of credit to the private sector.\nTo fulfill our role in providing liquidity, we have crossed traditional boundaries by\nextending the maturity of loans, the range of acceptable collateral, and the range of eligible\nborrowing institutions. As one example, we introduced a new auction system—called the Term\nAuction Facility (TAF)—to distribute discount window loans more effectively. We also have\ngreatly expanded the size of the auctions and the maturity of the allowable loans to address a\npersistent shortage of term funding in the money markets. In addition, we established a discount\nwindow facility for primary dealers and new facilities to provide liquidity to money market\n\n7\n\n\fmutual funds and the commercial paper market. We have also supported the provision of dollar\nliquidity beyond our own shores through a vast expansion of our network of swap lines with\nforeign central banks. Interest rates in a number of key money markets have come down in\nrecent months, and in my judgment, the suite of facilities that the Fed has created to improve\nmoney market conditions is working.\nTo directly improve the flow of credit to the private sector, the Fed announced several new\nprograms in November. In support of the housing sector, the Fed created a $600 billion program\nto purchase agency debt and agency-insured mortgage-backed securities. Yields on mortgagebacked securities and 30-year fixed-rate mortgages fell substantially right after the program was\nannounced, and these rates fell again when the first purchases were made in January. The Fed\nhas developed another very promising program jointly with the Treasury to help restore\nfunctioning in other impaired financial markets, called the Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan\nFacility (TALF). It will support the issuance of securities collateralized by auto, student, credit\ncard, and SBA, or Small Business Administration loans—sectors where the issuance of new\nsecurities has slowed to a trickle. This approach has the potential to be expanded substantially,\nwith higher lending volumes and additional asset classes, such as commercial mortgage-backed\nsecurities.\n\nNow I’d like to say a few words about the role of fiscal policy in the current crisis. Fiscal\npolicy must play two distinct roles. First, it is needed to help restore the financial system to\nbetter health. Much has been done already in this arena through the TARP, which has provided\ncapital to the banking system to stabilize it and encourage more lending, as well as funding for\nthe TALF program with the Federal Reserve, and guarantees against losses for several\nsystemically important financial institutions including Citigroup, Bank of America and AIG.\n8\n\n\fFurther actions are still needed, however, to get credit flowing. The Administration is expected\nto soon propose a comprehensive program to help banks address the bad assets on their balance\nsheets and assist homeowners in avoiding preventable foreclosures. A lesson from past\nexperience with banking crises around the globe is that the removal of bad assets from bank\nbalance sheets, along with the injection of new capital, is needed to restore health to the banking\nsystem. As long as hard-to-value, troubled assets clog their balance sheets, banks find it difficult\nto attract private capital and to focus on new lending.\n\nThe second role for fiscal policy is to provide stimulus to the economy through higher\nspending and tax cuts. In ordinary circumstances, there are good reasons why monetary, rather\nthan fiscal, policy should be used to stabilize the economy. An important argument against using\nfiscal policy to fight recessions is that it often takes a long time to implement due to the\ncomplexity of executive and legislative decision-making processes and the lags involved in\nspending the money that Congress appropriates. The result is that fiscal stimulus sometimes\nkicks in only after the need has passed. However, the current situation is extraordinary, making\nthe case for fiscal action very strong.\n\nOf course, a fiscal stimulus package, involving a combination of tax cuts and spending\nincreases, is a top priority for the new Obama administration and is now moving through\nCongress. There is—and there should be—vigorous debate about the form it should take and\nabout the likely effectiveness of particular fiscal strategies. However, it is critical that decisions\non these matters be made on a timely basis so that the economy’s downward spiral is not allowed\nto deepen.\n\n9\n\n\fPolicy actions by the Fed and federal government that have already been taken, and that\nseem to be in train, offer the prospect that we may be able to avoid dire outcomes for the\neconomy. My best guess is that we may see economic activity begin to grow late this year as\nhousing construction stabilizes and the financial sector begins to heal. But substantial downside\nrisks remain.\n\nBanking conditions\n\nYou are all well aware that current circumstances create formidable problems for banking\norganizations. For some time now, institutions have been taking losses on their holdings of\nresidential mortgages and securities, and on their residential construction and development loans.\nIn addition, losses have been incurred because of exposure to other financial institutions and offbalance-sheet vehicles that were damaged by those same housing-related assets. Moreover, as\nthe recession has deepened, we have seen rising credit problems in traditional commercial and\nconsumer loan portfolios. As a result, many banks are taking large provisions for expected\nlosses. Judging from the data so far, it appears likely that the commercial banking industry will\nincur a significant loss in the fourth quarter, and that the results for 2008 as a whole will be the\nweakest since at least the banking crisis of the early 1990s.\nTraditionally, the crest of bank credit losses has extended for some time beyond the end\nof recessions. This is not surprising, given that the unemployment rate typically peaks well after\nbusiness cycle troughs. As a result, and given the outlook for the economy, I would expect to\nsee more deterioration in corporate, commercial real estate, and consumer portfolios over the\ncourse of this year and into next year. How well any individual bank fares during this especially\ndifficult credit cycle will depend on the quality of its past and present underwriting; ongoing risk\n10\n\n\fmanagement practices; and the profitability of its core lending, deposit-taking, and feegenerating operations.\nMany community banks have significant commercial real estate concentrations, and these\nloans are a particular concern in the current environment. At present, the performance of such\nloans has deteriorated only mildly. But, as I suggested earlier, we can’t count on that situation to\ncontinue, since the downturn in commercial real estate construction is just getting started and is\nlikely to be quite challenging.\nOne saving grace is that many commercial real estate loans currently do not have the\nsame characteristics that infected the residential real estate boom or the commercial real estate\ncycles in the early 1980s and 1990s. In recent years, underwriting standards on commercial real\nestate loans generally have been fairly conservative. By and large, lenders have focused on\nmaking loans supported by significant cash flow and have required relatively conservative loanto-value ratios. The equity cushions on many of these loans, coupled with low interest rates,\nshould give borrowers quite a bit of “breathing room.” Still, as commercial real estate loans and\nrelated securities are refinanced amid rising vacancies, falling collateral values, and an economic\nrecession, we can expect higher delinquencies, defaults, and losses.\nThis situation represents an obvious challenge to risk-management practices, putting a\npremium on active monitoring and stress-testing. These stress tests can provide bank\nmanagement with advance warnings of the potential effects of higher-than-expected vacancies\nand falling collateral values on their borrowers’ ability to perform and on the bank’s potential\nlosses. This analysis in turn can be used to evaluate the full effect of a commercial real estate\n\n11\n\n\fconcentration on the bank’s earnings and capital, and lead to better decision-making throughout\nthe cycle.\nLarge real estate losses could put pressure on capital levels and should therefore prompt\nbanks to review their dividend policies. In this highly volatile period, when future, but currently\nunidentified, losses are highly likely and capital markets are still not functioning well, capital\nmaintenance is critical.\nIn addition, banks must be attentive to liquidity. Over the past year, we have seen that\nlarge and small banks alike can be extremely vulnerable to losses in confidence, and that past\nchoices in funding a bank’s operations may severely constrain efforts to take corrective action.\nEven multiple sources of liquidity can dry up at the same time, undermining the effectiveness of\ncontingency plans for maintaining access to funding. Many community banks have relied\nsignificantly on Federal Home Loan Bank advances and brokered deposits. While these sources\nof funds can be managed, they do pose risks. For example, the amount of a bank’s borrowing\ncapacity can quickly decline when Home Loan Bank collateral margin requirements tighten.\nSimilarly, institutions whose capital ratios fall from the well-capitalized category to the\nadequately capitalized category may not be permitted to acquire or roll over brokered deposits,\nresulting in liquidity strains.\nAs I have indicated, the work of public officials to stabilize the financial system and\nimprove the flow of credit should help banks meet challenges in these tougher economic times.\nThe measures taken by the Fed, Treasury, and the FDIC have buttressed public confidence,\nprovided new sources of liquidity, and helped cushion banks from losses. All of these special\nmeasures reflect a recognition that banking organizations play a unique and essential role in the\nU.S. economy.\n12\n\n\fIt’s also important to acknowledge that banking organizations find themselves under\nintense scrutiny and are subject to conflicting pressures. At a time of nearly unparalleled\nchallenges for financial institutions, you find yourselves called on simultaneously to preserve\ncapital, avoid excessive risk, and step up your lending. Policymakers are mindful how difficult it\ncan be to balance those mandates. In November, the Fed, the FDIC, the Office of the\nComptroller of the Currency, and the Office of Thrift Supervision issued a joint statement to help\nbanks and thrifts navigate these waters. The statement noted that “at this critical time, it is\nimperative that all banking organizations and their regulators work together to ensure that the\nneeds of creditworthy borrowers are met.” The statement also noted that “prudent bank lending\npractices” should be carried out “consistent with safety and soundness principles and existing\nsupervisory standards.”\nThe policy objective has been to equip banking organizations to serve the needs of\ncreditworthy borrowers by augmenting their capital, providing FDIC guarantees of debt,\nenhanced deposit insurance, and better access to liquidity. In the current circumstances, banks,\nlike households and firms, may be tempted to hunker down. My hope is that, while avoiding\nimprudent practices that would put your institutions at risk, you will also resist extreme risk\naversion, since it would undermine efforts to get the economy going again.\nIn sum, 2009 is shaping up to be, by many measures, the most challenging economic\nenvironment of the postwar period. At the same time though, the vigorous application of\nmonetary and fiscal policy offer the prospect of improvement. I am hopeful that the steps\npolicymakers are taking will stabilize the financial system and provide the broader economy with\na foundation for renewed growth.\n\n13\n\n\f"

I am very\npleased that one of my first speeches of the year is to the Financial Women’s Association.\nThose of you who work in the financial sector are keenly aware of the problems we now\nface in the financial markets and the economy, and I very much welcome your questions\nand insights.\nAs you all know, sound, well-functioning financial markets and institutions are\nessential to a sound, well-functioning economy. They provide the credit that firms\nrequire to finance inventory, hire workers, and invest in new capital equipment and that\nhouseholds need to buy houses and cars and to send their kids to college.\nToday, financial markets have, in many cases, broken down and the ramifications\nfor the economy have been severe due to the essential interconnections between the two:\nFinancial distress precipitated a credit crunch, sending the economy into recession. And\nweakness in the economy has intensified financial distress, further diminishing access to\ncredit. These ongoing, negative dynamics create severe downside economic risks, and\nthe perception of intense uncertainty about the future has prompted a loss in confidence,\nleaving households and firms wary about spending. For example, consumers are pulling\nback on purchases, especially on durable goods, to save more, and businesses are\n1\n\nI would like to thank John Judd, Rob Valletta and Judith Goff for outstanding assistance in preparing\nthese remarks.\n\n1\n\n\fcancelling capital investment plans and laying off workers to preserve cash. Such actions\nare sensible on an individual basis, but they intensify economic distress for the economy\nas a whole.\nI consider it imperative for policymakers to act boldly to restore confidence and\nimprove the functioning of financial markets in order to get the economy back on its feet.\nThe Federal Reserve has already implemented aggressive, creative, and substantial\npolicies, and more can be done. In addition, there is now a consensus that the economy\nneeds strong fiscal action, and prospects are good that a federal stimulus program will be\nforthcoming. Finally, I am heartened that policymakers around the world are responding\nforcefully and cooperatively to address the financial and economic crisis as it has spread\nthroughout the global economy. My goal today is to give you my perspective on the\nfinancial and economic turmoil and to discuss and explain the policy responses and their\nrationales. As always, my comments represent my own views and not necessarily those\nof my colleagues in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nEconomic conditions\nI will begin with a review of current economic conditions. Unfortunately, there is\nnot much good news to report. Recent data indicate that, over a year into the current\nrecession, the U.S. economy is still contracting sharply. For example, the latest Blue\nChip consensus estimates that output declined at an annual rate of over 5 percent last\nquarter and is likely to continue contracting, at a pace exceeding 3 percent, in the current\nquarter.\n\n2\n\n\fEconomic weakness is evident in every sector of the economy. After declining\nslightly in the third quarter, real personal consumption expenditures appear to have fallen\nmore sharply in the fourth. Such retrenchment in consumer spending is understandable,\ngiven the truly tough conditions that households face, but especially troubling because\nthis sector represents over 70 percent of GDP. With respect to jobs, employment has\ndeclined for twelve months in a row, and the unemployment rate now stands at 7¼\npercent up from 5 percent just a year ago. With respect to wealth, the combined impact\nof falling equity and house prices has been staggering. Household wealth has declined by\nan estimated $10 trillion. With respect to consumer credit, it is both costlier and harder to\nget. Not surprisingly, consumer confidence is at a 30-year low and the personal saving\nrate is on the rise, as people try to rebuild their wealth and provide a cushion against the\npossibility of job loss. The recent plunge in vehicle sales, in spite of lower gas prices and\nhuge price incentives, reflects this lack of confidence as well as the difficulties people are\nhaving in getting auto loans.\nBusiness spending is also feeling the crunch, as firms face weak demand for their\nproducts, a higher cost of capital, and restricted credit. In particular, many companies,\nespecially those with lower credit ratings, are experiencing difficulty borrowing in the\ncommercial paper market, an important source of short-term funding. Bank lines of\ncredit reportedly are more difficult to negotiate, trade credit is being restricted, and many\nfirms have become cautious in managing liquidity and in committing to capital spending\nprojects. Some companies are drawing down existing credit lines to have cash on hand in\ncase these lines are capped by their bank. This caution has spread to venture capital\nspending as well, where activity has dropped significantly; in consequence, information\n\n3\n\n\ftechnology and biotech companies in Silicon Valley and elsewhere are scaling back on\nbusiness expansion plans.\nNonresidential construction, surprisingly enough, has continued to show some\ngrowth up to this point, but this is not likely to last much longer. I’m hearing talk about\nsubstantial cutbacks on new projects and planned capital improvements on existing\nbuildings for two all-too-familiar reasons—demand is falling as the economy weakens\nand financing is hard to get. In particular, the market for commercial mortgage-backed\nsecurities, a mainstay for financing large projects, has all but dried up. Banks and other\ntraditional lenders have also become less willing to extend funding.\nAlthough residential investment accounts for under 5 percent of overall economic\nactivity, the decline in this sector over the past three years has been big enough to create a\nmajor drag on growth. Housing starts have plummeted, falling to nearly one-half of their\nyear-ago level, and it is hard to see when they will bottom out, since inventories of unsold\nnew and existing homes remain at high levels relative to sales. Indeed, the possibility of\nongoing contraction in this sector is intensified by the economic downturn, the loss in\njobs, and the reduced availability of mortgage credit. At this point, the market for\nprivate-label mortgage-backed securities is essentially closed for business, leaving the\ngovernment agencies, especially Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, as the main source of\nfunding or backing for conventional conforming mortgages. One piece of good news is\nthat interest rates on conforming mortgages have come down recently in response to a\nnew Federal Reserve program to purchase agency debt and significant quantities of\nagency-guaranteed mortgage-backed securities.\n\n4\n\n\fThe ongoing decline in house prices is a source of particular concern not only\nbecause of its impact on consumer spending, but also because it contributes importantly\nto delinquencies and foreclosures on subprime and other mortgages. Foreclosures are\nextremely painful for homeowners and create negative spillovers for neighbors and\nafflicted communities. As you may know, some of the earliest and sharpest price\ndeclines nationwide occurred in parts of California and other western states, such as\nArizona and Nevada. Foreclosure rates in these states are well above their historic highs\ndating back at least to the late 1970s, and home prices in the largest metro areas are down\nby as much as 35 to 40 percent from their 2006 peak. Unfortunately, futures contracts for\nhouse prices suggest that further declines are likely this year and next.\nMany state and local governments have been dragged into the financial mess.\nThe downturns in the housing markets and the economy have bitten into tax collections at\nthe same time that the financial market turmoil has made it harder to issue bonds. These\nproblems are particularly acute in California. Despite a successful bond issuance in\nOctober, ongoing erosion in revenues has raised the possibility that the state will run out\nof money in February. The latest projection is for a deficit of about $40 billion that will\naccumulate over the current and next fiscal year. This is a huge shortfall relative to\nannual revenue of $100 billion, and the actions needed to overcome it are only likely to\nadd to the recession in the state.\nMoving from the local to the global, the situation is not much brighter. The\nstrong foreign demand for our exports that gave a major boost to the U.S. economy\nthrough the third quarter of last year is not likely to continue. Economic growth in the\nrest of the world, particularly in Europe and Japan, has weakened sharply for a number of\n\n5\n\n\freasons, including spillovers from the U.S. recession and from the financial meltdown\nthat now has spread globally. In addition, the dollar has appreciated against the euro and\nBritish pound over the past year, offsetting a portion of the depreciation that was\nsupporting U.S. exports. For these reasons, it now looks likely that the data will show\nworldwide recession in late 2008 and early 2009, with a more severe and long-lasting\ncontraction in many industrial countries.\nTo conclude my review of current conditions, let me to turn to inflation. Not so\nlong ago we were worried about rising inflation in the wake of soaring commodity prices.\nThose days are gone. Weaker economic activity around the world has reduced the\ndemand for commodities, pushing their prices, and inflationary pressures, down\nsubstantially. At the same time, rising unemployment and unused industrial capacity are\nalso putting downward pressure on inflation. In fact, with slack in labor and product\nmarkets likely to build significantly over the next couple of years, it seems likely that\ninflation will move, for a time, below levels that are consistent with price stability.\n\nConventional Federal Reserve policies\nBy now, I hope my remarks have made it clear that the interaction between the\nfinancial shock and the recession, as well as the associated crisis in confidence, present\nextraordinary challenges for policymakers—challenges that certainly are the most\nsignificant and complex since the deep recession in 1980-82, and perhaps since the Great\nDepression. An important lesson from both theory and history is that such circumstances\ncall for prompt and aggressive policy action. I believe we have heeded that lesson,\nresponding vigorously. The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) has cut its federal\n\n6\n\n\ffunds rate target by roughly 5 full percentage points, lowering it essentially to its “zero\nbound,” by establishing a target range of 0 to ¼ percent at its meeting last December.\n\nFederal Reserve communications policy\nObviously, with the funds rate at the zero bound, the Committee cannot push it any\nlower to stimulate the economy. But that does not mean that the Committee is out of\noptions. An extensive body of literature suggests that communications can play a helpful\nrole in addressing the zero-bound constraint. In particular, by offering guidance about the\nlikely course of future short-term interest rates, conditional on the Committee’s economic\nforecast, the Fed may be able to influence longer-term rates and asset prices. The Fed\nemployed such an approach between 2003 and 2005, and has taken an important step\nalong the same path in its December announcement by stating that “exceptionally low\nlevels of the federal funds rate” are likely to be warranted “for some time” due to “weak\neconomic conditions.”\nCommunication also can be important in the Fed’s efforts to anchor long-term\ninflation expectations. As I mentioned at the outset, the odds are high that over the next\nfew years, inflation will decline below desirable levels. It is especially important in such\ncircumstances for the Fed to emphasize its commitment to returning inflation over time to\nthe higher levels that are most appropriate to the attainment of its longer-term objectives.\nA decline in inflationary expectations when economic conditions are weak is pernicious,\nespecially so when the federal funds rate has reached the zero bound, because any\ndowndrift in inflation expectations leads to an updrift in real interest rates and a\ntightening of financial conditions.\n\n7\n\n\fOver the past few years, the FOMC has taken important incremental steps toward\nmaking its longer-term inflation goals more explicit. For example, we are now\npublishing FOMC members’ inflation forecasts for the next three years under the\nassumption of “appropriate monetary policy,” and the publication of such forecasts has\nhelped shape public understanding concerning the range of inflation outcomes that\nFOMC members regard as desirable in the longer term. Looking forward, there could be\nscope for the Committee to improve the clarity of these communications. I am optimistic\nthat, by clearly communicating the Fed’s commitment to low and stable inflation and by\nbacking that commitment up with determined policy actions should the need arise, any\ndeflationary pressures caused by the weak economy can be contained.\n\nThe Federal Reserve’s balance sheet policies\nBeyond interest rate policy, the Fed has other tools at its disposal to improve the\nfunctioning of financial markets and to lower longer-term interest rates to support private\nspending. Indeed, the Fed has done a lot already through “nonconventional” programs\nthat use its balance sheet. These programs serve two main purposes: first, to provide a\nreliable source of liquidity to financial institutions and markets and second, to augment\nthe flow of credit to the private sector.\nThe provision of liquidity is important to prevent “runs” that create systemic risks\nto the economy as a whole. The Federal Reserve has long fulfilled this “lender of last\nresort” function for commercial banks, which have been protected both with access to the\nFed’s discount window and deposit insurance. In the current crisis, however, systemic\nrisk has been a concern for some financial institutions outside the commercial banking\n\n8\n\n\fsector. I am referring particularly to institutions comprising the so-called “shadow\nbanking sector.” This sector includes investment banks that commonly finance their\nsecurities portfolios through very short-term repurchase agreements with money market\nmutual funds and Structured Investment Vehicles (SIVs) and conduits—entities that issue\nshort-term asset-backed commercial paper to fund holdings of higher-yielding assetbacked securities. Entities like these subject the economy to systemic risk, because, like\nbanks, they are subject to runs. Indeed, any institution, however sound, that borrows very\nshort to hold a portfolio of longer-term, illiquid assets may be unable to satisfy the\ndemands of their lenders for repayment when they flee en masse.\nThe Fed’s balance sheet programs are also intended to augment the flow of credit\nto households and firms, thereby offsetting, at least in part, the reduced flow of credit\nfrom financial institutions and markets. One reason that the availability of credit has\ndiminished is because the markets for most asset-backed securities, with the exception of\nagency-guaranteed mortgage-backed securities, are highly impaired so that issuance has\ndiminished to a trickle. A second cause of the credit crunch is that financial institutions,\nespecially those in the shadow banking sector are scaling back their balance sheets.\nThese institutions suffer from a shortage of capital—or, to put it another way, are too\nhighly leveraged. Unfortunately, the commercial banking sector is unable to pick up all\nof the slack, in spite of the recent capital injections they have received, because banks are\nafflicted with losses from write-downs of impaired assets and mounting credit losses,\nparticularly on real estate loans.\nI’d like to next sketch out some of the programs that the Fed has already put in\nplace to provide liquidity and increase the flow of credit and address some frequently\n\n9\n\n\fasked questions about the Fed’s unconventional policies: Are they working? What is the\nscope for expanding these policies? How does the Fed’s approach compare to the\nquantitative easing policy implemented by the Bank of Japan between 2001 and 2006?\nTo fulfill our role in providing liquidity to financial institutions and markets, we\nhave crossed traditional boundaries by extending the maturity of the loans, the range of\nacceptable collateral, and the range of eligible borrowing institutions. We introduced a\nnew auction system—called the Term Auction Facility (TAF)—to distribute discount\nwindow loans more effectively, and then greatly expanded the size and term of the\nauctions to address a persistent shortage of term funding in the money markets. We have\nalso supported the provision of dollar liquidity beyond our own shores through a vast\nexpansion of our network of swap lines with foreign central banks.\nWe realized early on that stabilizing the financial system would require lending\nnot only to institutions in the traditional banking sector but also to those in the shadow\nbanking sector. Doing so required invoking section 13(3) of the Federal Reserve Act,\nwhich authorizes lending to nonbanks only in “unusual and exigent circumstances.” For\nexample, it was used to facilitate the acquisition of Bear Stearns and to stabilize AIG and\nCitigroup—three systemically important financial firms. This authority was also used to\nestablish a discount window facility for primary dealers—the Primary Dealer Credit\nFacility (PDCF)—and a new facility to enhance the ability of primary dealers to finance\ntheir securities inventories through the market for repurchase agreements—the Term\nSecurities Lending Facility (TSLF).\nThe collapse of Lehman and the near-collapse of AIG this past fall triggered severe\ndisruptions in short-term money markets, as investors in prime money market mutual\n\n10\n\n\ffunds fled to the safety of the shortest-term Treasury securities to the point that the threemonth T-bill rate hovered near zero. These disruptions also triggered dysfunction in the\ncommercial paper market, a large and important source of short-term financing for both\nfinancial and nonfinancial corporations. In response, the Fed set up new facilities to\nprovide liquidity to money market funds and the commercial paper market.\nIn my judgment, the suite of facilities that the Fed has created to improve money\nmarket conditions is working. Conditions are still abnormal, but money market\nfunctioning has improved markedly relative to the dark days of last September and\nOctober. For example, term Libor rates have declined along with the spreads of these\nrates over the federal funds rate. Since term Libor rates are a benchmark for many\nadjustable-rate loans, including mortgages, the benefits of these reductions are rippling\nthroughout the private sector. For highly rated commercial paper eligible for the\nCommercial Paper Funding Facility (CPFF), spreads have also narrowed substantially.\nTo improve the flow of credit to the private sector, the Federal Reserve\nannounced several new programs in November. In this arena there remains considerable\nscope for further action. In particular, in support of the housing sector, the Fed\nannounced and commenced a $600 billion program to purchase agency debt and agencyinsured mortgage-backed securities. Yields on mortgage-backed securities and 30-year\nfixed-rate mortgages fell substantially right after the program was announced, and these\nrates fell again when the first purchases were made earlier this month. Moreover, there\nhas been an upsurge in refinancing activity in recent weeks. The FOMC could also\nexpand its purchases of longer-term Treasury debt, which might lower government\nborrowing rates and spill over into private borrowing rates more broadly.\n\n11\n\n\fThe Fed has developed another very promising program to help restore functioning\nin other impaired financial markets. It is called the Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan\nFacility (TALF), and it will support the issuance of securities collateralized by auto,\nstudent, credit card, and SBA, or Small Business Administration loans—sectors where\nthe issuance of new securities has slowed to a trickle. The high borrowing spreads on\nsuch securities, even when the underlying loans are government-guaranteed—as in the\ncase of SBA and many student loans—suggest not only heightened credit risk but also an\nimpairment of market liquidity which the facilities can address. By improving the\nfunctioning of markets for securitized assets, the Fed has the potential to boost privatesector credit flows in support of the economy. This new facility is a joint Fed-Treasury\ninitiative; cooperation with the Treasury is necessary because the program entails some\nrisk of loss and, under the Federal Reserve Act, all Fed lending must be appropriately\nsecured.\nThe approach employed by the TALF has the potential to be expanded\nsubstantially, with higher lending volumes and additional asset classes, such as\ncommercial and non-agency residential mortgage-backed securities. As I noted, these\nmarkets have all but dried up since the credit crisis began, and the shortage of credit in\nthese critical sectors has made private borrowing costs exceptionally high.\nThe use of the Fed’s balance sheet to stimulate the economy might seem quite a lot\nlike the “quantitative easing” policy pursued by the Bank of Japan in the early 2000s,\nwhen it was at the zero bound. However, to my mind, the differences outweigh the\nsimilarities. The main similarity is that the Fed, like the Bank of Japan, has increased the\ntotal quantity of bank reserves well above the minimum level required to push overnight\n\n12\n\n\finterbank lending rates—in our case, the federal funds rate—to the vicinity of the zero\nbound. The creation of such a large volume of reserves, in the Fed’s case, results from\nthe enormous expansion in discount window lending, foreign exchange swaps, and asset\npurchases through our various liquidity facilities. In the Bank of Japan’s case, the\nexpansion in reserves resulted from the deliberate adoption of an explicit numerical target\nfor them. The concept underlying the Bank of Japan’s intervention was that banks might\nbe encouraged to lend by replacing their holdings of short-term government securities\nwith excess cash. However, near the zero bound, short-term government securities and\ncash are almost perfect substitutes, so exchanging one for the other should have little\neffect on banks’ desire to lend. And the Japanese experience suggests that simply\nexpanding bank reserves—even by a very large amount—had little effect on bank lending\nor on the economy more broadly.\nThe consequence of all of the Fed’s balance sheet initiatives is that our balance\nsheet has ballooned from about $900 billion at the beginning of 2008 to more than $2\ntrillion currently—and is rising. However, the impact of the totality of Fed programs\nshould not be judged by the overall size of the Fed’s balance sheet. Instead, that size will\nbe the result of decisions concerning the appropriate scale of each particular program and\nthe extent to which the various programs and facilities are actually used by market\nparticipants. The take-up rates on these programs and facilities are likely to fluctuate\nover time as market conditions change. For example, early in a new Fed lending\nprogram, its impact on economic activity might rise with the associated expansion of the\nFed’s balance sheet. Later on, if the program helps to improve the functioning of the\nprivate market, success could be associated with the contraction of the Fed’s balance\n\n13\n\n\fsheet as the Fed exits from the market, leaving the determination of credit flows to\nprivate participants. Furthermore, the mere availability of backup liquidity through a\nfacility may improve market functioning, even if the volume of borrowing is low.\n\nFiscal policy\nI’d like to conclude by stepping a bit outside the scope of monetary policy to say a\nfew words about the role of fiscal policy in the current crisis. In ordinary circumstances,\nthere are good reasons why monetary, rather than fiscal, policy should be used for\nstabilization purposes. But we are in extraordinary circumstances, and the case for\nsubstantial fiscal stimulus over the next few years is very strong. First, as I have\nindicated, with the economy contracting significantly, it is time to “pull out all the\nstops”—that is, to deploy both monetary and fiscal policy—to avoid a deep and lingering\nrecession. Second, the case for fiscal stimulus is strengthened by the fact that monetary\npolicy has already moved its short-term interest rate essentially to zero.\nIn fact, a substantial fiscal stimulus package is now under consideration by the\nincoming Obama administration and the Congress, and there will be—and should be—\nvigorous debate about the form it should take and about the likely effectiveness of\nparticular fiscal strategies. While engaging in that debate is not my job today, I would\nnote that fiscal policy can play two logically distinct roles in the present crisis. The first\nis to support aggregate demand. Of course, we don’t know the full details of the bill that\nwill be passed, but the proposed legislation would provide for considerable stimulus—a\ncombination of tax cuts and spending increases perhaps totaling nearly $800 billion.\n\n14\n\n\fThe second role, which is important in the current crisis, is to address the\nmaladies that now afflict the financial sector. Indeed, fiscal resources have already been\ndeployed to bolster the capital of the banking system, to stabilize systemically important\ninstitutions, and to support programs designed to assist homeowners and mitigate\nforeclosure. Fiscal policy can play a further supportive role in unclogging credit market\nflows. I have already mentioned one example: the TALF, which is a joint program\nbetween the Fed and the Treasury that uses funds from the Troubled Assets Relief\nProgram (TARP) and is designed to improve the flow of credit to households and\nbusinesses.\nThe resolution of financial sector difficulties, and the stimulus to aggregate\ndemand in our economy, are essential for a return to sustained growth, and I am\nheartened that the Fed and other policymakers in the U.S. and around the world are\ntaking bold steps.\n\n###\n\n15\n\n\f"

Yellen, President and CEO, Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco\nFor delivery on January 4, 2009, 2:30 PM Pacific, 5:30 PM Eastern\nU.S. Monetary Policy Objectives in the Short and Long Run1\nIntroduction\nToday the Federal Reserve faces some of the greatest challenges in its history as it strives to\nrestore economic growth, job creation, and financial stability and to preserve price stability. To\nachieve these policy objectives, the Federal Reserve is committed to using every tool at its\ndisposal.\nThe challenges are all too well known. Almost eighteen months since the onset of the nowglobal financial crisis, the functioning of financial markets remains greatly impaired, and\ndiminished credit flows are impeding the ability of households and firms to borrow and spend. As\na consequence, the U.S. economy is undergoing a sharp contraction, with almost two million jobs\nlost thus far and unemployment poised to rise further in the year ahead. And the adverse feedback\nloop goes on, as these deteriorating economic conditions, in turn, are intensifying financial sector\ndistress. Regarding price stability, pressures from soaring commodity prices at the onset of the\ncrisis have ebbed dramatically, and inflation is subsiding. Indeed, with growing economic slack,\ninflation may well decline, for a time, below levels that best promote the dual goals of full\nemployment and price stability.\nAn important lesson of theory and history is that circumstances like these call for prompt and\naggressive action. And the Federal Reserve has responded vigorously. Since September 2007, the\n1\n\nThe views expressed here are my own and do not necessarily represent those of my colleagues in the Federal\nReserve System. I would like to thank the staff of the San Francisco Fed’s Economic Research Department, and\nEric Swanson and John Judd in particular, for outstanding support in developing these remarks.\n\n1\n\n\fFOMC has cut the federal funds rate target roughly 500 basis points. In December, the Committee\ntook the historic final step of lowering the federal funds rate essentially to its “zero bound,”\nestablishing a target range of 0 to ¼ percent and communicating its expectation that weak\neconomic conditions would likely warrant exceptionally low levels of the federal funds rate for\nsome time. This move exhausts the Fed’s ability to provide stimulus through “conventional”\nmonetary policy actions. But it by no means exhausts the Fed’s options to stimulate the economy\nthrough other measures. The Committee’s focus going forward will be on “non-conventional”\nprograms that use its balance sheet to improve the functioning of financial markets, an arena where\nconsiderable scope for action remains. In my remarks today, I will describe the balance sheet\nmeasures that the Fed has already put in place, addressing some frequently asked questions: Have\nthe programs worked? What is the scope for expanding these policies going forward? How does\nthe Fed’s approach compare to the quantitative easing policy implemented by the Bank of Japan\nbetween 2001 and 2006? I will also discuss the potential role that enhanced Fed communications\nmight play in helping to achieve both short- and long-run objectives.\nTo preview my answers, I will argue that the suite of programs that the Fed has already\nannounced or put in place are an appropriate and creative response to alleviate strains from the\nongoing credit crunch. The evidence suggests to me that they have improved liquidity in the\nmoney markets and lowered the cost of private credit. Going forward, asset purchases and lending\nprograms could be expanded and extended to additional sectors impacted by the credit crunch. As\nfor the comparison to Japan’s experience, to my mind, the differences outweigh the similarities.\nRoughly speaking, the Fed is focused on the potential for targeted programs on the “asset side” of\nits balance sheet to improve credit flows in specific impaired markets, whereas the Bank of Japan\nwas primarily focused on the potential for an expansion of the total quantity of its liabilities—the\nexcess reserves of the banking system—to spur additional bank lending.\n2\n\n\fThe Fed’s Balance Sheet Policies\nSince the onset of the crisis, the Fed has massively expanded the provision of liquidity to\nfinancial institutions, thereby easing the broader credit crunch. Serving as lender of last resort is a\ntime-honored function for central banks and is critical in mitigating systemic risk. But in doing so\nduring the current crisis, the Fed has crossed traditional boundaries by extending the maturity of\nthe loans, the range of acceptable collateral, and the range of eligible borrowing institutions. At\nthe onset of the crisis, the Fed encouraged banks to use the discount window. The apparent stigma\nassociated with use of the window, however, discouraged banks from borrowing. To address this\nproblem, the Fed introduced and has substantially expanded a new auction system (the Term\nAuction Facility or TAF) to distribute discount window loans. Auctions of longer-term (up to 84day) loans at regular intervals were added to address a persistent shortage of term funding in the\nmoney markets, as evidenced, for example, by exceptionally high spreads of term versus overnight\nLibor loans. To further ease severe liquidity pressures at quarter- and year-end, the Fed introduced\na system of forward auctions on TAF loans. In addition, the Fed supported the provision of dollar\nliquidity beyond our own shores through a vast expansion of its network of swap lines with foreign\ncentral banks, raising the size of borrowing lines with existing swap partners and adding additional\ncentral banks to the network.\nA unique feature of the current financial crisis is that it has engulfed not only the banking\nsystem but also an enormous sector comprising the so-called “shadow banking system,” which\nincludes an array of non-bank financial institutions. It was apparent early on that confining the\nprovision of liquidity to depository institutions alone would be insufficient to meet the liquidity\nneeds of the broader financial markets. In response, the Fed invoked, for the first time since the\nGreat Depression, its authority under section 13(3) of the Federal Reserve Act to lend in “unusual\n3\n\n\fand exigent circumstances” to “individuals, partnerships, or corporations” that are “unable to\nsecure adequate credit accommodations from other banking institutions.” Discount window\nlending under this authority was used to facilitate the acquisition of Bear Stearns and to stabilize\nAIG and Citigroup—three systemically important financial firms. It has also been invoked to\nestablish a discount window facility for primary dealers (the Primary Dealer Credit Facility or\nPDCF) and a new facility to enhance the ability of primary dealers to finance their securities\ninventories through the repo market. This Term Securities Lending Facility (TSLF), through an\nauction mechanism, lends out Treasury securities from the Fed’s own holdings to primary dealers\nin exchange for investment grade securities. The facility, in effect, offers collateral to dealers for\nuse in repos that is more desirable in the market than most asset-backed securities.\nThe Fed’s use of its balance sheet to support the functioning of credit markets expanded\ndramatically following such events as the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers and the near-collapse of\nAIG. Those events triggered severe disruptions in short-term money markets as investors in prime\nmoney market funds fled to the safety of the shortest Treasury securities. These disruptions also\ntriggered dysfunction in the commercial paper market, a large and important source of short-term\nfinancing for both financial and nonfinancial corporations. Two new facilities (the Asset-Backed\nCommercial Paper Money Market Mutual Fund Liquidity Facility (AMLF) and Money Market\nInvestor Funding Facility (MMIFF) were introduced to provide backup liquidity to money market\nmutual funds to help them cope with redemptions that could otherwise cause them to “break the\nbuck.” The AMLF provides nonrecourse discount window loans to banks to enable them to\npurchase asset-backed commercial paper from money market mutual funds, and the MMIFF\nprovides loans to a private-sector vehicle established to purchase a broad range of assets from\nthese funds.\n4\n\n\fIn order to restore functioning to the commercial paper market, the Fed has also committed to\nproviding loans to a new Commercial Paper Funding Facility (CPFF) that was set up to purchase\ncommercial paper from highly rated (A1P1) issuers. Importantly, the ultimate purpose of all of\nthese facilities is to enhance the provision of credit to a broad range of private borrowers by\nrestoring the liquidity and functioning of short-term money markets.\nIn my judgment, the suite of facilities that the Fed has created to improve money market\nconditions is working to satisfy the financial system’s greatly increased demand for safe assets and\nliquidity. Conditions are still abnormal, but money market functioning has clearly improved\nrelative to the dark days of last September and October. For example, term Libor rates have\ndeclined along with the spreads of these rates over the federal funds rate. Since term Libor rates\nare a benchmark for many adjustable-rate loans, including mortgages, the benefits of these\nreductions are rippling throughout the private sector. For highly rated commercial paper, eligible\nfor the CPFF, spreads have also narrowed substantially. In contrast, the borrowing spreads for less\nhighly rated paper (A2P2) remain extremely elevated.\nMoving beyond the money markets, interventions have only just begun, and considerable\nscope remains for targeted asset purchases and discount window lending programs to improve the\nflow of credit and reduce its cost in sectors that have been severely impacted by the financial crisis.\nIn November, the Fed announced and commenced a $600 billion program to purchase agency debt\nand agency-insured mortgage-backed securities. A successful initiative in this area could provide\nsignificant support to the housing sector. Scope remains for larger interventions, and in December\nthe FOMC reiterated its readiness to expand upon these purchases “as conditions warrant.” Even\nat this early stage, the program appears to be having an impact. For example, yields on mortgagebacked securities and 30-year fixed-rate mortgages fell substantially immediately after the program\n5\n\n\fwas announced. The decline in mortgage rates, which also has been affected by a decline in\nTreasury yields, has prompted an upsurge in refinancing activity in recent weeks. The FOMC\ncould also expand its purchases of longer-term Treasury debt—an initiative that could lower\ngovernment borrowing rates and spill over into private borrowing rates more broadly. In its\nDecember statement, the FOMC noted that it is evaluating the potential benefits of such purchases.\nThe Federal Reserve Act confines the System’s outright asset purchases to securities issued\nor guaranteed by the U.S. Treasury or U.S. agencies. Even so, the Fed has the potential to use its\nbalance sheet to restore functioning in other impaired financial markets. The recently announced\nTerm Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility (TALF) provides a model for doing so. This new Fed\nfacility is designed to spur lending to meet the credit needs of households and small businesses.\nThe facility will support the issuance of securities collateralized by auto, student, credit card, and\nSmall Business Administration (SBA) loans—sectors where the issuance of new securities has\nslowed to a trickle. The high borrowing spreads on such securities, even when the underlying\nloans are government-guaranteed—as in the case of SBA and many student loans—suggest not\nonly heightened credit risk but also an impairment of market liquidity which the facilities can\naddress. The inability of financial institutions to securitize such loans, and of potential investors in\nsuch securities to borrow against them on reasonable terms, reflects an important breakdown in\ncredit markets. By improving the functioning of markets for securitized assets, the Fed has the\npotential to boost private-sector credit flows in support of the economy. Under the TALF, which is\na joint Federal Reserve-Treasury initiative, the Fed has agreed to provide nonrecourse loans to\nholders of eligible highly rated asset-backed securities. Cooperation with the Treasury is necessary\nbecause the program entails some risk of loss and, under the Federal Reserve Act, all Fed lending\nmust be appropriately secured. The Treasury has committed $20 billion of TARP funds to protect\nthe Fed against losses on the Fed’s lending commitment of up to $200 billion.\n6\n\n\fThe approach employed by the TALF can be expanded substantially, with higher lending\nvolumes and additional asset classes covered by the program. Indeed, the Federal Reserve and the\nTreasury have announced that the facility could be expanded over time to include commercial and\nnon-agency residential mortgage-backed securities. Securitization activity in these markets has all\nbut dried up since the credit crisis began, and the shortage of credit in these critical sectors has\nmade private borrowing costs exceptionally high. Along these lines, the FOMC stated that it “will\ncontinue to consider ways of using its balance sheet to further support credit markets and economic\nactivity.”\nIt is worth noting that, as the nation’s central bank, the Fed can issue as much currency and\nbank reserves as required to finance these asset purchases and restore functioning to these markets.\nIndeed, the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet has already ballooned from about $900 billion at the\nbeginning of 2008 to more than $2.2 trillion currently—and is rising.\nThe Fed’s current “balance sheet approach” to monetary policy creates an entirely new set of\npolicy issues and challenges. For example, the Fed normally eschews interventions that directly\naffect the allocation of credit, and to a considerable extent, the new facilities rely on financial\nmarkets to channel funds to individual borrowers. However, the new facilities do influence credit\nallocation because they must be targeted at particular sectors of the credit market. In effect, the\nFed must judge where to intervene, deciding where market dysfunction is greatest and where\nadverse consequences for the overall economy are particularly severe. Furthermore, many of the\ninterventions are novel, so no straightforward methods are available to quantify their effectiveness.\nThere are also no clear guidelines for the Fed to gauge the appropriate size of its interventions and\nfew precedents for the Fed to use in communicating its policy stance to the public beyond\nannouncing new programs and describing their terms in detail. Although the purpose of most\nprograms is to lower borrowing costs, the Fed must be careful to avoid the risks that could result\n7\n\n\ffrom targeting some predetermined yield or spread. Finally, the Fed must ensure that it has an exit\nstrategy to wind down the facilities in a timely and effective way when they are no longer needed.\nThese challenges notwithstanding, I believe that the approaches I have described have considerable\npotential to contribute to a strong economic recovery.\nQuantitative Easing?\nOn the surface, it may seem appropriate to equate the Fed’s use of its balance sheet to\nstimulate the economy with the quantitative easing policy pursued earlier by the Bank of Japan.\nBut as I noted at the outset, the differences outweigh the similarities in my opinion. The main\nsimilarity is that the Fed, like the Bank of Japan, has increased the quantity of excess reserves in\nthe banking system well above the minimum level required to push overnight interbank lending\nrates to the vicinity of zero. The creation of such a large volume of excess reserves, in the Fed’s\ncase, results from the enormous expansion in the Fed’s discount window lending, foreign exchange\nswaps, and asset purchases. In the Bank of Japan’s case, the expansion in excess reserves resulted\nfrom the deliberate adoption of an explicit numerical target for them. The theory underlying the\nBank of Japan’s intervention was that banks might be encouraged to lend by replacing their\nholdings of short-term government securities with excess cash. The problem with this idea is that,\nnear the zero bound, short-term government securities and cash are almost perfect substitutes—\nboth are essentially riskless assets that yield a zero or near-zero rate of return; thus, exchanging one\nfor the other should have little effect on banks’ desire to lend. Indeed, the Japanese experience\nduring their quantitative easing program in the early 2000s suggests that simply expanding excess\nbank reserves—even by a very large amount—had little effect on bank lending or on the economy\nmore broadly. The policy may have lowered longer-term borrowing rates, however, by\nsymbolizing and highlighting the Bank of Japan’s commitment to fighting deflation by holding its\n8\n\n\fshort-term interest rate at zero for an extended time—until deflationary pressures had been\nconvincingly dissipated.\nIn contrast, the overall size of assets on the Fed’s balance sheet will be the result of decisions\nconcerning the appropriate scale of each particular program and the extent to which the various\nprograms and facilities are actually used by market participants. The take-up rates on these\nprograms and facilities are likely to fluctuate over time as market conditions change. For example,\nearly in a new Fed lending program, its impact on economic activity might rise with the associated\nexpansion of the Fed’s balance sheet. Later on, if the program helps to improve the functioning of\nthe private market, success could be associated with the contraction of the Fed’s balance sheet as\nthe Fed exits from the market, leaving the determination of credit flows to private participants.\nFurthermore, the mere availability of backup liquidity through a facility may improve market\nfunctioning, even if the volume of borrowing is low. Thus, the impact of the totality of Fed\nprograms should not be judged by the overall size of the Fed’s balance sheet. Rather, it will be\nnecessary to evaluate the success of each individual program in improving market function and\nfacilitating the flow of credit.\nFederal Reserve Communications\nAn extensive literature and some recent experience suggest that central bank communications\nmay also play a helpful role in addressing the constraints relating to the zero-bound. For example,\nDavid Reifschneider and John Williams (2000) and Gauti Eggertsson and Michael Woodford\n(2003) showed that the constraints imposed by the zero lower bound are not very restrictive if the\nFed can credibly commit to keeping the funds rate low for an extended period of time. The idea is\nthat the FOMC can work around the zero lower bound on the overnight interest rate by lowering\ninterest rate expectations in the future, thus pushing down longer-term interest rates to stimulate\nprivate spending. The Fed employed such an approach between 2003 and 2005, and has taken an\n9\n\n\fimportant step along the same path in its December announcement by stating that “exceptionally\nlow levels of the federal funds rate” are likely to be warranted “for some time” due to “weak\neconomic conditions.” I believe that such statements can play a useful role in more clearly\nindicating to markets the Committee’s own expectations concerning the federal funds rate path,\nconditional on the Committee’s economic forecast.\nCommunication also can be important in the Fed’s efforts to anchor long-term inflation\nexpectations. As I mentioned at the outset, the odds are high that over the next few years, inflation\nwill decline below desirable levels. It is especially important in such circumstances for the Fed to\nemphasize its commitment to returning inflation over time to the higher levels that are most\nappropriate to the attainment of its longer-term objectives. A decline in inflationary expectations\nwhen economic conditions are weak is pernicious, especially so when the federal funds rate has\nreached the zero bound, because any downdrift in inflation expectations leads to an updrift in real\ninterest rates and a tightening of financial conditions.\nWork by Refet Gürkaynak, Eric Swanson, and coauthors (2005, 2006) suggests that\ncommitting a central bank to a long-run inflation objective helps anchor longer-run inflation\nexpectations in that country. Over the past few years, the FOMC has in fact taken important\nincremental steps toward making its longer-term inflation goals more explicit. For example, we\nare now publishing FOMC members’ inflation forecasts for the next three years under the\nassumption of “appropriate monetary policy,” and the publication of such forecasts has helped\nshape public understanding concerning the range of inflation outcomes that FOMC members\nregard as desirable in the longer term. Looking forward, there could be scope for the Committee to\nimprove the clarity of these communications. I am optimistic that, by clearly communicating the\nFed’s commitment to low and stable inflation and by backing that commitment up with determined\n10\n\n\fpolicy actions should the need arise, any deflationary pressures caused by the weak economy can\nbe contained.\n\nReferences\nEggertsson, Gauti, and Michael Woodford (2003), “The Zero Bound on Interest Rates and Optimal\nMonetary Policy,” Brookings Papers on Economic Activity 2003(1), pp. 139-211.\nGürkaynak, Refet, Brian Sack, and Eric Swanson (2005), “The Sensitivity of Long-Term Interest\nRates to Economic News: Evidence and Implications for Macroeconomic Models,” American\nEconomic Review 95(1), pp. 425-436.\nGürkaynak, Refet, Andrew Levin, and Eric Swanson (2006), “Does Inflation Targeting Help\nAnchor Inflation Expectations?

Yellen, President and CEO, Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco\nFor delivery on January 4, 2009, 10:15 AM Pacific, 1:15 PM Eastern\nComments on “The Revival of Fiscal Policy” 1\nF\n\nI’m delighted to have the opportunity to comment on the papers of my\ndistinguished colleagues, Martin Feldstein, John Taylor, and Alan Auerbach at a session\ndevoted to a topic of such critical policy importance. With the U.S. economy in a year-old\nrecession, marked by a particularly sharp contraction in recent months, and ensnared in\nongoing financial market distress, fiscal policy intervention is certainly needed. It is\nimportant that it be informed by the kind of cogent thinking and analysis that these papers\nembody.\nI agree with Marty that the current downturn is likely to be far longer and deeper\nthan the “garden-variety” recession in which GDP bounces back quickly. As Marty points\nout, a defining characteristic of this downturn is its cause. Typically, recessions occur\nwhen monetary policy is tightened to subdue the inflationary pressures that emerge during\na boom. This time, the cause was the eruption of a severe financial crisis. Cross-country\nevidence suggests that, following such an event, GDP remains subdued for an extended\nperiod. 2 And consistent with this evidence, many forecasters expect this to be one of the\nF\n\nF\n\n1\n\nThe views expressed here are my own and do not necessarily represent those of my colleagues in the\nFederal Reserve System. I would like to thank the staff of the San Francisco Fed’s Economic Research\nDepartment, and John Fernald and John Judd in particular, for outstanding support in developing these\nremarks.\n2\n\nSee, for example, Carmen Reinhart and Kenneth Rogoff, “Is the 2007 U.S. Subprime Crisis So\nDifferent?” American Economic Review Papers and Proceedings 98(2), May 2008, or International\nMonetary Fund, World Economic Outlook, October 2008, Chapter 4. (http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/\nweo/2008/02/pdf/text.pdf).\n\n\flongest and deepest recessions since the Great Depression. Indeed, the crisis is ongoing.\nRisk-aversion in financial markets remains exceptionally high; deleveraging is widespread;\nthe markets for most private asset-backed securities are dysfunctional; financial\ninstitutions, both large and small, have failed; and the economic downturn is causing\ndelinquencies to rise, threatening further financial distress; households and businesses face\nan ongoing credit crunch; and housing and financial wealth has plunged. Marty points out,\nand I agree, that the likely impact on consumer spending of the decline in wealth thus far—\none of a number of factors weighing on this sector—is, on its own, quite substantial. And\nhouse prices are continuing to slide.\nThe Federal Reserve has responded aggressively since the onset of the crisis with\nboth interest rate reductions and a variety of new, specialized liquidity facilities to improve\nthe functioning of impaired financial markets. At the FOMC’s last meeting in December,\nthe Committee reduced its target for the federal funds rate to a range of 0 to ¼ percent,\neffectively hitting the “zero bound” for the first time since the Great Depression. With\nnominal interest rates now essentially zero, we have reached the limits of what\nconventional monetary policy, working through short-term interest rates, can do to\nstimulate the economy. A special concern in the current circumstances is that a decline in\ninflationary expectations could cause real interest rates to rise. The potential for real\ninterest rates to rise as inflation declines creates a significant downside risk because, with\nan extended period of abnormally high unemployment in the forecast, it is increasingly\nlikely that inflation will fall to undesirably low levels. This is an additional consideration\nthat, to my mind, militates in favor of strong policy responses.\n\n2\n\n\fI certainly agree with John Taylor that the zero bound doesn’t mean that monetary\npolicy has run out of options. At another session this afternoon, I will discuss in detail a\nrange of non-conventional measures, using the Fed’s “balance sheet,” that will be a prime\nfocus for monetary policy going forward. The Fed has already announced or undertaken,\nand can expand, programs designed to improve the functioning of credit markets. These\nprograms complement the actions of the Treasury, the FDIC, and the Fed to inject capital\ninto the banking system, to stabilize systemically important financial institutions, to expand\ndeposit insurance, and to temporarily guarantee the senior debt of banking organizations.\nA clear lesson of history is that a sine qua non for sustained economic recovery following a\nfinancial crisis is a thoroughgoing repair of the financial system. The necessary steps are\noccurring now, but restoration of the financial system to full health will be a long, drawnout process.\nLess clear, and here I part ways with John, are the lessons from Japan’s recent\nexperience with “quantitative easing.” In his paper for this session, John asserts that the\nBOJ’s quantitative easing strategy worked well, while fiscal policy was ineffective. My\ninterpretation of the evidence is exactly the opposite. The BOJ targeted an extraordinarily\nhigh level of excess reserves in the banking system, in the hope that a flood of such\nreserves might stimulate additional bank lending. The BOJ’s quantitative easing policy\nprobably had some beneficial effect, but mainly because it symbolized the BOJ’s\ncommitment to combat deflation by keeping interest rates at zero for an extended time.\nThe expectation of an extended period of zero short-term interest rates was probably\ninstrumental in lowering longer-term nominal rates. But the expansion of excess reserves\nto extraordinary levels appears, on its own, to have had very little impact on financial\n\n3\n\n\fconditions. The Fed’s “balance sheet” strategy has a different motivation. We are focused\non pursuing carefully tailored programs to remedy specific financial market dysfunctions.\nFor example, our suite of programs is designed to enhance liquidity in financial markets, to\nimprove the availability of term funding in the money market, to restore the functioning of\nthe commercial paper market, and to stimulate the issuance of new asset-backed securities\nto support lending to consumers and small businesses.\nI am sanguine that the Fed’s new programs will be helpful in restoring credit flows.\nBut many of the new approaches are experimental, and there is a great deal of uncertainty\nconcerning their likely effects. Even with vigorous Fed action to restore credit flows, an\nextended period of economic weakness is likely. This explains why, in the statement\nfollowing its December meeting, the FOMC noted that it anticipates that an exceptionally\nlow level of the federal funds rate will be appropriate for some time.\nFor all of these reasons, I support Marty’s conclusion that there is an exceptionally\nstrong case for substantial fiscal stimulus over the next few years. In ordinary\ncircumstances, there are good reasons why monetary, rather than fiscal policy, should be\nused for stabilization purposes. But these are exceptional circumstances, and fiscal policy\ncan help get the economy going.\nGiven that a substantial fiscal stimulus package is now under consideration, it is\nimportant for economists to debate the form it should take and raise questions about the\nlikely effectiveness of particular fiscal strategies. With respect to optimal fiscal design, I\nhave heard more alliterative mantras during the past year than at any time in my\nprofessional career! A year ago, the mantra was “Timely, targeted, and temporary.” More\n\n4\n\n\frecently, I’ve heard “Speedy, substantial, and sustained.” 3 In recent testimony, John\nF\n\nF\n\nargued for fiscal policies that are “Permanent, pervasive, and predictable.” 4 And the\nF\n\nF\n\naward for the longest, most detailed, and least alliterative list goes to the International\nMonetary Fund whose staff this week recommended a package that is “large, lasting,\ndiversified, contingent, collective, and sustainable.” 5\nF\n\nF\n\nConceptually, I would note that fiscal policy can play two logically distinct roles in\nthe present crisis. The first, which is the main topic of the papers in this session and my\nsubsequent comments, is to support aggregate demand. I will discuss some issues that\nshould be considered in formulating a stimulus package for this purpose. The second,\nwhich is crucially important in the current crisis, is to address the maladies that now afflict\nthe financial sector. Indeed, fiscal resources have already been deployed to bolster the\ncapital of the banking system, to stabilize systemically important institutions, and to\nsupport programs designed to assist homeowners and mitigate foreclosure. Fiscal policy\ncan play a further supportive role in unclogging credit market flows. For example, the new\nTerm Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility (TALF) is a joint program between the\nFederal Reserve and the Treasury, using TARP funds, and is designed to improve the flow\nof credit to households and businesses. The Fed cannot conduct such programs on its own,\nsince taxpayer funds are at risk. As I noted earlier, the resolution of financial sector\n\n3\n\nLawrence Summers, November 2008, quoted at http://blogs.wsj.com/economics/2008/11/17/summerssnew-view-on-stimulus-sustained-not-temporary/ (downloaded December 31, 2008).\n4\nJohn Taylor, “The State of the Economy and Principles for Fiscal Stimulus,” Testimony before the\nCommittee on the Budget, United States Senate, November 19, 2008.

This\nconclusion is endorsed by the IMF in its recent position paper. 6\nF\n\nF\n\nLet me now turn to some design issues that relate to the use of fiscal policy for\nstabilization purposes. First, as both John and Alan highlight, automatic stabilizers have an\nimportant role to play, and this role could be expanded. These stabilizers have the\ndesirable property of being predictable and automatic—agents know they’re coming, and\nthey inevitably provide a boost just when it’s needed. Using aggregate CBO data on the\ncyclical contribution to the budget deficit, John argues that these stabilizers are as effective\nas ever; it is hard, though, to square this finding with Alan’s analysis showing that the\nautomatic stabilizers have become smaller over time, as marginal tax rates have declined.\nIn the current context, however, I don’t think that existing automatic stabilizers—of\nwhatever size—are likely to provide a sufficient boost to aggregate demand. Moreover,\nboth John and Alan make the important point that the predictable fiscal policy response to\nchanging economic conditions does not rely solely on automatic stabilizers. Alan\nhighlights the specific examples of countercyclical fiscal policy in the 2000s, as well as the\npredictable component over a long period of time in discretionary investment incentives.\nJohn notes, but does not emphasize, that the structural component of the budget deficit—\nreflecting specific, discretionary changes in legislation—has been highly responsive over\nthe past decade or longer to changes in the output gap.\nHence, private agents rationally expect that in times of economic weakness, fiscal\npolicy will respond and that expectation itself serves as a kind of automatic stabilizer in its\nown right, reassuring households and businesses that the government will do everything in\n6\n\nSee Spilimbergo et al., 2008.\n\n6\n\n\fits power to prevent a long period of intense economic distress. Agents have almost surely,\nat least implicitly, built some such expectation about discretionary fiscal policy into their\ncurrent behavior, even if they are highly uncertain about the details of the response.\nPerhaps it would be desirable in the longer run to make the policy rule more explicit and\npredictable—and, as Alan emphasizes, to devote more analysis to understanding the effects\nof different policy rules. But I don’t think now is the time to change the implicit, if\nimprecise, rules and disappoint agents’ expectations about the discretionary fiscal response\nto the present crisis.\nA second design principle that must be kept in mind, given the huge, long-term\nbudget challenges facing the country, is that current responses need to be consistent with\nlong-term fiscal discipline. Conceptually, the choices about the long-term size of\ngovernment—with revenues that are consistent with the desired level of spending—and the\nchoices about the optimal short-run stimulus are quite separate. But long-run expectations\nabout fiscal sustainability do matter, even in the short run. If agents don’t believe that tax\ncuts and/or spending increases are temporary, and are concerned that policy responses\nthreaten the sustainability of the long-run run budget picture, then long-term real interest\nrates are likely to rise in response, undercutting, conceivably even overwhelming, the\nshort-term stimulus. In the 1990s, the term “Rubinomics” came to summarize this\npossibility (in reverse): that “contractionary” measures to improve long-run fiscal balance\ncould provide net, short-term stimulus through this channel.\nIn the present context, this logic creates potential tradeoffs between short-run and\nlong-run considerations. In particular, the permanent income hypothesis implies that\npermanent tax cuts affect spending in the short run by more than temporary tax cuts; but if\n\n7\n\n\fthese tax cuts are not consistent with long-run spending realities, then they are inconsistent\nwith fiscal sustainability and are not credible. For this reason, I am a bit skeptical about\nMarty’s suggestion that we implement broad-based, permanent tax cuts. Especially given\nfuture obligations for social security and Medicare, voters and legislators might resist the\nsizeable reductions in other spending that would be required to keep taxes permanently\nlower than current legislation implies.\nOf course, a concern for fiscal discipline is one reason why temporary tax rebates\nseemed desirable to many observers last year. The rebates were explicitly targeted at lowerincome individuals who were more likely to be credit constrained and thus responsive to\ntemporary as well as permanent changes in income. Some micro evidence suggests that the\nrebates were effective in boosting spending. 7 On the basis of aggregate data, however,\nF\n\nF\n\nboth Marty and John agree that the tax rebates were a bust—they failed to have enough of\nan impact on consumer spending to make a dent in the aggregate spending data. There are\ndifficult econometric issues here—for example, credit constraints on households were\ntightening around the same time the checks were arriving, which could have obscured the\ntrue effects. Nevertheless, the rebate checks at best delayed the most severe period of the\ncurrent recession, and at worst were ineffective.\nHow about investment incentives? In contrast to temporary tax rebates, economic\ntheory implies that temporary investment incentives should be even more effective in\nstimulating aggregate demand than permanent incentives. Hence, they should work well in\nterms of providing large short-term bang for the buck with little damage to long-run fiscal\n7\n\nChristian Broda and Jonathan Parker (2008), “The Impact of the 2008 Tax Rebates on Consumer\nSpending: Preliminary Evidence,” mimeo University of Chicago, GSB, July 2008.\nhttp://faculty.chicagogsb.edu/christian.broda/website/research/unrestricted/Stimulus%20Payments%20and\n%20Spending.pdf.\n\n8\n\n\fbalance. Unfortunately, Alan’s work suggests that, while this logic might hold, it isn’t the\nwhole story. Investment incentives are clearly countercyclical—when the economy slows,\ninvestment incentives rise and firms contemplating capital investment know this. So the\nanticipation effects could cause undesirable fluctuations in investment and economic\nactivity.\nIn theory, as Marty suggests, temporary increases in government spending—or,\nperhaps, changes in the timing of government spending—fit the bill well. Such spending\nhas the advantage of hitting aggregate demand directly. There is uncertainty in the\nacademic literature about the multiplier, although I think that the multiplier is likely to be\nlarger than usual now because private spending is less likely than usual to be crowded out.\nOf course, it is unclear how quickly temporary spending programs can be ramped up and,\nas Marty suggests, there could be bottlenecks of various sorts.\nTogether, these considerations reinforce the IMF’s recent suggestion that a\ndiversified package of policies should be deployed. That is, within the class of fiscally\nsustainable policies, there is considerable uncertainty about the effects of any individual\npolicy. So we should try a lot of things, including, as Marty suggests, government\nspending.\nOf course, there are many things the government could spend money on and this\nbrings me to a third design principle: Policy should aim to promote spending on goods and\nservices with higher rather than lower social value. After all, the goal of policy is to raise\nwelfare. And spending money on projects that aren’t viewed as having much social value\n—such as digging holes and filling them in again—adds a lot less to social welfare than\n\n9\n\n\favailable alternatives, even if such low-value activities can succeed in increasing aggregate\ndemand. Tax cuts do have the advantage of giving individuals the choice about how to\nspend their money. But, as I’ve already noted, it is unclear whether fiscally sustainable tax\ncuts will have sufficient stimulative effect.\nIn this context, as Marty’s argument implies, there are clear macroeconomic gains\nfrom direct government spending. In cost-benefit terms, the aggregate demand\nexternalities increase the benefits of government spending relative to the costs. Hence,\nprograms that already look worthwhile ought to be implemented; and some programs that\nmight not otherwise pass a cost-benefit test could also be justified given the considerable\nslack in the economy. There are real dangers, however, in pushing this logic too far and\nJapan’s experience, to my mind, illustrates them. John suggested that discretionary fiscal\npolicy made no meaningful contribution to Japan’s recovery. I disagree with that\ncharacterization. Japan’s decision to raise its consumption tax and cut public spending in\n1997 aborted an incipient recovery then in progress; and the fiscal stimulus put in place in\n1998 and 1999 appears to have prompted a rebound. Most studies find that fiscal measures\ndid have a positive stimulative effect, although estimates of the fiscal multipliers vary. 8\nF\n\nF\n\nEven so, I have the impression that John’s view is widely held in Japan. I suspect that\nfiscal policy was both unpopular, and widely viewed as ineffective, in Japan because so\nmuch of it involved spending on “bridges to nowhere”—public works projects of dubious\nsocial value. Such spending appears to have undermined popular support for fiscal\nstimulus.\n\n8\n\nThis is consistent with the view expressed in Spilimbergo et al. (2008, page 25).\n\n10\n\n\fIf ever, in my professional career, there was a time for active, discretionary fiscal\nstimulus, it is now. Although our economy is resilient and has bounced back quickly from\ndownturns in the past, the financial and economic firestorm we face today poses a serious\nrisk of an extended period of stagnation—a very grim outcome. Such stagnation would\nintensify financial market strains, exacerbating the problems that triggered the downturn.\nIt’s worth pulling out all the stops to ensure those outcomes don’t occur.\n\n11\n\n\f"
