Yellen at U.S.Africa Leaders Summit: Heads of State Session on Food\nSecurity\nDecember 15, 2022\n\nAs Prepared for Delivery\nGood a�ernoon. I am pleased to welcome you today to a discussion with President Biden\nand other Leaders on the food security crisis impacting Africa and the rest of the world.\nA strengthened U.S. partnership with Africa is vitally important to enhance food security in\nthe immediate term, as well as to promote the long-term resilience of food systems, in Africa\nand globally.\nAs we know, our food systems have been under stress due to climate change, conflict, and\nCOVID-19ʼs economic disruptions. Russiaʼs illegal war in Ukraine has only magnified these\nchallenges.\nWe heard from President Biden how the United States has—and will continue to—mount a\nrobust and swi� response to food insecurity in Africa. We are doing so through bilateral and\nmultilateral channels, and in partnership with you and other African leaders.\nLast Spring, I called on the international financial institutions to swi�ly surge and scale their\ne�orts to increase food security. They responded by launching an Action Plan to Address\nFood Insecurity and have since made meaningful progress.\nWe also stepped-up support for agile mechanisms that prioritize country-ownership like the\nGlobal Agriculture and Food Security Program. The Program will soon announce new funding\nto help build resilient and sustainable agriculture and food systems, particularly in Africa.\nG20 Leaders recently highlighted the importance of a robust global food security response.\nUnder Indiaʼs G20 presidency, we will be mapping the existing policy responses to identify\nany gaps, analyze the spillover e�ects from food and energy insecurity, and consider how\nmacro-policy tools can be used by G20 economies to address these challenges.\n\n\fThese e�orts are making a di�erence for the most vulnerable in Africa. Yet more needs to be\ndone, including on longer-term agricultural and food supply chain development, research\nand development, key logistics and infrastructure.\nThe U.S. is keen to further strengthen our partnership on this vital issue with you. We look\nforward to hearing from you today about how we can all do more—and do so quickly.\n####\n\n\f"

As a result, developing countries and African\ncountries, in particular, have faced serious challenges such as higher food, fertilizer and fuel\ncosts.\nThe United States is seeking to deepen our economic relationships with Africa.

Senegal is a major\neconomic center in West Africa and an important partner to the United States. As Chair of the\nAfrican Union, Senegal also plays a key role as a leader on the continent. We have much to\ndiscuss on how best to meet the challenges we face, including food security and the need for\nsustainable infrastructure investment to boost economic growth and prosperity.\nSenegal, like many other countries, has experienced rising food security challenges, including in\nterms of access and pricing. Russia’s ongoing war in Ukraine has added further stress to the\nsystem, and raised local food and fertilizer costs beyond reach for vulnerable populations.\nPresident Sall and I will discuss how the international community can further work with Senegal\n– and African countries more broadly – to address short-term food security needs and the longterm imperative to promote transformational investments in sustainable and resilient food\nsystems. The International Financial Institutions’ Action Plan to Address Food Insecurity is an\nimportant tool in this regard.\nWe will also speak about the need for sustainable, high-quality, infrastructure investment. By\nworking together, we can make the African economy stronger and more resilient. These\ninvestments are vital for unlocking the enormous economic potential of Africa in the decades to\ncome. And a prosperous continent won’t just benefit Africa – it will make the American and\nglobal economy stronger as well.\nWe have already made progress in this area. As just one example, the U.S. Development Finance\nCorporation supported the construction of the largest wind farm in West Africa – a 158megawatt power plant near Dakar. This project has helped two million people gain access to\npower for the first time – in addition to other economic benefits. President Sall and I will discuss\n\n\fhow Senegal and other countries can explore future investment project ideas in partnership\nwith the U.S..\nIn addition, we will discuss how the multilateral development banks can help countries like\nSenegal tackle traditional development challenges and reduce poverty while also better\naddressing cross-border challenges like climate change, pandemics, and spillovers from\nfragility.\nI greatly appreciate that President Sall was able to travel to Washington for the U.S. – African\nLeaders Summit and for the opportunity to discuss how we strengthen our partnership with\nAfrica, and with Senegal in particular.\n\n####\n\n\f"

        "content": "U.S. DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY\nRemarks by Secretary of the Treasury Janet L. Yellen at the\nBureau of Engraving and Printing Facility in Fort Worth, Texas\nDecember 8, 2022\n\nAs Prepared for Delivery\n\nThank you for that kind introduction, Chief Malerba, and for the extraordinary job you are doing\nas our Treasurer. And good morning, everyone. I’m delighted to be in Fort Worth – and at the\nBureau of Engraving and Printing.\nLet me begin by thanking my BEP colleagues here today: for joining us and for all of your hard\nwork. The currency that you produce here touches just about everyone in the United States and\nmillions more across the world. Our currency is essential to the functioning of the financial\nsystem. And its integrity is core to our national security.\nBEP employees have always gone above and beyond. But you’ve done so at a whole new scale\nunder heightened pressure over the past few years. When much of the nation was sheltering at\nhome, most of you reported to work in person to run essential operations during the pandemic.\nYou’ve worked overtime and on weekends to meet the historic demand for U.S. currency. And\nyou did so successfully: on schedule and under budget.\nBut that’s not all. As if these immediate needs weren’t enough of a challenge, many of you have\ndedicated time and energy to position BEP for the coming decades. You’ve made significant\nprogress on our very ambitious plans to expand the Fort Worth facility and to build a new facility\nin Maryland. And most importantly, many of you are spending time to mentor and train the next\ngeneration of highly skilled union workers. Indeed, BEP benefits from over 1,200 dedicated\nunion members.\nI want to thank you for all you are doing. Each of you is taking on so much. I know you take\ntremendous pride in your work. And I hope you know how appreciative I am of your work as\nwell.\n\n\fI want to especially thank Director Len Olijar Director Olijar is set to retire from federal service\nnext month after nearly 35 years at BEP. Director: your dedication to BEP, Treasury, and our\ncountry epitomizes the spirit of public service. We’re grateful for your commitment to this\norganization – from when you were coming up the ranks of the Bureau to your many years at the\nhelm.\n\nIMPORTANCE OF OUR CURRENCY AND COINAGE\nIt’s no surprise why Director Olijar and many of you have spent your careers dedicated to the\nwork of this organization. Currency plays a critical role in our economy. Economists know that\nmoney serves a number of traditional purposes: as a store of value, a medium of exchange, and\na unit of account. Put simply, our currency powers our economic engine. It enables people to\nexchange goods and services with each other more efficiently. But money also has a deeper\nsocial purpose. Currency is something we use and touch every day. When done right, it can tell\nus who we are, what we value, and what is possible.\nSome of the first banknotes issued by the Continental Congress included unifying messages like\n“we are one.” Coins in the 20thcentury featured national heroes like Susan B. Anthony. She was\nthe first woman to appear on a circulating U.S. coin. This year, the Mint has rolled out coinage\nwith the faces of five remarkable American women. That includes trailblazers like Maya Angelou,\npoet and civil rights activist, and Anna May Wong, Hollywood’s first Chinese-American film star.\nBut these coins are just the beginning of our work to ensure our currency and coinage reflect the\nfull fabric of our nation. With your hard work, we will be introducing new currency designs in the\ncoming years – including placing Harriet Tubman’s portrait on the $20 bill.\nIt’s customary that Treasury Secretaries provide their signature to be featured on our nation’s\ncurrency. You’d think this would be a straightforward process. But the founding fathers did not\naccount for what seems to be a common attribute for Treasury Secretaries: terrible handwriting.\nMy friend Tim Geithner famously had to change his signature in order to make it legible. In an\ninterview back in 2012, he described that the change was made not for “elegance” but simply\nfor “clarity.” President Obama joked during Jack Lew’s nomination as Secretary that he should\ntry to make “at least one letter legible” in his signature. The good news is that President Biden\ndid not make a similar request when he nominated me. But I’ll admit: I spent some quality time\npracticing my signature before submitting it to Director Olijar.\nIn all seriousness: I’m honored that, thanks to the hard work of this team, the first banknotes\nwith my signature are being delivered this month to the Federal Reserve. They’ll be in\n\n\fcirculation starting in the new year. Some will note that this is the first time the signature of a\nwoman Treasury Secretary will be on a U.S. banknote. And the first time the signatures of two\nwomen will be on our currency.\nBut this is really not about me or Treasurer Malerba. To me, these notes represent the hard,\nongoing work of the Treasury Department to strengthen our economy and advance our\neconomic standing around the world. And it is also a reminder of the contributions of the\nwomen who have worked at Treasury and in the economics profession.\nLet me say a bit about both.\n\nMAJOR TREASURY ACCOMPLISHMENTS\nWhen our Administration first entered office, the economy was in the depths of the COVID\npandemic. The coronavirus was claiming more American lives a week than it had at any other\npoint since the start of the pandemic. Millions of jobs had been lost. And there was tremendous\nuncertainty about the fate of our economy. In 2020 and 2021, we were facing the tail risk of an\neconomic downturn that matched the Great Depression.\nYet over the past two years, our country has seen a historic economic recovery. Treasury has\nbeen at the forefront of these efforts. Through the American Rescue Plan, we provided aid to\nhouseholds, businesses, and state and local governments to help them get through a once-in-acentury pandemic. This assistance saved American lives and kept families in their homes. And it\nprovided critical financial relief to those who were suffering.\nAt the same time, we have also made long-term investments in our economic strength. The\npassage of the CHIPS Act and the Inflation Reduction Act this year will enable the growth of two\nimportant industries of the future: semiconductors and clean energy. Nearly three-quarters – or\n$270 billion – of the Inflation Reduction Act’s climate investments are delivered via tax\nincentives. This puts Treasury at the forefront of implementing the biggest climate action in our\nnation’s history. The law will also position us to capitalize on a wave of economic opportunities\nfor the American people, including in communities often overlooked. As we make these targeted\ninvestments, we are also improving our revenue collection system. We have secured muchneeded long-term funding for the IRS. The surge of new resources will modernize the IRS and\ndramatically improve taxpayer service. And it will enable the agency to make sure that all\nAmericans are playing by the same tax rules.\n\n\fAs we’ve rescued and invested in our economy, we have also strengthened our financial system.\nIn the face of increased market volatility, our financial system remains resilient and continues to\noperate well through uncertainties. Since the beginning of the Administration, Treasury has\nworked with financial regulators to improve the resiliency of the Treasury market. This market\nplays a critical role in supporting the global financial system and financing the federal\ngovernment. We have also worked to reduce risks in financial firms and activities that operate\noutside – but are connected to – the traditionally regulated banking system. And we are\naddressing potential emerging risks to the financial system from climate change and digital\nassets. We will continue this work through 2023 and beyond.\nBeyond addressing our considerable domestic challenges, we’ve also advanced the economic\ninterests of Americans around the world. Some of our biggest economic challenges are global.\nToday, the world economy faces serious headwinds in large part due to Putin’s barbaric war in\nUkraine.\nWhen Russia invaded Ukraine earlier this year, the United States joined partners and allies to\nimplement a historic sanctions regime to hold Russia accountable. Together with over 30\ncountries, we have denied Russia revenue and resources it needs to fight its war. We have also\ndegraded Russia’s military-industrial complex and ability to wage war in the long term. Our\nefforts are working: we have curtailed Russia’s access to semiconductors and other key inputs.\nIn fact, reports indicate that Russia is now forced to turn to outdated Soviet-era equipment and\narms and technology from North Korea and Iran. Now, with our price cap on Russian oil in place,\nwe are targeting Russia’s key source of revenue while aiming to mitigate volatility in global\nenergy markets.\nIn the meantime, the United States is supporting Ukrainians with $13 billion in direct economic\nassistance – in addition to military aid. And we’ve requested that Congress provide an additional\n$14.5 billion in support for the first nine months of 2023. Our support of Ukraine is a moral and\nnational security imperative. And we’re continuing to help mitigate the impacts of Russia’s war\non countries in need. Energy and food security is critical for countries around the world, in\naddition to our continued urgent work on poverty alleviation, pandemic response, and climate\nmitigation and adaptation.\n\nWOMEN IN THE TREASURY DEPARTMENT AND ECONOMICS\nPROFESSION\n\n\fAs I look back on the past year, I’m reminded of the talent and dedication of our Treasury\ncolleagues. Our work is only possible because we are tapping into the potential of people with a\nbroad range of backgrounds and experiences.\nThe truth is that this wasn’t always the case for women in the economics profession. I was the\nonly woman out of a PhD program of a couple dozen students. When I was at the start of my\nacademic career, women made up only 6 percent of faculty in economic departments surveyed\nby the American Economic Association. And this was back in the early 1970s. Women who came\nbefore me – and even more so for those in less forgiving professions – experienced much worse.\nIn fact, Treasury led the first major effort to employ women into the federal government. While\nTreasury hired a few women prior to the 19th century, there was no dedicated effort to do so\nuntil the Civil War. Men were in short supply, and women were cheaper to hire. So, starting in\n1862, Treasury began hiring hundreds of women. The first woman to be hired in that cohort was\nJennie Douglas. The first Black woman was Sophia Holmes. Many of these women were\nresponsible for inspecting banknotes for counterfeits and cutting up sheets of Treasury notes. In\nother words, these women were your predecessors at BEP.\nMany decades later, President Franklin Roosevelt nominated Josephine Roche as the first\nwoman to be Assistant Secretary of the Treasury. Women joined the Treasury workforce in much\nlarger numbers in the 20th century, thanks to the persistent work of activists and women like\nJennie, Sophia, and Josephine. They also did so in other industries and professions. In fact, the\ngrowing participation of women in our labor force was one of the greatest drivers of America’s\neconomic growth in the 20th century.\nToday, women represent around 62 percent of the Treasury workforce. And women are in\npositions of power across our Department – from public affairs to domestic finance to the chief\nof staff’s office. We’ve made progress in providing greater economic opportunity for women at\nTreasury and in the economics profession. But we know that much more needs to be done. I\nhope that today is a reminder of the road we’ve traveled on equity and inclusion. And I hope it\nmotivates us to continue to move forward.\nI’m proud of the work that Treasury is doing. Today is not about me or a new signature on our\ncurrency. It’s about our collective work to create a stronger and more inclusive economy. At the\nend of the day, the field of economics is not about numbers or theory. It’s about improving the\nlives of ordinary people. This is what the Treasury Department has been focused on in 2022. And\nthat will continue to be our North Star over the coming months and years.\n\n\fThank you. I’m grateful for all of your hard work.\n###\n\n\f"

        "content": "U.S. DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY\nRemarks by Secretary of the Treasury Janet L. Yellen at Inaugural\nMeeting of Treasury Advisory Committee on Racial Equity\nDecember 5, 2022\n\nWASHINGTON — Today, Secretary of the Treasury Janet L. Yellen delivered opening remarks at\nthe first meeting of the Treasury Advisory Committee on Racial Equity (TACRE). The first-of-itskind committee aims to provide advice and recommendations to Secretary Yellen and Deputy\nSecretary Wally Adeyemo on efforts to advance racial equity in the economy and address acute\ndisparities for communities of color.\n\nAs Prepared for Delivery\nGood morning, everyone. Welcome to the Treasury Department. And welcome to the first\nmeeting of the Treasury Advisory Committee on Racial Equity.\nI’d like to thank you for being here today, and for the work that you’ve graciously agreed to do.\nThe formation of this committee is a milestone in Treasury’s racial equity agenda. This\ncommittee will bring a wide set of outside perspectives to advise me, the Deputy Secretary, and\nother Treasury officials on how we can bolster our equity efforts.\nThe inaugural members of the committee come from a broad range of backgrounds – from\nacademia to business to local government. But you all share a commitment to building an\neconomy that works for everyone. I want to thank Mayor Nutter for chairing this committee, and\nFelicia Wong for serving as vice chair. And I want to thank Janis Bowdler, my Counselor for\nRacial Equity, and her team for their hard work.\nLet me speak briefly about how the committee fits into our work on racial equity.\nSince taking office, President Biden has made clear that our Administration’s work to recover\nand rebuild must be inclusive and equitable. Even before the coronavirus hit our shores, we\nknew our economy had not worked as well as it should for too many people of color. And we\nknew that this did not just have a negative impact on underserved communities. Economic\ninequality is a drag on our economy as a whole.\n\n\fIn fact, I have spent the last few months on the road to lay out our “modern supply-side”\nagenda. This agenda – reflected in the President’s economic plan – recognizes that some of the\nbest opportunities for growth come from investing in people and places that have been\noverlooked. I believe that investments in disadvantaged communities often result in higher\nrelative returns on investment. And they can boost top-line growth by enabling us to tap all our\nresources.\nAt Treasury, we have been guided by this principle in our work. Our first job was to foster a postpandemic recovery that did not leave any Americans behind. We centered equity in our\nimplementation of the American Rescue Plan – from our housing programs to our aid to state\nand local governments. Today, economic data indicates that our recovery has been the most\nequitable in recent history, with record drops in unemployment for many communities of color.\nWe are also making investments that will drive the future growth of our economy. Over the past\nyear, the Biden Administration has made three historic investments in the long-term strength of\nour economy: the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, the CHIPS and Science Act, and the Inflation\nReduction Act. Treasury is playing a particularly significant role in the implementation of the\nInflation Reduction Act’s historic climate change investments – nearly three-quarters of which\nare estimated to be delivered via tax incentives. You’ll hear an update today from Lily\nBatchelder, our Assistant Secretary for Tax Policy, about our efforts there. And you’ll also hear\nfrom Counselor Natasha Sarin about our efforts to modernize the IRS and ensure that all\nAmericans are playing by the same rules. I believe that these laws provide a transformative\nopportunity to advance economic fairness.\nThe Treasury Advisory Committee on Racial Equity will play a major role in our effort. Over the\ncoming months, you will inform our policymaking in areas from tax fairness and capital delivery\nsystems to Treasury’s internal efforts to reflect America’s diversity in our workforce. And you’ll\nkeep us accountable: to make sure we’re focused on our North Star of fostering an economy that\nunlocks everyone’s economic potential – including people of color, rural communities and those\nmost affected by climate change. Our entire economy benefits when all Americans reach their\nfull potential.\nThe work of this committee will make a difference for many Americans. I’m looking forward to\nhearing your perspectives in this meeting. And I’m looking forward to working together to\nensure communities of color and other underserved communities benefit from – and participate\nin – the economic growth and investments enacted by this Administration.\n\n\fAgain, thank you for all you are doing. Mayor Nutter, I’ll turn it over to you.\n\n\f"

I value our partnership on global\neconomic issues, and I am particularly appreciative of our cooperation on sanctions to hold\nRussia accountable for its war against Ukraine.\nRussia’s barbaric war has destroyed lives and livelihoods in Ukraine. But its ramifications have\nalso reached millions around the globe – including threatening energy supply in Europe.\nAs I’ve said before, ending Russia’s war is a moral imperative. And it remains the single best\nthing we can do to help the global economy. Both of our countries are committed to holding\nRussia accountable for its horrific actions – and we must support brave Ukrainians as they\ndefend their homeland and rebuild.\nI look forward to discussing a range of issues with you today, including continuing to hold\nRussia accountable, supporting Ukraine financing and recovery, and building sustainable global\ngrowth.\nIn particular, I’m proud that yesterday the Biden Administration requested a further $14.5\nbillion, which will primarily provide economic assistance to Ukraine for the first 9 months of\n2023. In addition to the European Union’s recent commitment of 18 billion euros in economic\nsupport for 2023, and the significant economic and security assistance our countries have\n\n\falready provided, we are ensuring that the Ukrainian people have the support they need to\nresist Russia’s illegal war of aggression.\nOn all of these issues, our partnership will be crucial, and I look forward to today’s discussion\nand engagements moving forward.\nThank you.\n\n\f"

Yellen at the U.S. –\nIndia Business and Investment Opportunities Event in New\nDelhi, India\nNovember 11, 2022\n\nAs Prepared for Delivery\nThank you for that introduction. It’s great to be here with all of you. Let me first express my\nthanks to Minister Sitharaman. I’m grateful for her warm welcome. I’m also appreciative of her\npartnership on a broad range of important issues over the past two years.\nI’m thrilled to be back in India. During this trip, I’ve been reminded of the dynamism of the\nIndian people. The leaders gathered here today are an example of the vitality that makes India\none of the fastest-growing major economies in the world. It’s also been inspiring to witness how\nAmericans and Indians are working together to strengthen our ties and drive economic growth\nfor both of our countries.\nWe’re meeting today at a moment where we see significant challenges for the global economy.\nThe pandemic continues to exert a drag on economies across the globe. Putin’s brutal war has\nclaimed countless Ukrainian lives and livelihoods; it has also exacerbated food and energy\ninsecurity across the world. Climate change continues to devastate communities with greater\nseverity and frequency.\nAs President Biden said earlier this year, India is an indispensable partner to the United States.\nThat’s particularly true today. I believe that these urgent challenges are bringing India and the\nUnited States closer together than ever before. Our partnership is especially crucial as India\nprepares to assume the G20 presidency. Over the next year, we look forward to supporting\nIndia’s presidency and making progress on our shared global priorities.\nBut today, I want to focus on our own bilateral economic relationship. I believe that we should\nstrengthen trade and investment between India and the United States. Deepening our bilateral\nties will reap significant economic benefits for both of our nations. At a time of global turmoil, I\nalso believe that it will bolster our countries’ resilience and national security.\n\n\fThe economic ties between the U.S. and India are stronger than ever before. As you know, the\nUnited States is India’s biggest trading partner. And our bilateral trade recently reached an alltime high of over $150 billion in 2021. Direct investment from India in my country supported\nover 70,000 jobs at the end of 2020. A broad range of American companies – from Whirlpool to\nBoeing to GE – invest in India. And Indian technology firms like Infosys and Mindtree are critical\nto the day-to-day operations of many American corporations.\nOur close ties also extend to the next generation. We’re grateful that 200,000 Indians are\nstudying in America and enriching our schools and universities. As many of you know, our\nstrong educational and research collaboration will lay the groundwork for future economic\ngrowth.\nOur relationship has not only withstood, but thrived, at a time of global volatility. That’s no\nsurprise. Our countries share an economic dynamism that is tied to our democratic traditions:\none that values new ideas while providing stability and predictability through the rule of law.\nAs we look to the future, I believe that the recent disruptions caused by the pandemic and\nRussia’s war are a reason to further deepen our economic ties.\nIndia is one of our trusted trading partners. In a world where supply chain vulnerabilities can\nimpose heavy costs, we believe it’s important to strengthen our trade ties with India and the\nlarge number of countries that share our approach to economic relations. This includes both\ndeveloping and advanced economies. Our goal is to vigorously promote global economic\nintegration while creating greater redundancies in our supply chain to mitigate concentration\nrisks. We also want to diversify away from risky countries like Russia that seek to weaponize\ntrade integration to advance their geopolitical aims.\nWe call this strategy “friendshoring.” Modernizing our trade relationships in this way will pay\ndividends. Increased trade between our two countries can result in economic benefits for our\npeople. It will also provide greater reliability and certainty for consumers and businesses on key\ngoods and inputs. As Prime Minister Modi said, resilient trade in the 21st century requires trust,\ntransparency, and timeliness. Deepening our integration will serve all three of these goals.\nWe are already seeing new supply chains develop in India. This includes manufacturing\ninvestments by American companies. Apple and Google have both announced plans to expand\nphone production in India. Hasbro, an American toy conglomerate, began shifting\nmanufacturing from China to India and Vietnam in 2019. And it plans to continue doing so. We\n\n\fwill continue to build business and commercial ties through meetings like the U.S.-India\nCommercial Dialogue and CEO Forum.\nFurther, our government is partnering with India to grow local industries and connect them to\nglobal supply chains. We believe our investments will benefit both countries. For example, the\nU.S. International Development Finance Corporation has a very active portfolio in India –\ninvesting in projects from microfinance to renewable energy. Last year, it approved up to $500\nmillion in debt financing for America’s largest solar manufacturer to build a solar module\nproduction facility in Tamil Nadu. The loan is the largest single debt financing transaction in the\ninstitution’s history. Once finished, the facility will strengthen global supply chains by\ndiversifying solar panel production. At the same time, it will support Prime Minister Modi’s\nrenewable energy ambitions.\nAs we bolster our relationship, we can do so in a way that sets the standard for innovation and\ncooperation in the 21st century. Earlier this year, India and a dozen other economies joined the\nUnited States in establishing the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework. The Indo-Pacific region is\nprojected to be the largest contributor to global growth over the next few decades. The\ncountries in this Framework will help write rules for our new economy.\nIn all, I believe that the current moment, difficult as it is, will bring our countries even closer\ntogether. We have much to gain: for our economies as well as for our resilience and national\nsecurity.\nAll of us in this room have a critical role to play. We look forward to working with government,\nindustry, and civil society leaders as we deepen the relationship between our two countries.\nThank you.\n###\n\n\f"

        "content": "U.S. DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY\nRemarks by Secretary of the Treasury Janet L. Yellen at Microsoft\nin New Delhi, India\nNovember 11, 2022\n\nAs Prepared Delivery\nGood morning. Let me start by thanking Microsoft for hosting me. I’m appreciative of your warm\nwelcome and the opportunity to meet with private sector executives and engineers this\nmorning. Your work is helping strengthen our countries’ ties and contributing to our economic\ngrowth.\nThis is my first visit to India as Treasury Secretary. I’m delighted to be here as India celebrates its\n75th year of independence and prepares to assume the G20 presidency. As President Biden said\nearlier this year, India is one of America’s indispensable partners. The dynamism I’ve felt at\nMicrosoft today – and in Delhi more broadly – is a testament to the talent of the Indian people\nand the vibrancy of its culture. It’s no surprise that India is among the fastest-growing major\neconomies in the world.\nI’m also here at a pivotal moment for the global economy. We are dealing with a confluence of\nheadwinds: the lingering effects of the pandemic, spillovers from Putin’s barbaric war in\nUkraine, and macroeconomic tightening as many countries grapple with inflation. Emerging\nmarkets and developing countries are particularly under pressure. Tens of millions more people\nface extreme poverty and hunger since Russia’s war in Ukraine began. Prime Minister Modi was\ncorrect when he said that this “is not an era of war.” I believe that ending Russia’s war is a moral\nimperative. It is also the single best thing we can do to help the global economy. This is a view\nthat is broadly shared among policymakers of the world’s major economies.\nDifficult times test us. But I believe the challenges we face are bringing the United States and\nIndia closer together than ever before.\nI’ll begin my remarks today by discussing the strong relationship between our two countries. I’ll\nfocus particularly on efforts to deepen our shared economic interests, including through trade.\nOur collective work is critical to showing the world that democracies can deliver for our people.\n\n\fThen, I’ll turn to our leadership on global priorities. The trajectory of the global economy will be\nshaped by the work that India and the United States undertake together. The same is true for\nthe prosperity and security of the Indo-Pacific. As a lead developing country and the world’s\nlargest economy, we have great opportunity and great responsibility to make progress on the\nworld’s most intractable problems. In fact, I think that our continued partnership is an example\nof how advanced and developing countries can bridge policy differences and move forward on\nmajor policy objectives.\n\nDEEPENING THE U.S.-INDIA RELATIONSHIP\nA. U.S-India Partnership\nI’d like to start by reflecting on the strength of our relationship.\nThe U.S.-India relationship continues to grow through its 75th year. Our ties are stronger than\never before. The United States is home to the largest Indian diaspora outside of Asia. It serves as\nIndia’s largest export market. Bilateral trade between our two countries reached an all-time high\nlast year, and we expect it to grow further in the years to come.\nThe dynamism of our relationship can especially be seen in the technology sector. Our people\nand our companies depend on each other on a daily basis. Indians frequently use WhatsApp to\ncommunicate; many American companies rely on Infosys to operate. Leaders of Indian descent\npopulate the highest ranks of Google, Microsoft, and other valuable American companies.\nThey’re also responsible for starting a third of all immigrant-founded startups in the United\nStates.\nDomestically, both of our countries are pursuing long-term investments in our economic\nstrength. Since the Biden Administration took office last year, we have enacted an agenda that I\ncall “modern supply-side” economics. This agenda pursues investments in human capital,\nphysical capital, and science and technology in order to boost the economy’s productive\ncapacity and reduce inequality. I know that India shares an interest in certain elements of this\nagenda as well. Prime Minister Modi has launched a 100-trillion-rupee infrastructure\ndevelopment plan, just as President Biden is deploying funding from our historic $1.2 trillion\ninfrastructure law. Both of our countries are also growing our domestic semiconductor and\nclean energy industries. The United States welcomes India’s ambition to become a powerhouse\nin the areas of green hydrogen and other renewable technologies like solar.\n\n\fMore broadly, India and the United States are the world’s largest democracies. We are living at a\ncritical time for the cause of freedom around the world. Democracies require our constant\nattention and nurturing. It is important for all democracies to renew our commitment to civil\nliberties and human rights, including for all our minorities, at home and abroad. And we must\ncontinue to cultivate the economic vitality that is tied to our democratic traditions. That’s an\nopen, inclusive, and competitive economy where new ideas can grow and thrive, with the\nstability and reliability accorded by adherence to the rule of law.\nIn the Indo-Pacific region, our shared objective is to advance prosperity and maintain peace and\nsecurity. India and the United States remain committed to upholding the rules-based\ninternational order. We are working with our allies and partners to tackle global challenges\nthrough the Quad and the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework. The United States’ leadership in\nestablishing IPEF demonstrates our commitment to the region. Together, the 14 members of\nIPEF constitute 40 percent of the world’s GDP. We are writing new rules for the 21st-century\neconomy, in areas from climate to anti-corruption to supply chain resilience.\n\nB. Our Approach to Friendshoring\nThis brings me to my next point. The United States and India share an interest in strengthening\nour supply chains in a world where certain governments wield trade as a geopolitical weapon.\nLet me explain an approach that the United States is taking to minimize supply chain\nvulnerabilities. It’s called “friendshoring.”\nLet’s begin with the basics. The United States believes in economic integration. Trade can drive\ngrowth and bring significant economic benefits to all countries involved. Exports enable\ncountries to expand production and provide good-paying jobs in industries where they have a\ncomparative advantage. Imports provide consumers and businesses with cheaper goods and a\nbroader array of choices. Trade also facilitates the cross-pollination of ideas that is vital to\ndiscovery and innovation.\nWe must vigorously promote our global economic integration and continue to reap its benefits.\nAs we do so, I believe that we must also account for the probability of disruptions to trade.\nRecent disruptions have contributed to higher prices in both of our countries and sapped\neconomic output. For too long, countries around the world have been overly dependent on\nrisky countries or a single source for critical inputs.\n\n\fTake Russian energy exports. Russia has long presented itself as a reliable energy partner. But\nfor the better part of this year, Putin has weaponized Russia’s natural gas supply against the\npeople of Europe. It’s an example of how malicious actors can use their market positions to try\nto gain geopolitical leverage or disrupt trade for their own gain.\nThe United States is pursuing an approach called “friendshoring” to diversify away from\ncountries that present geopolitical and security risks to our supply chain. To do so, we are\nproactively deepening economic integration with trusted trading partners like India. Our\nstrategy will also create redundancies in our supply chain to mitigate over-concentration risks.\nAnd we are also addressing our reliance on manufacturers whose approaches clash with our\nhuman rights values.\nTo be very clear, friendshoring is not limited to an exclusive club of countries. We seek\nintegration with the large group of countries that we can count on – developing countries and\nadvanced economies alike. In fact, part of our “friendshoring” approach involves partnering\nwith developing countries to grow local industries and connect them to the global supply chain.\nFor example, our development finance institution is providing America’s largest solar\nmanufacturer with up to $500 million in debt financing to build a facility in Tamil Nadu in India.\nThis facility will boost India’s solar manufacturing capacity. At the same time, it will help\ndiversify supply chains away from China, which currently dominates over 80 percent of global\nsolar panel production. Our investments are also consistent with our values: certain solar panel\nmaterials produced in China – like those from the Xinjiang region – are known to be produced\nwith forced labor.\nWe are already seeing progress. New supply chains are developing across regions from Asia to\nthe European Union. We are also seeing signs that Western firms are diversifying their supply\nchains beyond China. Technology companies like Amazon and Google are investing in India and\nVietnam. Apple recently announced that it was shifting some iPhone manufacturing from China\nto India. The United States will continue to deepen our business and commercial ties with India\nas we pursue our friendshoring agenda.\n\nINDIA’S G20 PRESIDENCY AND PROGRESS ON GLOBAL\nCHALLENGES\nBuilding a truly resilient world also requires multilateral action on pressing global challenges.\nWe know these problems are urgent. And we know how reliant we are on each other. A virus that\n\n\femerges in a city on one side of the world can spread into a pandemic. An unjustified land war in\none region can worsen hunger and poverty for millions around the globe.\nIn three weeks, India will assume the helm of the G20 at an uncertain time for the global\neconomy. We look forward to supporting India’s G20 presidency. A successful Indian presidency\nis indispensable to our global economic recovery and sustained progress on our deepest\nproblems.\nLet me focus on four shared objectives: addressing debt distress, promoting climate action,\nevolving the multilateral development banks, and embracing and shaping our changing\neconomy.\n\nA. Debt Distress\nFirst, the G20 must do better to provide debt relief where necessary.\nEven before the pandemic hit, debt levels were rising in many low- and middle-income\ncountries. Today, nearly 60 percent of low-income countries are at high risk of or are in debt\ndistress. This over-indebtedness poses a risk to stability and growth at a time when financial\npressures are mounting. Without timely and orderly debt relief, we worry that many developing\ncountries may face severe economic fallout.\nIndia’s G20 year is a chance to accelerate global coordination on debt restructuring. Two years\nago, the G20 established the Common Framework to bring all the major bilateral creditors\ntogether to coordinate timely and orderly debt relief for low-income countries. But the Common\nFramework has not delivered on its promise, largely because of lack of cooperation from China.\nAs a consequence, debtor countries in need are hesitant to request Common Framework\ntreatment. This needs to change. All major bilateral creditors, including China, must cooperate\nconstructively to deliver on their G20 commitment to provide meaningful debt relief. We must\nalso improve the speed and predictability of the Common Framework itself.\nBeyond low-income countries, middle-income countries in distress, such as Sri Lanka, will also\nneed a process for receiving timely and orderly debt relief. We welcome India’s leadership in this\narea, whether through an expansion of the Common Framework or another multilateral\nframework\n\nB. Climate Crisis\n\n\fSecond, we must accelerate action on climate.\nAs the world’s second- and third-largest emitters, we have a shared interest and responsibility to\nreduce our greenhouse gas emissions. The United States is taking significant action. At home,\nwe have enacted the Inflation Reduction Act. It’s the most aggressive domestic climate action in\nour history. Our investment puts us on a strong path to meet our goal of reducing our emissions\nto at least half of 2005 levels by the end of this decade. It will also bring down the cost curves of\nclean energy technologies. This will have positive spillovers for the rest of the world.\nAbroad, we are supporting the clean energy transition for developing countries, all while\nrecognizing that energy access remains a challenge for many. We are working with countries to\nstrengthen climate resilience for the most vulnerable communities. And we are facilitating a just\ntransition for those most affected by the shift to a net-zero economy.\nPresident Biden has committed to increasing U.S. international public climate financing to over\n$11 billion by 2024. In partnership with India, the G7 is marshalling a broad mix of public,\nprivate, and philanthropic financing to expedite India’s energy transition in line with its\nambitious climate goals. We will also advance global climate coordination with India in our role\nas co-chair of the G20 working group on sustainable finance. A global challenge like climate\ncannot be solved by any one country. It requires all of us to work together.\n\nC. Multilateral Development Bank Evolution\nThird, we must position our international institutions to more effectively tackle global\nchallenges.\nThe world faces a growing array of increasingly complex and interlinked challenges that do not\nrespect national boundaries. This includes climate change, pandemics, and fragility and\nconflict. Yet, our existing multilateral development finance architecture is currently unable to\nrespond to these global challenges with the necessary speed and scale. Last month, ahead of\nthe Annual Meetings, I called for an evolution of the development banks. I said that these\ninstitutions must devise new approaches to global challenges, while maintaining their existing\nfocus on poverty reduction and the Sustainable Development Goals.\nI am pleased that the World Bank has committed to developing a work program by the end of\nthe year to strengthen its role and capacity to respond to evolving needs. As key World Bank\nshareholders, India and the United States are critical to guiding the institution through this\n\n\fevolution. This effort serves as an important part of our overall strategy to mobilize against our\nglobal challenges.\n\nD. Embracing and Shaping our Changing Economy\nLastly, we need to embrace and shape our changing global economy. This is particularly true in\nthe digital space.\nThe digital revolution has changed the face of communication and commerce in our countries\nover the past three decades. Today, the digital economy provides massive opportunity and\ncontinues to drive economic growth. This is particularly true in India, which has over 560 million\nInternet subscribers and 1.2 billion mobile phone subscribers. Rapid digital adoption has\nenabled India to achieve stunning success on its financial inclusion efforts. Nearly 500 million\nnew bank accounts have been opened in India over the past eight years.\nBut the digital opportunities available to many Indians and Americans today are not readily\navailable for much of the world. Around 3 billion citizens – more than a third of the world’s\npopulation – have never used the Internet. By extension, they are being entirely left out of the\nmodern economy. Over the next five years, the G7 aims to mobilize $600 billion through the\nPartnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment. It has identified digital infrastructure as a\nkey priority alongside climate, health, and gender. The United States is ready to work with India\nand other partners to close the global digital gap. As we do so, it is equally important to combat\nthreats to privacy and cybersecurity and attend to emerging problems like illicit finance.\nIt is also clear that economic integration in the 21st century requires a modern international\npayments system. Cross-border payments should be cheaper than they are today. They should\nalso be faster, more transparent, and easier to access. The G20 has set out a roadmap for\nenhancing cross-border payments. We look forward to working with India to deliver on tangible\noutcomes. This includes reducing frictions to the flow of data. We also look forward to the G20\nadvancing financial inclusion efforts for the unbanked around the world.\n\nCONCLUSION\nIn sum, we live in difficult and complicated times. We face urgent problems that require\nconcerted and collective action. The work of our two countries has never been more vital. I\nbelieve that no significant global issue can be solved without the cooperation of our two\ncountries. Our partnership can shape the lives of millions around the world.\n\n\fThe U.S. and India are “natural allies,” in the words of a former Indian prime minister. We may be\nlocated across the world from each other, but what unites us is far greater than any of our\ndifferences. Our fights for independence were born of the same desire for freedom and dignity.\nAnd today, our democracies, while works in progress, are necessary bulwarks at a time of\nvolatility and war.\nI believe that this moment is an inflection point not only for the global economy but for the\ndemocratic idea itself. People around the world are looking to us and asking: can democracies\nmeet the economic needs of their citizens? Can they stand up to bullies and cooperate on the\nmost intractable global problems? Or are democracies too messy and complex – and turn\ninward when the going gets tough?\nWe have an opportunity to answer the skeptics. Democracy exhibits its greatest promise during\nturbulent times, when it serves not only as a system of governance but also as a reason for hope\nof collective progress. Our actions over the next year and beyond can demonstrate the capacity\nof our democracies to deliver for our people. I am confident that we will succeed.\nThank you.\n###\n\n\f"

It’s home to the Wright Brothers, who\ninvented the first airplane. And Charles Kettering, the Dayton resident who created the world’s first automobile electric\nignition. Even Thomas Edison was born just an hour from here.\nDuring my two years as Treasury Secretary, I have been laser focused on two economic priorities. First: rescuing the\neconomy from the depths of the pandemic and stabilizing it amid additional global economic shocks. And second:\nstrengthening the foundations of our post-pandemic economy. Our economic plan – powered by three major laws\nenacted over the past year – constitutes among the most significant investments that we’ve ever made in the long-term\nstrength of our economy.\nToday, I will focus my remarks on President Biden’s economic plan, and how it will create resilient growth and an\neconomy that works for all Americans. I’ll talk specifically about the core role of American manufacturing in our agenda.\nOver the past two years, our Administration has made significant investments in our country’s industrial strength. These\ninvestments will create good-paying jobs, make our economy more productive and resilient, and ensure that economic\nopportunity is shared broadly beyond our country’s coasts.\nBut first, let me speak about the state of the economy when we took office and the progress that we’ve made.\nAt the time of the President’s inauguration in January 2021, the United States was in the depths of the pandemic. The\nvirus was claiming more American lives a week than it had at any other point since the onset of the crisis. The economic\ncalamity was also massive. Over 800,000 new jobless claims were being filed in an average week. Given the severity of\nthe economic downturn, our Administration took action: to support households, businesses, and state and local\ngovernments through a once-in-a-century public health emergency.\nTwo years later, we have experienced one of the quickest economic recoveries in modern history. Since President Biden\ntook office, we have created over 10 million jobs. Manufacturing jobs are growing at their fastest pace since the 1980s.\nNearly 700,000 manufacturing jobs have been added since early last year. And we’ve seen significant investments in\nAmerican manufacturing, including right here in Ohio.\n\n\fWhile these are promising signs, we still face challenges. Today, our economy faces high inflation and significant global\nheadwinds. Americans are rightly concerned that rising prices are eroding their living standards, so our Administration’s\ntop economic priority is to bring inflation down. But even in the face of these challenges, our economy remains resilient,\nbolstered by President Biden’s economic plan. That resilience is evidenced by today’s GDP report, which shows solid real\nGDP growth in our economy in the third quarter. We are seeing ample signs of America’s economic strength, despite\nglobal challenges like the impact of Putin’s illegal war and successive waves of COVID. Our unemployment rate is at its\nlowest point in over 50 years. Household balance sheets remain strong. These signals are consistent with an economy\nthat is shifting from a historically fast recovery to stable and sustained growth.\nAs our Administration continues to tackle our immediate challenges, we have also been focused on strengthening the\nlong-term foundations of the American economy. I will now turn to the three pillars of our economic plan: expanding our\nproductive capacity, bolstering our economic resilience, and creating an economy that works for all.\n\nEXPANDING THE PRODUCTIVE CAPACITY OF OUR ECONOMY\nEarlier this year, I delivered a speech calling for a “modern supply-side” expansion of our economy. With a labor market\nat full employment, I argued that the current moment was well-suited for a supply-side agenda that increases our\neconomy’s productive capacity. A country’s long-term growth potential depends on, among other things, how many\npeople we have working and the productivity of our workers. Concerted investments in both areas increase the ceiling\nfor what our economy can produce.\nLess than a year later, I’m proud to report that we’ve enacted key parts of our “modern supply-side” agenda. There are\nthree major laws powering our growth strategy. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law is modernizing our nation’s physical\nand digital infrastructure. I’ll speak more to that in a moment. The CHIPS Act is growing semiconductor manufacturing\nhere at home. And the Inflation Reduction Act is our nation’s largest-ever investment in clean energy – and will bolster\nAmerica’s leadership in the industries of the future for years to come.\nEconomic research has long established that investment in basic infrastructure increases productivity, attracts business\nactivity, and is associated with higher rates of economic growth. Put simply, good infrastructure makes it easier to make\nthings in America and ship our products to the world. Better freight rail allows goods to move from Point A to Point B\nwith fewer disruptions. Modern roads, bridges, and public transportation help connect workers with training, education,\nand better jobs. Expanding our electric grid and broadband infrastructure help lay the foundations for modern industries\nlike clean energy and digital technology.\nOur economic plan invests in everything I just mentioned. But we also know that it’s not enough just to fund\ninfrastructure. We need to accelerate the pace at which we deploy these projects in order to maximize the economic\nbenefits. This month, our Administration announced an Action Plan to efficiently deliver infrastructure that is “On Time,\nOn Task, and On Budget.”[1] We are advancing our Permitting Action Plan to speed up investments while upholding\nbedrock standards and laws. We are also working with employers, labor unions, and training providers to build a robust\ntalent pipeline of skilled workers in sectors like construction and electrification.\nIn sum, our investments in infrastructure will boost our economic potential. They will help build on the progress we’ve\nmade in American manufacturing. They will also help our economy cope with unexpected shocks – like pandemics or\nclimate disasters.\n\nSTRENGTHENING ECONOMIC RESILIENCE\n\n\fThis brings me to the next pillar of our economic plan: strengthening our economic resilience.\nOver the past few years, we’ve witnessed immense disruptions in our lives. The confluence of the pandemic’s economic\neffects, climate disasters, and Putin’s illegal war in Ukraine have driven food and energy price volatility and created\nshortages in some of our most critical goods. Our Administration is building resilience to such future shocks by\nstrengthening our supply chains and growing critical manufacturing industries in America.\nSemiconductors have been a major area of focus. These microchips power so much of modern life: from phones to cars\nto washing machines. They also power technologies that are crucial to our national defense.\nThe United States is a leader in certain parts of the semiconductor ecosystem – like chip design. But we’ve lost our\nleadership in semiconductor manufacturing. Three decades ago, the United States made 37 percent of semiconductors\nsold globally. Today, we produce only 12 percent. When it comes to the most advanced chips, we have no meaningful\nmanufacturing capacity at all.\nSemiconductors are so critical that China, Japan, South Korea, and the European Union have – or are about to – invest in\ngrowing their domestic manufacturing capacity.[2] The economic stakes are high. The pandemic chip shortage resulted in\na loss of about $240 billion in U.S. GDP last year.[3] Here in Ohio, the shortage caused automakers like Ford to temporarily\nshut down their assembly plants.[4]\nOur economic plan is nurturing the growth of the full semiconductor ecosystem in the United States: from R&D to design\nto fabrication. Tens of billions of dollars will go toward growing domestic semiconductor manufacturing in America. We\nbelieve that this will reduce economic and national security risks. It will provide greater certainty to both businesses and\nconsumers. And it will also build our leadership in areas like R&D; close collaboration between “lab” and “fab” is\nnecessary to directing R&D efforts based on what works on the factory floor.\nThere’s already been progress. Major manufacturers are expanding their U.S. footprint. Just last month, Intel broke\nground on its $20 billion semiconductor plant outside of Columbus.[5] Intel’s project is said to be the single largest private\ninvestment in Ohio’s history. When completed, it will employ thousands of Ohioans and support tens of thousands of\nadditional long-term jobs throughout the ecosystem. We are already seeing reverberating effects of this investment on\nlocal communities. For example, Intel is investing $50 million in Ohio colleges and universities to help train the next\ngeneration of chipmakers.[6]\n\nBUILDING AN ECONOMY THAT WORKS FOR ALL\nOur semiconductor investments demonstrate that government and business can work together to nurture and grow new\nindustries. It also demonstrates that we can work together to broaden economic opportunity and create good-paying\njobs. In fact, a deliberate feature of our “modern supply-side” agenda is the allocation of investments across people and\nplaces – particularly those that are historically underserved.\nFor too long, regions like the Midwest have suffered through decades of underinvestment. Wages for too many working\nfamilies have stagnated. At the same time, providing for basic needs and investing in their kids’ futures have become\nincreasingly expensive. The costs of childcare, healthcare, buying a home, and higher education have risen faster than\nmedian household income over the past three decades.\nThe traditional approach to supply-side economics focuses on generating economic growth through deregulation and\ntax cuts that disproportionately benefit the wealthiest Americans and large corporations. Economic evidence indicates\nthat this strategy has failed to achieve its promised gains. In many cases, it has also exacerbated income and wealth\ninequality.\n\n\fIn contrast, our “modern supply-side” agenda recognizes that investing in underserved communities is not just good for\nthe community itself. It’s good for the whole economy. Given the economic premise of diminishing returns, we believe\nthat investments in underserved communities have higher relative returns on investment. They also help unlock the\npotential of all Americans. That expands our economic capacity.\nA prime example is investing in small manufacturers, including those in underserved communities. Treasury recently\napproved Ohio to receive up to $182 million in small business funding through the State Small Business Credit Initiative.\nThis American Rescue Plan program is expected to mobilize up to ten times the amount of public funding – through\nprivate capital – to support small businesses across the country, including small manufacturers. During the prior version\nof this program, Ohio generated over $28 million in support to small manufacturers.\nWe are beginning to see signs of renewal in places and sectors that have traditionally seen disinvestment. American\nmanufacturing employment had dropped precipitously over the past few decades. In Ohio, people employed in\nmanufacturing jobs fell from a million in 2000 – to less than 700,000 twenty years later – even as Ohio’s population grew.\nBut our Administration’s manufacturing incentives have recently led to a wave of private sector commitments that will\npower our economy and create good-paying jobs. Clean energy industries have been shown to create broad opportunity\nacross the country, including in non-coastal areas and communities traditionally reliant on fossil fuel extraction. In fact,\nthe Inflation Reduction Act provides businesses with bonus tax incentives for investing in low-income and energy\ncommunities. This is a place-based investment strategy designed to broaden economic opportunity across all\ncommunities.\nSince January of last year, companies have announced over $100 billion in EV, battery, and charging investments here in\nAmerica.[7] Honda and LG earlier this month announced a battery plant in Fayette County – right outside Columbus.[8]\nThis plant will create thousands of new jobs. The wave of new battery investments in the Midwest has been so significant\nthat some commentators are dubbing the region as the new “Battery Belt.”[9] We expect to see our economic plan\ncontinue to drive a significant amount of capital into good clean energy and manufacturing jobs over the coming months\nand years.\nAs we create an economy that works for all Americans, we also know economic fairness requires all Americans to play by\nthe same rules. Too often, that has not been the case in our tax system.\nWe currently have a two-tiered tax system: one where average families pay their fair share while large corporations and\nhigh-income earners too often do not. Take the “tax gap.” That’s the amount of taxes owed but not paid to the IRS. In\n2019, the top one percent of Americans was estimated to owe over a fifth of unpaid taxes – a total of around $160 billion.\n[10]\n\nMuch of the disparity stemmed from chronic underinvestment in the IRS. This was unacceptable to the President and\nme. So, we secured $80 billion of new funding for the agency.\nThis funding will enable the IRS to increase audits of taxpayers at the high end who have not paid their full bill. As I’ve\nsaid before, I’ve directed that enforcement resources will not be used to raise audit rates for households making under\n$400,000 a year relative to historical levels. In fact, once the IRS has the right technological infrastructure in place, we\nexpect audit rates for honest taxpayers to decline.\nBy closing the tax gap, we will raise hundreds of billions of dollars in additional revenue over this decade. Our corporate\ntax reforms – like the 15 percent minimum tax on the largest corporations – will raise hundreds of billions more as well.\nThe additional revenue will strengthen our public finances. It can be used to fund additional investments in our\neconomic strength, lower the deficit, or reduce taxes for working families.\n\n\fI believe that these tax reforms reflect the values underpinning our entire economic plan: that economic fairness actually\nadds to, rather than subtracts from, our overall economic strength.\n\nCONCLUSION\nWhen we look back decades from now, I believe that we will view the past two years as a uniquely difficult time for our\ncountry and the world. We’ve gone through so much together: a pandemic, a war in Europe, and an acceleration of\nclimate disasters. There’s much more we must do to ease the strain on working families. But I believe that we will also\nview this period as a time when we renewed America’s economic strength. We are positioning America to build, innovate,\nand lead in the 21st century.\nI look forward to building that future together with you. Congratulations again on the opening of your new center.\nThank you.\n\n[1]\n\n[2]\n\n[3]\n\n[4]\n\n[5]\n\n[6]\n\n[7]\n\nhttps://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Action-Plan-for-Accelerating-Infrastructure-October-2022.pdf\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2022/06/17/us/politics/semiconductors-congress-chips.html\n\nhttps://www.commerce.gov/news/press-releases/2022/04/analysis-chips-act-and-bia-briefing\n\nhttps://fordauthority.com/2022/03/ford-ohio-assembly-plant-idled-for-another-week-due-to-chip-shortage/\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/us-policy/2022/09/09/biden-intel-ohio-chip-factory/\n\nhttps://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/newsroom/news/intel-invests-100m-ohio-national-education.html#gs.frqtfo\n\nhttps://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/10/19/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-driving-u-s-battery-manufacturing-and-good-\n\npaying-jobs/\n[8]\n\nhttps://hondanews.com/en-US/releases/honda-and-lg-energy-solution-announce-ohio-as-home-to-joint-venture-ev-battery-\n\nplant#:~:text=Honda%20and%20LG%20Energy%20Solution%20(LGES%3B%20KRX%3A%20373220),jobs%2C%20pending%20final%20government%20approvals.\n[9]\n\nhttps://www.axios.com/2022/08/17/electric-cars-vehicles-batteries-battery-belt-biden\n\n[10]\n\nhttps://home.treasury.gov/news/featured-stories/the-case-for-a-robust-attack-on-the-tax-gap\n\n\f"

Yellen at Today’s\nStakeholder Roundtable on Clean Power Generation\nOctober 26, 2022\n\nAs prepared for delivery\nThank you all for joining me today. This is the second of six roundtables we are hosting on the\nInflation Reduction Act’s climate and clean energy tax incentives.\nI am looking forward to hearing from you about how we can accelerate the build-out of a clean\nenergy economy.\nAs you know, the Inflation Reduction Act is the most significant investment in clean energy in\nour nation’s history. It puts President Biden’s climate goals within reach. At the same time, it\ncreates jobs, saves households money, and strengthens our nation’s energy security.\nTo realize the promise of this law, we are working in tandem with all of you: utilities, project\ndevelopers, manufacturers, organized labor, community organizations, and other critical actors\nwho help supply the clean power our economy and our planet need.\nAs you all know, the Inflation Reduction Act provides the long-term clarity that clean energy\ndevelopers have sought for years. We’d like to hear from you about how our guidance can help\nprovide further certainty so that investments can move forward and our economy can realize\nthe benefits as quickly as possible.\nThe law also includes several new provisions for clean energy tax incentives, including wage and\napprenticeship bonuses, bonuses for investing in low-income communities and energy\ncommunities, bonuses for using domestic content, additional support for the clean energy\nvalue chain, and new ways to monetize credits.\nWe welcome your insights on how to promote an efficient and effective implementation of these\n\n\fand other aspects of the law.\nI appreciate your partnership, and I’m grateful for all the work you’ve already done to accelerate\nthe deployment of clean energy. We look forward to continued engagement with you all in the\nmonths ahead.\nThank you very much.\n###\n\n\f"
