        "content": "For release on delivery\n10:00 a.m. EST\nDecember 3, 2015\n\nStatement by\nJanet L. Yellen\nChair\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nbefore the\nJoint Economic Committee\nU.S. Congress\nDecember 3, 2015\n\n\fChairman Coats, Ranking Member Maloney, and members of the Committee, I\nappreciate the opportunity to testify before you today. In my remarks I will discuss the current\neconomic outlook before turning to monetary policy.\nThe Economic Outlook\nThe U.S. economy has recovered substantially since the Great Recession. The\nunemployment rate, which peaked at 10 percent in October 2009, declined to 5 percent in\nOctober of this year. At that level, the unemployment rate is near the median of Federal Open\nMarket Committee (FOMC) participants’ most recent estimates of its longer-run normal level.\nThe economy has created about 13 million jobs since the low point for employment in early\n2010, and total nonfarm payrolls are now almost 4-1/2 million higher than just prior to the\nrecession. Most recently, after a couple of months of relatively modest payroll growth,\nemployers added an estimated 271,000 jobs in October. This increase brought the average\nmonthly gain since June to about 195,000--close to the monthly pace of around 210,000 in the\nfirst half of the year and still sufficient to be consistent with continued improvement in the labor\nmarket.\nAt the same time that the labor market has improved, U.S. economic output--as measured\nby inflation-adjusted gross domestic product (GDP), or real GDP--has increased at a moderate\npace, on balance, during the expansion. Over the first three quarters of this year, real GDP is\ncurrently estimated to have advanced at an annual rate of 2-1/4 percent, close to its average pace\nover the previous five years. Many economic forecasters expect growth roughly along those\nsame lines in the fourth quarter.\nGrowth this year has been held down by weak net exports, which have subtracted more\nthan 1/2 percentage point, on average, from the annual rate of real GDP growth over the past\n\n\f-2 three quarters. Foreign economic growth has slowed, damping increases in U.S. exports, and the\nU.S. dollar has appreciated substantially since the middle of last year, making our exports more\nexpensive and imported goods cheaper.\nBy contrast, total real private domestic final purchases (PDFP)--which includes\nhousehold spending, business fixed investment, and residential investment, and currently\nrepresents about 85 percent of aggregate spending--has increased at an annual rate of 3 percent\nthis year, significantly faster than real GDP. Household spending growth has been particularly\nsolid in 2015, with purchases of new motor vehicles especially strong. Job growth has bolstered\nhousehold income, and lower energy prices have left consumers with more to spend on other\ngoods and services. Increases in home values and stock market prices in recent years, along with\nreductions in debt, have pushed up the net worth of households, which also supports consumer\nspending. Finally, interest rates for borrowers remain low, due in part to the FOMC’s\naccommodative monetary policy, and these low rates appear to have been especially relevant for\nconsumers considering the purchase of durable goods.\nOther components of PDFP, including residential and business investment, have also\nadvanced this year. Indeed, gains in real residential investment spending have been faster so far\nthis year than last year, although the level of new residential construction still remains fairly low.\nAnd outside of the drilling and mining sector, where lower oil prices have led to substantial cuts\nin outlays for new structures, business investment spending has posted moderate gains.\nTurning to inflation, it continues to run below the FOMC’s longer-run objective of\n2 percent. Overall consumer price inflation--as measured by the change in the price index for\npersonal consumption expenditures--was only 1/4 percent over the 12 months ending in October.\nHowever, this number largely reflects the sharp fall in crude oil prices since the summer of 2014.\n\n\f-3 Because food and energy prices are volatile, it is often helpful to look at inflation excluding\nthose two categories--known as core inflation--which is typically a better indicator of future\noverall inflation than recent readings of headline inflation. But core inflation--which ran at\n1-1/4 percent over the 12 months ending in October--is also well below our 2 percent objective,\npartly reflecting the appreciation of the U.S. dollar, which has pushed down the prices of\nimported goods, placing temporary downward pressure on inflation. Even after taking account\nof this effect, however, inflation has been running somewhat below our objective.\nLet me now turn to where I see the economy is likely headed over the next several years.\nTo summarize, I anticipate continued economic growth at a moderate pace that will be sufficient\nto generate additional increases in employment and a rise in inflation to our 2 percent objective.\nAlthough the economic outlook, as always, is uncertain, I currently see the risks to the outlook\nfor economic activity and the labor market as very close to balanced.\nRegarding U.S. inflation, I anticipate that the drag due to the large declines in prices for\ncrude oil and imports over the past year and a half will diminish next year. With less downward\npressure on inflation from these factors and some upward pressure from a further tightening in\nU.S. labor and product markets, I expect inflation to move up to the FOMC’s 2 percent objective\nover the next few years. Of course, inflation expectations play an important role in the inflation\nprocess, and my forecast of a return to our 2 percent objective over the medium term relies on a\njudgment that longer-term inflation expectations remain reasonably well anchored.\nMonetary Policy\nLet me now turn to the implications of the economic outlook for monetary policy. In the\npolicy statement issued after its October meeting, the FOMC reaffirmed its judgment that it\nwould be appropriate to increase the target range for the federal funds rate when we had seen\n\n\f-4 some further improvement in the labor market and were reasonably confident that inflation\nwould move back to the Committee’s 2 percent objective over the medium term. That initial rate\nincrease would reflect the Committee’s judgment, based on a range of indicators, that the\neconomy would continue to grow at a pace sufficient to generate further labor market\nimprovement and a return of inflation to 2 percent, even following the reduction in policy\naccommodation. As I have already noted, I currently judge that U.S. economic growth is likely\nto be sufficient over the next year or two to result in further improvement in the labor market.\nOngoing gains in the labor market, coupled with my judgment that longer-term inflation\nexpectations remain reasonably well anchored, serve to bolster my confidence in a return of\ninflation to 2 percent as the disinflationary effects of declines in energy and import prices wane.\nCommittee participants recognize that the future course of the economy is uncertain, and\nwe take account of both the upside and downside risks around our projections when judging the\nappropriate stance of monetary policy. In particular, recent monetary policy decisions have\nreflected our recognition that, with the federal funds rate near zero, we can respond more readily\nto upside surprises to inflation, economic growth, and employment than to downside shocks.\nThis asymmetry suggests that it is appropriate to be more cautious in raising our target for the\nfederal funds rate than would be the case if short-term nominal interest rates were appreciably\nabove zero. Reflecting these concerns, we have maintained our current policy stance even as the\nlabor market has improved appreciably.\nHowever, we must also take into account the well-documented lags in the effects of\nmonetary policy. Were the FOMC to delay the start of policy normalization for too long, we\nwould likely end up having to tighten policy relatively abruptly to keep the economy from\nsignificantly overshooting both of our goals. Such an abrupt tightening would risk disrupting\n\n\f-5 financial markets and perhaps even inadvertently push the economy into recession. Moreover,\nholding the federal funds rate at its current level for too long could also encourage excessive\nrisk-taking and thus undermine financial stability.\nOn balance, economic and financial information received since our October meeting has\nbeen consistent with our expectation of continued improvement in the labor market. And, as I\nhave noted, continuing improvement in the labor market helps strengthen our confidence that\ninflation will move back to our 2 percent objective over the medium term. That said, between\ntoday and the next FOMC meeting, we will receive additional data that bear on the economic\noutlook. These data include a range of indicators regarding the labor market, inflation, and\neconomic activity. When my colleagues and I meet, we will assess all of the available data and\ntheir implications for the economic outlook in making our policy decision.\nAs you know, there has been considerable focus on the first increase in the federal funds\nrate after nearly seven years in which that rate was at its effective lower bound. We have tried to\nbe as clear as possible about the considerations that will affect that decision. Of course, even\nafter the initial increase in the federal funds rate, monetary policy will remain accommodative.\nAnd it bears emphasizing that what matters for the economic outlook are expectations\nconcerning the path of the federal funds rate over time: It is those expectations that affect\nfinancial conditions and thereby influence spending and investment decisions. In this regard, the\nCommittee anticipates that even after employment and inflation are near mandate-consistent\nlevels, economic conditions may, for some time, warrant keeping the target federal funds rate\nbelow levels the Committee views as normal in the longer run.\n\n\f-6 Summary\nIn closing, the economy has come a long way toward the FOMC’s objectives of\nmaximum employment and price stability. When the Committee begins to normalize the stance\nof policy, doing so will be a testament, also, to how far our economy has come in recovering\nfrom the effects of the financial crisis and the Great Recession. In that sense, it is a day that I\nexpect we all are looking forward to.\nThank you. I would be pleased to take your questions.\n\n\f"

Yellen\nChair\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\nThe Economic Club of Washington\nWashington, D.C.\n\nDecember 2, 2015\n\n\fThank you to the Economic Club of Washington for inviting me to speak to you\ntoday. I would like to offer my assessment of the U.S. economy, nearly six and half\nyears after the beginning of the current economic expansion, and my view of the\neconomic outlook. I will describe the progress the economy has made toward the Federal\nOpen Market Committee’s (FOMC) goals of maximum employment and stable prices\nand what the current situation and the outlook imply for how monetary policy is likely to\nevolve to best foster the attainment of those objectives.\nThe Economic Outlook\nThe U.S. economy has recovered substantially since the Great Recession. The\nunemployment rate, which peaked at 10 percent in October 2009, declined to 5 percent in\nOctober of this year. At that level, the unemployment rate is near the median of FOMC\nparticipants’ most recent estimates of its longer-run normal level.1 The economy has\ncreated about 13 million jobs since the low point for employment in early 2010, and total\nnonfarm payrolls are now almost 4-1/2 million higher than just prior to the recession.\nMost recently, after a couple months of relatively modest payroll growth, employers\nadded an estimated 271,000 jobs in October. This increase brought the average monthly\ngain since June to about 195,000--close to the monthly pace of around 210,000 in the first\nhalf of the year and still sufficient to be consistent with continued improvement in the\nlabor market.\nDespite these substantial gains, we cannot yet, in my judgment, declare that the\nlabor market has reached full employment. Let me describe the basis for that view.\n\n1\n\nSee table 1 in the Summary of Economic Projections, an addendum to the minutes of the September 2015\nFOMC meeting. See Board of Governors (2015b).\n\n\f-2 To begin with, I believe that a significant number of individuals now classified as\nout of the labor force would find and accept jobs in an even stronger labor market. To be\nclassified as unemployed, working-age people must report that they have actively sought\nwork within the past four weeks. Most of those not seeking work are appropriately not\ncounted as unemployed. These include most retirees, teenagers and young adults in\nschool, and those staying home to care for children and other dependent family members.\nEven in a stronger job market, it is likely that many of these individuals would choose not\nto work.\nBut some who are counted as out of the labor force might be induced to seek work\nif the likelihood of finding a job rose or if the expected pay was higher. Examples here\ninclude people who had become too discouraged to search for work when the prospects\nfor employment were poor and some who retired when their previous jobs ended. In\nOctober, almost 2 million individuals classified as outside the labor force because they\nhad not searched for work in the previous four weeks reported that they wanted and were\navailable for work. This is a considerable number of people, and some of them\nundoubtedly would be drawn back into the workforce as the labor market continued to\nstrengthen. Likewise, some of those who report they don’t want to work now could\nchange their minds in a stronger job market.\nAnother margin of labor market slack not reflected in the unemployment rate\nconsists of individuals who report that they are working part time but would prefer a fulltime job and cannot find one--those classified as “part time for economic reasons.” The\nshare of such workers jumped from 3 percent of total employment prior to the Great\nRecession to around 6-1/2 percent by 2010. Since then, however, the share of these part\n\n\f-3 time workers has fallen considerably and now is less than 4 percent of those employed.\nWhile this decline represents considerable progress, particularly given secular trends that\nover time may have increased the prevalence of part-time employment, I think some\nroom remains for the hours of these workers to increase as the labor market improves\nfurther.\nThe pace of increases in labor compensation provides another possible indicator,\nalbeit an imperfect one, of the degree of labor market slack. Until recently labor\ncompensation had grown only modestly, at average annual rates of around 2 to 2-1/2\npercent. More recently, however, we have seen a welcome pickup in the growth rate of\naverage hourly earnings for all employees and of compensation per hour in the business\nsector. While it is too soon to conclude whether these more rapid rates of increase will\ncontinue, a sustained pickup would likely signal a diminution of labor market slack.\nTurning to overall economic activity, U.S. economic output--as measured by\ninflation-adjusted gross domestic product (GDP), or real GDP--has increased at a\nmoderate pace, on balance, during the expansion. Over the first three quarters of this\nyear, real GDP is currently estimated to have advanced at an annual rate of 2-1/4 percent,\nclose to its average pace over the previous five years. Many economic forecasters expect\ngrowth roughly along those same lines in the fourth quarter.\nGrowth this year has been held down by weak net exports, which have subtracted\nmore than 1/2 percentage point, on average, from the annual rate of real GDP growth\nover the past three quarters. Foreign economic growth has slowed, damping increases in\nU.S. exports, and the U.S. dollar has appreciated substantially since the middle of last\nyear, making our exports more expensive and imported goods cheaper.\n\n\f-4 By contrast, total real private domestic final purchases (PDFP)--which includes\nhousehold spending, business fixed investment, and residential investment, and currently\nrepresents about 85 percent of aggregate spending--has increased at an annual rate of\n3 percent this year, significantly faster than real GDP. Household spending growth has\nbeen particularly solid in 2015, with purchases of new motor vehicles especially strong.\nJob growth has bolstered household income, and lower energy prices have left consumers\nwith more to spend on other goods and services. These same factors likely have\ncontributed to consumer confidence that is more upbeat this year than last year. Increases\nin home values and stock market prices in recent years, along with reductions in debt,\nhave pushed up the net worth of households, which also supports consumer spending.\nFinally, interest rates for borrowers remain low, due in part to the FOMC’s\naccommodative monetary policy, and these low rates appear to have been especially\nrelevant for consumers considering the purchase of durable goods.2\nOther components of PDFP, including residential and business investment, have\nalso advanced this year. The same factors supporting consumer spending have supported\nfurther gains in the housing sector. Indeed, gains in real residential investment spending\nhave been faster so far in 2015 than last year, although the level of new residential\nconstruction still remains fairly low. And outside of the drilling and mining sector, where\nlower oil prices have led to substantial cuts in outlays for new structures, business\ninvestment spending has posted moderate gains.\nOn balance, the moderate average pace of real GDP growth so far this year and\nover the entire expansion has been sufficient to help move the labor market closer to the\n\n2\n\nFor a recent empirical assessment, see Johnson, Pence, and Vine (2014).\n\n\f-5 FOMC’s goal of maximum employment. However, less progress has been made on the\nsecond leg of our dual mandate--price stability--as inflation continues to run below the\nFOMC’s longer-run objective of 2 percent. Overall consumer price inflation--as\nmeasured by the change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures--was\nonly 1/4 percent over the 12 months ending in October. However, this number largely\nreflects the sharp fall in crude oil prices since the summer of 2014 that, in turn, has\npushed down retail prices for gasoline and other consumer energy products. Because\nfood and energy prices are volatile, it is often helpful to look at inflation excluding those\ntwo categories--known as core inflation--which is typically a better indicator of future\noverall inflation than recent readings of headline inflation. But core inflation--which ran\nat 1-1/4 percent over the 12 months ending in October--is also well below our 2 percent\nobjective, partly reflecting the appreciation of the U.S. dollar. The stronger dollar has\npushed down the prices of imported goods, placing temporary downward pressure on\ncore inflation.3 The plunge in crude oil prices may also have had some small indirect\neffects in holding down the prices of non-energy items in core inflation, as producers\npassed on to their customers some of the reductions in their energy-related costs. Taking\naccount of these effects, which may be holding down core inflation by around 1/4 to\n1/2 percentage point, it appears that the underlying rate of inflation in the United States\nhas been running in the vicinity of 1-1/2 to 1-3/4 percent.\nLet me now turn to where I see the economy is likely headed over the next several\nyears. To summarize, I anticipate continued economic growth at a moderate pace that\nwill be sufficient to generate additional increases in employment, further reductions in\n\n3\n\nFor a more detailed discussion of the recent behavior of inflation, see Yellen (2015).\n\n\f-6 the remaining margins of labor market slack, and a rise in inflation to our 2 percent\nobjective. I expect that the fundamental factors supporting domestic spending that I have\nenumerated today will continue to do so, while the drag from some of the factors that\nhave been weighing on economic growth should begin to lessen next year. Although the\neconomic outlook, as always, is uncertain, I currently see the risks to the outlook for\neconomic activity and the labor market as very close to balanced.\nTurning to the factors that have been holding down growth, as I already noted, the\nhigher foreign exchange value of the dollar, as well as weak growth in some foreign\neconomies, has restrained the demand for U.S. exports over the past year. In addition,\nlower crude oil prices have reduced activity in the domestic oil sector. I anticipate that\nthe drag on U.S. economic growth from these factors will diminish in the next couple of\nyears as the global economy improves and the adjustment to prior declines in oil prices is\ncompleted.\nAlthough developments in foreign economies still pose risks to U.S. economic\ngrowth that we are monitoring, these downside risks from abroad have lessened since late\nsummer. Among emerging market economies, recent data support the view that the\nslowdown in the Chinese economy, which has received considerable attention, will likely\ncontinue to be modest and gradual. China has taken actions to stimulate its economy this\nyear and could do more if necessary. A number of other emerging market economies\nhave eased monetary and fiscal policy this year, and economic activity in these\neconomies has improved of late. Accommodative monetary policy is also supporting\neconomic growth in the advanced economies. A pickup in demand in many advanced\n\n\f-7 economies and a stabilization in commodity prices should, in turn, boost the growth\nprospects of emerging market economies.\nA final positive development for the outlook that I will mention relates to fiscal\npolicy. This year the effect of federal fiscal policy on real GDP growth has been roughly\nneutral, in contrast to earlier years in which the expiration of stimulus programs and\nfiscal policy actions to reduce the federal budget deficit created significant drags on\ngrowth.4 Also, the budget situation for many state and local governments has improved\nas the economic expansion has increased the revenues of these governments, allowing\nthem to increase their hiring and spending after a number of years of cuts in the wake of\nthe Great Recession. Looking ahead, I anticipate that total real government purchases of\ngoods and services should have a modest positive effect on economic growth over the\nnext few years.5\nRegarding U.S. inflation, I anticipate that the drag from the large declines in\nprices for crude oil and imports over the past year and a half will diminish next year.\nWith less downward pressure on inflation from these factors and some upward pressure\nfrom a further tightening in U.S. labor and product markets, I expect inflation to move up\nto the FOMC’s 2 percent objective over the next few years. Of course, inflation\nexpectations play an important role in the inflation process, and my forecast of a return to\nour 2 percent objective over the medium term relies on a judgment that longer-term\ninflation expectations remain reasonably well anchored. In this regard, recent measures\n\n4\n\nThe Congressional Budget Office estimates that current federal fiscal policies will have little effect on\neconomic growth this year, but that earlier fiscal policy actions reduced the rate of real GDP growth\nroughly 1-1/2 percentage points in 2013 and about 1/4 percentage point in 2014 relative to what it would\nhave been otherwise. See Congressional Budget Office (2015a).\n5\nSee Congressional Budget Office (2015b).\n\n\f-8 from the Survey of Professional Forecasters, the Blue Chip Economic Indicators, and the\nSurvey of Primary Dealers have continued to be generally stable. The measure of longerterm inflation expectations from the University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers, in\ncontrast, has lately edged below its typical range in recent years. However, this measure\noften seems to respond modestly, though temporarily, to large changes in actual inflation,\nand the very low readings on headline inflation over the past year may help explain some\nof the recent decline in the Michigan measure.6 Market-based measures of inflation\ncompensation have moved up some in recent weeks after declining to historically low\nlevels earlier in the fall. While the low level of these measures appears to reflect, at least\nin part, changes in risk and liquidity premiums, we will continue to monitor this\ndevelopment closely. Convincing evidence that longer-term inflation expectations have\nmoved lower would be a concern because declines in consumer and business expectations\nabout inflation could put downward pressure on actual inflation, making the attainment of\nour 2 percent inflation goal more difficult.\nMonetary Policy\nLet me now turn to the implications of the economic outlook for monetary policy.\nReflecting progress toward the Committee’s objectives, many FOMC participants\nindicated in September that they anticipated, in light of their economic forecasts at the\ntime, that it would be appropriate to raise the target range for the federal funds rate by the\nend of this year. Some participants projected that it would be appropriate to wait until\nlater to raise the target funds rate range, but all agreed that the timing of a rate increase\n\n6\n\nFor example, the University of Michigan survey measure of longer-term inflation expectations was\ntemporarily elevated relative to its usual range in 2008 when crude oil and other commodity prices spiked\nand pushed up actual headline inflation for a time.\n\n\f-9 would depend on what the incoming data tell us about the economic outlook and the\nassociated risks to that outlook.\nIn the policy statement issued after its October meeting, the FOMC reaffirmed its\njudgment that it would be appropriate to increase the target range for the federal funds\nrate when we had seen some further improvement in the labor market and were\nreasonably confident that inflation would move back to the Committee’s 2 percent\nobjective over the medium term. That initial rate increase would reflect the Committee’s\njudgment, based on a range of indicators, that the economy would continue to grow at a\npace sufficient to generate further labor market improvement and a return of inflation to\n2 percent, even after the reduction in policy accommodation. As I have already noted, I\ncurrently judge that U.S. economic growth is likely to be sufficient over the next year or\ntwo to result in further improvement in the labor market. Ongoing gains in the labor\nmarket, coupled with my judgment that longer-term inflation expectations remain\nreasonably well anchored, serve to bolster my confidence in a return of inflation to\n2 percent as the disinflationary effects of declines in energy and import prices wane.\nCommittee participants recognize that the future course of the economy is\nuncertain, and we take account of both the upside and downside risks around our\nprojections when judging the appropriate stance of monetary policy. In particular, recent\nmonetary policy decisions have reflected our recognition that, with the federal funds rate\nnear zero, we can respond more readily to upside surprises to inflation, economic growth,\nand employment than to downside shocks. This asymmetry suggests that it is appropriate\nto be more cautious in raising our target for the federal funds rate than would be the case\n\n\f- 10 if short-term nominal interest rates were appreciably above zero.7 Reflecting these\nconcerns, we have maintained our current policy stance even as the labor market has\nimproved appreciably.\nHowever, we must also take into account the well-documented lags in the effects\nof monetary policy.8 Were the FOMC to delay the start of policy normalization for too\nlong, we would likely end up having to tighten policy relatively abruptly to keep the\neconomy from significantly overshooting both of our goals. Such an abrupt tightening\nwould risk disrupting financial markets and perhaps even inadvertently push the economy\ninto recession. Moreover, holding the federal funds rate at its current level for too long\ncould also encourage excessive risk-taking and thus undermine financial stability.\nOn balance, economic and financial information received since our October\nmeeting has been consistent with our expectations of continued improvement in the labor\nmarket. And, as I have noted, continuing improvement in the labor market helps\nstrengthen confidence that inflation will move back to our 2 percent objective over the\nmedium term. That said, between today and the next FOMC meeting, we will receive\nadditional data that bear on the economic outlook. These data include a range of\nindicators regarding the labor market, inflation, and economic activity. When my\ncolleagues and I meet, we will assess all of the available data and their implications for\nthe economic outlook in making our policy decision.\n\n7\n\nSee, for example, Adam and Billi (2007), Nakata (2012), and Evans and others (2015).\nMilton Friedman famously concluded that “monetary actions affect economic conditions only after a lag\nthat is both long and variable” (1961, p. 447). Evidence that monetary policy affects inflation with a lag\ncomes in part from vector autoregressions in which monetary policy shocks have been identified under a\nvariety of identification assumptions. See, for example, Christiano, Eichenbaum and Evans (2005) and\nUhlig (2005).\n\n8\n\n\f- 11 As you know, there has been considerable focus on the first increase in the federal\nfunds rate after nearly seven years in which that rate has been at its effective lower\nbound. We have tried to be as clear as possible about the considerations that will affect\nthat decision. Of course, even after the initial increase in the federal funds rate, monetary\npolicy will remain accommodative. And it bears emphasizing that what matters for the\neconomic outlook are the public’s expectations concerning the path of the federal funds\nrate over time: It is those expectations that affect financial conditions and thereby\ninfluence spending and investment decisions. In this regard, the Committee anticipates\nthat even after employment and inflation are near mandate-consistent levels, economic\nconditions may, for some time, warrant keeping the target federal funds rate below levels\nthe Committee views as normal in the longer run.\nThis expectation is consistent with an implicit assessment that the neutral nominal\nfederal funds rate--defined as the value of the federal funds rate that would be neither\nexpansionary nor contractionary if the economy were operating near its potential--is\ncurrently low by historical standards and is likely to rise only gradually over time. One\nindication that the neutral funds rate is unusually low is that U.S. economic growth has\nbeen quite modest in recent years despite the very low level of the federal funds rate and\nthe Federal Reserve’s very large holdings of longer-term securities. Had the neutral rate\nbeen running closer to the levels that are thought to have prevailed prior to the financial\ncrisis, current monetary policy settings would have been expected to foster a very rapid\neconomic expansion, with inflation likely rising significantly above our 2 percent\nobjective.\n\n\f- 12 Empirical support for the judgment that the neutral federal funds rate is low\ncomes from both academic research and Federal Reserve staff analysis. Figure 1\nemploys four macroeconomic models used by Federal Reserve staff to estimate the\n“natural” real rate of interest, a concept closely related to the neutral rate.9 The measures\nof the natural rate shown in this figure represent the real short-term interest rate that\nwould prevail in the absence of frictions that slow the adjustment of wages and prices to\nchanges in the economy; under a variety of assumptions, this interest rate has been shown\nto promote full employment.10 The shaded blue band represents the range of the\nestimates of the natural real rate at each point in time. This analysis suggests that the\nnatural real rate fell sharply with the onset of the crisis and has recovered only partially.\nThese findings are broadly consistent with those reported in a paper by Thomas Laubach\nand John Williams, shown in figure 2.11\n\n9\n\nNote that these estimates are in real terms; to obtain estimates of the nominal natural interest rate, one\nwould add a measure of expected inflation. The four models used are (1) a dynamic stochastic general\nequilibrium (DSGE) model developed by the staff of the Federal Reserve Board and described in Kiley\n(2013); (2) a DSGE model developed by the staff of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and described\nin Del Negro and others (2013); (3) a DSGE model developed by the staff of the Federal Reserve Board\nbased on Christiano, Motto, and Rostagno (2014); and (4) a DSGE model developed by the staff of the\nFederal Reserve Board based on Guerrieri and Iacoviello (2013 [rev. 2014]).\n10\nThe concept of the natural rate goes back to Wicksell, who defined it as the rate that “tends neither to\nraise nor to lower” (1936 [1898], p. 102) commodity prices. Wicksell posited that the natural rate would be\nequal to the real interest rate that would balance supply and demand absent monetary frictions. The recent\nacademic literature draws on this notion to define the natural rate as the real interest rate that would prevail\nin the absence of sluggish adjustment in nominal prices and wages. In simple models, this interest rate\nwould result in stable prices and full employment; in some more complex models, this interest rate has\nbeen found to promote stable inflation and appropriate economic activity, although monetary policymakers\nface important tradeoffs in such settings. Importantly, the natural rate varies over time. For example, it\ngenerally rises with expected productivity growth and with “preference shocks” that capture households’\ndesire to consume today rather than save. For further discussion of the potential usefulness of the natural\nrate for monetary policy, see, for example, Barsky, Justiniano, and Melosi (2014) and Cúrdia and others\n(2015). By contrast, Laubach and Williams (2015) employ a statistical approach that defines the natural\nrate as one consistent with the economy operating at its full potential once transitory shocks to aggregate\nsupply and demand have abated. These two approaches to the measurement of the natural real rate are\ndifferent but have important similarities. Qualitatively, the two measures would be expected to move\ntogether in response to shocks to productivity growth and preferences so long as those shocks were very\npersistent.\n11\nSee Laubach and Williams (2015).\n\n\f- 13 The marked decline in the neutral federal funds rate after the crisis may be\npartially attributable to a range of persistent economic headwinds that have weighed on\naggregate demand. These headwinds have included tighter underwriting standards and\nlimited access to credit for some borrowers, deleveraging by many households to reduce\ndebt burdens, contractionary fiscal policy at all levels of government, weak growth\nabroad coupled with a significant appreciation of the dollar, slower productivity and labor\nforce growth, and elevated uncertainty about the economic outlook.12 As the restraint\nfrom these headwinds further abates, I anticipate that the neutral federal funds rate will\ngradually move higher over time. Indeed, in September, most FOMC participants\nprojected that, in the long run, the nominal federal funds rate would be near 3.5 percent,\nand that the actual federal funds rate would rise to that level fairly slowly.13\nBecause the value of the neutral federal funds rate is not directly measureable and\nmust be estimated based on our imperfect understanding of the economy and the\navailable data, I would stress that considerable uncertainty attends our estimates of its\ncurrent level and even more to its likely path going forward.14 That said, we will learn\n\n12\n\nFor analyses of how a sudden tightening in access to credit can lead to household deleveraging, pushing\ndown the neutral rate of interest, see Eggertsson and Krugman (2012) and Guerrieri and Lorenzoni (2015).\n13\nSee figure 2 in the Summary of Economic Projections, an addendum to the minutes of the September\n2015 FOMC meeting. See Board of Governors (2015b). The longer-run normal level of the federal funds\nrate reported in the SEP presumably matches participants’ assessment of the neutral nominal federal funds\nrate that will prevail in the longer run. Between June 2012 and September 2015 the median of FOMC\nparticipants’ estimates of the longer-run level of the federal funds rate declined 75 basis points, to 3.5\npercent. When revising down their estimates of the longer-run federal funds rate, participants have\ngenerally cited a lower assessment of the economy’s longer-run potential growth rate as a contributing\nfactor.\n14\nOne source of uncertainty regarding the neutral federal funds rate is so-called model uncertainty. As\nshown in figure 1, a variety of models that provide plausible descriptions of the economy give somewhat\ndifferent estimates of the neutral rate. A second source of uncertainty is the limited sample size of relevant\nmacroeconomic data: Our estimates of the neutral federal funds rate represent inferences about a moving\ntarget. As a result, although the data provide important signals about the neutral rate, our estimates are\nnecessarily imprecise. In Laubach and Williams (2003), for example, the standard error of the estimate of\nthe neutral rate in one baseline model was about 2 percentage points on average. Moreover, one-sided\n\n\f- 14 more from observing economic developments in the period ahead. It is thereby important\nto emphasize that the actual path of monetary policy will depend on how incoming data\naffect the evolution of the economic outlook. Stronger growth or a more rapid increase in\ninflation than we currently anticipate would suggest that the neutral federal funds rate is\nrising more quickly than expected, making it appropriate to raise the federal funds rate\nmore quickly as well; conversely, if the economy disappoints, the federal funds rate\nwould likely rise more slowly. Given the persistent shortfall in inflation from our\n2 percent objective, the Committee will, of course, carefully monitor actual progress\ntoward our inflation goal as we make decisions over time on the appropriate path for the\nfederal funds rate.\nIn closing, let me again thank the Economic Club of Washington for this\nopportunity to speak about the economy and monetary policy. The economy has come a\nlong way toward the FOMC’s objectives of maximum employment and price stability.\nWhen the Committee begins to normalize the stance of policy, doing so will be a\ntestament, also, to how far our economy has come in recovering from the effects of the\nfinancial crisis and the Great Recession. In that sense, it is a day that I expect we all are\nlooking forward to.\n\nestimates of the neutral rate--those available to policymakers, based only on data known at the time--are\ngenerally noisier than estimates of the neutral rate at some previous time that incorporate all the data\navailable.\n\n\f- 15 References\nAdam, Klaus, and Roberto M.

Yellen\nChair\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\n“Monetary Policy Implementation and Transmission in the Post-Crisis Period,”\na research conference sponsored by\nthe Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nWashington, D.C.\n\nNovember 12, 2015\n\n\fIt is my pleasure to welcome you to the Federal Reserve Board’s conference on\n“Monetary Policy Implementation and Transmission in the Post-Crisis Period.” The\nconference aims to bring together academic and central bank economists, financial\nmarket practitioners, and policymakers to stimulate debate and research on a topic that is\ncritically important to the Federal Reserve’s mission of conducting monetary policy in\nthe pursuit of maximum employment and stable prices.\nThe global financial crisis had profound effects on our economy, and it altered the\nway many think about monetary policy. At the peak of the crisis and during its\nimmediate aftermath, unconventional monetary policy measures were designed and\nimplemented by the Federal Reserve and other central banks around the world. The postcrisis period has offered policymakers an opportunity to assess a range of novel policy\nand operational issues associated with the conduct of monetary policy and the\neffectiveness of different policy options. Specifically, policymakers have to carefully\nweigh the advantages and disadvantages of alternative monetary implementation\nframeworks in the presence of new policy tools. Moreover, policymakers should be\nmindful of new channels for monetary policy transmission that may have emerged from\nthe intricate economic and financial linkages in our global economy that were revealed\nby the crisis. Finally, it is crucial to understand the effect of regulations and possible\nchanges in financial intermediation on monetary policy implementation and transmission.\nThe impressive conference program covers the following topics in three sessions:\nmonetary policy implementation, the transmission of monetary policy, and the effect of\nregulation and financial intermediation on monetary policy implementation and\ntransmission. The presentations and discussions of the 12 academic papers on the\n\n\f-2 conference program will surely provide a foundation for what I expect will be a\nstimulating discussion of important topics over the next two days.\nLooking ahead to later today, I am delighted that Vice Chairman Fischer will\ndeliver keynote remarks on the exchange rate mechanism in the transmission of monetary\npolicy. Tomorrow the conference concludes with two interesting policy panels on the\neffect of regulations on monetary policy and the “optimal design” of monetary policy in\nthe post-crisis world.\nLet me also say that I consider the topics covered during this conference highly\nrelevant for the Federal Reserve System’s ongoing efforts to evaluate potential long-run\nmonetary policy implementation frameworks and to assess a number of issues related to\nthe consideration of alternative frameworks. I hope the work and ideas presented and\ndiscussed over the next two days will spur subsequent research on these issues and\npromote further collaboration among all of you.\nAs I have often stressed before, in addition to its responsibilities for monetary\npolicy and financial regulation and supervision, the Federal Reserve takes very seriously\nits role as a research institution. I want to thank our research conference committee for\nputting together this high-caliber research conference, which has gathered distinguished\nspeakers and guests from around the world and, I am sure, will add to our understanding\nof the implementation and transmission of monetary policy.\nWelcome to the Federal Reserve Board. I hope you all have enjoyable and\nproductive discussions over the next two days.\n\n\f"

        "content": "For release on delivery\n10:00 a.m. EST\nNovember 4, 2015\n\nStatement by\nJanet L. Yellen\nChair\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nbefore the\nCommittee on Financial Services\nU.S. House of Representatives\nNovember 4, 2015\n\n\fChairman Hensarling, Ranking Member Waters, and other members of the committee, I\nappreciate the opportunity to testify on the Federal Reserve’s regulation and supervision of\nfinancial institutions. One of our most fundamental goals is to promote a financial system that is\nstrong, resilient, and able to serve a healthy and growing economy. We work to ensure the safety\nand soundness of the firms we supervise and also to ensure that they comply with applicable\nconsumer protection laws, so that they may, even when faced with stressful financial conditions,\ncontinue serving consumers, businesses, and communities.\nAt today’s hearing, I would like to discuss the lessons of the financial crisis and how we\nhave transformed our regulatory and supervisory approach. Before the crisis, our primary goal\nwas to ensure the safety and soundness of individual financial institutions. A key shortcoming of\nthat approach was that we did not focus sufficiently on shared vulnerabilities across firms or the\nsystemic consequences of the distress or failure of the largest, most complex firms. In the fall of\n2008, the failure or near-failure of several of these firms--many of which we did not supervise at\nthe time--sparked a panic that engulfed the financial system and much of the economy.\nToday we aim to regulate and supervise financial firms in a manner that promotes the\nstability of the financial system as a whole. This shift in focus has led to a comprehensive\nchange in our regulation and supervision of large financial institutions. As I will discuss in more\ndetail, we have introduced a series of requirements for large banking organizations that reduce\nthe risks to the system and our economy that could result from the failure or distress of these\ninstitutions. In addition, we have made changes in our supervision that now allow us to\nsupervise large financial institutions on a more coordinated, forward-looking basis.\nAt the same time, we have been careful to make more-measured changes in our approach\nto regulating and supervising firms at the other end of the spectrum. Smaller institutions did not\n\n\f-2emerge from the financial crisis unscathed, and we have identified several areas in which the\nsupervision of these institutions can be strengthened. At the same time, we are well aware that\nregulatory and compliance costs can impose a burden that is disproportionate to the risks these\ninstitutions pose to taxpayers and financial stability. We are committed to ensuring that the\nsupervision of smaller institutions is tailored appropriately to their risk.\nStrengthening the Regulation and Supervision of the Largest Financial Institutions\nRegulatory Framework\nThe regulatory reforms we have adopted since the crisis have been designed to address\nthe risks posed by large financial institutions in one of two ways. First, our reforms are designed\nto reduce the probability that large financial institutions will fail by requiring those institutions to\nmake themselves more resilient to stress. However, we recognize that we cannot eliminate the\npossibility of a large financial institution’s failure. Therefore, a second aim of our post-crisis\nreforms has been to limit the systemic damage that would result if a large financial institution\ndoes fail. This effort has involved taking steps to help ensure that authorities would have the\nability to resolve a failed firm in an orderly manner while its critical operations continue to\nfunction.\nTo reduce the probability of a large financial institution’s failure, we and the other federal\nbanking agencies have implemented a series of reforms that strengthen the firms we regulate.\nWe have implemented capital rules that require large banking organizations to hold substantially\nlarger amounts of high-quality capital. Working with the other federal banking agencies, we also\nhave adopted a liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) rule that requires large banking organizations to\nhold a buffer of high-quality liquid assets sufficient to meet net liquidity outflows during a\nperiod of severe stress. In addition, the Board has established a broader set of enhanced\n\n\f-3prudential standards for large domestic and foreign banking organizations pursuant to\nsection 165 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank\nAct), which includes risk-based and leverage capital requirements, liquidity standards, riskmanagement requirements, and stress testing. 1\nWe have also adopted risk-based and leverage capital surcharges for the handful of U.S.\nfirms that we have identified as global systemically important banking organizations (GSIBs),\nwhich require these firms to hold larger amounts of loss-absorbing capital than other firms. 2 The\nU.S. GSIBs are central intermediaries in U.S. financial markets, and their failure or distress\nwould thus likely cause the most harm to the financial system. Under the framework that the\nBoard adopted this summer, a GSIB’s risk-based capital surcharge would reflect the effect that\nits failure would have on the financial system. In effect, the risk-based capital surcharge\nconfronts each U.S. GSIB with a choice: It can hold more capital, or it can reduce its systemic\nfootprint. Although similar to the international risk-based capital surcharge framework that we\nhelped design, the rule adopted by the Board is calibrated at a level that requires U.S. GSIBs to\nhold significantly more capital than would be required under the international framework. A\nsecond important difference between the Board’s rule and the international framework is that the\nBoard’s rule incorporates a measure of each GSIB’s use of short-term wholesale funding, which\nis a key determinant of a GSIB’s systemic footprint.\nTo limit the systemic effect of a large financial institution’s failure, the Board and the\nFederal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) have adopted a resolution plan rule that requires\n\n1\n\nThe enhanced prudential standards we have established require foreign banking organizations with large U.S.\noperations to organize their U.S. subsidiaries under an intermediate holding company. This intermediate holding\ncompany requirement provides a basis for regulating and supervising the U.S. operations of foreign banking\norganizations on a more robust and consistent basis.\n2\nThe firms currently identified as U.S. GSIBs are Bank of America Corporation; The Bank of New York Mellon\nCorporation; Citigroup, Inc.; The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.; JPMorgan Chase & Co.; Morgan Stanley; State Street\nCorporation; and Wells Fargo & Company.\n\n\f-4large banking organizations to show how they could be resolved in an orderly manner under the\nbankruptcy code.\nLast week the Board proposed another reform that would establish long-term debt and\ntotal loss-absorbing capacity (TLAC) requirements for U.S. GSIBs. We see these requirements\nas critical to avoiding the choice that authorities faced in the most recent crisis between bailing\nout large financial firms and allowing those firms to fail in a manner that would impose large\ncosts on the broader economy. With the new requirements, if losses were to wipe out a firm’s\ncapital and push a firm into resolution, a sufficient amount of long-term unsecured debt would\nprovide a mechanism for absorbing additional losses and recapitalizing the firm without\ngenerating contagion across the financial system and damaging the economy. In effect, this\nrequirement provides a means for “bailing in” a firm’s long-term debt holders so that a taxpayer\nbailout will be unnecessary. These requirements also should improve market discipline by\nensuring that each GSIB has a class of creditors with clear incentive to monitor the firm’s risktaking.\nSupervisory Approach\nIn addition to strengthening the regulation of the largest, most complex financial\ninstitutions, we have also transformed our supervision of these firms. Our work is now more\nforward looking and multidisciplinary, drawing on a wide range of staff expertise. We put this\nnew approach into operation with the creation of the Large Institution Supervision Coordinating\nCommittee (LISCC). The LISCC is charged with the supervision of the firms that pose elevated\nrisk to U.S. financial stability. Those firms include the eight U.S. banking organizations that\nhave been identified as GSIBs, four foreign banking organizations with large and complex U.S.\noperations, and the four nonbank financial institutions that have been designated as systemically\n\n\f-5important by the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC). 3 The supervisory approach\nembodied in the LISCC differs from our more traditional approach to supervision in that it is\noriented toward both the safety and soundness of the individual firms, and the stability of the\nfinancial system as a whole. 4\nThe LISCC program is distinguished by several characteristics. First, the LISCC, led by\nthe Board’s director of the Division of Banking Supervision and Regulation, has implemented a\nmore centralized, multidisciplinary supervisory approach by bringing together experts from\naround the Federal Reserve System in the areas of supervision, research, legal counsel, financial\nmarkets, and payments systems. Second, the LISCC takes a forward-looking approach by\nfocusing on capital and liquidity resiliency under normal and potentially adverse conditions in\nthe future as well as governance and recovery and resolution preparedness. And, third, the\nLISCC complements traditional, firm-specific supervisory work with annual “horizontal”\nprograms that examine the same firms at the same time and on the same set of issues in order to\npromote better monitoring of trends and consistency of assessments across all of the LISCC\nfirms. The Federal Reserve conducts three major horizontal reviews of the LISCC banking firms\neach year that are focused on capital adequacy, liquidity resiliency, and preparedness for\nrecovery and resolution.\nWith regard to capital adequacy, the Federal Reserve’s Comprehensive Capital Analysis\nand Review (CCAR) is designed to ensure that large U.S. bank holding companies, including the\nLISCC firms, have rigorous, forward-looking capital planning processes and have sufficient\n\n3\n\nThe foreign banking organizations whose U.S. operations are currently supervised as part of the LISCC program\nare Barclays PLC, Credit Suisse Group AG, Deutsche Bank AG, and UBS AG. The firms designated by the FSOC\nfor supervision by the Federal Reserve are American International Group, Inc.; General Electric Capital\nCorporation, Inc.; MetLife, Inc.; and Prudential Financial, Inc.\n4\nFurther information on the LISCC, including a full list of the supervised firms, is available on the Board’s website\nat www.federalreserve.gov/bankinforeg/large-institution-supervision.htm.\n\n\f-6levels of capital to operate through times of stress, as defined by the Federal Reserve’s\nsupervisory stress scenario. The program enables us to make a quantitative and qualitative\nassessment of the resilience and capital planning abilities of the largest banking firms on an\nannual basis and to limit capital distributions for firms that exhibit weaknesses.\nWith regard to liquidity resiliency, under the Federal Reserve’s Comprehensive Liquidity\nAnalysis and Review (CLAR), LISCC firms are subject to a comprehensive review of their\nliquidity positions and liquidity risk management, including internal stress-testing practices.\nFirms with weak liquidity positions or practices are directed to improve those practices and\naugment their liquidity positions as needed. Similar to CCAR, CLAR is designed to ensure that\nLISCC firms have rigorous, forward-looking liquidity stress testing and risk-management\npractices that account for unique risks, and that the LISCC firms maintain sufficient liquidity to\ncontinue to operate through a period of acute stress. The program allows the Federal Reserve to\ncompare the range of practices across firms and form a view on liquidity vulnerabilities and\nfunding concentrations in the system as a whole. Unlike CCAR, which currently applies to all\nfirms with $50 billion or more in total assets, only firms within the LISCC portfolio are required\nto participate in CLAR.\nLISCC firms are also subject to an annual review of their recovery and resolution\npreparedness. The program evaluates progress in implementing operational capabilities and\nlegal entity rationalization that would facilitate recovery or resolution under a range of scenarios\nand provides the Federal Reserve with the ability to compare progress on recovery and resolution\nplanning across firms. We are working with the FDIC to evaluate the GSIBs’ most recent\nresolution plans, which were submitted in July.\n\n\f-7As I noted, the LISCC is also responsible for the supervision of nonbank financial\ncompanies that have been designated by the FSOC. The Federal Reserve currently conducts\nactive, on-site supervision of all four of the designated firms. We are tailoring our supervisory\nframework to the specific business lines, risk profiles, and systemic footprints of these firms.\nOur supervisory efforts to date have focused on strengthening the firms’ risk identification,\nmeasurement, and management; internal controls; and corporate governance. Our objectives for\nthe designated holding companies are to ensure that the consolidated firms operate safely and\nsoundly and to mitigate risks to financial stability. We coordinate our consolidated supervision\nof the three designated insurance companies, as well as the other insurance holding companies\nwe supervise, with state insurance regulators, who continue their established oversight of\ninsurance legal entities within the consolidated firms. We do not regulate the manner in which\ninsurance is provided by these companies or the types of insurance they provide. Those\nimportant aspects of the firms’ activities are the province of state insurance supervisors.\nRegulation and Supervision of Large and Regional Companies\nIn supervising banking organizations with more than $50 billion in assets but outside the\nLISCC program, the Board focuses on ensuring that companies are well managed, appropriately\ncapitalized, and prepared to withstand potential adverse developments in the business\nenvironment. However, because the distress or failure of a non-LISCC firm is unlikely to have\nthe same effect on financial stability as that of a LISCC firm, we do not apply the full range of\nrules that we apply to those in the LISCC portfolio. For example, the Board’s risk-based and\nleverage capital surcharges, as well as the recently proposed long-term debt and TLAC\nrequirements, only apply to GSIBs. Similarly, the advanced approaches capital rules,\ncountercyclical capital buffer, supplementary leverage ratio, and full LCR only apply to\n\n\f-8internationally active banking organizations. 5 We also scale our examination procedures to\nreflect the lower level of systemic risk presented by non-LISCC companies.\nRegulatory and supervisory requirements are further tailored for regional banking\norganizations, defined as those with total assets between $10 billion and $50 billion. For\nexample, while regional banking organizations must comply with recently implemented changes\nthat strengthened the risk-based capital rules, they are not subject to a supervisory stress test or\nCCAR. Rather, as required by the Dodd-Frank Act, regional banking organizations perform\ntheir own stress tests. Similarly, these companies are not subject to enhanced prudential\nstandards established under section 165 of the Dodd-Frank Act, the LCR, or other related\nrequirements. Instead, we conduct regular inspections and evaluate their safety and soundness\nbased on each company’s individual circumstances. Because many regional banking\norganizations concentrate their assets and activities in banking subsidiaries that are supervised by\nother federal banking agencies, we coordinate supervisory activities closely with our regulatory\ncolleagues and rely significantly on the results of their examinations, focusing our own\ninspections on the parent company and its ability to serve as a source of strength to the banks.\nCommunity Bank Supervision\nI know that community banks play a vital role in many of your districts. Let me say that\nthe experiences and challenges of community banking are not new to me. Before I became Chair\nof the Board of Governors and Vice Chair before that, I spent six years as president of the\nFederal Reserve Bank of San Francisco. In that role, I was responsible for the supervision of a\nsubstantial number of community banking organizations in the nine states of the San Francisco\nDistrict. Among the lessons that experience reinforced is that when it comes to bank regulation\n\n5\n\nAn “internationally active banking organization” is defined as a banking organization with more than $250 billion\nin total assets or $10 billion in on-balance-sheet foreign exposure.\n\n\f-9and supervision, one size does not fit all. To effectively promote safety and soundness and\nensure consumer compliance without creating undue regulatory burden, rules and supervisory\napproaches should be tailored to different types of institutions such as community banks.\nThe Federal Reserve supervises more than 830 community banks and more than\n4,000 holding companies that control small depository institutions. These are banking\norganizations with total assets of $10 billion or less. In supervising these institutions, we follow\na risk-focused approach that aims to target examination resources to higher-risk areas of each\nbank’s operations and to ensure that banks maintain risk-management capabilities appropriate to\ntheir size and complexity. In the wake of the crisis, we are taking steps to refine this process by\nusing the financial data we collect from banks to calibrate our examination procedures based on\nrisk. We believe this will help us to be more forward looking in addressing emerging risks and\nto ensure that community bank examiners with specialized expertise and experience are allocated\nto the institutions exhibiting the highest risks. We have also implemented a new risk-focused\nconsumer compliance examination framework that is intended to allow examiners to spend less\ntime on low-risk compliance issues so that issues more likely to result in harm to consumers get\nmore attention. And we continue to improve our examiner commissioning training program to\nensure that it fully reflects the lessons of the recent crisis.\nWith the Congress’s support, we have also taken action to relieve small holding\ncompanies of certain requirements by raising the asset threshold for the Board’s Small Bank\nHolding Company Policy Statement from $500 million to $1 billion, and by applying this\nstatement to small savings and loan holding companies. The Small Bank Holding Company\nPolicy Statement promotes local control of community banking organizations by acknowledging\nthat smaller companies have less access to the capital markets and allowing them to fund\n\n\f- 10 acquisitions with a higher level of debt than would otherwise be allowed. We also relieved small\nholding companies of requirements to comply with consolidated capital requirements,\nrecognizing that their bank subsidiaries make up most of their assets and are already subject to\ncapital rules. In addition, in conjunction with this change, we eliminated quarterly and more\ndetailed consolidated financial reporting requirements for holding companies with less than\n$1 billion in assets, and instead require parent-only financial statements on a semiannual basis. 6\nConsistent with the Economic Growth and Regulatory Paperwork Reduction Act\n(EGRPRA), the Board is also working with the other federal banking agencies to identify\nbanking regulations that are outdated, unnecessary, or unduly burdensome. As part of the\nEGRPRA review, the agencies have held several public outreach meetings with bankers,\nconsumer groups, and other stakeholders. 7 Several themes have emerged during the discussions.\nFor example, community bankers in rural areas have noted that it can be difficult to find an\nappraiser with knowledge about the local housing market at a reasonable fee. Bankers have\nasked the agencies to consider increasing the dollar threshold for requiring appraisals, which\ncould allow them to use a less formal valuation of collateral for a larger number of mortgage\nloans. In addition, bankers have raised concerns about the extent of the financial reporting\nrequirements established by the banking agencies. In response, the banking agencies have\nalready taken steps under the auspices of the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council\nto consider options to eliminate or revise Call Report data items and to develop a streamlined\nreporting form for community banks. 8\n\n6\n\nSee Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2015), “Federal Reserve Board Issues Final Rule to\nExpand Applicability of Small Bank Holding Company Policy Statement and Apply It to Certain Savings and Loan\nHolding Companies,” press release, April 9, www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/bcreg/20150409a.htm.\n7\nAn additional EGRPRA outreach meeting is scheduled to be held in Washington, D.C., on December 2, 2015.\n8\nSee Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (2015), “FFIEC Announces Initiative to Streamline\nReporting Requirements for Community Banks,” press release, September 8, www.ffiec.gov/press/pr090815.htm.\n\n\f- 11 Bankers have also asked whether the agencies could review the statutorily mandated\nsafety-and-soundness examination frequency for banks, which varies based on a bank’s asset\nsize and condition, as a way to ease the burden of frequent on-site examinations. Other bankers\nhave commented on the burden associated with recently implemented changes to the capital\nguidelines and have encouraged the agencies to consider simplifying requirements for\ncommunity banking organizations.\nThe Federal Reserve is giving all of these suggestions careful consideration and will be\nworking closely with the other banking agencies in developing a report to the Congress at the\nconclusion of the EGRPRA review. Given the important role that community banks play in their\ncommunities and the economic support they provide across the country, we recognize that our\nsupervision of community banks must be balanced and avoid unnecessarily constraining their\nactivities.\nCurrent Conditions\nHaving reviewed the major changes we have made to our regulatory and supervisory\nprograms, let me offer a few brief remarks about the current state of the firms we regulate.\nThe financial condition of the firms in the LISCC portfolio has strengthened considerably\nsince the crisis. Common equity capital at the eight U.S. GSIBs alone has more than doubled\nsince 2008, representing an increase of almost $500 billion. Moreover, these firms generally\nhave much more stable funding positions: The amount of high-quality liquid assets held by the\neight U.S. GSIBs has increased by roughly two-thirds since 2012, and their reliance on shortterm wholesale funding has dropped considerably. Our new regulatory and supervisory\napproaches are aimed at helping ensure these firms remain strong. Requiring these firms to plan\n\n\f- 12 for an orderly resolution has forced them to think more carefully about the sustainability of their\nbusiness models and corporate structures.\nNevertheless, while we have seen some evidence of improved risk management, internal\ncontrols, and governance at the LISCC firms, they continue to have substantial compliance and\nrisk-management issues. Compliance breakdowns in recent years have undermined confidence\nin the LISCC firms’ risk management and controls and could have implications for financial\nstability, given the firms’ size, complexity, and interconnectedness. The LISCC firms must\naddress these issues directly and comprehensively.\nOur examinations have found large and regional banks to be well capitalized. Both large\nand regional banking organizations experienced dramatic improvements in profitability since the\nfinancial crisis, although these banks have also faced challenges in recent years due to weak\ngrowth in interest and noninterest income. Both large and regional institutions have seen robust\ngrowth in commercial and industrial lending.\nFinally, community banks are significantly healthier. More than 95 percent are now\nprofitable, and capital lost during the crisis has been largely replenished. Loan growth is picking\nup, and problem loans are now at levels last seen early in the financial crisis.\nConclusion\nWhile more work remains to be done, I hope you will take away from my testimony just\nhow much has changed. Taken as a whole, the reforms we have adopted since the crisis,\nincluding those mandated by the Dodd-Frank Act, represent a substantial strengthening of the\nregulatory framework for the largest financial institutions and should help ensure that the U.S.\nfinancial system remains able to fulfill its vital role of supporting the economy. Our supervisory\n\n\f- 13 approach is more comprehensive and forward looking while also tailored to fit the level of\noversight to the risks and scope of the institution.\nWe know our work is not complete. In the coming year we anticipate moving forward on\nother rulemaking initiatives that will complement the steps we have already taken. The Federal\nReserve is committed to remaining vigilant, diligent, and forward looking as a regulator and\nsupervisor of the financial institutions that serve our economy. We will do everything we can to\nfulfill the responsibility that has been entrusted to us by the Congress and the American public.\nThank you. I would be pleased to respond to your questions.\n\n\f"

        "content": "For release on delivery\n11:00 a.m. EDT\nOctober 20, 2015\n\nRemarks by\n\nJanet L. Yellen\nChair\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat the\nInduction of Carroll D. Wright and Janet L. Norwood\ninto the Department of Labor’s Hall of Honor\n\nU.S. Department of Labor\nWashington, D.C.\n\nOctober 20, 2015\n\n\fWe are here to honor two exceptional public servants and the great institution\nthey helped build. Let’s consider for a moment why the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS)\nhas succeeded and how Carroll Wright and Janet Norwood contributed to that success.\nIn 1884, a time of great strife and mistrust between management and labor, the\nfederal government created an agency with the mission of providing detailed and\nobjective information on American workers. That task fell to Carroll Wright, who had\nwon the confidence of workers and management as chief of the Massachusetts Bureau of\nLabor Statistics in the years after that state became the first to legalize labor unions.\nAt that point, before the United States itself had recognized such rights and before\nthe federal government could agree on labor standards, the public needed an\nunimpeachable assessment of the conditions faced by workers. Under Carroll Wright,\nwhat was then called the Bureau of Labor investigated major labor disputes and issued\nreports that shaped public opinion and were the basis for executive action and legislation.\nHe initiated the collection of data on hours, wages, and prices and was responsible for\nmany important advances that successively improved the reliability of these data. The\nrespect for the thoroughness and objectivity of the research that Wright oversaw led to\nthe dismantling of damaging trade barriers in the 1890s and later raised public awareness\nabout the deplorable conditions faced by women in the workplace.\nIn the U.S. Constitution, there is not a requirement that government statistics be\naccurate and free of political influence or bias. Carroll Wright recognized that this\nsimple, powerful idea could help build public confidence for the government’s effort to\nreduce conflicts between management and workers and move our nation forward. He and\nothers are responsible for a fundamental feature of our democracy that is now often taken\n\n\f-2 for granted--the public’s expectation and insistence that information provided by the\ngovernment can be trusted. To Carroll Wright’s descendants, one of whom is with us\ntoday, thank you, on his behalf, for this valuable contribution.\nThis legacy lives on in the agency Carroll Wright founded, and few of his\nsuccessors did as much to advance this principle as Janet Norwood. One reason for this\nsuccess, I am sure, is that she rose from the ranks, and the values of the BLS were deeply\ningrained in her over the 28 years she served this agency. Those who worked with Janet\nsay she strongly believed the BLS was uniquely positioned to contribute to the economic\npolicy debate as an authoritative, unimpeachable source of information and analysis\nabout the economy.\nIn her 13 years as commissioner, Janet succeeded in winning support for an\nambitious expansion of the BLS. She launched the annual Consumer Expenditure\nSurvey, as well as many other important data series, and elevated the skills and quality of\nstatistical analysis throughout the agency. To supplement the traditional measurement of\nproductivity as output per hour of labor, she oversaw the creation of a new measure of\nmultifactor productivity in the private sector, estimating productivity as the result of both\nlabor and capital inputs. When budget pressures threatened to end important data series\ncollected elsewhere at the Department of Labor, she found the means to continue these\nseries at the BLS.\nAt the same time, Janet faced challenges to the BLS’s tradition of professionalism\nand objectivity. From 1979, when she was appointed by President Carter, to 1991, when\nshe retired, the news on employment, productivity, and inflation was often bad. In this\n\n\f-3 circumstance, the BLS was sometimes accused of overstating economic problems, and it\noccasionally came under pressure to alter the basis for its data.\nJanet Norwood fended off these challenges with a mixture of resolve and\nflexibility, channeling some of the pressure into deliberate and constructive processes that\neventually yielded improvements in the consumer price index and generated alternative\nprice measures. As commissioner and like her predecessors, Janet helped preserve the\nBLS’s deserved reputation for accuracy and integrity by continually improving the\ndesign, procedures, and techniques of data collection.\nAfter government service, Janet had a long and active retirement in which she\ncontinued her contributions to the economic profession and the science of statistics. She\npassed away on March 31 of this year.\nTo members of her family who are with us today, thank you for her extraordinary\nservice to our country. Janet’s legacy continues in the ongoing work of the exceptional\nagency she helped build, on the foundation laid by Carroll Wright, whom she so\nappropriately joins today in this Hall of Honor.\nThe Bureau of Labor Statistics is exceptional, and in that way, I hope it serves as\nan example of how effective, reliable, and trusted government can be.\n\n\f"

It is truly a pleasure for me to join President Bullard and Chairman\nCotney in welcoming you to the Community Banking Research and Policy Conference,\nwhich I am proud to say has been cosponsored since its inception by the Federal Reserve\nSystem and the Conference of State Bank Supervisors (CSBS).\nThis is the third year for this conference, which I consider a milestone. The first\ntime you organize a conference like this, all you can be sure about is that there was\nindeed enough research and interest for such a conference. The second time it is held,\nyou proved that you could do it again.\nBut the third year, this year, is when we can start to feel we have established a\ntradition. If this year’s conference comes even close to being as successful as the first\ntwo were, and I expect it will be, I hope that we have established an ongoing role for this\ngathering, which provides such a great opportunity for bankers, regulators, and academic\nresearchers to come together to share ideas and insights about the issues that matter most\nin community banking.\nBased on the agenda and conference materials I have seen, I expect participants\nover the next two days will tackle some of the most important issues facing community\nbanks, provoke discussion and debate about opportunities and challenges, and generate\nsome promising ideas about how community banks can continue to play the\nindispensable role they have played in so many communities. The lineup of speakers,\nwhich includes my Federal Reserve Board colleague, Governor Brainard, is impressive.\nShe and others will delve deeply into the important research questions and other issues\nfacing community banking.\n\n\f-2My role today is to welcome you on behalf of the Federal Reserve Board. In the\ninterest of getting to the important work of this conference, I will be brief, but if I\naccomplish anything by speaking to you today, I hope it is to convey the Board’s\nunderstanding of the unique and important role of community banks in our financial\nsystem as well as the Board’s commitment, at the highest level, to consider how our\nsupervisory and regulatory decisions affect those institutions.\nMy fellow Board members and I know that community banks provide essential\nfinancial services to households, small businesses, and farms in communities throughout\nthe country. We know that community banks serve many customers that large banks do\nnot and provide services that are not offered by large banks in many communities. This\ncircumstance is especially true in rural areas and other small communities, where\ncommunity banks are sometimes the only retail financial institutions.\nWe understand that community bankers serve members of their local communities\nwho are not just their customers, but also their neighbors and their friends. We know the\nstrong links these banks have to the people and businesses in their communities provide\nfirsthand knowledge of local economic conditions. My colleagues on the Board\nunderstand, as I do, that these close ties give community bankers special insight and\nunderstanding into local needs so that they can tailor their products and services to meet\nthose needs.\nAlthough community banks largely kept to their traditional business model of\nprudent, local lending and avoided the excessive risk-tasking that helped fuel the\nfinancial crisis, that crisis, and the deep recession that followed, devastated many\ncommunities and the banks that serve them. The significant improvement in the\n\n\f-3economy since then has helped communities and community banks, but I am well aware\nthat the challenges for this sector continue, and my Board colleagues understand this also.\nWe know and appreciate these concerns because the Board makes it our business\nto regularly and extensively meet with and talk to community bankers and industry\nleaders. The Board of Governors meets twice a year with the Community Depository\nInstitutions Advisory Council, which includes representatives of community banks,\nthrifts, and credit unions in each of the 12 Federal Reserve Districts. 1 The Board also has\na Subcommittee on Smaller Regional and Community Banking, headed by Governor\nPowell and including Governor Brainard. 2\nLet me also say that the experiences, aspirations, and challenges of community\nbanking are not new to me. Before I became Chair of the Board of Governors and Vice\nChair before that, I spent six years as president of the San Francisco Fed. In this role, I\nwas responsible for the supervision of a substantial number of community banking\norganizations in the nine states of the 12th District.\nAmong the things I learned from that experience is that, when it comes to bank\nregulation and supervision, one size does not fit all. To effectively promote safety and\nsoundness and ensure consumer compliance without creating undue regulatory burden,\nrules and supervisory approaches should be tailored to different types of institutions.\nThat is why the Congress chose to exempt community banks from many aspects of new,\npost-crisis regulations and why financial regulators, including the Fed, have otherwise\n\n1\n\nMore information on the Community Depository Institutions Advisory Council is available on the\nBoard’s website at www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/cdiac.htm.\n2\nBoard member assignments are available on the Board’s website at\nwww.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/bios/board/default.htm.\n\n\f-4recognized the differences between community banks and larger, more complex\ninstitutions.\nThe Federal Reserve is committed to this approach to community bank oversight\nand to ensuring that new and existing regulations are not unduly burdensome for\ncommunity banks. One way we are fulfilling this commitment is through the regulatory\nreview required by the Economic Growth and Regulatory Paperwork Reduction Act\n(EGRPRA). The Federal Reserve and other agencies involved in the EGRPRA process\nhave so far held four in a series of six planned outreach meetings at locations across the\ncountry. We have heard many comments about community bank concerns and are taking\nthose insights into account as we consider options for alleviating unnecessary regulatory\nburden.\nLet me conclude by returning to the occasion of this conference and what I\nbelieve it says about the Federal Reserve’s commitment to supporting the ongoing role of\ncommunity banking in America.\nIn addition to its responsibilities for monetary policy and financial regulation and\nsupervision, the Federal Reserve takes very seriously its role as a research institution.\nWe believe strongly in the idea that high-quality research can add to knowledge and\nunderstanding and help inform economic and financial policymaking to yield better\ndecisions that benefit society. The Fed instituted this conference in partnership with the\nCSBS because we believe that research can help us better understand the benefits that\ncommunity banks provide to society and the challenges they face. The work presented at\nthis conference and subsequent research that may be spurred by this work can deepen\ncommunity bankers’ understanding of their businesses, and it can help state and federal\n\n\f-5regulators make better-informed decisions. Ultimately, research can help provide\nanswers to how community banks can continue to succeed in the 21st century.\nThank you for this opportunity to speak, welcome to St. Louis, and I hope you\nenjoy the discussions of the next two days.\n\n\f"

        "content": "For release on delivery\n5:00 p.m. EDT\nSeptember 24, 2015\n\nInflation Dynamics and Monetary Policy\n\nRemarks by\nJanet L. Yellen\nChair\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\nThe Philip Gamble Memorial Lecture\nUniversity of Massachusetts, Amherst\nAmherst, Massachusetts\n\nSeptember 24, 2015\n\n\fI would like to thank Michael Ash for his kind introduction and the University of\nMassachusetts for the honor of being invited to deliver this year’s Philip Gamble\nMemorial Lecture.\nIn my remarks today, I will discuss inflation and its role in the Federal Reserve’s\nconduct of monetary policy. I will begin by reviewing the history of inflation in the\nUnited States since the 1960s, highlighting two key points: that inflation is now much\nmore stable than it used to be, and that it is currently running at a very low level. I will\nthen consider the costs associated with inflation, and why these costs suggest that the\nFederal Reserve should try to keep inflation close to 2 percent. After briefly reviewing\nour policy actions since the financial crisis, I will discuss the dynamics of inflation and\ntheir implications for the outlook and monetary policy.\nHistorical Review of Inflation\nA crucial responsibility of any central bank is to control inflation, the average rate\nof increase in the prices of a broad group of goods and services. Keeping inflation stable\nat a moderately low level is important because, for reasons I will discuss, inflation that is\nhigh, excessively low, or unstable imposes significant costs on households and\nbusinesses. As a result, inflation control is one half of the dual mandate that Congress\nhas laid down for the Federal Reserve, which is to pursue maximum employment and\nstable prices.\nThe Federal Reserve has not always been successful in fulfilling the price stability\nelement of its mandate. The dashed red line in figure 1 plots the four-quarter percent\nchange in the price index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE)--the measure of\ninflation that the Fed’s policymaking body, the Federal Open Market Committee, or\n\n\f-2FOMC, uses to define its longer-run inflation goal.1 Starting in the mid-1960s, inflation\nbegan to move higher. Large jumps in food and energy prices played a role in this\nupward move, but they were not the whole story, for, as illustrated here, inflation was\nalready moving up before the food and energy shocks hit in the 1970s and the early\n1980s.2 And if we look at core inflation, the solid black line, which excludes food and\nenergy prices, we see that it too starts to move higher in the mid-1960s and rises to very\nelevated levels during the 1970s, which strongly suggests that something more than the\nenergy and food price shocks must have been at work.\nA second important feature of inflation over this period can be seen if we examine\nan estimate of its long-term trend, which is plotted as the dotted black line in figure 1. At\neach point in time, this trend is defined as the prediction from a statistical model of the\nlevel to which inflation is projected to return in the long run once the effects of any\nshocks to the economy have fully played out.3 As can be seen from the figure, this\nestimated trend drifts higher over the 1960s and 1970s, implying that during this period\n\n1\n\nSee the Federal Open Market Committee’s Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy\nStrategy, available on the Board’s website at\nwww.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/FOMC_LongerRunGoals.pdf.\n2\nThe first jump in energy prices in the 1970s reflected a rise in crude oil prices whose proximate cause was\nthe so-called Arab oil embargo that followed the 1973 Arab-Israeli War; the first jump in food prices was\ncaused by disease and poor harvests combined with low levels of inventories (particularly for grains) in\nmany countries. The second energy price shock resulted from a jump in crude oil prices following the\n1978-79 revolution in Iran and subsequent Iraqi invasion; the second food price shock was largely\nattributable to bad weather and disease. (See Blinder and Rudd, 2013, for an assessment of the effect that\nthese and other special factors--including the imposition and removal of price controls over the 1971-74\nperiod--had on consumer price inflation in the 1970s and 1980s.)\n3\nThe predicted long-run trend shown here updates an estimate made by Peneva and Rudd (2015), which\nuses a vector autoregression (VAR) with time-varying parameters and stochastic volatility to compute a\nstochastic trend for inflation (see that paper for additional details regarding model specification and data\ndefinitions). The estimation procedure for the VAR is similar to that used by Clark and Terry (2010),\nwhich in turn follows Cogley and Sargent (2005); see also Cogley and others (2010) and Ascari and\nSbordone (2014) for related applications.\n\n\f-3there was no stable “anchor” to which inflation could be expected to eventually return--a\nconclusion generally supported by other procedures for estimating trend inflation.\nToday many economists believe that these features of inflation in the late 1960s\nand 1970s--its high level and lack of a stable anchor--reflected a combination of factors,\nincluding chronically overheated labor and product markets, the effects of the energy and\nfood price shocks, and the emergence of an “inflationary psychology” whereby a rise in\nactual inflation led people to revise up their expectations for future inflation. Together,\nthese various factors caused inflation--actual and expected--to ratchet higher over time.\nUltimately, however, monetary policy bears responsibility for the broad contour of what\nhappened to actual and expected inflation during this period because the Federal Reserve\nwas insufficiently focused on returning inflation to a predictable, low level following the\nshocks to food and energy prices and other disturbances.\nIn late 1979, the Federal Reserve began significantly tightening monetary policy\nto reduce inflation. In response to this tightening, which precipitated a severe economic\ndownturn in the early 1980s, overall inflation moved persistently lower, averaging less\nthan 4 percent from 1983 to 1990. Inflation came down further following the 1990-91\nrecession and subsequent slow recovery and then averaged about 2 percent for many\nyears. Since the recession ended in 2009, however, the United States has experienced\ninflation running appreciably below the FOMC’s 2 percent objective, in part reflecting\nthe gradual pace of the subsequent economic recovery.\nExamining the behavior of inflation’s estimated long-term trend reveals another\nimportant change in inflation dynamics. With the caveat that these results are based on a\nspecific implementation of a particular statistical model, they imply that since the mid-\n\n\f-41990s there have been no persistent movements in this predicted long-run inflation rate,\nwhich has remained very close to 2 percent. Remarkably, this stability is estimated to\nhave continued during and after the recent severe recession, which saw the\nunemployment rate rise to levels comparable to those seen during the 1981-82 downturn,\nwhen the trend did shift down markedly.4 As I will discuss, the stability of this trend\nappears linked to a change in the behavior of long-run inflation expectations--measures of\nwhich appear to be much better anchored today than in the past, likely reflecting an\nimprovement in the conduct of monetary policy. In any event, this empirical analysis\nimplies that, over the past 20 years, inflation has been much more predictable over the\nlonger term than it was back in the 1970s because the trend rate to which inflation was\npredicted to return no longer moved around appreciably. That said, inflation still varied\nconsiderably from year to year in response to various shocks.\nAs figure 2 highlights, the United States has experienced very low inflation on\naverage since the financial crisis, in part reflecting persistent economic weakness that has\nproven difficult to fully counter with monetary policy. Overall inflation (shown as the\ndashed red line) has averaged only about 1-1/2 percent per year since 2008 and is\ncurrently close to zero. This result is not merely a product of falling energy prices, as\ncore inflation (the solid black line) has also been low on average over this period.\nInflation Costs\nIn 2012 the FOMC adopted, for the first time, an explicit longer-run inflation\nobjective of 2 percent as measured by the PCE price index.5 (Other central banks,\n\n4\n\nTrend inflation estimates from univariate statistical models manifest somewhat less stability in recent\nyears; see Clark and Bednar (2015).\n5\nIn contrast, the FOMC has determined that a number of considerations preclude it from setting a fixed\nnumerical target for the other leg of its dual mandate, maximum employment. As discussed in its\n\n\f-5including the European Central Bank and the Bank of England, also have a 2 percent\ninflation target.) This decision reflected the FOMC’s judgment that inflation that\npersistently deviates--up or down--from a fixed low level can be costly in a number of\nways. Persistent high inflation induces households and firms to spend time and effort\ntrying to minimize their cash holdings and forces businesses to adjust prices more\nfrequently than would otherwise be necessary. More importantly, high inflation also\ntends to raise the after-tax cost of capital, thereby discouraging business investment.\nThese adverse effects occur because capital depreciation allowances and other aspects of\nour tax system are only partially indexed for inflation.6\nPersistently high inflation, if unanticipated, can be especially costly for\nhouseholds that rely on pensions, annuities, and long-term bonds to provide a significant\nportion of their retirement income. Because the income provided by these assets is\ntypically fixed in nominal terms, its real purchasing power may decline surprisingly\nquickly if inflation turns out to be consistently higher than originally anticipated, with\npotentially serious consequences for retirees’ standard of living as they age.7\n\nStatement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy (see note 1), the maximum level of\nemployment is something that is largely determined by nonmonetary factors that affect the structure and\ndynamics of the labor market. Moreover, the maximum level of employment, the longer-run “natural” rate\nof unemployment, and other related aspects of the labor market are not directly observable, can change\nover time, and can only be estimated imprecisely. As a result, views vary about what labor market\nconditions would be consistent with a normal level of resource utilization.\n6\nFor a general survey of the costs of high inflation, see Briault (1995). English (1999) discusses costs\nassociated with an increased need for cash management. For a discussion of costs that arise through\ninteractions of inflation with the tax system, see Feldstein (1997, 1999) and Cohen and others (1999).\nFinally, high inflation may adversely affect the economy’s allocation of resources by increasing the\nmagnitude of misalignments in relative prices that result because firms do not continually adjust all of their\nprices; for a discussion of such costs in the context of the new-Keynesian model of inflation, see Ascari and\nSbordone (2014).\n7\nMore broadly, if inflation evolves in an unpredictable manner over many years, then even financially\nsophisticated households and firms may not be able to avoid significant forecasting errors with their\nattendant costs. Such costs can arise in a wide variety of situations; for instance, any firm, union, or other\nentity that engages in a multiyear nominal contract may be adversely affected by unexpected increases or\ndecreases in inflation, although those on the other side of the contract might benefit.\n\n\f-6An unexpected rise in inflation also tends to reduce the real purchasing power of\nlabor income for a time because nominal wages and salaries are generally slow to adjust\nto movements in the overall level of prices. Survey data suggest that this effect is\nprobably the number one reason why people dislike inflation so much.8 In the longer run,\nhowever, real wages--that is, wages adjusted for inflation--appear to be largely\nindependent of the average rate of inflation and instead are primarily determined by\nproductivity, global competition, and other nonmonetary factors. In support of this view,\nfigure 3 shows that nominal wage growth tends to broadly track price inflation over long\nperiods of time.\nInflation that is persistently very low can also be costly, and it is such costs that\nhave been particularly relevant to monetary policymakers in recent years. The most\nimportant cost is that very low inflation constrains a central bank’s ability to combat\nrecessions. Normally, the FOMC fights economic downturns by reducing the nominal\nfederal funds rate, the rate charged by banks to lend to each other overnight. These\nreductions, current and expected, stimulate spending and hiring by lowering longer-term\nreal interest rates--that is, nominal rates adjusted for inflation--and improving financial\nconditions more broadly. But the federal funds rate and other nominal interest rates\ncannot go much below zero, since holding cash is always an alternative to investing in\nsecurities.9 Thus, the lowest the FOMC can feasibly push the real federal funds rate is\nessentially the negative value of the inflation rate. As a result, the Federal Reserve has\n\n8\n\nFor more on this survey, see Shiller (1997).\nBecause of the inconvenience of storing and protecting very large quantities of currency, some firms are\nwilling to pay a premium to hold short-term government securities or bank deposits instead. As a result,\nseveral foreign central banks have found it possible to push nominal short-term interest rates somewhat\nbelow zero.\n\n9\n\n\f-7less room to ease monetary policy when inflation is very low. This limitation is a\npotentially serious problem because severe downturns such as the Great Recession may\nrequire pushing real interest rates far below zero for an extended period to restore full\nemployment at a satisfactory pace.10 For this reason, pursuing too low an inflation\nobjective or otherwise tolerating persistently very low inflation would be inconsistent\nwith the other leg of the FOMC’s mandate, to promote maximum employment.11\nAn unexpected decline in inflation that is sizable and persistent can also be costly\nbecause it increases the debt burdens of borrowers. Consider homeowners who take out a\nconventional fixed-rate mortgage, with the expectation that inflation will remain close to\n2 percent and their nominal incomes will rise about 4 percent per year. If the economy\nwere instead to experience chronic mild deflation accompanied by flat or declining\nnominal incomes, then after a few years the homeowners might find it noticeably more\ndifficult to cover their monthly mortgage payments than they had originally anticipated.\nMoreover, if house prices fall in line with consumer prices rather than rising as expected,\nthen the equity in their home will be lower than they had anticipated. This situation,\nwhich is sometimes referred to as “debt deflation,” would also confront all households\nwith outstanding student loans, auto loans, or credit card debt, as well as businesses that\n\n10\nFor example, Curdia and others (2014) estimate that stabilizing the economy during the last recession\nwould have required lowering the real federal funds rate to negative 10 percent for a time; by comparison,\nthe average value of the real federal funds has been only negative 1-1/4 percent since early 2009. Of\ncourse, the FOMC was able to use other policy tools, such as large-scale asset purchases, to put additional\ndownward pressure on long-term interest rates after the nominal funds rate was cut to near zero; however,\nthose policies had potential costs and risks that made them an imperfect substitute for traditional interest\nrate policy. See Krugman (1998), Reifschneider and Williams (2000), and Eggertsson and Woodford\n(2003) for discussions of the effects that low inflation and the zero lower bound on nominal interest rates\nhave on a central bank’s ability to stimulate the economy during economic downturns. In addition, see\nEnglish, Lopez-Salido, and Tetlow (2015) and Engen, Laubach, and Reifschneider (2015) for model-based\nanalyses of the effectiveness of the Federal Reserve’s large-scale asset purchases and forward guidance in\nmitigating the effects of the zero lower bound. Finally, for a discussion of the costs and benefits of\nemploying large scale asset purchases, see Bernanke (2012) and Yellen (2013).\n11\nFor a further discussion of this point, see Mishkin (2007).\n\n\f-8had taken out bank loans or issued bonds.12 Of course, in this situation, lenders would be\nreceiving more real income. But the net effect on the economy is likely to be negative, in\nlarge part because borrowers typically have only a limited ability to absorb losses. And if\nthe increased debt-service burdens and declines in collateral values are severe enough to\nforce borrowers into bankruptcy, then the resultant hardship imposed on families, small\nbusiness owners, and laid-off workers may be very severe.13\nMonetary Policy Actions since the Financial Crisis\nAs I noted earlier, after weighing the costs associated with various rates of\ninflation, the FOMC decided that 2 percent inflation is an appropriate operational\ndefinition of its longer-run price objective.14 In the wake of the 2008 financial crisis,\n\n12\n\nSee Fisher (1933) for an early discussion of debt deflation and its effects on the economy.\nVery low inflation also can result in chronically higher unemployment by closing off an important way in\nwhich the labor market can respond to adverse shocks. In sectors where productivity is lagging or demand\nis slowing, declines in real wages might be necessary to avoid even worse outcomes, such as layoffs. For\nvarious reasons, however, employers often try to avoid nominal wage cuts. (Bewley (1999) suggests a\nnumber of reasons that firms find cutting nominal wages difficult, including the effect that such cuts have\non employee morale. Inflation is therefore often said to “grease the wheels of the labor market” because it\npermits these required adjustments in real wages to occur through a combination of unchanged nominal\nwages and rising prices.) But when inflation falls to a very low level, this passive approach to wage\nreductions may no longer be viable for many firms, causing relatively more of the burden of adjustment to\nfall on employment.\n14\nBlanchard, Dell’Ariccia and Mauro (2010), among others, have recently suggested that central banks\nshould consider raising their inflation targets, on the grounds that conditions since the financial crisis have\ndemonstrated that monetary policy is more constrained by the effective lower bound (ELB) on nominal\ninterest rates than was originally estimated. Ball (2013), for example, has proposed 4 percent as a more\nappropriate target for the FOMC. While it is certainly true that earlier analyses of ELB costs significantly\nunderestimated the likelihood of severe recessions and slow recoveries of the sort recently experienced in\nthe United States and elsewhere (see Chung and others, 2012), it is also the case that these analyses did not\ntake into account central banks’ ability to use large-scale asset purchases and other unconventional tools to\nmitigate the costs arising from the ELB constraint. In addition, it is not obvious that a modestly higher\ntarget rate of inflation would have greatly increased the Federal Reserve’s ability to support real activity in\nthe special conditions that prevailed in the wake of the financial crisis, when some of the channels through\nwhich lower interest rates stimulate aggregate spending, such as housing construction, were probably\nattenuated. Beyond these tactical considerations, however, changing the FOMC’s long-run inflation\nobjective would risk calling into question the FOMC’s commitment to stabilizing inflation at any level\nbecause it might lead people to suspect that the target could be changed opportunistically in the future. If\nso, then the key benefits of stable inflation expectations discussed below--an increased ability of monetary\npolicy to fight economic downturns without sacrificing price stability--might be lost. Moreover, if the\npurpose of a higher inflation target is to increase the ability of central banks to deal with the severe\nrecessions that follow financial crises, then a better strategic approach might be to rely on more vigorous\nsupervisory and macroprudential policies to reduce the likelihood of such events. Finally, targeting\n13\n\n\f-9however, achieving both this objective and full employment (the other leg of the Federal\nReserve’s dual mandate) has been difficult, as shown in figure 4. Initially, the\nunemployment rate (the solid black line) soared and inflation (the dashed red line) fell\nsharply. Moreover, after the recession officially ended in 2009, the subsequent recovery\nwas significantly slowed by a variety of persistent headwinds, including households with\nunderwater mortgages and high debt burdens, reduced access to credit for many potential\nborrowers, constrained spending by state and local governments, and weakened foreign\ngrowth prospects. In an effort to return employment and inflation to levels consistent\nwith the Federal Reserve’s dual mandate, the FOMC took a variety of unprecedented\nactions to help lower longer-term interest rates, including reducing the federal funds rate\n(the dotted black line) to near zero, communicating to the public that short-term interest\nrates would likely stay exceptionally low for some time, and buying large quantities of\nlonger-term Treasury debt and agency-issued mortgage-backed securities.15\nThese actions contributed to highly accommodative financial conditions, thereby\nhelping to bring about a considerable improvement in labor market conditions over time.\nThe unemployment rate, which peaked at 10 percent in 2009, is now 5.1 percent, slightly\nabove the median of FOMC participants’ current estimates of its longer-run normal level.\nAlthough other indicators suggest that the unemployment rate currently understates how\nmuch slack remains in the labor market, on balance the economy is no longer far away\n\ninflation in the vicinity of 4 percent or higher would stretch the meaning of “stable prices” in the Federal\nReserve Act.\n15\nFor a more complete listing of the Federal Reserve’s policy actions in recent years, see “The Federal\nReserve’s Response to the Financial Crisis and Action to Foster Maximum Employment and Price\nStability,” a webpage available on the Board’s website at\nwww.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/bst_crisisresponse.htm. Also see Engen, Laubach, and\nReifschneider (2015) for an analysis of the combined macroeconomic effects of the FOMC’s asset\npurchases and guidance concerning the future path of the federal funds rate.\n\n\f- 10 from full employment. In contrast, inflation has continued to run below the Committee’s\nobjective over the past several years, and over the past 12 months it has been essentially\nzero. Nevertheless, the Committee expects that inflation will gradually return to\n2 percent over the next two or three years. I will now turn to the determinants of inflation\nand the factors that underlie this expectation.\nInflation Dynamics\nModels used to describe and predict inflation commonly distinguish between\nchanges in food and energy prices--which enter into total inflation--and movements in the\nprices of other goods and services--that is, core inflation. This decomposition is useful\nbecause food and energy prices can be extremely volatile, with fluctuations that often\ndepend on factors that are beyond the influence of monetary policy, such as technological\nor political developments (in the case of energy prices) or weather or disease (in the case\nof food prices). As a result, core inflation usually provides a better indicator than total\ninflation of where total inflation is headed in the medium term.16 Of course, food and\nenergy account for a significant portion of household budgets, so the Federal Reserve’s\ninflation objective is defined in terms of the overall change in consumer prices.\nWhat, then, determines core inflation? Recalling figure 1, core inflation tends to\nfluctuate around a longer-term trend that now is essentially stable. Let me first focus on\nthese fluctuations before turning to the trend. Economic theory suggests, and empirical\nanalysis confirms, that such deviations of inflation from trend depend partly on the\n\n16\n\nSeveral other approaches are commonly used to abstract from the short-term volatility of overall inflation\nand thereby better discern its medium-term direction. For example, one procedure removes the\ncomponents of the total PCE price index with the largest or smallest price changes before computing the\naverage price change, yielding the “trimmed mean” PCE index; another uses the median price change in a\ngiven period, rather than the mean change, to represent the overall inflation rate. In practice, simply using\ncore inflation does about as well in predicting overall inflation over the coming year and beyond as these\nalternative procedures (see Detmeister, 2011, 2012).\n\n\f- 11 intensity of resource utilization in the economy--as approximated, for example, by the\ngap between the actual unemployment rate and its so-called natural rate, or by the\nshortfall of actual gross domestic product (GDP) from potential output. This\nrelationship--which likely reflects, among other things, a tendency for firms’ costs to rise\nas utilization rates increase--represents an important channel through which monetary\npolicy influences inflation over the medium term, although in practice the influence is\nmodest and gradual. Movements in certain types of input costs, particularly changes in\nthe price of imported goods, also can cause core inflation to deviate noticeably from its\ntrend, sometimes by a marked amount from year to year.17 Finally, a nontrivial fraction\nof the quarter-to-quarter, and even the year-to-year, variability of inflation is attributable\nto idiosyncratic and often unpredictable shocks.18\nWhat about the determinants of inflation’s longer-term trend? Here, it is\ninstructive to compare the purely statistical estimate of the trend rate of future inflation\nshown earlier in figure 1 with survey measures of people’s actual expectations of longrun inflation, as is done in figure 5. Theory suggests that inflation expectations--which\npresumably are linked to the central bank’s inflation goal--should play an important role\nin actual price setting.19 Indeed, the contours of these series are strikingly similar, which\n\n17\n\nAnother input cost that can affect core inflation is the price of energy; in recent decades, however, the\npass-through of energy price changes to core inflation appears much smaller than in previous periods (see\nHooker, 2002; Clark and Terry, 2010).\n18\nSome of these idiosyncratic shocks are related to identifiable factors, such as changes in Medicare\nreimbursement rates or movements in the (imputed) price of holding a checking account. (Both of these\nfactors are included in the services component of the PCE price index, but not the consumer price index\n(CPI).) However, not all idiosyncratic shocks can be reliably traced to specific factors, as a significant\nfraction represents unpredictable “noise.”\n19\nMost theoretical versions of the Phillips curve suggest that inflation should depend on short-run inflation\nexpectations, but, as an empirical matter, measures of long-run expectations appear to explain the data\nbetter.\n\n\f- 12 suggests that the estimated trend in inflation is in fact related to households’ and firms’\nlong-run inflation expectations.20\nTo summarize, this analysis suggests that economic slack, changes in imported\ngoods prices, and idiosyncratic shocks all cause core inflation to deviate from a longerterm trend that is ultimately determined by long-run inflation expectations. As some will\nrecognize, this model of core inflation is a variant of a theoretical model that is\ncommonly referred to as an expectations-augmented Phillips curve.21 Total inflation in\nturn reflects movements in core inflation, combined with changes in the prices of food\nand energy.\nAn important feature of this model of inflation dynamics is that the overall effect\nthat variations in resource utilization, import prices, and other factors will have on\ninflation depends crucially on whether these influences also affect long-run inflation\nexpectations. Figure 6 illustrates this point with a stylized example of the inflation\nconsequences of a gradual increase in the level of import prices--perhaps occurring in\nresponse to stronger real activity abroad or a fall in the exchange value of the dollar--that\ncauses the rate of change of import prices to be elevated for a time.22 First, consider the\n\n20\nSee Clark and Davig (2008); see also Faust and Wright (2013), who make a related point in the context\nof inflation forecasting. Note that the question about expected inflation in the University of Michigan\nSurveys of Consumers is not phrased in terms of a specific measure of prices, so its level--as opposed to its\ncontour--cannot be directly compared with a particular measure of inflation such as the change in the PCE\nprice index.\n21\nSee Tobin (1972) and Friedman (1968) for early discussions of the theory underpinning the expectationsaugmented Phillips curve. Theoretical descriptions of the inflation process remain an active area of\nresearch in economics. In recent years, many economic theorists have used a so-called new-Keynesian\nframework--in which optimizing agents are assumed to face constraints on price or wage setting in the form\nof adjustment costs or explicit nominal contracts--to model inflation dynamics (see Woodford, 2003,\nchapter 3, for a textbook treatment). Although these new-Keynesian inflation models can differ\nimportantly in their specifics, they all tend to assign a central role to inflation expectations and resource\nutilization as drivers of inflation dynamics.\n22\nIn this exercise, we ignore any inflation effects that might arise because of shifts in resource utilization\ninduced by the change in import prices, which are expressed relative to core prices.\n\n\f- 13 situation shown in panel A, in which households’ and firms’ expectations of inflation are\nnot solidly anchored, but instead adjust in response to the rates of inflation that are\nactually observed.23 Such conditions--which arguably prevailed in the United States from\nthe 1970s to the mid-1990s--could plausibly arise if the central bank has, in the past,\nallowed significant and persistent movements in inflation to occur. In this case, the\ntemporary rise in the rate of change of import prices results in a permanent increase in\ninflation. This shift occurs because the initial increase in inflation generated by a period\nof rising import prices leads households and firms to revise up their expectations of future\ninflation. A permanent rise in inflation would also result from a sustained rise in the\nlevel of oil prices or a temporary increase in resource utilization.\nBy contrast, suppose that inflation expectations are instead well anchored, perhaps\nbecause the central bank has been successful over time in keeping inflation near some\nspecified target and has made it clear to the public that it intends to continue to do so.\nThen the response of inflation to a temporary increase in the rate of change of import\nprices or any other transitory shock will resemble the pattern shown in panel B. In this\ncase, inflation will deviate from its longer-term level only as long as import prices are\nrising. But once they level out, inflation will fall back to its previous trend in the absence\nof other disturbances.24\nA key implication of these two examples is that the presence of well-anchored\ninflation expectations greatly enhances a central bank’s ability to pursue both of its\n\n23\nAn expectations-augmented Phillips curve in which expectations of inflation are assumed to eventually\nrespond one-for-one to actual past inflation is typically referred to as an accelerationist Phillips curve.\n24\nQualitatively similar results obtain in fully specified structural models with rational expectations-including the FRB/US, EDO, and SIGMA models maintained at the Federal Reserve Board--in which the\nlong-term behavior of inflation and inflation expectations is governed by the central bank’s (fixed) inflation\nobjective.\n\n\f- 14 objectives--namely, price stability and full employment. Because temporary shifts in the\nrate of change of import prices or other transitory shocks have no permanent influence on\nexpectations, they have only a transitory effect on inflation. As a result, the central bank\ncan “look through” such short-run inflationary disturbances in setting monetary policy,\nallowing it to focus on returning the economy to full employment without placing price\nstability at risk. Indeed, the Federal Reserve has done just that in setting monetary policy\nover the past decade or more. Moreover, as I will discuss shortly, these inflation\ndynamics are a key reason why the FOMC expects inflation to return to 2 percent over\nthe next few years.\nOn balance, the evidence suggests that inflation expectations are in fact well\nanchored at present. Figure 7 plots the two survey measures of longer-term expected\ninflation I presented earlier, along with a measure of longer-term inflation compensation\nderived as the difference between yields on nominal Treasury securities and inflationindexed ones, called TIPS. Since the late 1990s, survey measures of longer-term\ninflation expectations have been quite stable; this stability has persisted in recent years\ndespite a deep recession and concerns expressed by some observers regarding the\npotential inflationary effects of unconventional monetary policy. The fact that these\nsurvey measures appear to have remained anchored at about the same levels that\nprevailed prior to the recession suggests that, once the economy has returned to full\nemployment (and absent any other shocks), core inflation should return to its\npre-recession average level of about 2 percent.\nThis conclusion is tempered somewhat by recent movements in longer-run\ninflation compensation, which in principle could reflect changes in investors’\n\n\f- 15 expectations for long-run inflation. This measure is now noticeably lower than in the\nyears just prior to the financial crisis.25 However, movements in inflation compensation\nare difficult to interpret because they can be driven by factors that are unique to financial\nmarkets--such as movements in liquidity or risk premiums--as well as by changes in\nexpected inflation.26 Indeed, empirical work that attempts to control for these factors\nsuggests that the long-run inflation expectations embedded in asset prices have in fact\nmoved down relatively little over the past decade.27 Nevertheless, the decline in inflation\ncompensation over the past year may indicate that financial market participants now see\nan increased risk of very low inflation persisting.\nAlthough the evidence, on balance, suggests that inflation expectations are well\nanchored at present, policymakers would be unwise to take this situation for granted.\nAnchored inflation expectations were not won easily or quickly: Experience suggests\nthat it takes many years of carefully conducted monetary policy to alter what households\nand firms perceive to be inflation’s “normal” behavior, and, furthermore, that a persistent\nfailure to keep inflation under control--by letting it drift either too high or too low for too\n\n25\n\nIn evaluating the potential implications of this decline for expected PCE inflation, one also needs to keep\nin mind that TIPS are indexed to the CPI. CPI inflation generally runs a few tenths of a percentage point\nhigher than PCE inflation, though that differential can vary materially over time.\n26\nAnother complication is that we do not know whose expectations “matter” for determining inflation.\nInflation expectations of professional forecasters (such as those collected in the Blue Chip Economic\nIndicators, the Survey of Professional Forecasters, or the Survey of Primary Dealers) or inflation\nexpectations derived from asset prices probably capture the views of participants in financial markets but\nneed not reflect the views of households and firms more broadly. As an empirical matter, the little\ninformation available on the longer-term inflation expectations of firms from the Atlanta Federal Reserve\nBusiness Inflation Expectations survey suggests that firms’ expectations more closely resemble\nexpectations from the University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers than the expectations of professional\nforecasters. Similarly, preliminary data from a New Zealand study suggests that inflation forecasts of firms\nare much more similar to those of households than those of professional forecasters (see Coibion and\nGorodnichenko, 2015).\n27\nD’Amico, Kim, and Wei (2014) examine a number of models that use TIPS yields to back out expected\ninflation estimates. The best-fitting models show only a small decline in longer-term inflation expectations\nsince 2005.\n\n\f- 16 long--could cause expectations to once again become unmoored.28 Given that inflation\nhas been running below the FOMC’s objective for several years now, such concerns\nreinforce the appropriateness of the Federal Reserve’s current monetary policy, which\nremains highly accommodative by historical standards and is directed toward helping\nreturn inflation to 2 percent over the medium term.29\nBefore turning to the implications of this inflation model for the current outlook\nand monetary policy, a cautionary note is in order. The Phillips-curve approach to\nforecasting inflation has a long history in economics, and it has usefully informed\nmonetary policy decisionmaking around the globe. But the theoretical underpinnings of\nthe model are still a subject of controversy among economists. Moreover, inflation\nsometimes moves in ways that empirical versions of the model, which necessarily are a\n\n28\n\nMy interpretation of the historical evidence is that long-run inflation expectations become anchored at a\nparticular level only after a central bank succeeds in keeping actual inflation near some target level for\nmany years. For that reason, I am somewhat skeptical about the actual effectiveness of any monetary\npolicy that relies primarily on the central bank’s theoretical ability to influence the public’s inflation\nexpectations directly by simply announcing that it will pursue a different inflation goal in the future.\nAlthough such announcements might potentially persuade some financial market participants and\nprofessional forecasters to shift their expectations, other members of the public are probably much less\nlikely to do so. Hence, actual inflation would probably be affected only after the central bank has had\nsufficient time to concretely demonstrate its sustained commitment and ability to generate a new norm for\nthe average level of inflation and the behavior of monetary policy--a process that might take years, based\non U.S. experience. Consistent with my assessment that announcements alone are not enough, Bernanke\nand others (1999) found no evidence across a number of countries that the initial disinflation which follows\nthe adoption of inflation targeting is any less costly than disinflations carried out under alternative\nmonetary regimes.\n29\nSome might be surprised that the preceding discussion of inflation determinants makes no mention of\nlabor costs. In the past, wages provided a good empirical indicator of the future direction of price inflation;\nindeed, the presence of a so-called wage-price spiral--in which higher price inflation led workers to push\nfor higher wage growth, thereby in turn leading to even faster price increases as firms’ labor costs\naccelerated--was often invoked to explain the inflationary dynamics of the 1970s. The wage-price spiral no\nlonger seems to provide a useful description of the U.S. inflation process. In fact, some evidence suggests\nthat, like inflation, the rate of growth of labor costs is now characterized by a stable long-run trend; again, a\nlikely explanation for this empirical finding is the improved anchoring of long-term inflation expectations.\n(See Peneva and Rudd, 2015, for some suggestive evidence along these lines.) More generally, movements\nin labor costs no longer appear to be an especially good guide to future price movements. (This\ndevelopment does not imply that wage developments carry no useful information: Because wage growth is\ninfluenced by labor market slack, observed movements in compensation gains can provide an indication of\nhow close the economy is to full employment.)\n\n\f- 17 simplified version of a complicated reality, cannot adequately explain. For this reason,\nsignificant uncertainty attaches to Phillips curve predictions, and the validity of forecasts\nfrom this model must be continuously evaluated in response to incoming data.\nPolicy Implications\nAssuming that my reading of the data is correct and long-run inflation\nexpectations are in fact anchored near their pre-recession levels, what implications does\nthe preceding description of inflation dynamics have for the inflation outlook and for\nmonetary policy?\nThis framework suggests, first, that much of the recent shortfall of inflation from\nour 2 percent objective is attributable to special factors whose effects are likely to prove\ntransitory. As the solid black line in figure 8 indicates, PCE inflation has run noticeably\nbelow our 2 percent objective on average since 2008, with the shortfall approaching\nabout 1 percentage point in both 2013 and 2014 and more than 1-1/2 percentage points\nthis year. The stacked bars in the figure give the contributions of various factors to these\ndeviations from 2 percent, computed using an estimated version of the simple inflation\nmodel I just discussed.30 As the solid blue portion of the bars shows, falling consumer\nenergy prices explain about half of this year’s shortfall and a sizable portion of the 2013\nand 2014 shortfalls as well. Another important source of downward pressure this year\nhas been a decline in import prices, the portion with orange checkerboard pattern, which\n\n30\n\nFor a technical explanation of the procedure used to produce this decomposition, see the appendix. In the\ndecomposition procedure, movements in core inflation affect headline inflation one-for-one; as a result, the\ncontributions of food and energy price inflation are defined as each component’s price change relative to\nthe core, weighted by its share in total nominal consumer spending. (Note that the “other” category\nincludes the effects of changes in food prices.) The estimated contribution of movements in import prices\nis also computed relative to core inflation; thus, if import prices are rising at the same rate as core inflation,\nthey have no estimated effect on the shortfall of overall inflation from 2 percent. In addition, the\ndecomposition takes account of lags in the adjustment of core inflation to movements in resource utilization\nand other factors.\n\n\f- 18 is largely attributable to the 15 percent appreciation in the dollar’s exchange value over\nthe past year. In contrast, the restraint imposed by economic slack, the green dotted\nportion, has diminished steadily over time as the economy has recovered and is now\nestimated to be relatively modest.31 Finally, a similarly small portion of the current\nshortfall of inflation from 2 percent is explained by other factors (which include changes\nin food prices); importantly, the effects of these other factors are transitory and often\nswitch sign from year to year.\nAlthough an accounting exercise like this one is always imprecise and will depend\non the specific model that is used, I think its basic message--that the current near-zero\nrate of inflation can mostly be attributed to the temporary effects of falling prices for\nenergy and non-energy imports--is quite plausible. If so, the 12-month change in total\nPCE prices is likely to rebound to 1-1/2 percent or higher in 2016, barring a further\nsubstantial drop in crude oil prices and provided that the dollar does not appreciate\nnoticeably further.\nTo be reasonably confident that inflation will return to 2 percent over the next few\nyears, we need, in turn, to be reasonably confident that we will see continued solid\neconomic growth and further gains in resource utilization, with longer-term inflation\nexpectations remaining near their pre-recession level. Fortunately, prospects for the U.S.\neconomy generally appear solid. Monthly payroll gains have averaged close to 210,000\nsince the start of the year and the overall economy has been expanding modestly faster\n\n31\n\nAs discussed later, the current difference between the unemployment rate and its normal longer-run level\nlikely understates the actual amount of slack that remains in the labor market. If so, the estimates reported\nin figure 8 somewhat understate the contribution of slack to the current shortfall of inflation from 2 percent\nand, correspondingly, overstate the contribution from other factors. For example, if the standard\nunemployment gap currently understates the true level of slack by 1/2 percentage point, then the\ncontribution of slack to this year’s inflation shortfall is roughly 0.1 percentage point larger than the estimate\nreported in figure 8.\n\n\f- 19 than its productive potential. My colleagues and I, based on our most recent forecasts,\nanticipate that this pattern will continue and that labor market conditions will improve\nfurther as we head into 2016.\nThe labor market has achieved considerable progress over the past several years.\nEven so, further improvement in labor market conditions would be welcome because we\nare probably not yet all the way back to full employment. Although the unemployment\nrate may now be close to its longer-run normal level--which most FOMC participants\nnow estimate is around 4.9 percent--this traditional metric of resource utilization almost\ncertainly understates the actual amount of slack that currently exists: On a cyclically\nadjusted basis, the labor force participation rate remains low relative to its underlying\ntrend, and an unusually large number of people are working part time but would prefer\nfull-time employment.32 Consistent with this assessment is the slow pace at which hourly\nwages and compensation have been rising, which suggests that most firms still find it\nrelatively easy to hire and retain employees.\nReducing slack along these other dimensions may involve a temporary decline in\nthe unemployment rate somewhat below the level that is estimated to be consistent, in the\nlonger run, with inflation stabilizing at 2 percent. For example, attracting discouraged\nworkers back into the labor force may require a period of especially plentiful\nemployment opportunities and strong hiring. Similarly, firms may be unwilling to\nrestructure their operations to use more full-time workers until they encounter greater\ndifficulty filling part-time positions. Beyond these considerations, a modest decline in\n\n32\n\nFor a further discussion of the current level of resource utilization, see the Federal Reserve Board’s most\nrecent Monetary Policy Report, dated July 15, 2015, available on the Board’s website at\nwww.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/mpr_default.htm.\n\n\f- 20 the unemployment rate below its long-run level for a time would, by increasing resource\nutilization, also have the benefit of speeding the return to 2 percent inflation. Finally,\nalbeit more speculatively, such an environment might help reverse some of the significant\nsupply-side damage that appears to have occurred in recent years, thereby improving\nAmericans’ standard of living. 33\nConsistent with the inflation framework I have outlined, the medians of the\nprojections provided by FOMC participants at our recent meeting show inflation\ngradually moving back to 2 percent, accompanied by a temporary decline in\nunemployment slightly below the median estimate of the rate expected to prevail in the\nlonger run. These projections embody two key judgments regarding the projected\nrelationship between real activity and interest rates. First, the real federal funds rate is\ncurrently somewhat below the level that would be consistent with real GDP expanding in\nline with potential, which implies that the unemployment rate is likely to continue to fall\nin the absence of some tightening. Second, participants implicitly expect that the various\nheadwinds to economic growth that I mentioned earlier will continue to fade, thereby\nboosting the economy’s underlying strength. Combined, these two judgments imply that\nthe real interest rate consistent with achieving and then maintaining full employment in\nthe medium run should rise gradually over time. This expectation, coupled with inherent\nlags in the response of real activity and inflation to changes in monetary policy, are the\nkey reasons that most of my colleagues and I anticipate that it will likely be appropriate\nto raise the target range for the federal funds rate sometime later this year and to continue\n\n33\n\nFor a discussion of the supply-side damage that has occurred since 2007 and the potential benefits of\npartially reversing it through more accommodative monetary policy, see Reifschneider, Wascher, and\nWilcox (2015) and Van Zandweghe (forthcoming).\n\n\f- 21 boosting short-term rates at a gradual pace thereafter as the labor market improves further\nand inflation moves back to our 2 percent objective.\nBy itself, the precise timing of the first increase in our target for the federal funds\nrate should have only minor implications for financial conditions and the general\neconomy. What matters for overall financial conditions is the entire trajectory of shortterm interest rates that is anticipated by markets and the public. As I noted, most of my\ncolleagues and I anticipate that economic conditions are likely to warrant raising shortterm interest rates at a quite gradual pace over the next few years. It’s important to\nemphasize, however, that both the timing of the first rate increase and any subsequent\nadjustments to our federal funds rate target will depend on how developments in the\neconomy influence the Committee’s outlook for progress toward maximum employment\nand 2 percent inflation.\nThe economic outlook, of course, is highly uncertain and it is conceivable, for\nexample, that inflation could remain appreciably below our 2 percent target despite the\napparent anchoring of inflation expectations. Here, Japan’s recent history may be\ninstructive: As shown in figure 9, survey measures of longer-term expected inflation in\nthat country remained positive and stable even as that country experienced many years of\npersistent, mild deflation.34 The explanation for the persistent divergence between actual\nand expected inflation in Japan is not clear, but I believe that it illustrates a problem faced\nby all central banks: Economists’ understanding of the dynamics of inflation is far from\nperfect. Reflecting that limited understanding, the predictions of our models often err,\n\n34\n\nIn addition, we cannot count on expectations remaining anchored if the Federal Reserve were to permit\nactual inflation to continue to run noticeably below its announced objective after the real economy has\nsubstantially recovered.\n\n\f- 22 sometimes significantly so. Accordingly, inflation may rise more slowly or rapidly than\nthe Committee currently anticipates; should such a development occur, we would need to\nadjust the stance of policy in response.\nConsiderable uncertainties also surround the outlook for economic activity. For\nexample, we cannot be certain about the pace at which the headwinds still restraining the\ndomestic economy will continue to fade. Moreover, net exports have served as a\nsignificant drag on growth over the past year and recent global economic and financial\ndevelopments highlight the risk that a slowdown in foreign growth might restrain U.S.\neconomic activity somewhat further. The Committee is monitoring developments\nabroad, but we do not currently anticipate that the effects of these recent developments on\nthe U.S. economy will prove to be large enough to have a significant effect on the path\nfor policy. That said, in response to surprises affecting the outlook for economic activity,\nas with those affecting inflation, the FOMC would need to adjust the stance of policy so\nthat our actions remain consistent with inflation returning to our 2 percent objective over\nthe medium term in the context of maximum employment.\nGiven the highly uncertain nature of the outlook, one might ask: Why not hold\noff raising the federal funds rate until the economy has reached full employment and\ninflation is actually back at 2 percent? The difficulty with this strategy is that monetary\npolicy affects real activity and inflation with a substantial lag. If the FOMC were to\ndelay the start of the policy normalization process for too long, we would likely end up\nhaving to tighten policy relatively abruptly to keep the economy from significantly\novershooting both of our goals. Such an abrupt tightening would risk disrupting financial\nmarkets and perhaps even inadvertently push the economy into recession. In addition,\n\n\f- 23 continuing to hold short-term interest rates near zero well after real activity has returned\nto normal and headwinds have faded could encourage excessive leverage and other forms\nof inappropriate risk-taking that might undermine financial stability. For these reasons,\nthe more prudent strategy is to begin tightening in a timely fashion and at a gradual pace,\nadjusting policy as needed in light of incoming data.\nConclusion\nTo conclude, let me emphasize that, following the dual mandate established by\nthe Congress, the Federal Reserve is committed to the achievement of maximum\nemployment and price stability. To this end, we have maintained a highly\naccommodative monetary policy since the financial crisis; that policy has fostered a\nmarked improvement in labor market conditions and helped check undesirable\ndisinflationary pressures. However, we have not yet fully attained our objectives under\nthe dual mandate: Some slack remains in labor markets, and the effects of this slack and\nthe influence of lower energy prices and past dollar appreciation have been significant\nfactors keeping inflation below our goal. But I expect that inflation will return to\n2 percent over the next few years as the temporary factors that are currently weighing on\ninflation wane, provided that economic growth continues to be strong enough to complete\nthe return to maximum employment and long-run inflation expectations remain well\nanchored. Most FOMC participants, including myself, currently anticipate that achieving\nthese conditions will likely entail an initial increase in the federal funds rate later this\nyear, followed by a gradual pace of tightening thereafter. But if the economy surprises\nus, our judgments about appropriate monetary policy will change.\n\n\f- 24 References\nAscari, Guido, and Argia M.

The core inflation forecasting equation is\n𝑐\n𝑐\n𝜋𝑡𝑐 = .41𝜋𝑡𝑒 + .36𝜋𝑡−1\n+ .23𝜋𝑡−2\n− .08𝑆𝐿𝐴𝐶𝐾𝑡 + .57𝑅𝑃𝐼𝑀𝑡 + 𝜖𝑡 ,\n\nwhere 𝜋𝑡𝑒 is expected long-run inflation; 𝑆𝐿𝐴𝐶𝐾𝑡 denotes the level of resource utilization;\n𝑅𝑃𝐼𝑀𝑡 controls for the effect of changes in the relative price of core imported goods; 𝜖𝑡\nis a white-noise error term; and the coefficients are ordinary least squares estimates\nobtained using data from 1990:Q1 to 2014:Q4.\nFor estimation purposes, 𝑆𝐿𝐴𝐶𝐾𝑡 is approximated using the unemployment rate\nless the Congressional Budget Office’s (CBO) historical series for the long-run natural\nrate, while 𝜋𝑡𝑒 is proxied using the median forecasts of long-run PCE or CPI inflation\nreported in the Survey of Professional Forecasters, with a constant adjustment of 40 basis\n\n35\n\nThis appendix was revised on December 17, 2015, to provide additional information on the definition of\ncore import inflation and its implications for the longer-run rate of unemployment consistent with stable\ninflation. In addition, the original version of the appendix incorrectly reported that the adjustment factor\nused to convert historical readings on expected long-run inflation from a CPI basis to a PCE basis was\n50 basis points.\n\n\f- 29 points prior to 2007 to put the CPI forecasts on a PCE basis. (Prior to 1991:Q4, this\nseries is based on the long-run inflation expectations reported in the Hoey survey.) The\nrelative import price term, 𝑅𝑃𝐼𝑀𝑡 , is defined as the annualized growth rate of the price\nindex for core imported goods (defined to exclude petroleum, natural gas, computers, and\nsemiconductors), less the lagged four-quarter change in core PCE inflation, all multiplied\nby the share of nominal core imported goods in nominal GDP.36\nTo decompose recent movements in inflation into its various components, the\nseries used in the inflation model--for which data are available only through 2015:Q2 in\nmost cases--are first extended through the end of 2015. In the case of inflation, the\nextensions are consistent with the medians of FOMC participants’ projections for total\nand core PCE inflation in 2015 that were reported at the press conference following the\nSeptember FOMC meeting.37 Similarly, 𝑆𝐿𝐴𝐶𝐾𝑡 over the second half of 2015 is defined\nto be consistent with the median of FOMC projections for the 2015:Q4 unemployment\nrate, less the CBO’s estimates of the historical path of the long-run natural rate; the\nCBO’s 2015 estimate is almost identical to the median of FOMC participants’ most\nrecent projections of the normal longer-run level of the unemployment rate. For changes\nin the prices of consumer energy and core imports, the 2015:H2 extrapolations are based\non regressions of these two series on current and lagged changes in, respectively, crude\noil prices and exchange rates. This approach predicts that energy prices should decline at\nannual rates of about 6 percent in 2015:Q3 and 18 percent in 2015:Q4, while core import\n\n36\n\nThis measure of core import prices is constructed by Board staff using published and unpublished data\nprovided by the Bureau of Economic Analysis and the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n37\nThe information on participants’ forecasts provided at the September 17, 2015, press conference is\navailable on the Board’s website at\nwww.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/fomcprojtabl20150917.pdf.\n\n\f- 30 prices should fall about 2-1/2 percent at an annual rate in both quarters.38 Food prices are\nassumed to remain flat at their 2015:Q2 level; this assumption ensures that the combined\ncontribution of food and energy prices to inflation in 2015 is consistent with the median\ndifference between FOMC participants’ projections for total and core inflation. Finally,\nnominal spending shares for food, energy, and core imports are assumed to remain\nunchanged at their 2015:Q2 levels, and long-run inflation expectations are assumed to\nremain constant at 2 percent.\nAfter computing historical 𝜖𝑡 tracking errors for the two equations of the model,\nthe final step in the decomposition procedure is to run a sequence of counter-factual\nsimulations of the model from 1990:Q1 through 2015:Q4. One by one, each explanatory\nvariable of the model is set to zero and the model is simulated; the resulting difference\nbetween actual inflation and its simulated value equals the historical contribution of that\nparticular factor. Importantly, the simulations are all dynamic in that the lagged inflation\nterm in the core inflation equation is set equal to its simulated value in the preceding\nperiod, rather than its actual value. As a result, the decompositions incorporate the\neffects of changes in lagged inflation that are attributable to previous movements in the\nexplanatory variables.\n\n38\n\nThe level of core import prices, expressed relative to core consumer prices, displayed a modest\ndownward trend from 1990 through 2001 but since then has displayed little persistent trend, particularly if\none controls for shifts related to recent changes in the real exchange rate. If the post-2001 pattern persists\nin coming years, then 𝑅𝑃𝐼𝑀𝑡 would be expected to converge to zero within a few quarters and core PCE\ninflation to converge to 2 percent within two or three years, assuming that the unemployment rate remains\nclose to 5 percent (the CBO estimate of the natural rate) and there are no further shocks to the exchange\nrate and other factors. If, however, core import prices were expected to resume trending down relative to\nconsumer prices, then the model as specified would imply that the unemployment rate consistent with\ninflation stabilizing at 2 percent in the longer run would be somewhat lower than 5 percent.\n\n\fFigure 1\n\nU.S. Inflation since the 1960s\n4-quarter percent change\n14\n\n14\nTotal PCE price index\n\n12\n\n12\n\n10\n\n10\n\n8\n\n8\nCore PCE price index\n\n6\n\n6\n\n4\n\n4\n\n2\n\nLong-term trend\n\nQ2\n\n0\n\n2\n0\n\n-2\n\n-2\n1960\n\n1965\n\n1970\n\n1975\n\n1980\n\n1985\n\n1990\n\n1995\n\n2000\n\n2005\n\n2010\n\n2015\n\n2\n\nNote: The data are quarterly.

        "content": "For release at\n8:30 a.m. EDT\nJuly 15, 2015\n\nStatement by\nJanet L. Yellen\nChair\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nbefore the\nCommittee on Financial Services\n\nU.S. House of Representatives\nJuly 15, 2015\n\n\fChairman Hensarling, Ranking Member Waters, and members of the Committee, I am\npleased to present the Federal Reserve’s semiannual Monetary Policy Report to the Congress. In\nmy remarks today, I will discuss the current economic situation and outlook before turning to\nmonetary policy.\nCurrent Economic Situation and Outlook\nSince my appearance before this Committee in February, the economy has made further\nprogress toward the Federal Reserve’s objective of maximum employment, while inflation has\ncontinued to run below the level that the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) judges to be\nmost consistent over the longer run with the Federal Reserve’s statutory mandate to promote\nmaximum employment and price stability.\nIn the labor market, the unemployment rate now stands at 5.3 percent, slightly below its\nlevel at the end of last year and down more than 4-1/2 percentage points from its 10 percent peak\nin late 2009. Meanwhile, monthly gains in nonfarm payroll employment averaged about 210,000\nover the first half of this year, somewhat less than the robust 260,000 average seen in 2014 but\nstill sufficient to bring the total increase in employment since its trough to more than 12 million\njobs. Other measures of job market health are also trending in the right direction, with noticeable\ndeclines over the past year in the number of people suffering long-term unemployment and in the\nnumbers working part time who would prefer full-time employment. However, these measures-as well as the unemployment rate--continue to indicate that there is still some slack in labor\nmarkets. For example, too many people are not searching for a job but would likely do so if the\nlabor market was stronger. And, although there are tentative signs that wage growth has picked\nup, it continues to be relatively subdued, consistent with other indications of slack. Thus, while\n\n\f-2labor market conditions have improved substantially, they are, in the FOMC’s judgment, not yet\nconsistent with maximum employment.\nEven as the labor market was improving, domestic spending and production softened\nnotably during the first half of this year. Real gross domestic product (GDP) is now estimated to\nhave been little changed in the first quarter after having risen at an average annual rate of\n3-1/2 percent over the second half of last year, and industrial production has declined a bit, on\nbalance, since the turn of the year. While these developments bear watching, some of this\nsluggishness seems to be the result of transitory factors, including unusually severe winter\nweather, labor disruptions at West Coast ports, and statistical noise. The available data suggest a\nmoderate pace of GDP growth in the second quarter as these influences dissipate. Notably,\nconsumer spending has picked up, and sales of motor vehicles in May and June were strong,\nsuggesting that many households have both the wherewithal and the confidence to purchase bigticket items. In addition, homebuilding has picked up somewhat lately, although the demand for\nhousing is still being restrained by limited availability of mortgage loans to many potential\nhomebuyers. Business investment has been soft this year, partly reflecting the plunge in oil\ndrilling. And net exports are being held down by weak economic growth in several of our major\ntrading partners and the appreciation of the dollar.\nLooking forward, prospects are favorable for further improvement in the U.S. labor\nmarket and the economy more broadly. Low oil prices and ongoing employment gains should\ncontinue to bolster consumer spending, financial conditions generally remain supportive of\ngrowth, and the highly accommodative monetary policies abroad should work to strengthen\nglobal growth. In addition, some of the headwinds restraining economic growth, including the\neffects of dollar appreciation on net exports and the effect of lower oil prices on capital spending,\n\n\f-3should diminish over time. As a result, the FOMC expects U.S. GDP growth to strengthen over\nthe remainder of this year and the unemployment rate to decline gradually.\nAs always, however, there are some uncertainties in the economic outlook. Foreign\ndevelopments, in particular, pose some risks to U.S. growth. Most notably, although the\nrecovery in the euro area appears to have gained a firmer footing, the situation in Greece remains\ndifficult. And China continues to grapple with the challenges posed by high debt, weak property\nmarkets, and volatile financial conditions. But economic growth abroad could also pick up more\nquickly than observers generally anticipate, providing additional support for U.S. economic\nactivity. The U.S. economy also might snap back more quickly as the transitory influences\nholding down first-half growth fade and the boost to consumer spending from low oil prices\nshows through more definitively.\nAs I noted earlier, inflation continues to run below the Committee’s 2 percent objective,\nwith the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index up only 1/4 percent over the\n12 months ending in May and the core index, which excludes the volatile food and energy\ncomponents, up only 1-1/4 percent over the same period. To a significant extent, the recent low\nreadings on total PCE inflation reflect influences that are likely to be transitory, particularly the\nearlier steep declines in oil prices and in the prices of non-energy imported goods. Indeed,\nenergy prices appear to have stabilized recently.\nAlthough monthly inflation readings have firmed lately, the 12-month change in the PCE\nprice index is likely to remain near its recent low level in the near term. My colleagues and I\ncontinue to expect that as the effects of these transitory factors dissipate and as the labor market\nimproves further, inflation will move gradually back toward our 2 percent objective over the\nmedium term. Market-based measures of inflation compensation remain low--although they\n\n\f-4have risen some from their levels earlier this year--and survey-based measures of longer-term\ninflation expectations have remained stable. The Committee will continue to monitor inflation\ndevelopments carefully.\nMonetary Policy\nRegarding monetary policy, the FOMC conducts policy to promote maximum\nemployment and price stability, as required by our statutory mandate from the Congress. Given\nthe economic situation that I just described, the Committee has judged that a high degree of\nmonetary policy accommodation remains appropriate. Consistent with that assessment, we have\ncontinued to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent and have kept\nthe Federal Reserve’s holdings of longer-term securities at their current elevated level to help\nmaintain accommodative financial conditions.\nIn its most recent statement, the FOMC again noted that it judged it would be appropriate\nto raise the target range for the federal funds rate when it has seen further improvement in the\nlabor market and is reasonably confident that inflation will move back to its 2 percent objective\nover the medium term. The Committee will determine the timing of the initial increase in the\nfederal funds rate on a meeting-by-meeting basis, depending on its assessment of realized and\nexpected progress toward its objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation. If the\neconomy evolves as we expect, economic conditions likely would make it appropriate at some\npoint this year to raise the federal funds rate target, thereby beginning to normalize the stance of\nmonetary policy. Indeed, most participants in June projected that an increase in the federal funds\ntarget range would likely become appropriate before year-end. But let me emphasize again that\nthese are projections based on the anticipated path of the economy, not statements of intent to\nraise rates at any particular time.\n\n\f-5A decision by the Committee to raise its target range for the federal funds rate will signal\nhow much progress the economy has made in healing from the trauma of the financial crisis.\nThat said, the importance of the initial step to raise the federal funds rate target should not be\noveremphasized. What matters for financial conditions and the broader economy is the entire\nexpected path of interest rates, not any particular move, including the initial increase, in the\nfederal funds rate. Indeed, the stance of monetary policy will likely remain highly\naccommodative for quite some time after the first increase in the federal funds rate in order to\nsupport continued progress toward our objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent\ninflation. In the projections prepared for our June meeting, most FOMC participants anticipated\nthat economic conditions would evolve over time in a way that will warrant gradual increases in\nthe federal funds rate as the headwinds that still restrain real activity continue to diminish and\ninflation rises. Of course, if the expansion proves to be more vigorous than currently anticipated\nand inflation moves higher than expected, then the appropriate path would likely follow a higher\nand steeper trajectory; conversely, if conditions were to prove weaker, then the appropriate\ntrajectory would be lower and less steep than currently projected. As always, we will regularly\nreassess what level of the federal funds rate is consistent with achieving and maintaining the\nCommittee’s dual mandate.\nI would also like to note that the Federal Reserve has continued to refine its operational\nplans pertaining to the deployment of our various policy tools when the Committee judges it\nappropriate to begin normalizing the stance of policy. Last fall, the Committee issued a detailed\nstatement concerning its plans for policy normalization and, over the past few months, we have\nannounced a number of additional details regarding the approach the Committee intends to use\nwhen it decides to raise the target range for the federal funds rate.\n\n\f-6Federal Reserve Transparency and Accountability\nThese statements pertaining to policy normalization constitute recent examples of the\nmany steps the Federal Reserve has taken over the years to improve our public communications\nconcerning monetary policy. As this Committee well knows, the Board has for many years\ndelivered an extensive report on monetary policy and economic developments at semiannual\nhearings such as this one. And the FOMC has long announced its monetary policy decisions by\nissuing statements shortly after its meetings, followed by minutes of its meetings with a full\naccount of policy discussions and, with an appropriate lag, complete meeting transcripts.\nInnovations in recent years have included quarterly press conferences and the quarterly release of\nFOMC participants’ projections for economic growth, unemployment, inflation, and the\nappropriate path for the Committee’s interest rate target. In addition, the Committee adopted a\nstatement in 2012 concerning its longer-run goals and monetary policy strategy that included a\nspecific 2 percent longer-run objective for inflation and a commitment to follow a balanced\napproach in pursuing our mandated goals.\nTransparency concerning the Federal Reserve’s conduct of monetary policy is desirable\nbecause better public understanding enhances the effectiveness of policy. More important,\nhowever, is that transparent communications reflect the Federal Reserve’s commitment to\naccountability within our democratic system of government. Our various communications tools\nare important means of implementing monetary policy and have many technical elements. Each\nstep forward in our communications practices has been taken with the goal of enhancing the\neffectiveness of monetary policy and avoiding unintended consequences. Effective\ncommunication is also crucial to ensuring that the Federal Reserve remains accountable, but\n\n\f-7measures that affect the ability of policymakers to make decisions about monetary policy free of\nshort-term political pressure, in the name of transparency, should be avoided.\nThe Federal Reserve ranks among the most transparent central banks. We publish a\nsummary of our balance sheet every week. Our financial statements are audited annually by an\noutside auditor and made public. Every security we hold is listed on the website of the Federal\nReserve Bank of New York. And, in conformance with the Dodd-Frank Act, transaction-level\ndata on all of our lending--including the identity of borrowers and the amounts borrowed--are\npublished with a two-year lag. Efforts to further increase transparency, no matter how well\nintentioned, must avoid unintended consequences that could undermine the Federal Reserve’s\nability to make policy in the long-run best interest of American families and businesses.\nSummary\nIn sum, since the February 2015 Monetary Policy Report, we have seen, despite the soft\npatch in economic activity in the first quarter, that the labor market has continued to show\nprogress toward our objective of maximum employment. Inflation has continued to run below\nour longer-run objective, but we believe transitory factors have played a major role. We\ncontinue to anticipate that it will be appropriate to raise the target range for the federal funds rate\nwhen the Committee has seen further improvement in the labor market and is reasonably\nconfident that inflation will move back to its 2 percent objective over the medium term. As\nalways, the Federal Reserve remains committed to employing its tools to best promote the\nattainment of its dual mandate.\nThank you. I would be pleased to take your questions.\n\n\f"
