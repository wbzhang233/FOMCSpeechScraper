        "content": "Presentation to The Institute of Regulation & Risk, North Asia\nHong Kong\nBy Janet L. Yellen, President and CEO, Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco\nFor delivery on November 17, 2009, 6:30 PM local Hong Kong time, 5:30 AM Eastern,\n2:30 AM Pacific\n\nLinkages between Monetary and Regulatory Policy: Lessons from the Crisis 1\nF\n\nThank you. It is a great privilege to be here among such a distinguished group. I want to\nthank the Institute of Regulation & Risk for inviting me to speak tonight and express my\nparticular gratitude to Ms. Au King-chi of the Hong Kong Government and Mr. Norman Chan of\nthe Hong Kong Monetary Authority. I’m especially grateful to our gracious host Mr. Robert\nPringle. Given the limited time I have, I will try to lay out some broad themes concerning the\nimplications of the financial crisis for regulatory reform and monetary policy. My comments are\nmy own and do not necessarily reflect the views of my Federal Reserve colleagues. I look\nforward to the extended discussion we shall have later tonight when we will be able to delve\nmore deeply into these critical issues.\nIn the past, monetary and regulatory policies have generally been viewed as separate\ndomains with distinct objectives. The primary focus of monetary policy has been on attaining\nthe macroeconomic goals of low inflation and a stable economy. In the United States, these\ngoals find their expression in the Federal Reserve’s dual mandate of maximum employment and\nprice stability. By contrast, regulatory policy has generally pursued significantly different ends:\nprotecting the safety and soundness of individual financial institutions and reducing systemic\nrisk.\n1\n\nI would like to thank John Williams and Sam Zuckerman for assistance in preparing these remarks.\n\n1\n\n\fOf course, monetary and regulatory policies do not exist in total isolation and the Federal\nReserve, an institution with responsibilities in both domains, has long recognized some important\nlinkages. For example, it’s clear that the effectiveness of monetary policy and the performance\nof the macroeconomy depend greatly on maintaining a stable and healthy financial system. And\na sound economy makes the work of regulators much easier because economic downturns put\nconsiderable stress on the financial system. In addition, the insights we derive from our\nsupervision of banking organizations are helpful in formulating monetary policy. And the\neconomic analysis that underpins monetary policy improves our understanding of the risks\nconfronting financial institutions. Nonetheless, policymakers have generally viewed monetary\nand regulatory questions as separate disciplines, and we have designed our strategies and carried\nout our policies accordingly. 2\nF\n\nThe painful events of the past two years have fundamentally challenged this\ndichotomization of monetary and regulatory policies. It is no longer obvious that setting policies\nto stabilize the economy on the one hand and to safeguard the financial system on the other can\nbe cleanly separated—either in conception or implementation. 3 This experience has important\nF\n\nF\n\nimplications for both monetary and regulatory policy. Here I will focus on the conceptual issues,\nleaving aside vital questions concerning implementation, such as the appropriate division of\nauthority among different regulatory bodies—a subject that is under discussion in the United\nStates.\n\n2\n\nAt times, the connections between monetary policy and regulation have become more apparent. For example, the\nabolition of Regulation Q in the United States had a direct bearing on how monetary policy affected the economy\nand the appropriate monetary policy response to shocks (see Mauskopf 1990).\n\n3\n\nSee Shirakawa (2009) for further discussion on this point.\n\n2\n\n\fLet me start by considering our regulatory responsibilities. Government agencies have\nlong practiced micro-prudential supervision and regulation—that is, oversight of individual\nfinancial institutions aimed at preserving their safety and soundness. Indeed, micro-prudential\nsupervision—including on-site examinations, surveillance, guidance, regulations, and\nenforcement—is the first line of defense against systemic risk. The crisis has taught us valuable\nlessons on how to strengthen supervision going forward. For example, we need to develop\nstronger and more effective capital and liquidity standards, strengthen our oversight of risk\nmanagement practices, and insure that compensation arrangements do not create incentives that\ncould compromise safety and soundness. 4 In the United States, we also gleaned important\nF\n\nF\n\ninsights on how to improve our consolidated supervision of bank holding companies through this\nyear’s stress test of the 19 largest banking organizations, as part of the Supervisory Capital\nAssessment Program. We intend to make such horizontal institutional reviews involving\nmultidisciplinary teams an important component of our supervision going forward. Currently,\nwe are conducting a horizontal assessment of internal processes for evaluating capital adequacy\nat the largest U.S. banking organizations and will shortly undertake a similar horizontal review\nof incentive compensation practices.\nOverall, the crisis has exposed serious deficiencies in our micro-prudential regulatory\nstructure. We clearly need to address gaps, such as inadequate authority or tools to properly\nsupervise the so-called shadow banking system, including major investment banks, nonbank\nlenders, and vital financial insurance providers such as AIG.\nA broad consensus exists that we need to make these changes. But, it is critical to\nrecognize that carrying bigger sticks as micro-prudential supervisors entails tradeoffs between\n\n4\n\nSee, for example, Crockett (2009) and Tarullo (2009) for discussions of these issues.\n\n3\n\n\fstability and efficiency—that is, between managing systemic risk and cultivating a fertile\nenvironment for economic growth. Admittedly, we may well have been operating far off the\noptimal tradeoff curve in recent years! Still, in designing a new regulatory framework, we must\nbe aware that stronger capital standards that reduce leverage might hamper the flow of funds to\nbusinesses and households in ways that could impede investment and consumption. Of course,\nfinding the right balance is an immense challenge.\nTo strike that balance between stability and growth, we should examine what other policy\nweapons should be in our arsenal. Perhaps the most important are in the area of macroprudential oversight, which we increasingly understand is an essential complement to microprudential supervision. Now, what exactly does macro-prudential supervision entail? To me, it\nmeans identifying and correcting behaviors and structures in financial markets that create\nexcessive risk before they mushroom into something that threatens the entire financial system.\nThis requires real-time collection and analysis of data from a wide variety of financial\ninstitutions and markets, the deployment of tools to mitigate the inherent pro-cyclical tendencies\nof financial markets, and new resolution powers to deal with the failure of any institution that\nposes a threat to financial stability.\nMacro-prudential supervision takes a very different perspective than its micro-prudential\nsibling. It’s akin to caring for an entire ecosystem rather than individual trees. It is targeted at\nspillovers and externalities that contribute to systemic risk even when they don’t directly harm\nindividual institutions. An example is an investment strategy that is highly positively correlated\nacross institutions. Taken in isolation, each institution may appear to be adequately managing\nliquidity, capital, and exposure to risk. But, when many large institutions invest in the same\nclass of assets, a downturn in that asset class can cause a rush to the exits as everyone tries to sell\n\n4\n\n\fat the same time. That’s exactly what happened in 2007 and 2008 in the markets for mortgagerelated securities, with disastrous effects that we know too well. In the worst case, correlation\ncan feed contagion that spreads across the globe as institutions seek to rapidly deleverage and\nprotect liquidity. This presents a regulatory challenge of the first order: How are we to measure\nand safeguard against such highly correlated investment strategies? Research is under way now\nto provide some answers. 5 One promising strategy is to implement a system that would require\nF\n\nF\n\nbanking organizations to build capital buffers in good times that could be run down under\nstressful conditions. Such a system could serve as an automatic stabilizer, mitigating the buildup\nof leverage in booms and the destabilizing impact of broad-based deleveraging in downturns.\nOther practices may also be ripe for macro-prudential supervision. They include procyclical underwriting standards, shortcomings in the provision of liquidity and credit risk\nprotection during crises, and payment and clearing systems. 6 For example, markets for over-theF\n\nF\n\ncounter derivatives, including credit default swaps, lack the stabilizing mechanisms associated\nwith central exchanges. 7\nF\n\nF\n\nA key issue in macro-prudential supervision concerns the too-big-to-fail problem of\nsystemically important financial institutions. A number of approaches have been suggested to\nlimit the systemic risk from large, interconnected financial institutions. These include capping\nthe size of these institutions, moving some activities to exchanges or clearing firms, requiring\nthem to hold more capital, and reducing their odds of failure by requiring them to hold debt that\nautomatically converts to equity in a crisis situation. It is also essential to devise effective means\n\n5\n\nSee Caruana (2009) and Adrian and Brunnermeier (2009).\n\n6\n\nSee Bernanke (2009) and Dudley (2009) for further discussion of these and related issues of macro-prudential\nregulation.\n\n7\n\nSee Duffie and Zhu (2009) for an analysis of the problems associated with clearing credit default swap contracts.\n\n5\n\n\fto resolve large, highly interconnected financial institutions in an orderly manner to minimize the\ndamage to the financial system. In the United States, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation\nuses a well-tested and highly effective procedure for resolving commercial banks and thrifts.\nBut, for nondepository financial institutions, the standard bankruptcy process is all that’s\navailable. We’ve seen that the mere hint a financial institution is headed for bankruptcy can set\noff a run, depriving it of vital short-term funding and leaving it incapable of paying creditors. As\nrecent events attest, in the cases of systemically important institutions, the end result can be\nmarket turmoil, cascading declines in valuations, and panic.\nMacro-prudential supervision has the potential to lower systemic risk and thereby create a\nmore secure financial system that will contribute to macroeconomic goals as well. But,\nmonetary policy may also play a role in managing systemic risk. One notable feature of boomand-bust cycles has been highly pro-cyclical leverage at primary dealers, such as investment\nbanks. Recent research by Tobias Adrian and Hyun Shin suggests that monetary policy affects\nthese cycles in asset growth. 8 Specifically, they find that periods when monetary policy is\nF\n\nF\n\n“tight” relative to the predictions of an estimated Taylor rule are associated with weaker growth\nin holdings of repurchase agreements by primary dealers. 9 By contrast, “easy” monetary policy\nF\n\nF\n\nis associated with rapid increases in financial institution balance sheets that can add to systemic\nrisk. 10\nF\n\nThese results suggest that monetary policy could play a role in restraining undesirable\nswings in leverage and, by extension, reduce systemic risk. In particular, interest rate cuts in a\n8\n\nSee Adrian and Shin (2008a).\n\n9\n\nTaylor (2007) describes a different channel, but comes to the same conclusion that monetary policy can contribute\nto undesirable booms and busts.\n\n10\n\nSee Adrian and Shin (2008b, 2009). They also find evidence that asset growth is linked to housing construction.\n\n6\n\n\ftime of market disruption can be effective at stopping a deleveraging cycle from turning into an\nuncontrolled crash. And higher rates than called for based on purely macroeconomic conditions\nmay help forestall a potentially damaging buildup of leverage and an asset price boom.\nThis raises the broader—and very contentious—issue of whether monetary policy should\nseek to lean against potentially dangerous swings in asset prices. The answer is far from clear,\nbecause the use of monetary policy for these ends necessarily compromises the attainment of\nother macroeconomic goals. Because such use of monetary policy is costly, high priority should\nbe assigned to developing regulatory tools to address systemic risk. Even so, the crisis of the\npast two years has prompted many of us to reexamine the widely held view that monetary policy\nshould respond to asset prices only to the extent that they influence the anticipated trajectories of\ninflation and unemployment. Further research into the connections among monetary policy, the\nbanking and financial sectors, and systemic risk is needed to help answer this question. 11\nF\n\nIn summary, the events of the past few years compel us to reexamine many of our longheld ideas and practices in both monetary and regulatory policy. I am gratified that researchers\naround the world are looking hard at these questions. In addition, I am encouraged by the sense\nof purpose and cooperation exhibited by my colleagues at central banks, governments, and\ninternational organizations in their efforts to develop policies that will help us avoid the kind of\ncrisis we have just experienced. Thank you.\n\n11\n\nIncreasingly macroeconomists are incorporating banking and financial frictions in their macroeconomic models.\nSee, for example, Curdia and Woodford (2009) and Gertler and Karadi (2009).\n\n7\n\n\fReferences\nAdrian, Tobias, and Markus K.

Yellen, President and CEO, Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco\nFor delivery on November 10, 2009, 8:05 AM Mountain Standard Time, 10:05 AM Eastern\n\nThe Outlook for the Economy and Real Estate 1\nF\n\nThank you very much Sheila. It’s a great pleasure to see you again and to join all of you\nthis morning. I want to express my appreciation to Sheila for her excellent service as a member\nand as deputy chair of the San Francisco Federal Reserve Bank’s board of directors from 1999 to\n2004. I am very pleased to have the chance to speak to a group of professionals dedicated to\nadvancing the understanding of land economics. As you know, problems in real estate were\ncentral to the financial crisis and ongoing developments in this sector bear importantly on the\neconomy’s prospects for recovery. So my comments will focus on the economic outlook and I\nwill emphasize the role of real estate in shaping it.\nThroughout my remarks, I will compare the situation in the nation as a whole with that\nhere in Phoenix. I’m always struck when I visit Phoenix by the beauty of your natural setting\nand the great vitality of the city that has grown in this magnificent place. Phoenix demonstrates\na spirit of entrepreneurship, a sense of optimism about the future, and an eagerness to build\nsomething new. But, as the housing market collapsed and the nation fell into financial crisis and\nrecession, your desert metropolis was set back on its heels. Just as you grew faster than the\nnation as a whole during the boom years in the middle of the decade, so did you fall harder when\nthe bust came. I can only imagine what it’s like for those who’ve been blessed with one of the\n\n1\n\nI would like to thank Fred Furlong, John Judd, David Wright, and Sam Zuckerman for assistance in\npreparing these remarks.\n1\n\n\fnation’s most vibrant economies to suffer a setback of this magnitude. I’m pleased to say that I\nthink you will find much in my message this morning that is encouraging.\nThis is the first talk I’ve given since the economy has officially been reported to be\ngrowing again. The economy’s return to growth after a year and a half of recession marks a\nmajor turn and it looks like more than a flash in the pan. It seems to me that the economy has\nentered a sustained period of expansion. We’ve seen meaningful upturns in areas as diverse as\nhousing, consumer spending, industrial production, and foreign trade. And, a number of factors\nbode well for the future, including a better functioning financial system, low mortgage interest\nrates, a resurgent stock market, a stabilization of house prices, and stronger growth abroad.\nAll the same, I am not going to paint an entirely rosy picture for you. The strength and\ndurability of the expansion is in question. Some of the rebound is due to temporary government\nprograms and a swing in inventory investment that will not provide an ongoing source of growth.\nFinancial conditions have improved markedly in some respects, but many financial institutions\nare still hobbled with bad loans. The outlook for consumer spending is in doubt because\nhouseholds remain burdened with debt, and they have taken enormous hits to their wealth from\ndeclines in house and stock prices in recent years. And it’s particularly sobering that labor\nmarkets continue to deteriorate badly, leaving many millions of our fellow Americans unable to\nfind jobs. Just last week, we found out that the unemployment rate passed 10 percent in October.\nThe 10.2 percent jobless rate is the highest since 1983. Today I will consider this mixed picture\nin some detail and focus on two subjects of professional interest to many of you—the residential\nand commercial real estate markets. I want to stress that my comments are my own and do not\nnecessarily reflect the views of my Federal Reserve colleagues.\n\n2\n\n\fAs we look at the national economy, it’s important to keep things in perspective. It’s not\nfun to ponder a subdued recovery. But a year ago, after the near collapse of the global financial\nsystem, there was a real possibility of an outright depression. Fortunately, we avoided that. But\nwhat we did suffer through was bad enough—the worst downturn since the Great Depression of\nthe 1930s. The recession began at the end of 2007. Economic output has dropped by just over\n3½ percent. Over seven million jobs have been lost in the nonfarm sector of the economy. And\nthe unemployment rate has soared by over five percentage points. Few, if any, parts of the\neconomy were unscathed. The labor market was devastated, and housing, consumer spending,\nbusiness investment, exports, and imports all fell off the table.\nPhoenix was particularly hard-hit. In May 2007, the area unemployment rate was an\nextraordinarily low 2.9 percent. By September 2009, the rate had roughly tripled to 8.5 percent.\nThat’s lower than the national rate, but it’s a huge 5.6 percentage point swing. Construction\nrepresented a higher-than-average share of the Arizona economy, and the drag from real estate\nover the past two years has been especially severe in the state.\nAgainst this backdrop, the nation’s third-quarter return to growth was a great relief. Real\ngross domestic product—which is the economy’s total output of goods and services—increased\nat a solid annual rate of 3½ percent. The recession hasn’t officially been declared over, but a\nwide array of data suggests that the corner has been turned. In the third quarter, residential\ninvestment—which was at the center of the downturn—rose at nearly a 25 percent annual rate,\nalbeit from a very low level. Home sales, prices, and housing starts are once again climbing.\nMeanwhile, manufacturing is also beginning to show signs of strength. This was helped by a\nrebound in motor vehicle production, boosted by the government’s temporary cash-for-clunkers\n\n3\n\n\fprogram. Our exports surged as growth abroad picked up. And, importantly, consumer spending\nfinally is growing.\nTo me, the explanation for this turnaround is clear: Massive and concerted responses by\ngovernments and central banks around the world rescued the financial system, brought down\ninterest rates, provided emergency support, and broke the economy’s downward spiral. On the\nmonetary policy side, the Fed has pushed its traditional interest rate lever—the federal funds\nrate—close to zero. And, in order to provide additional stimulus, we put in place an array of\nunconventional programs to spur the flow of credit to households and businesses. These\nmeasures provided funding to banks and restored liquidity to a range of markets. We’ve\nincreased the flow of credit for securities backed by small business loans, consumer loans, and\nother assets. Our large-scale purchases of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac debt and mortgagebacked securities (MBS) helped lower mortgage rates and bolstered the housing market. We’ve\nalso bought longer-term U.S. Treasury debt to help bring private borrowing rates down.\nThese initiatives appear to have eased financial conditions. Clearly, the financial system\nis not yet back to normal, but it has bounced back notably. The stock market has soared since its\nlow in the winter. That rally has helped households recover some of their lost wealth and\nprovided a much-needed psychological boost. Investors perceive that economic risks are not as\ndire as they once seemed to be. Interest rates on corporate bonds—especially for less-than-prime\nfirms—have dropped sharply and issuance has been brisk. And the markets that financial\ninstitutions and corporations rely on for short-term funding are functioning reasonably well\nagain, due in part to Fed intervention.\n\n4\n\n\fFederal government policies also have contributed, including the fiscal stimulus program\npassed by Congress in February. Tax cuts have raised disposable income and government\nspending is directly adding to payrolls. Much of the stimulus money authorized by Congress\nremains to be spent and will spur growth in coming quarters. Other government initiatives\ncontributed to the third-quarter expansion as well, including the cash-for-clunkers program and\nthe $8,000 tax credit for first-time homebuyers.\nThe normal dynamics of the business cycle have also turned more favorable. Demand for\nhouses, durable goods such as autos, and business equipment is beginning to revive as\nhouseholds and businesses replace or upgrade needed equipment and structures. A particularly\nhopeful sign is that inventories of unsold goods, which have been shrinking rapidly, now seem to\nbe in better alignment with sales. Manufacturers had slashed production dramatically in the face\nof slumping sales. Recent data suggest that this correction may be near an end, setting the stage\nfor more production.\nThe big issue is how strong the upturn will be. With such enormous reservoirs of slack in\nthe form of high unemployment and idle productive capacity, we need a strong rebound to put\nunemployed people back to work and get underutilized factories, offices, and stores humming\nagain. Unfortunately, my own forecast envisions a less-than-robust recovery for several reasons.\nAs the impetus from government programs and inventories diminishes in the quarters ahead,\nprivate final demand will have to fill the breach. The danger is that demand may grow at too\nanemic a pace to support vigorous expansion.\nFirst, it may take quite a while for financial institutions to heal to the point that normal\ncredit flows are restored. The credit crunch hasn’t entirely gone away. In the face of massive\n\n5\n\n\floan losses, banks have clamped down on underwriting and credit terms for both businesses and\nconsumers. Smaller businesses without direct access to capital markets are particularly feeling\nthe pinch. Lenders have had to run hard just to stay in place: Rising unemployment, business\nfailures, and delinquencies in real estate markets have fed additional credit losses and made it\nmore difficult for financial institutions to get their balance sheets in good order.\nSecond, households have been pummeled and prospects for consumer spending are\ncloudy. Consumers have surprised us in the past with their free-spending ways and it’s not out\nof the question that they will do so again. But I wouldn’t count on them leading a strong\nrecovery. They face high and rising unemployment, stagnant wages, and heavy debt burdens.\nTheir nest eggs have shrunk dramatically as house and stock prices have fallen, and their access\nto credit has been squeezed.\nIt may be that we are witnessing the start of a new era for consumers following the harsh\nfinancial blows they have endured. 2 We often hear the word “deleveraging” used to describe the\nF\n\nF\n\npush by financial institutions to scale back debt and build equity. Households too have now\nbegun to pay down debt and rebuild their savings. This phenomenon can be seen not only in the\nUnited States, but in most countries that experienced similar housing booms. The United States\nwas hardly the only country where households borrowed heavily just before a severe housing\nbust set in. And those countries with greater increases in debt relative to income before the crisis\nexperienced greater declines in consumption spending once the crisis began.\nIn the United States, the personal saving rate, which had fallen to an incredibly low 1\npercent in early 2008, has averaged 4 percent so far this year and may well rise higher. In the\n\n2\n\nSee Glick and Lansing (2009).\n\n6\n\n\fcurrent environment, such belt-tightening makes great sense from the standpoint of individual\nhouseholds. In fact, some households may have no other option because their access to credit\nhas been crimped. Over the long run, higher saving is surely a good thing for our economy\nbecause it provides capital that can be devoted to modern infrastructure, technology, and other\nproductive investments that enhance our standard of living. All the same, the transition to a\nhigher saving plane could be painful if it reduces the growth rate of consumer spending for an\nextended period.\nWeakness in the labor market is another factor that may keep the recovery sluggish for\nquite some time. Payroll employment has been plummeting for more than a year and a half, and,\neven though the pace of the decline has slowed, unemployment now stands at its highest level\nsince 1983. In addition, many workers have seen their hours cut or are experiencing involuntary\nfurloughs. To bolster earnings in the face of weak revenue growth, employers have been\naggressive in cutting labor costs and jobs, and my business contacts say they will be reluctant to\nhire again until they see clear evidence of a sustained recovery. Weak demand for workers is\nalso putting a lid on paychecks. Wages are barely rising. A well-known measure of overall\nemployment costs rose by only 1¼ percent over the past year, the smallest increase in the history\nof the series. High unemployment, weak job growth, and paltry wage increases are a recipe for\nsluggish consumer spending growth and a tepid recovery.\n\nThe U.S. experienced so-called jobless recoveries following the previous two recessions\nin 1991 and 2001, when job creation remained weak for several years following the business\ncycle trough. In both cases, output growth was less robust than in the typical recovery and,\nunfortunately, things seem to be shaping up similarly this time around.\n\n7\n\n\fNow I’d like to take a close look at real estate markets, both residential and commercial.\nYou may be getting weary of my “on-the-one-hand, on-the-other-hand” message, but I’m afraid I\nhave more of that to offer when it comes to housing. To put it bluntly, the outlook for the\nresidential market is uncertain. And uncertain is much better than the prospects for commercial\nreal estate, which clearly are weak.\n\nLet me begin with housing. We have gone through many boom-and-bust cycles, but\nnone in the past half century have had such far-reaching effects as the wild ride of residential real\nestate during this decade. House prices soared from 2002 through 2005, moving dramatically\nout of line with fundamentals. By one measure, house prices on average peaked more than 50\npercent above the level that could be supported by underlying rental values. Since the market\ntop three years ago, the nation has experienced roughly a 30 percent collapse in average house\nprices, depending on the index used. That’s a terrible plunge, but there’s some good news in it\nfor the future: Prices are approaching a range where valuations are more in line with\nfundamentals. Such an adjustment is essential for a sustained revival of housing activity.\n\nIndeed, there are indications that the sickening market plunge has ended, with prices\nbeginning to edge up. At the same time, home sale volumes are advancing briskly. The supply\nof new houses on the market has been brought down from over 12 months to about 7½ months.\nThat’s still well above the four-month supply that was typical in the period right before the bust,\nbut the adjustment seems to have been enough to kick some life back into construction. In the\nthird quarter, real residential investment surged, though from an admittedly low level. For the\nfirst time in more than three years, housing construction actually added to GDP growth.\n\n8\n\n\fWhat I’ve said about the national housing market can be seen in even sharper relief here\nin Arizona, and especially in the Phoenix area. The metropolitan area’s residential boom-andbust cycle was considerably more pronounced than that of the nation as a whole. Gains in house\nprices were simply spectacular. Fast population and job growth following the 2001 recession\nexplains part of the story. However, the truly exceptional price jumps in 2004 and 2005, just\nbefore the collapse, look to be outsized even given the strong demographic and labor trends.\nSubprime loans represented an especially high proportion of mortgage lending in the region. Not\nsurprisingly, the house price collapse in this area has been especially severe. Price declines are\nas high as 50 percent or more, about 1½ times that of the nation, bringing values back to 2001\nlevels.\nFortunately, things are beginning to look up in Arizona as they are for the nation.\nExisting home sales are up sharply in recent months, although a large share of those are\nforeclosed properties. In the Phoenix area, home prices are now above their lows. A widely\nwatched forecasting survey predicts that 2009 will be the trough for housing permits in Phoenix\nand that 2010 will see significant increases. 3\nF\n\nStill, the Phoenix housing market is nowhere near a return to health. In the face of high\nand rising unemployment, mortgage delinquency and foreclosure rates are still increasing in the\narea. The share of mortgage loans in foreclosure or 60 days or more past due is nearly three\ntimes the national median. And this is by no means largely a subprime problem. Prime\nborrowers now account for the lion’s share of new foreclosures.\n\n3\n\nBlue Chip Economic Forecast Phoenix, Arizona State University, Third Quarter 2009.\nhttp://wpcarey.asu.edu/bluechip/phoenix/index.cfm\n9\n\n\fMeanwhile, developers and their creditors have been caught with excess raw land, lots\nthat are partially completed, or completed but still vacant. Values for finished but vacant lots\nacross the country are reported to be off about 50 percent from their peak, with some hard-hit\nregions in the West down even more. Over the past year and a half, developers and their bankers\nhave been working through this inventory and recognizing the associated losses. As write-offs\non these loans flow through community and regional banks, we can expect more failures.\nTurning back to the national picture, the bottom line is that the outlook for housing has\nturned up in response to favorable mortgage rates, lower house prices, and a lower overhang of\nunsold houses. And growth in this sector should contribute to the overall economic recovery.\nThese developments represent real gains, but it’s important not to get carried away. Some of the\nadvance reflects temporary government support in the form of tax credits for first-time home\nbuyers, and the impact of loan modification programs and foreclosure moratoriums that reduced\nthe pace of distressed sales. Moreover, foreclosure notices surged earlier this year and distressed\nproperty sales may rise once again in the months ahead. If so, we could see renewed pressure on\nhouse prices. Of course, continuing high unemployment will also fuel additional foreclosures.\nAnd the supply of credit for nonconforming mortgages remains extremely tight. Financial\ninstitutions are reluctant to place them on their books when they are trying to reduce leverage\nand we have yet to see any revival of the market for private mortgage-backed securities.\nWhen we turn to commercial real estate, the prospects are worrisome. Commercial\nproperty didn’t turn down until well after housing did. The sector’s problems appear to stem in\nlarge part from the effects of the recession and the credit crunch, rather than the type of building\nboom and lax underwriting standards that tripped up housing. Still, there are some parallels\nbetween the two sectors. As in the residential market, commercial real estate values posted\n10\n\n\fenormous price gains, with office values roughly doubling from the end of the 2001 recession to\nthe peak. Since then, values have plunged an estimated 35 to 40 percent and vacancy rates are\nrising for office, retail, warehouse, and other income-producing properties. In Arizona, office\nvacancy rates started moving up in the second part of 2006 as job growth decelerated abruptly\nfrom an exceptionally fast pace. Vacancies in Phoenix are near 25 percent, about a 13\npercentage point rise from the recent low.\nAs I indicated, credit market conditions are weighing heavily on this sector. Risk\npremiums on commercial real estate financing remain elevated, although they’re down a bit from\nthe peak of the financial crisis. Average commercial real estate capitalization rates have seen\nrisk spreads more than double over the past two years to more than 4 percentage points over 10year Treasury securities. The market for commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS)\nremains deeply distressed and issuance is meager despite support from the Fed’s Term AssetBacked Securities Loan Facility (TALF) and the Treasury’s Public-Private Investment Program\n(PPIP). Banks and thrifts, which account for more than half of commercial real estate financing,\nhave significantly raised rates and tightened credit terms. That, combined with higher investor\ndemands for returns and weakening operating income, points to further downward pressure on\nproperty values.\nCommercial real estate borrowers are increasingly hard-pressed to stay current on their\nloans. CMBS delinquency rates rose from about half a percent in August 2008 to over 3 percent\nthis July. Weakening loan quality is particularly damaging in Arizona where commercial real\nestate accounts for a much larger share of the average bank loan portfolio than in the nation. A\nlarge volume of commercial real estate loans and securities are coming up for renewal over the\nnext several years. This will prompt lenders and investors to review terms for continued\n11\n\n\fextension of credit. In many instances, banks are asking borrowers to either repay loans, provide\nmore equity, or agree to modified terms and conditions. These adverse trends recently prompted\nfederal regulators to issue guidance on commercial real estate to banks and thrifts, with a focus\non sound practices for loan workouts.\nNationwide, the commercial real estate downturn has been a drag on economic growth,\nsubtracting about 1 percent at an annual rate over the first three quarters of this year, compared\nwith a roughly neutral effect in 2008. All indications are that commercial real estate will\ncontinue weighing down the recovery going forward.\nWhen the weakness of the commercial property market is combined with the muted\noutlook for housing and consumer spending, you can see why I believe that the overall economic\nrecovery is likely to be gradual and remain vulnerable to shocks. It’s popular to pick a letter of\nthe alphabet to describe the likely course of the economy. The letter I would choose doesn’t\nexist in our alphabet, but if I were to describe it, it would look something like an “L” with a\ngradual upward tilt of the base. With such a slow rebound, unemployment could well stay high\nfor several years to come. In other words, our recovery is likely to feel like something well short\nof good times.\nThis brings me to inflation, a topic that has been hotly debated. 4 Some people worry\nF\n\nF\n\nabout the long-term inflationary implications of sustained federal budget deficits. Others fear\nthat economic slack and downward wage pressure are pushing inflation below rates that are\nconsistent with price stability. I am in the second camp. Persistent large budget deficits may be\nharmful once the economy recovers because they are apt to boost interest rates and absorb\n\n4\n\nSee Leduc, Rudebusch and Weidner (2009).\n\n12\n\n\fprivate savings that would otherwise finance productive investments. But experience teaches us\nthat budget deficits do not cause inflation in advanced economies with independent central banks\nthat pursue appropriate monetary policies. 5 As for the Fed, you can be 100 percent certain that\nF\n\nF\n\nprice stability will remain our objective, regardless of the stance of fiscal policy.\nI believe that the more significant threat to price stability over the next several years\nstems from enormous slack in the economy that is pushing inflation lower. Today, inflation is\nalready very low. Over the past 12 months, consumer prices as measured by the personal\nconsumption price index actually fell by one-half percent. After removing the effects of volatile\nfood and energy prices, core prices rose by 1¼ percent. That’s below the 2 percent rate that I\nand most of my fellow Fed policymakers on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC)\nconsider an appropriate long-term price stability objective. The public’s inflation expectations,\nwhich can independently influence inflation, remain well anchored, which is appropriate given\nthe Fed’s record and its commitment to price stability. And with slack likely to persist for years\nand wages barely rising, it seems probable that core inflation will move even lower over the next\nfew years.\nThis landscape presents clear challenges for monetary policy. We face an economy with\nsubstantial slack, prospects for only moderate growth, and low and declining inflation. With the\nfederal funds rate already at zero for all practical purposes, the Fed’s traditional policy tool is as\naccommodative as it can be. To provide more stimulus, the Fed has used unconventional policy\ntools, including emergency lending programs to promote liquidity and push longer-term interest\nrates lower. However, many of these programs are winding down or nearing completion. That\n5\n\nSee Fischer, Sahay, and Vegh (2002) and Catao and Terrones (2005) for analysis of the relationship between\ndeficits and inflation in the post-World War II period.\n\n13\n\n\fis why the FOMC stated that “economic conditions, including low rates of resource utilization,\nsubdued inflation trends, and stable inflation expectations, are likely to warrant exceptionally\nlow levels of the federal funds rate for an extended period” following our meeting last week.\nAt some point, of course, we will have to tighten policy—and we certainly have the\nmeans and the will to do so. We are—and always will be—steadfast in our determination to\nachieve both of our statutory goals of full employment and price stability. Until that time comes\nthough, we need to provide the monetary accommodation necessary to spur job creation and\nprevent inflation from falling any further below rates that are consistent with price stability.\nThank you very much.\n\nReferences\nCatao, Luis A.V., and Marco E.

Yellen, President and CEO, Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco\nFor delivery on September 14, 2009, 12:50 PM Pacific, 3:50 PM Eastern\n\nThe Outlook for Recovery in the U.S. Economy 1\nF\n\nIt’s a pleasure to appear before a group of professionals who spend as much time trying\nto understand the financial markets and the economy as I do. It’s fair to say that the last two or\nthree years have provided all of us an education—a far-from-welcome one—of just how\ncomplex these subjects are. We have had to rethink old assumptions and question conventional\nwisdom in the face of a crisis whose dimensions few of us might have imagined.\nI am hugely relieved that our financial system appears to have survived this near-death\nexperience. And, as painful as this recession has been, I believe that we succeeded in avoiding\nthe second Great Depression that seemed to be a real possibility. Much of the recent economic\ndata suggest that the economy has bottomed out and that the worst risks are behind us. The\neconomy seems to be brushing itself off and beginning its climb out of the deep hole it’s been in.\nThat’s the good news. But I regret to say that I expect the recovery to be tepid. What’s\nmore, the gradual expansion gathering steam will remain vulnerable to shocks. The financial\nsystem has improved but is not yet back to normal. It still holds hazards that could derail a\nfragile recovery. Even if the economy grows as I expect, things won’t feel very good for some\ntime to come. In particular, the unemployment rate will remain elevated for a few more years,\nmeaning hardship for millions of workers. Moreover, the slack in the economy, demonstrated by\nhigh unemployment and low utilization of industrial capacity, threatens to push inflation lower at\n1\n\nI would like to thank John Judd, Rob Valletta, and Sam Zuckerman for assistance in preparing these remarks.\n\n1\n\n\fa time when it is already below the level that, in the view of most members of the Federal Open\nMarket Committee (FOMC) best promotes the Fed’s dual mandate for full employment and price\nstability. As a result, monetary policy makers will continue to face a difficult task in the years\nahead.\nDuring the rest of my talk this afternoon, I will try to give a more detailed picture of the\nfinancial and economic landscapes. My comments are my own and do not necessarily reflect the\nviews of my Federal Reserve colleagues.\nAs I noted, we’ve come a long way since last year when the financial system was\nteetering on the edge of collapse. To me, it’s plain that the extraordinary and aggressive\nresponse of governments and central banks around the world saved the day—heading off the\nkind of financial meltdown that would have inflicted catastrophic damage on the economy.\nSome are skeptical about the effectiveness of emergency programs such as TARP, TAF, and\nTALF. But, in my view, these programs staved off disaster. And they have been keeping the\npatient on essential life support as little by little it begins to breathe again on its own.\nWhile the worst was avoided, the financial shock that did hit the economy was awful\nenough. The economy finally fell into recession at the end of 2007 when, on top of an ongoing\ndrag from a contracting housing sector, the ever-dependable American consumer—who had\nshrugged off one shock after another in years past—finally succumbed to the fallout from the\nfinancial crisis. Since the beginning of the downturn, real GDP has fallen by a bit short of 4\npercent and the unemployment rate has jumped by nearly 5 percentage points. Few, if any, parts\nof the economy have escaped the devastation. In addition to the setbacks in housing and\nconsumer spending, business investment, exports, and imports all fell off the table.\n\n2\n\n\fI’m happy to report that the downturn has probably now run its course. This summer\nlikely marked the end of the recession and the economy should expand in the second half of this\nyear. A wide array of data supports this view. However, payrolls are still shrinking at a rapid\npace, even though the momentum of job losses has slowed in the past few months. The housing\nsector finally seems to be improving. Home sales and starts are once again rising from very low\nlevels, and home prices appear to be stabilizing, even rising in recent months according to some\nnational measures. Meanwhile, manufacturing is also beginning to show signs of life, helped\nparticularly by a rebound in motor vehicle production. Importantly, consumer spending finally is\nbottoming out.\nA particularly hopeful sign is that inventories, which have been shrinking rapidly, now\nseem to be in better alignment with sales. That’s occurred because firms slashed production\nrapidly and dramatically in the face of slumping sales. Recent data suggest that this correction\nmay be near an end and firms are now poised to step up production to match sales. In fact, I\nexpect the biggest source of expansion in the second half of this year to come from a diminished\npace of inventory liquidation by manufacturers, wholesalers, and retailers. Such a pattern is\ntypical of business cycles. Inventory investment often is the catalyst for economic recoveries.\nTrue, the boost is usually fairly short-lived, but it can be quite important in getting things going.\nNowhere is this cycle more evident than in the auto sector. Production cutbacks this year have\nled to sharp reductions in inventories. Recently, sales of light vehicles have begun to rise, in part\ndue to the government’s cash-for-clunkers program. As a result, auto manufacturing has picked\nup and, with inventories lean, prospects are good for further production increases.\nIn all of these sectors, improved financial conditions have played a vital part in\nstimulating greater activity. To be sure, the financial system is not yet back to normal and credit\n3\n\n\fis still tight. But there have been notable improvements. The stock market rally has helped\nhouseholds recover some of their lost wealth and provided a much-needed psychological boost.\nInvestors have regained some of their appetite for risk. Interest rates on corporate bonds—\nespecially for less-than-prime firms—have dropped sharply and issuance has been brisk. Federal\nReserve programs to support the mortgage market have helped push rates down. And other Fed\nprograms have helped jump-start issuance of securities backed by consumer and small business\nloans. In the short-term wholesale funding markets, measures of stress have also diminished.\nThe fiscal stimulus program passed by Congress in February also deserves credit for\nhelping the economy turn the corner. Its tax cuts have raised disposable income, and\ngovernment spending is directly adding to payrolls, providing another source of household\nincome. Much of the stimulus money remains to be spent and will add to growth as the year\nproceeds.\nThe normal dynamics of the business cycle have also turned more favorable. Some\neconomic sectors are growing again simply because they sank so low. The inventory adjustment\nI just discussed is one factor, although the biggest part of those benefits usually is only felt for a\nfew quarters. But other business cycle patterns can be longer lasting. Demand for houses,\ndurable goods such as autos, and business equipment is beginning to revive as households and\nfirms replace or upgrade needed equipment and structures.\nI’d like to pause for a moment to make a few observations about the Bay Area economy.\nThe recession has been felt keenly here. Employment is down about 6 percentage points from its\npeak in late 2007. The unemployment rate has risen by more than 6 percentage points to just\nover 10 percent from its low point in late 2006, outstripping the national increase.\n\n4\n\n\fA harsh slump in information technology, due to plunging business spending on tech\nequipment and services, has prompted extensive job cuts and been a key factor driving down the\narea economy. Employment has fallen especially steeply on the hardware side, although IT\nservice providers have cut back as well.\nFortunately, IT seems to be on the mend. Sales of U.S.-made semiconductors are up\nsubstantially in recent months, prompting some prominent companies to bump up earnings\noutlooks for the remainder of the year. My local contacts have noted an uptick in venture capital\ninvestment, and they say that companies that received venture funding in the past are doing\nbetter at meeting performance benchmarks. Overall, the area’s IT industry is in much better\nshape than it was following the dot-com bust of the early 2000s. Clearly, it has struggled during\nthis downturn. But, this time around, it is not recovering from bubble-driven overexpansion, so\nit is well-positioned to take advantage of an economic upswing.\nThe area’s housing market is also showing signs of life. Sales of existing homes have\nbeen rising since late last year. Of course, the pickup has been propelled in part by sales of\nforeclosed homes and widespread availability of properties at bargain-basement prices. As we\nall know, Bay Area home prices have been decimated. Estimates of the cumulative decline over\nthe past few years range from about 15 percent to as high as 45 percent. Many local\nhomeowners are under water, and that’s helped feed the foreclosure wave. While it’s too soon to\nbe sure, this pernicious process may finally be coming to an end. Some recent data show price\nincreases and a notable pickup in sales of higher-end properties over the past few months.\nReturning to the national economy, the all-important question is how strong the upturn\nwill be. With unemployment at 9.7 percent of the workforce and capacity utilization at its lowest\n\n5\n\n\flevel of the post-World War II period, the economy has an enormous amount of slack. That\ngives us plenty of room to grow rapidly over the next few years. Indeed, we need to grow\nrobustly to alleviate the enormous human toll resulting from high unemployment and the waste\nof so much idle industrial capacity. At first glance, history suggests that a vigorous expansion\ncould very well take place. Following previous deep recessions, the United States typically saw\nV-shaped recoveries. For example, the economy grew at an average rate of nearly 6 percent\nduring the two years following the severe recession in 1981-82.\nThis time though rapid growth does not seem to be in store. My own forecast envisions a\nfar less robust recovery, one that would look more like the letter U than V. And I’m not alone.\nThe Blue Chip consensus forecast, reflecting the views of nearly 50 professional forecasters,\nanticipates by far the weakest recovery of the postwar era over the next year and a half. A large\nbody of evidence supports this guarded outlook. It is consistent with experiences around the\nworld following recessions caused by financial crises. 2 That seems to be because it takes quite a\nF\n\nF\n\nwhile for financial systems to heal to the point that normal credit flows are restored. That is\nwhat I expect this time. In the buildup to the recession, financial institutions became highly\nleveraged, a vulnerability compounded by investments in complex and risky assets funded with\nshort-term debt. In an attempt to improve credit quality and reduce risk, banks have now\ntightened business and consumer lending standards. They have been doing so at the same time\nthat rising unemployment and falling house prices have fed additional credit losses.\n\nUnfortunately, more credit losses are in store even as the economy improves and overall\nfinancial conditions ease. Certainly, households remain stressed. In the face of high and rising\nunemployment, delinquencies and foreclosures are showing no sign of turning around. The\n2\n\nSee Reinhart and Rogoff (2009) for evidence on this issue.\n\n6\n\n\fdelinquency rate on adjustable-rate mortgages is now up to about 18 percent, and, on fixed-rate\nloans, it’s about 6 percent. 3 Delinquencies on both types of loans have increased sharply over\nF\n\nF\n\nthe past year and are still rising. This trend is consistent across other major loan categories, and\nis affecting high- and low-quality borrowers alike. Even recent-vintage loans are experiencing\nrising delinquency rates.\n\nWhile it is important for economic recovery that lenders provide credit to worthy\nhouseholds and businesses, they also must maintain enough capital to withstand losses—even if\neconomic conditions turn out to be worse than anticipated. In the face of continuing credit\nlosses, moves by lenders to shrink assets, reduce leverage, and conserve capital are restricting the\nprovision of credit in the economy. For example, the Fed’s Senior Loan Officer Survey on Bank\nLending Practices conducted in July showed that, for consumer loans, far more banks are\ntightening standards than easing them, despite some improvements in this measure in recent\nmonths.\n\nNormally, if credit flows were restricted by these types of financial headwinds, the Fed\nwould ease the stance of monetary policy by cutting its federal funds rate target. But the funds\nrate is already at zero for all practical purposes, leaving the Fed’s traditional policy tool as\naccommodative as it can be. In fact, many versions of the Taylor rule, a well-known policy\nbenchmark based on the state of the economy and inflation, indicate that we should lower the\nfunds rate well below this zero bound—if such a thing were possible. To provide more\naccommodation, the Fed has used unconventional policy tools. Collectively, these programs,\nwhich have provided us a slew of new acronyms, appear to be helping. But we have little\n\n3\n\nThese figures refer to mortgages that are delinquent for 60 or more days or are in foreclosure.\n\n7\n\n\fexperience with them and the extent of their effectiveness is highly uncertain. So here’s the\nbottom line: Financial conditions have clearly eased compared to the darkest days of the\nfinancial crisis. But the financial system is still far from healthy and tight credit is likely to put a\ndamper on growth for some time to come.\n\nA sputtering financial system is not the only challenge before us. The chances are slim\nfor a robust rebound in consumer spending, which represents around 70 percent of economic\nactivity. Of course, consumers are getting a boost from the fiscal stimulus package. But this\nprogram is temporary. Over the long term, consumers face daunting issues of their own. In fact,\nit’s easy to draw a comparison between the financial state of households and that of financial\ninstitutions. For years prior to the recession, households went on a spending spree. This\noccurred during a period that economists call the “Great Moderation,” about two decades when\nrecessions were infrequent and mild, and inflation was low and stable. Credit became ever easier\nto get and consumers took advantage of this to borrow and buy. Stock and home prices rose year\nafter year, giving households additional wherewithal to keep spending. In this culture of\nconsumption, the personal saving rate fell from around 10 percent in the mid-1980s to 1½\npercent or lower in recent years. At the same time, households took on larger proportions of\ndebt. From 1960 to the mid-1980s, debt represented a manageable 65 percent of disposable\nincome. Since then, it has risen steadily, with a notable acceleration in the last economic\nexpansion. By 2008, it had doubled to about 130 percent of income.\n\nIt may well be that we are witnessing the start of a new era for consumers following the\ntraumatic financial blows they have endured. 4 The destruction of their nest eggs caused by\nF\n\nF\n\nfalling house and stock prices is prompting them to rebuild savings. The personal saving rate is\n4\n\nSee Glick and Lansing (2009).\n\n8\n\n\ffinally on the rise, averaging almost 4½ percent so far this year. While certainly sensible from\nthe standpoint of individual households, this retreat from debt-fueled consumption could reduce\nthe growth rate of consumer spending for years. An increase in saving should ultimately support\nthe economy’s capacity to produce and grow by channeling resources from consumption to\ninvestment. And higher investment is the key to greater productivity and faster growth in living\nstandards. But the transition could be painful if subpar growth in consumer spending holds back\nthe pace of economic recovery.\n\nWeakness in the labor market is another factor that may keep the recovery in low gear for\na while. As I mentioned, payroll employment has been plummeting for a year and a half. While\nthe August employment report offered more evidence that the pace of the decline has slowed,\nunemployment now stands at its highest level since 1983. My business contacts indicate that\nthey will be very reluctant to hire again until they see clear evidence of a sustained recovery, and\nthat suggests we could see another so-called jobless recovery in which employment growth lags\nthe improvement in overall output. What’s more, wage growth has slowed sharply. Over the\nfirst half of this year, the employment cost index for private-industry workers has risen by a\nmeager three-quarters of one percent. Unemployment, job insecurity, and low growth in\nincomes will undoubtedly take a toll on consumption. When the array of problems facing\nconsumers is considered, it is hard to see how we can avoid sluggish spending growth.\n\nPutting the whole puzzle together, the main impetus to growth in the second half of this\nyear will be inventory investment. The boost it provides will be a big help for a while, but we\nwill need to look to other sectors to sustain growth. The fact that the largest sector of the\neconomy—consumer spending—is likely to be lackluster implies a less-than-robust expansion.\n\n9\n\n\fEven the gradual recovery we expect will be vulnerable to shocks, especially from the financial\nsector. As I said, financial conditions are better, but not back to normal. And the likelihood of\ncontinuing losses by financial institutions will add new fuel to the credit crunch. In particular,\nsmall and medium-size banks could experience damaging losses on commercial real estate loans.\nThus far, the largest losses have been on loans for construction and land development. Going\nforward, however, rising loan losses on other commercial real estate lending is likely because\nproperty values are falling, office vacancy rates are rising, and credit remains tight or nonexistent\nfor those many property owners that will need to refinance mortgages over the next few years.\nFinancial contagion from this sector is one of the most important threats to recovery.\n\nThe slow recovery I expect means that it could still take several years to return to full\nemployment. The same is true for capacity utilization in manufacturing. It will take a long time\nbefore these human and capital resources are put to full use.\nThis brings me to the complex topic of inflation. In my career, I have never witnessed a\nsituation like the one that exists now, when views about inflation risks have coalesced into two\ndiametrically opposed camps. On the one hand, one group worries about the long-term\ninflationary implications of a seemingly endless procession of massive federal budget deficits.\nAt the same time, others fear that economic slack and downward wage pressure are pushing\ninflation below rates that are considered consistent with price stability and even raising the\nspecter of outright deflation. This dichotomy is on display among the participants in the Survey\nof Professional Forecasters. The lowest quartile of forecasters focuses on disinflation over the\nnext five years. The top quartile is preoccupied with the possibility of rising inflation five to ten\nyears out.\n\n10\n\n\fThe fear of higher long-term inflation reflects, to a large degree, worries about Fed\nmonetary policy. Our array of new programs to spur the economy have pumped up our balance\nsheet and created a huge quantity of bank reserves in the process. Some worry that we won’t be\nable to shrink our balance sheet because of political pressures, and in the process we will end up\nmonetizing the government debt. This fear is real, growing, and disruptive. That’s why it’s so\nimportant for me to say the following loud and clear: We at the Fed are and will remain fiercely\nindependent from politics. We have the means—and we certainly have the will—to tighten\npolicy when the time is right. In fact, by raising the interest rate that we pay on excess reserves\nwe can tighten monetary policy even before our balance sheet shrinks. And we are, as always,\nsteadfast in our determination to achieve both of our statutory goals of full employment and price\nstability.\nMy personal belief is that the more significant threat to price stability over the next\nseveral years stems from the disinflationary forces unleashed by the enormous slack in the\neconomy. The 1980s provides a useful historical comparison. During that period, fears about\nburgeoning federal deficits and an unsustainable fiscal situation were widespread, as they are\ntoday. Moreover, the Fed was under significant political pressure, and some worried whether it\nwould be able to safeguard its independence. But those circumstances didn’t ignite a renewed\nbout of inflation. Unemployment nearly hit 11 percent in 1982 and oil prices were sinking. Core\npersonal consumption expenditure (PCE) inflation—the Fed’s preferred measure—fell about 6\npercentage points during the first half of the 1980s.\nOf course, that period differed from ours in one critical respect. Then, inflation was\ncoming down from unacceptably high levels. Monetary policy was designed to be tight enough\nto bring inflation down to price stability, a goal we accomplished and have maintained for two11\n\n\fand-a-half decades. Today, we are starting with very low inflation. Core PCE price inflation has\naveraged just under 1½ percent over the past twelve months, which is already below the 2\npercent rate that I and most of my FOMC colleagues consider an appropriate long-term price\nstability objective. With slack likely to persist for years, it seems likely that core inflation will\nmove even lower, departing yet farther from our price stability objective.\nFrom a monetary policy point of view, the landscape will continue to present challenges.\nWe face an economy with substantial slack, prospects for only moderate growth, and low and\ndeclining inflation. With our policy rate already as low as it can go, it’s no wonder that the\nFOMC’s last statement indicated that “economic conditions are likely to warrant exceptionally\nlow levels of the federal funds rate for an extended period.” I can assure you that we will be\nready, willing, and able to tighten policy when it’s necessary to maintain price stability. But,\nuntil that time comes, we need to defend our price stability goal on the low side and promote full\nemployment. Thank you very much.\n\n12\n\n\fReferences\nGlick, Reuven, and Kevin J.

Yellen, President and CEO, Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco\nFor delivery on Tuesday, July 28, 2009, 9:35 AM Pacific time, 12:35 PM Eastern\n\nThe Outlook for the U.S. Economy and Community Banks 1\nF\n\nThank you very much. I’m delighted to be able to talk to an audience of community\nbankers in such a beautiful setting. The 12th Federal Reserve District stretches from Utah to\nHawaii, and from Arizona to Alaska. As I travel around this region, I often think how lucky I am\nto be able to visit some of the most breathtaking places in the United States. Coeur d’Alene is\nclearly among them.\nI will speak today about the difficult economic landscape lying before us and what that\nmeans for community banks. It’s fair to say that you have been caught in a financial and\neconomic crisis that you did not create, one precipitated in part by exotic financial engineering\ncarried out mainly by large financial institutions, not banks like yours. Community banks\ngenerally steered clear of the market for credit default swaps and didn’t create structured\ninvestment vehicles to keep assets off of balance sheets. Now though all of us must live with the\nconsequences of the culture of risk that permeated the global financial system. The near collapse\nof that system and the severe recession that continues today have created an exceptionally\nstressful environment even for well-run banks. That leaves little choice except to take the proper\nsteps to manage through this storm, a point I will expand on later in my talk.\n\n1\n\nI would like to thank Teresa Curran, John Judd, Maureen O’Byrne, and Sam Zuckerman for assistance in preparing\nthese remarks.\n\n\fI’ll start my remarks by giving you my perspective on the current economic landscape\nand prospects for recovery. I will then offer some thoughts about inflation, a subject I know\nconcerns many of you. And I will finish by reviewing the situation faced by community banks in\nthe Pacific Northwest and the 12th District as a whole. As always, my comments represent my\nown views and not necessarily those of my colleagues in the Federal Reserve System.\nEconomic and financial conditions\nIt was less than a year ago that the financial system found itself on the very brink of\ncollapse. As home prices tumbled, loan losses cascaded through our financial system. These\nlosses started in subprime markets but spread broadly across nearly all sectors, exposing\nweaknesses in market structures and the practices of many financial institutions. When Lehman\nBrothers failed in September 2008, vital wholesale funding markets seized up, precipitating the\nmost catastrophic liquidity crisis since the 1930s. Only the most aggressive intervention by\ngovernments and central banks around the world prevented outright financial meltdown. Some\npeople grumble about programs such as TARP, TAF, TALF, and the rest of the alphabet soup.\nBut it’s important to remember how close we were to something unimaginable. Those initiatives\nmay not have been perfect, but I believe they succeeded in supporting the system until a measure\nof confidence returned.\nFinancial trauma of this magnitude could have nothing but the direst effects on economic\nactivity. As we all know, the financial earthquake of the summer and fall was quickly followed\nby aftershocks that rocked the broader economy, intensifying a credit crunch, and producing\nprecipitous drops in employment and economic output. The interaction between the economy\n\n2\n\n\fand the credit crunch—often described as an adverse feedback loop—led to what could become\nthe most severe recession since the Great Depression.\nThat’s the backdrop to our current situation. And here the picture turns brighter, as we\nglimpse the first solid signs since the recession started more than a year and a half ago that\neconomic growth may be poised to resume. Indeed, I expect that to happen sometime this year.\nFinancial conditions have improved markedly in recent months. The stock market has rallied\nand investor appetite for corporate bonds and other assets has rebounded, restoring access to\ncapital at reasonable rates for many healthy companies, including financial institutions.\nMeasures of stress in the markets for short-term funding have also diminished. At the same time,\nthe housing sector finally seems to be stabilizing. Housing starts have leveled off and, in an\nencouraging sign, sales are beginning to improve. Meanwhile, house price declines may finally\nbe abating. Consumer spending may also be stabilizing. Payrolls are still shrinking at a dreadful\npace, but at least the momentum of job losses has slowed a bit in the past two months.\nOregon and Idaho have been hit hard by the recession, with unemployment rising in both\nstates at a faster pace than in the nation as a whole. 2 Both Oregon and Idaho have large\nF\n\nF\n\nproportions of technology manufacturing jobs, which have been vulnerable to the sharp\ndownturn in that sector. And Oregon is highly dependent on international trade, 3 which has\nF\n\nF\n\nexperienced a historic contraction. Oregon’s unemployment rate was 12.2 percent in June, the\nthird highest in the nation.\n\n2\n\nOregon’s unemployment rate has risen from a low of 5 percent in April 2007 to 12.2 percent in June 2009, an\nincrease of 7.2 percentage points. Idaho’s rate has jumped from 2.8 percent in May 2007 to 8.4 percent in June 2009,\nan increase of 5.6 percentage points. By comparison, the U.S. unemployment rate went from 4.4 percent in March\n2007 to 9.5 percent in the latest period, an increase of 5.1 percentage points.\n\n3\n\nThe value of merchandise exports as a share of gross state product was 12 percent in Oregon in 2008. For the\nUnited States, the comparable percentage was 9.1 percent.\n\n3\n\n\fLooking ahead at the national economy, a variety of sources will fuel growth in the\nmonths ahead, including expansionary fiscal and monetary policies, and the normal dynamics of\nthe business cycle. The fiscal stimulus program passed by Congress in February provides tax\ncuts that have raised household income. In addition, government spending is directly adding to\npayrolls and boosting demand. More stimulus will come on line as the year proceeds. This\nprogram wasn’t designed to produce an economic recovery by itself, but rather to cushion our\nfall. In that sense, it’s doing its job.\nMonetary policy too has contributed to recovery. As you know, the Fed is using both\ntraditional and nontraditional tools to boost the economy. We have set our federal funds rate\ntarget close to zero and indicated that economic conditions are likely to warrant keeping it there\nfor an “extended period.” We have provided liquidity to previously dysfunctional markets, such\nas the asset-backed commercial paper market. And we’ve purchased Treasury and agencyrelated securities for our own portfolio to help push longer-term private borrowing costs lower,\nthereby stimulating demand.\nMeanwhile, the normal dynamics of the business cycle are turning more favorable. Some\nsectors are poised to rebound simply because they have sunk so low. For example, the auto\nindustry has cut production so far that inventories have begun to shrink, even in the face of\nhistorically weak demand. Just slowing the pace of inventory liquidation will bolster economic\nactivity. This story holds for many sectors of the economy where spikes in inventories occurred\nas cautious consumers cut back on purchases of durable goods, and businesses slashed spending\non equipment and software. Looking forward, the demand for houses and durables should also\neventually revive as old and broken-down goods need to be replaced. The resulting demand will\nhelp the economy recover.\n4\n\n\fBut that recovery is likely to be painfully slow. History teaches that it often takes a long\nwhile to recover from downturns caused by financial crises. 4 Financial institutions and markets\nF\n\nF\n\nwon’t heal overnight. And it will take quite some time before households have repaired their\ntattered finances. Until recently, households were saving less and borrowing more in response to\nwealth gains in both stocks and housing. This pattern made their balance sheets vulnerable to\nadverse developments and the crashes in both house and stock prices during the last two years\ndestroyed trillions of dollars of their wealth. Not surprisingly, the personal saving rate has now\nshot higher and I expect to see subdued consumer spending for some time. 5 The unprecedented\nF\n\nF\n\nglobal nature of the recession also will act as a drag. 6 Countries recovering from financial crises\nF\n\nF\n\noften receive a boost from foreign demand, but neither the United States nor its trading partners\ncan count on such external stimulus this time.\nA gradual recovery means that things won’t feel very good for some time to come. The\nunemployment rate currently is 9½ percent, and this figure is likely to rise further. Moreover,\neven after the economy begins to grow, it could still take several years to return to full\nemployment. The same is true for capacity utilization in manufacturing, which has declined so\nfar that it has fallen “off the charts”—now standing at its lowest level in the postwar period.\nFinally, even though downside risks to the outlook have diminished, there remains some\nchance that economic conditions could turn out worse than what I’ve sketched. High on my\nworry list is the possibility of another shock to the still-fragile financial system. Commercial real\nestate is a particular danger zone, but I will hold my discussion of that topic until I turn to\nbanking conditions.\n4\n\nReinhart and Rogoff (2009).\nGlick and Lansing (2009).\n6\nInternational Monetary Fund (2009).\n5\n\n5\n\n\fLet me now address another issue that is garnering attention—inflation. This is a subject\nrife with contradiction. Almost without exception, my business contacts report downward\npressure on wages and prices. At the same time, they tell me they worry that the United States is\non the threshold of serious inflation. They see large federal budget deficits today and more\nlooming on the horizon. They also note that the Fed has pumped up bank reserves and expanded\nits balance sheet to fund its financial support programs. They worry that this may amount to\nfinancing deficits with money creation. Surely, they say, these things will eventually have to\nlead to higher inflation.\nI’ll begin with budget deficits. The gap in the federal budget for the current and the next\nfiscal years are projected to exceed $1 trillion, far larger than anything we’ve ever seen before.\nBut a large part of these current deficits are temporary. A portion stems from the impact of the\nweak economy on the budget. In a recession, tax collections fall and spending on programs such\nas unemployment insurance rise automatically. A significant portion is due to the fiscal stimulus\nthat has been put in place over the next few years to address the recession. Antirecessionary\nfiscal policy, in my view, is entirely appropriate. Since that stimulus is temporary by design, the\nresulting deficits will shrink as the stimulus phases out. But federal deficits will not disappear\ncompletely even when the economy has recovered and the stimulus program has phased out. On\nthe contrary, these ongoing or “structural” deficits are anticipated to stretch indefinitely into the\nfuture and to escalate over time in a manner that ultimately is not sustainable. The long-term\nprojected structural budget deficit mainly reflects the impact of an aging population and rapidly\nrising health-care costs on spending for federal entitlement programs, particularly Medicare and\nMedicaid.\n\n6\n\n\fEconomists have known, worried, and warned the public about the damaging\nconsequences of escalating long-term budget deficits in the United States for decades. It’s high\ntime for our country to tackle the problem head-on. But the main concern with these deficits\nrelates to productivity and living standards, and not high inflation. Large budget deficits do not\ncause high inflation automatically. In fact, since World War II, large deficits have been\nassociated with high inflation only in developing countries. That’s because developing countries\noften have central banks that are under the sway of the government, which sometimes induces\nthem to print money to finance government spending. 7 The connection isn’t found in countries\nF\n\nF\n\nsuch as ours with advanced financial systems and independent central banks. Remember that, in\nthe 1980s, the United States ran large deficits just as inflation was coming down. And Japan has\nhad huge deficits through much of the past two decades, yet its problem is persistent deflation—\nprecisely the opposite of inflation. The United States and most other industrialized countries\nhave central banks with long traditions of independence and deep-seated support for keeping\npolitics out of monetary policy. In those countries, the monetary authorities generally have stuck\nto their inflation objectives, even when governments ran large budget deficits.\nIn advanced countries, the problem isn’t that large deficits cause inflation. Rather it’s\nthat they raise long-term interest rates, thereby crowding out private investment, which holds\nback advances in productivity and living standards. Right now, private investment spending is\nextremely weak, so financing for the large federal deficits is readily available. But once private\nspending recovers, the competition for funds between the government and private sectors could\ndrive interest rates up. A decline in productivity growth is a serious problem—one we should\nstrive to avoid—but it is not the same as inflation.\n\n7\n\nFischer et al. (2002) and Catao and Terrones (2005).\n\n7\n\n\fSo what about the Fed’s unprecedented balance sheet expansion? Our strong steps to\navert financial and economic meltdown have caused our assets to more than double, from under\n$900 billion at the start of the recession to over $2 trillion now. This expansion is largely\nfinanced by increases in excess reserves that banks deposit with us.\nNow we come to the crux of the issue: Will this expansion of credit and bank reserves\ncreate high inflation? My answer is no. And the reason again is because of current economic\nconditions. Monetary policy fosters inflation when it loosens the stance of policy enough to\ncreate excess demand for goods and services. Right now, we have exactly the opposite—an\nexcess supply of goods and services. We need more demand—not less—to offset slack in labor\nand product markets. We have seen a noticeable slowdown in wage growth and reports of wage\ncuts have become increasingly prevalent. Businesses are cutting prices to boost sales. As a\nresult, core inflation—a measure that excludes volatile food and energy prices—has drifted\nbelow 2 percent, a level that I and most of my colleagues consider consistent with price stability.\nWith unemployment already substantial and likely to rise further, and industrial capacity\nutilization at record low levels, downward pressure on wages and prices isn’t likely to go away\nsoon. I expect core inflation to remain below 2 percent for several more years.\nOf course, the economy will eventually recover and we will need to withdraw monetary\naccommodation. If we were to fail to do so, we would indeed have higher inflation. The Fed is\nkeenly aware of this. We have the tools to tighten policy when the time is right and we have the\nwill to use them. First, many of our emergency programs are already tapering off as market\nconditions improve. Second, many of the assets that we have accumulated during the crisis—\nsuch as Treasury and mortgage-backed agency securities—have ready markets and can be easily\nsold. Finally, the Fed can push up the federal funds rate and tighten policy by raising the rate of\n8\n\n\finterest paid to banks on the reserves they deposit with us—authority granted by Congress last\nyear. An increase in the interest rate on reserves will induce banks to lend money to us rather\nthan to other banks, thereby pushing up rates in the interbank market and, by extension, other\ninterest rates throughout the economy. This is an important tool because, even if the economy\nrebounds nicely, the credit crunch might not be fully behind us and some financial markets might\nstill need Fed support. This tool will enable us to tighten credit conditions even if we maintain a\nlarge balance sheet for a time. The experience of central banks in Europe, Japan, and Canada\nsuggests that this approach can be effective. 8\nF\n\nLet me be clear: In our conduct of monetary policy, we are guided by our statutory\nmandates of maximum employment and price stability. We are committed to doing everything\nin our power to foster both goals. Our institution was created as a politically independent central\nbank, and that tradition is deeply embedded in our culture and practice. When the economy does\ncome back, I can assure you that we will act decisively and appropriately to tighten the stance of\npolicy and maintain price stability.\nBanking\nLet me shift now to a review of banking conditions. As I noted earlier, when the\nfinancial crisis intensified last fall, the Fed worked jointly with Treasury and other regulators to\nstabilize the banking system and restore confidence in financial markets more broadly.\nThe Troubled Asset Relief Program, or TARP, injected capital into the banking system at\na time when confidence in the system’s soundness was eroding and private funding was\nunavailable. I believe that it made a positive contribution. One indication of the significance of\n\n8\n\nBernanke (2009a).\n\n9\n\n\fTARP capital for community banks in the West is that about one in five banks in the 12th Federal\nReserve District took advantage of the program. Participating banks augmented their capital by\nan average of 2 percentage points. I certainly recognize that some bankers don’t like the\n“strings” attached to TARP and perceive that the goals of the program have shifted over time.\nBut there’s no denying that the program measurably strengthened the capitalization of many\ncommunity banks, putting them in a stronger position to weather difficult times. The stability of\nbank funding has also been bolstered by the FDIC’s temporary liquidity guarantee program and\nthe expansion of deposit insurance limits. Another program that should be helpful to banks is the\njoint Fed-Treasury initiative known as the Term Asset-Backed Securities Lending Facility, or\nTALF. This initiative is designed to revive critical securitization markets and help boost the\nissuance of a wide range of securitized loan products. The Fed’s recent expansion of the\nprogram to include both legacy and new commercial mortgage-backed securities should enhance\nthe availability of credit for commercial real estate and benefit both large and small banks with\nsignificant exposure to this sector by preventing defaults and facilitating the sale of distressed\nproperties.\nAll in all, I believe that the aggressive responses of the Fed and other agencies served to\nease the funding pressures facing a broad range of banks and to stabilize the financial system.\nThe restoration of confidence in the financial system has benefited all banks.\n\nOf course, the crisis has made it self-evident that we must reform our regulatory\nframework and improve supervisory practice so that a catastrophe of this magnitude never\nhappens again. As you know, the Obama administration has submitted a comprehensive reform\nbill to Congress, which is holding hearings over the summer on the proposal. Last week,\nChairman Bernanke and Governor Tarullo testified before Congress, laying out the Fed’s views\n10\n\n\fon regulatory restructuring. 9 Let me mention just two key areas where our regulatory framework\nF\n\nF\n\nmust be strengthened.\n\nFirst, we need a better way to manage systemic risk. By that I mean improved oversight\nof the financial system as a whole. Focusing on systemic risk is different than our traditional\ninstitution-oriented approach to supervision. It has become painfully clear that when regulators\nfocus exclusively on individual institutions, they can miss broader risks building in the system.\nIn particular, we need to do a better job of assessing how the practices of large institutions may\naffect their counterparties and the system as a whole. I know that many community bankers\nconsider it unfair that small banks—which did not cause the financial mess—are allowed to fail,\nwhile larger banks that took the biggest risks are rescued. That’s an understandable reaction.\nBut we can’t escape the reality that certain institutions, by virtue of their size or their linkages to\nkey markets, pose unique risks to the system and can bring others down with them. One lesson\nfrom the crisis is that it’s dangerous to have large, systemic institutions operating outside the\nregulatory framework or with inadequate capital and liquidity buffers. It’s essential that we\nidentify these systemic institutions and subject them to a robust framework of consolidated\nsupervision as well as more stringent standards for capital, liquidity, and governance.\n\nProtecting consumers is a second area where our current system failed in many respects.\nThis is not only a matter of fairness for individuals. It’s also a key element in the performance of\nour economy. Abuses such as inadequate consumer disclosures and unfair and deceptive\nmortgage lending practices by some institutions contributed to record foreclosure rates that\nmagnified the financial crisis. Given what we’ve learned about the pernicious effects of\n\n9\n\nTarullo (2009) and Bernanke (2009b).\n\n11\n\n\fconsumer loan defaults on the banking sector and the economy, it’s critical that we strengthen\nour regulation and supervision in this area for both bank and nonbank financial players.\n\nNow let me turn to the business environment facing banks. The industry is going through\none of the most difficult periods in modern times. First-quarter data show that the 12th District\nhas been hit harder than any other area of the country. Bank profits are down, loan delinquencies\nare up, and failures are climbing.\n\nIn Oregon and Idaho, community banks are underperforming the nation and have\nsignificantly riskier profiles. In terms of return on assets, Oregon was the eighth and Idaho was\nthe eleventh worst performing state in the nation. 10 Moreover, a relatively large fraction of\nF\n\nF\n\nbanks in each state lost money in the first quarter—about 40 percent in Oregon and 20 percent in\nIdaho. Loan quality indicators tell a similar story. Recent net charge-off rates at banks in each\nstate are much higher than the national average. Recessionary effects normally take some time\nto work their way through loan portfolios. So, even though I expect economic growth to resume\nin the second half of this year, banking conditions are likely to remain quite weak for another\nyear or two.\n\nTo date, the community banks under greatest financial stress are those with high real\nestate concentrations in construction and land development lending. Banks that liberally funded\nspeculative housing and condominium construction, and those that funded land acquisition and\ndevelopment, have been hardest hit. Over 20 District financial institutions have failed since last\nyear. The vast majority of them had high concentrations in residential construction and\ndevelopment lending. In fact, these banks had construction loans that averaged about 40 percent\n10\n\nThese and other statistics on bank performance are from Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco (2009).\n\n12\n\n\fof their loan portfolio, well above the District average of 16 percent. Unfortunately, some banks\nthat aggressively pursued these loans had weak appraisal and risk-monitoring systems.\n\nThe next area of significant vulnerability for the banking system, particularly for\ncommunity and regional banks with real estate concentrations, is income-producing office,\nwarehouse, and retail commercial property. Market fundamentals in most western states are\ndeteriorating. Vacancy rates are rising and rent pressures are hurting property cash flows.\nOffice vacancy rates in both Boise and Portland are expected to reach or exceed 20 percent over\nthe next year or two, the highest rates these cities have seen in many years. Retail shopping\ncenters are struggling with falling occupancy rates and pressures to grant rent concessions.\nProperty values are falling sharply across wide areas of the country, including the Pacific\nNorthwest. Some analysts forecast that commercial property values could experience falls\nsimilar to housing of 30 to 40 percent.\nRegrettably, a number of banks failed to implement risk management steps outlined in\nthe guidance on commercial real estate loan concentrations that was issued by regulators in 2006.\nBanks need to take proactive steps to address emerging credit problems, obtain new appraisals,\nand recognize impairment when warranted. But we also encourage banks to work out problem\nloans with troubled borrowers when this is prudent.\nOur biggest concern now is with maturing loans on depreciated commercial properties.\nIn many cases, borrowers seeking to refinance will be expected to provide additional equity and\nto have underwriting and pricing adjusted to reflect current market conditions. In some cases,\nborrowers won’t have the resources to refinance loans. TALF and the Treasury’s Public-Private\n\n13\n\n\fInvestment Program can support the commercial real estate market. But the economic forces\nhammering commercial property are unlikely to reverse anytime soon.\nAnother area I’d like to touch on is liquidity. For most banks, funding has stabilized\nsince last fall but remains quite fragile. We’ve seen rapid growth in the use of noncore funding\nchannels, such as brokered deposits and Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) advances. Brokered\ndeposits constitute an average of less than 4 percent of deposits nationally. But in Idaho, that\nconcentration is more than double. And, in Oregon, it’s more than three times higher. 11\nF\n\nF\n\nAlthough many banks have managed their liquidity positions effectively, one lesson of the\ncurrent period is that funding options can evaporate when a bank is facing declining asset\nquality, diminished earnings capacity, and falling capital. And that holds for brokered deposits,\ncorrespondent lines, and FHLB advances.\nI know this sounds woeful, but my advice is to hope for the best and plan for the worst.\nThat means anticipating a range of bad and worst-case scenarios that reflect local economic\nconditions and a bank’s particular risk profile. It can be helpful to perform stress tests based on\nthese scenarios to assess potential effects on earnings and capital, and to develop appropriate\ncontingency plans. The commercial real estate guidance that I mentioned earlier emphasizes the\nimportance of stress tests. The testing that the largest 19 banks recently conducted offers\nexamples of techniques that community banks can adopt, such as two-year portfolio loss\nestimates and methods of estimating revenue. Appropriately designed stress tests can help bank\nmanagements and boards make decisions about loan-loss provisioning, capital planning, and\nstrategic initiatives.\n\n11\n\nThe Idaho concentration is 8 percent; Oregon is 13 percent.\n\n14\n\n\fIt also makes sense to perform liquidity risk analyses that assess potential funding\npressures. These analyses should include forward-looking metrics such as cash-flow projections,\nand should examine a range of possibilities, such as reduced correspondent borrowing lines,\nhigher FHLB haircuts, and loss of access to brokered deposits. Banks would be well advised to\nhave in place well-tested backup plans before any potential funding crisis, including procedures\nfor using the Fed’s discount window.\nOn the subject of capital, regulatory minimums are just that—minimums. They’re not\nguarantees that a bank will have enough capital to weather a future storm. The Fed and other\nregulators are placing much more emphasis on forward-looking capital analyses that consider a\nrange of difficult economic scenarios and include earnings and loss estimates, and assessments of\nan institution’s ability to raise private capital. Capital retention is an integral part of this\nequation, and that implies a rigorous review of dividend policy. I encourage bank managements\nto consult with their primary regulators about dividends in the context of capital planning\ndiscussions.\nAlthough my message is that you should plan for the worst and exercise caution, I want\nto stress that it is also critical that you continue to make loans to creditworthy borrowers. The\nprofits that quality loans generate will serve you well as you safeguard capital. They are the core\nearning assets that will power bank profitability as we head out of this recession. And, of course,\nthe credit provided by prudent, well-functioning depository institutions will play an important\nrole in supporting the broader economic recovery that now seems to be on the horizon.

Yellen, President and CEO, Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco\nFor delivery on Tuesday, June 30, 2009, 6:00 PM Pacific time, 9 PM Eastern.\nA View of the Economic Crisis and the Federal Reserve’s Response 1\nF\n\nThank you very much. I’m very glad to be here before this thoughtful and engaged\naudience to talk about the economy and the Federal Reserve’s response. The Fed has faced\nextraordinary challenges over the past two years and these challenges continue as this very\npainful recession grinds on. I don’t have to tell you how difficult these times have been for the\nAmerican people. You are reminded of it every time you look at your retirement portfolio or\nhear about rising foreclosures and plunging home values. Your businesses may be squeezed as\ncustomers retreat and credit remains scarce. You may have seen colleagues get pink slips or you\nyourselves may be struggling to find a job. I’m happy to offer some good news: We’ve seen\nencouraging signs lately that the economy is poised to turn the corner. But as California’s 11.5\npercent unemployment rate attests, we still find ourselves slogging through the starkest economic\nlandscape most of us have known in our lifetimes.\nFor economic policymakers, this crisis has been like a hundred-year flood—a disaster of\nthe highest order which has put us on a continuous emergency footing. That is especially true at\nthe Federal Reserve—the institution where I serve as one of 12 regional bank presidents—which\nis charged with promoting maximum employment and controlling inflation. Later in my talk, I’ll\ndescribe how we’ve responded to what not so long ago seemed perilously close to financial and\neconomic meltdown. For now, all I’ll say is that, in the face of unprecedented challenges, we’ve\n\n1\n\nI would like to thank John Williams and Sam Zuckerman for assistance in preparing these remarks.\n\n\fdeveloped a number of creative programs far beyond the confines of our usual focus on interest\nrates to make sure that everything that reasonably could be done to get the economy turned\naround is being done.\nI want to start by discussing where the economy has been and where I see it going over\nthe next few years. As always, my comments represent my own views and not necessarily those\nof my colleagues in the Federal Reserve System. To understand where we’re headed, it’s useful\nto review how we got to the present situation. I think it’s helpful to divide the recent turmoil,\nlike a play, into three acts. I hope the curtain is now rising on the final act, one defined by\neconomic recovery.\nThe first act began early in the new century, amid a frenzied housing boom and a\nmortgage market where loans were available to just about everyone on unbelievably generous\nterms. Interest rates were unusually low, partly because of a huge supply of foreign savings that\nflooded the U.S. market and partly because the Fed promoted very low interest rates after the\ntech bubble burst to prevent deflation. 2 With money so cheap, investors borrowed to the hilt and\nF\n\nF\n\ntook ever-greater risks in search of higher returns.\nIt may be that investors—and regulators too—got overly complacent. Many had come to\nbelieve that the new and mind-bendingly complex forms of financial engineering that had swept\nWall Street virtually guaranteed the safety of banks and investment firms. A new era had\ndawned: financial innovation and sophisticated risk management had changed the rules. What’s\nmore, the business cycle had been tamed. For two decades, recessions had been rare and mild.\n\n2\n\nSee Bernanke (2005) for a discussion of the global influences on interest rates. See Taylor (2009) for a critical\nevaluation of U.S. monetary policy during this period.\n\n2\n\n\fThis whole process fed on itself. In the housing market, loan standards became\nincreasingly lax. Investors had an insatiable appetite for securities created from home loans,\nbuying them by the truckload from the institutions that made the loans, even though they offered\nreturns just a shade higher than ultra-safe U.S. Treasury securities. These risky practices spread\nfar beyond the subprime mortgage market where they were most visible, reaching into all kinds\nof credit products around the world.\nThis brings us to the second act of the play. House prices leaped higher every year,\nthanks to this frothy financial market. But they couldn’t go up forever. Once they started to fall\nin 2006, loan delinquencies surged and the sophisticated financial engineering collapsed. The\nfinancial system spread those losses like a runaway infection. Banks and investment firms\naround the world saw the value of their housing-related investments plummet, in some cases\nthreatening their solvency. The financial engineering was so unfathomable that it was nearly\nimpossible to identify which institutions were safe and which were in jeopardy. That prompted\nfinancial firms to hunker down and avoid lending money to anybody.\nThis all came to a head last fall. The weakest links in the financial chain were unable to\nborrow the money they needed to meet day-to-day obligations—a classic liquidity crisis. And\nwhen the venerable Wall Street firm Lehman Brothers collapsed, the system broke down\nentirely. The financial markets that banks and businesses rely on to fund daily operations froze\nup. The value of investments held by financial institutions plunged as everyone tried to sell\nwhatever they could to raise cash. Even the most solid institutions feared for their lives.\nSuch a breakdown of the financial system had the direst implications for the broader\neconomy, threatening to choke off credit to households and Main Street businesses. For\n\n3\n\n\fCongress, the Fed, the Treasury Department, and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, it\nwas a signal to take emergency steps to keep credit flowing to the economy. Congress approved\nthe TARP program and it was quickly used to provide capital to banks. And the Fed created\nnever-before-seen programs to stabilize money market mutual funds and the short-term\ncommercial paper market. In addition, the Fed and Treasury jointly intervened to support\nimportant institutions whose collapse was judged to threaten the entire financial system.\nI am not going to go into detail about the alphabet soup of Fed programs created during\nthis period. But I want to stress that these policies—in some cases improvised in very short\norder—did succeed in averting a full-blown meltdown. The panic of 2008 subsided.\nIncreasingly, banks and corporations have been able to raise funds on reasonable terms.\nConfidence in the financial system is slowly returning.\nStill, our brush with financial collapse came at great cost. As financial institutions\nstruggled to survive, they cut back on lending. And private securitization markets seized up\nentirely. These are markets in which a variety of types of loans, including auto, student, credit\ncard, Small Business Administration, jumbo mortgage, and commercial real estate loans, are\npackaged as securities and sold to investors. The resulting massive credit crunch caused the\neconomy to nosedive in the final quarter of last year and the first quarter of this year. Job losses\nreached more than 700,000 per month and the unemployment rate skyrocketed to levels not seen\nsince the early 1980s, reaching 9.4 percent in May. Some 6 million jobs vaporized during the\nrecession. Each of these was once held by a real human being, who likely depended on that\npaycheck to pay the mortgage, buy the groceries, and put gas in the car. The loss of these jobs is\nan immense tragedy. We should never forget that this awful recession is a flesh-and-blood thing\nthat robs our families, neighbors, and friends of their livelihood.\n4\n\n\fEarlier I described some of the emergency measures the Fed has taken to prop up the\nfinancial system. Now I’d like to talk about the policies we’ve adopted to fight the recession\ndirectly. Our policymaking body is called the Federal Open Market Committee, or FOMC. It\nconsists of the presidents of the Fed’s regional banks, like me, plus the governors of the Federal\nReserve Board in Washington, including Chairman Ben Bernanke. Traditionally, our main\nmonetary policy tool is the federal funds rate, which is what banks charge each other for\novernight loans. We control this rate by pumping cash into the banking system or withdrawing\nit. This is a powerful tool because the interest banks pay to borrow determines what they charge\nfor loans and ultimately works its way through to the rates businesses and households pay for\ncredit. This December, we cut the federal funds rate essentially to zero—an extraordinary step\non its own—and we’ve said repeatedly that low rates would likely be warranted “for an extended\nperiod.” As a result, many other interest rates in the economy are at very low levels. Other\nmajor central banks have taken similar steps.\nStill, given the depth of the crisis we’ve faced, a near-zero federal funds rate hasn’t been\nenough to turn the economy around. So we’ve developed a variety of alternative ways to\nstimulate the economy. For example, we’ve become a major buyer of securities issued by the\ngiant mortgage companies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, a move that has helped push\nconforming mortgage interest rates to near-record low levels—a support to the housing sector,\nwhich is under tremendous duress. In addition, the FOMC launched a program to purchase large\nquantities of longer-term Treasury debt, to help bring down corporate bond and other rates that\nare linked to Treasury yields. In total, the FOMC has committed up to $1.75 trillion—that is,\ntrillion with a “T”—for these asset purchases by the end of this year.\n\n5\n\n\fThe Fed and other government bodies have also worked hard to put our banking sector on\na more secure footing. The recent stress tests of the 19 largest U.S. banks provided a thorough\nevaluation of their financial health and capital needs. Since these tests, many banks have raised\ncapital or issued debt without FDIC guarantees—a very encouraging sign.\nIn addition, the Fed and Treasury Department jointly developed the Term Asset-Backed\nSecurities Loan Facility, or TALF, program to help revive vital securitization markets.\nSecuritization is one of the great financial innovations of the last generation, greatly expanding\nthe market for these loans and reducing their cost compared with the days when banks and other\nfront-line lenders had to keep such credits in their own portfolios. There’s no question that\nsecuritization of certain types of loans like subprime mortgages contributed to the crisis. But we\nmust not throw out the baby with the bath water. Securitization markets will continue to play a\nmajor role in our financial system. As I mentioned, in the midst of the financial storm late last\nyear, these markets froze up entirely, with the exception of the market for mortgage-backed\nsecurities issued by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. That made it tough, if not impossible, for\nordinary people to borrow to buy a car, pay college tuition, or finance a business. Restoring\nsecuritization markets to health is one of the key challenges we face. Our TALF program got off\nto a slow start, but is now clearly helping to bring rates down and increase the issuance of a wide\nrange of securitized loan products.\nWe now come to the present—the third act—in which the economy hopefully recovers.\nRight now, we’re like a patient in intensive care whose condition has stabilized and whose fever\nis just starting to come down. We’re just completing the sixth quarter of recession, but the pace\nof decline has slowed markedly. The news during the past few months has been encouraging.\nEven though house prices are continuing to fall in most markets, housing sales and new\n6\n\n\fconstruction appear to have stabilized. Consumers have recovered some spirit and their spending\nhas also stabilized, thanks in part to government stimulus programs. Payrolls are still shrinking\nat an awful pace, but the momentum of job losses has slowed considerably in the past two\nmonths.\nFinancial markets are in much better shape today than we ever would have dreamed six\nmonths ago. Investors have gone from disregarding risk, to being paralyzed by it, to once again\nbeing willing to take on a reasonable bit. The stock market has rallied and investor appetite for\ncorporate bonds and other assets has rebounded, restoring access to capital for healthy\ncompanies. Even so, I am concerned that mortgage rates, which have risen of late, could place a\ndrag on a still very sick housing market, potentially driving home prices still lower and pushing\nmore borrowers into foreclosure. The recent run-up in oil prices may also reflect greater\nconfidence in the global outlook. But it too is troublesome because it impedes recovery by\nforcing consumers and businesses to pay more for gas and energy, thereby reducing their ability\nto buy other goods and services.\nStill, I expect the recession will end sometime later this year. That would make it the\nlongest and probably deepest downturn since the Great Depression. Growth will come from a\nvariety of sources. One is federal government spending resulting from the stimulus program\npassed by Congress earlier this year. This package provides tax cuts that leave more cash in\nconsumers’ pockets, as well as direct government spending increases that add to payrolls and\nboost economic output. But it will take more than fiscal policy to really get the economy moving\nforward.\n\n7\n\n\fFortunately, some sectors are poised to rebound. For example, the auto industry has cut\nback production so far that inventories have begun to shrink—even in the face of historically\nweak demand for motor vehicles. As the economy stabilizes, just slowing the pace of this\ninventory shrinkage will boost gross domestic product, or GDP, which is the nation’s total output\nof goods and services. This story holds through broad sectors of the economy, where cautious\nconsumers and businesses have cut back on purchases of durable goods, such as computers and\nappliances. Eventually, old and broken-down goods will need to be replaced, and the resulting\ndemand will add to economic growth.\nThe housing sector too will eventually rise from the ashes. Home construction has fallen\ndramatically over the past few years as the nation works off the massive overbuilding of the\nboom years. But, once this adjustment is complete, housing construction will need to increase\nsignificantly just to keep pace with the growth in the number of households. Finally, the vicious\ncycle of tight credit and a weak economy can turn into a virtuous cycle. Once the economy starts\ngrowing and jobs and income are increasing, fewer borrowers will default and lenders will be\nwilling to increase the supply of credit.\nI don’t like taking the wind out of the sails of our economic expansion, but a few\ncautionary points should be considered. I expect the pace of the recovery will be frustratingly\nslow. It’s often the case that growth in the first year after a recession is very rapid. That’s what\nhappened as we came out of a very deep downturn in the early 1980s. Although I sincerely wish\nwe would repeat that performance, I don’t think we will. In past deep recessions, the Fed was\nable to step on the accelerator by cutting the federal funds rate sharply, causing the economy to\nshoot ahead. This time, we already have our foot planted firmly on the floor. We can’t take the\nfederal funds rate any lower than zero. I believe that the Fed’s novel programs are stimulating\n8\n\n\fthe flow of credit, but they simply aren’t as powerful levers as large rate cuts, so this time\nmonetary policy alone can’t power a rapid recovery.\nHistory also teaches us that it often takes a long time to recover from downturns caused\nby financial crises. 3 In particular, financial institutions and markets won’t heal overnight. Our\nF\n\nF\n\nmajor banks have made excellent progress in establishing the capital buffers needed to continue\nlending even through a downturn that is more serious than we anticipate. But they are still\nnursing their wounds and credit will remain tight for some time to come.\nI also think that a massive shift in consumer behavior is under way—one that will\nproduce great benefits in the long run but slow our recovery in the short term. 4 American\nF\n\nF\n\nhouseholds entered this recession stretched to the limit with mortgage and other debt. The\npersonal saving rate fell from around 8 percent of disposable income two decades ago to almost\nzero. Households financed their lifestyles by drawing on increasing stock market and housing\nwealth, and taking on higher levels of debt. But falling house and stock prices have destroyed\ntrillions of dollars in wealth, cutting off those ready sources of cash. What’s more, the stark\nrealities of this recession have scared many households straight, convincing them that they need\nto save larger fractions of their incomes. In the long run, higher saving promises to channel\nresources from consumption to investment, making capital more readily available to retool\nindustry and fix our infrastructure. But, in the here and now, such a rediscovery of thrift means\nfewer sales at the mall, and fewer jobs on assembly lines and store counters.\n\n3\n4\n\nSee Reinhart and Rogoff (2009) for evidence on this issue.\nSee Glick and Lansing (2009) for a discussion of household deleveraging.\n\n9\n\n\fA fourth factor that could slow recovery is the unprecedented global nature of the\nrecession. 5 Neither we nor our trading partners can count on a boost from strong foreign\nF\n\nF\n\ndemand. Finally, developments in the labor market suggest it could take several years to return\nto full employment. During this recession, an unusually high proportion of layoffs have been\npermanent as opposed to temporary, meaning workers won’t get called back when conditions\nimprove. Also, we’ve seen an unprecedented level of involuntary part-time work, such as state\nworkers on furlough a few days per month. Those workers are likely to return to full-time status\nbefore new workers are hired. To summarize, I expect that we will turn the growth corner\nsometime later this year, but I am not optimistic that the economy will spring back to normal\nanytime soon. What’s more, I expect the unemployment rate to remain painfully high for several\nmore years.\nThat’s a dreary prediction, but there is also some risk that things could turn out worse.\nHigh on my worry list is the possibility of another shock to the still-fragile financial system.\nCommercial real estate is a particular danger zone. Property prices are falling and vacancy rates\nare rising in many parts of the country. Given the weak economy, prices could fall more rapidly\nand developers could face tough times rolling over their loans. Many banks are heavily exposed\nto commercial real estate loans. An increase in defaults could add to their financial stress,\nprompting them to tighten credit. The Fed and Treasury are providing loans to investors in\nsecuritized commercial mortgages, which should be a big help. But a risk remains of a severe\nshakeout in this sector.\nLet me now turn to an issue that has lately garnered a great deal of attention—inflation.\nJust a short time ago, most economists were casting a wary eye on the risk of deflation—that is\n5\n\nSee IMF (2009) for a discussion of the global economic outlook.\n\n10\n\n\fthat prices might drop, perhaps falling into a downward spiral that would squeeze the life out of\nthe economy. Now, though, all I hear about is the danger of an outbreak of high inflation.\nI’ll put my cards on the table right away. I think the predominant risk is that inflation\nwill be too low, not too high, over the next several years. I take 2 percent as a reasonable\nbenchmark for the rate of inflation that is most compatible with the Fed’s dual mandate of price\nstability and maximum employment. This is also the figure that a majority of FOMC members\ncited as their long-run forecast for inflation, according to the minutes of the committee’s April\nmeeting.\nFirst of all, this very weak economy is, if anything, putting downward pressure on wages\nand prices. We have already seen a noticeable slowdown in wage growth and reports of wage\ncuts have become increasingly prevalent—a sign of the sacrifices that some workers are making\nto keep their employers afloat and preserve their jobs. Businesses are also cutting prices and\nprofit margins to boost sales. Core inflation—a measure that excludes volatile food and energy\nprices—has drifted down below 2 percent. With unemployment already substantial and likely to\nrise further, the downward pressure on wages and prices should continue and could intensify.\nFor these reasons, I expect core inflation will dip to about 1 percent over the next year and\nremain below 2 percent for several years.\nIf the economy fails to recover soon, it is conceivable that this very low inflation could\nturn into outright deflation. Worse still, if deflation were to intensify, we could find ourselves in\na devastating spiral in which prices fall at an ever-faster pace and economic activity sinks more\nand more. But I don’t view this as likely. The vigorous policy actions of the Fed and other\ncentral banks, combined with sizable fiscal stimulus here and abroad, have sent a clear message\n\n11\n\n\fthat deflation won’t be tolerated. Based on measures of inflation expectations, the public appears\nconfident that the Fed will adopt policies that will maintain a low, positive rate of inflation.\nEvidently, the credibility that the Fed and other central banks have built over the past few\ndecades in bringing inflation down has spilled over into a belief that we won’t allow inflation to\nget too low either. This does not mean that a short episode of deflation couldn’t occur, but it\nmakes a prolonged and devastating deflationary spiral less likely.\nNone of what I just said will satisfy those who worry about inflation. Indeed, if you\nlisten to popular business news channels, you might hear a drumbeat of concern that the Fed\ncould let inflation get too high. Those who hold this view point to the rise in Treasury yields and\ncommodity prices this year as signs that runaway inflation is on the horizon. They muster three\narguments. The first is that the Fed has pumped up the money supply and expanded its balance\nsheet to fund its financial rescue programs, potentially igniting inflation. The second is that the\nFed runs the risk of repeating the errors of the 1970s by focusing on mistaken views of economic\nslack rather than rising prices. The third is that large fiscal budget deficits will create higher\ninflation. I take all of these concerns very seriously and will address each in turn.\nFirst, I’ll talk about the Fed’s balance sheet. As I discussed earlier, the Fed has taken a\nnumber of strong steps to avert a financial and economic meltdown, and to support the flow of\ncredit. These policies have caused the assets on the Fed’s balance sheet to more than double,\nfrom under $900 billion at the start of the recession to over $2 trillion now. This expansion is\nlargely financed by increases in bank reserves, that is, surplus cash that banks deposit with us.\nSome worry that the Fed’s balance sheet expansion is pumping money into the economy and will\nbe inflationary. But, as I will explain in a moment, we have the tools needed to tighten policy\nand head off future inflation. There is also some concern that the Fed could be trapped by\n12\n\n\fconflicting goals if, at some point, a growing economy requires a higher federal funds rate,\nbefore credit markets are fully healed. Finally, some worry that the Fed may lack the political\nwill to tighten policy when the time comes.\nI will be the first to say that it is always difficult to get monetary policy just right. But the\nFed’s analytical prowess is top-notch and our forecasting record is second to none. The FOMC\nis committed to price stability and has a solid track record in achieving it. With respect to our\ntool kit, we certainly have the means to unwind the stimulus when the time is right. Many of the\nspecial programs we developed to provide emergency credit to the financial system are already\ntapering off as market conditions improve. Many of the assets that we have accumulated during\nthe crisis, such as Treasury and mortgage-backed agency securities, have ready markets. And\nthe Fed can push up the federal funds rate by raising the rate of interest that we pay to banks on\nthe reserve balances they have on deposit with us—authority that was granted to us by Congress\nlast year. An increase in the interest rate on reserves will induce banks to lend money to us\nrather than to other banks and borrowers, thereby pushing up the federal funds rate and other\nrates charged to private borrowers throughout the economy. The ability to pay interest on\nreserves is an important tool because, as I mentioned, it’s conceivable that, even if the economy\nrebounds nicely, the credit crunch might not be fully behind us and some financial markets might\nstill need Fed support. This tool will enable us to tighten credit conditions even though our\nbalance sheet wouldn’t shrink.\nLet me turn to the second concern, that we could have a rerun of the stagflation of the\n1970s. Some economists have argued that the Fed misjudged how low the unemployment rate\ncould go without igniting inflation and, as a result, lowered the federal funds rate too far for too\n\n13\n\n\flong, an overly accommodative stance that contributed to runaway prices. 6 This is an issue we\nF\n\nF\n\nhave studied in great depth, looking at a wide range of data sources and using a variety of\ntechniques to estimate slack in labor and product markets. Not surprisingly, these estimates\nvary. But they all plainly show that labor and product markets are currently operating well\nbelow the levels that would trigger inflation. We must beware of overconfidence that we have\ntoo precise a handle on these questions. But, to me, the evidence is clear that the economy has\nsubstantial slack and we are far from the kinds of unemployment rates that would make inflation\na danger.\nThe third concern is that big federal budget deficits might eventually be inflationary. In\nmy years of teaching at Berkeley, I regularly lectured on the relationship between fiscal deficits\nand inflation. A glance at history shows that many countries with massive structural deficits and\nwithout an independent central bank turned to the printing press to pay off their debts. That’s a\nrecipe for high inflation and, in some cases, hyperinflation.\nBut I don’t believe the United States faces that threat. Looking back in history, runaway\nfiscal deficits have often been accompanied by high inflation. 7 But, since World War II, such a\nF\n\nF\n\nrelationship has only held in developing countries. 8 In countries with advanced financial\nF\n\nF\n\nsystems and histories of low inflation, no such connection is found.\nSo where exactly do the dangers with fiscal deficits lie? To answer that question, it’s\nimportant to distinguish between cyclical deficits and long-run or structural deficits. The recent\nsharp rise in the federal deficit in large part stems from the government’s appropriate response to\n\n6\n\nSee, for example, Orphanides (2002).\nSee Sargent (1982) for a discussion of the fiscal sources of high inflation.\n8\nSee Fischer et al. (2002) and Catao and Terrones (2005) for analysis of the relationship between deficits and\ninflation in the post-World War II period.\n7\n\n14\n\n\fa severe recession and financial crisis. These near-term cyclical deficits vastly overstate the\nproblem of ongoing structural deficits. But the United States does have a large structural budget\ndeficit, and it will remain when the economy finally recovers. To a great extent, the structural\nbudget gap reflects demographic shifts resulting in an aging population coupled with a chronic\nescalation in health-care costs. The issue of rising entitlement and health-care spending is not\nnew. In fact, I spent many of my waking hours grappling with these problems a decade ago\nwhen I chaired the Council of Economic Advisers in the Clinton administration.\nIt is essential that we come to grips with structural budget deficits, but not because such\ndeficits will cause inflation. It’s because large, sustained structural deficits vacuum up savings\nthat could be put to more productive uses. Once the economy is back on track, these deficits will\nmake capital more expensive for private borrowers, crowding out the investments that are\nessential to boost productivity and fuel growth in real wages and living standards.\nConsider the case of the large deficits in the United States in the 1980s. We did not see a\nrun-up in inflation then. On the contrary, the deficits soared just as inflation was coming down.\nThose deficits did, however, contribute to higher interest rates, which made education and\ninvestment more expensive. Japan provides another example. Japan has run very large fiscal\ndeficits through much of the past two decades, yet its problem is persistent deflation—precisely\nthe opposite of inflation.\nFinally, there’s the matter of whether the Fed’s resolve is firm enough to tighten policy\nwhen the time comes to do so. Let me be unequivocal. The Fed is committed to doing\neverything in its power to foster recovery while maintaining price stability. When it’s necessary\nto withdraw the extraordinary stimulus we have put in place, we won’t hesitate. The Fed was\n\n15\n\n\fcreated as a politically independent central bank, and that tradition is deeply embedded in our\nculture and practice. We have worked closely with the Treasury and other agencies during this\ncrisis, and it was appropriate to do so. But, in our conduct of monetary policy, we are guided\nsolely by our statutory mandates of maximum employment and price stability. In March, the\nTreasury Department and the Fed signed an accord reaffirming our independence in setting\nmonetary policy.\nIn sum, although I take these concerns about inflation seriously, I do not believe that\nthere is a real threat of high inflation in the current situation. Monetary policy fosters inflation\nwhen it loosens financial conditions enough to create excess demand for goods and services.\nWhat could be clearer than the fact that right now we need more demand—not less—to offset the\nslack in labor and product markets?\nIf anything, I’m more concerned that we will be tempted to tighten policy too soon,\nthereby aborting recovery. That’s just what happened in 1936 when, following two years of\nrobust recovery, the Fed tightened policy because it was worried about large quantities of excess\nreserves in the banking system. The result? In 1937, the economy plunged back into a deep\nrecession. 9 Japan too learned that hard lesson in the 1990s, when both monetary and fiscal\nF\n\nF\n\npolicies were tightened in the mistaken belief that the economy was rebounding.\nThese episodes teach us a valuable lesson that we should heed in the present situation.\nLet this not be another 1937, but a time when policymakers have the wisdom and patience to\nnurse the economy back to health. And, when the economy does come back, let it be built on a\nfoundation of sound private investment and sustainable public policies. Only then can we be\n9\n\nSee Friedman and Schwartz (1963), Romer (1992), and Orphanides (2004) for analysis of the events of 1936 and\n1937. See Ahearne et al.

        "content": "Panel discussion for the Federal Reserve Board/Journal of Money, Credit, and Banking (JMCB)\nconference on “Financial Markets and Monetary Policy”\nWashington D.C.\nBy Janet L. Yellen, President and CEO, Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco\nFor delivery on Friday, June 5, 2009 at 2:15 PM Eastern time, 11:15 AM Pacific\nClosing Panel Presentation\nI’m delighted to have this opportunity to help wrap up what has been a fascinating and timely\nmacro-finance research conference. Cataclysmic events, like the current economic and financial crisis,\noften fundamentally alter the focus—and even the paradigm—for economic research and for monetary\npolicymaking. The Keynesian paradigm, with its activist policy prescriptions, grew out of the pain and\nsuffering of the Great Depression, which dealt a blow to the classical view that markets readily\nequilibrate. The Great Inflation of the 1970s, in turn, exposed inadequacies in the substance and\nmethodology of Keynesian macroeconometric modeling, and helped usher in the real business cycle\nresearch program with its prescription that monetary policy should leave the economy to its own devices\nand focus mainly on keeping inflation low and stable. Just a decade later, the Great Disinflation of the\nearly 1980s reminded us that monetary policy has real consequences, and a New Keynesian synthesis\nfocused policy on both full employment and price stability, as approximately described by a Taylor rule.\nDuring the relatively stable Great Moderation, the quintessence of that synthesis—namely, the DSGE\nmodel with nominal rigidities—ascended to the position of reigning macroeconomic orthodoxy. But few\nthings are permanent in our world. The current financial crisis raises questions about the relevance and\nusefulness of this paradigm too. I’d like to focus today on three of these questions.\n\nThe monetary policy transmission mechanism\nThe first has to do with the transmission mechanism of monetary policy. In most models used for\nmonetary policy analysis today, “optimal” policies can be designed for pursuing full employment, and\nlow and stable inflation. While these models allow for various real and nominal rigidities, they treat\n1\n\n\ffinancial markets as frictionless and efficient. As a consequence, monetary policy affects the economy\nthrough a single tool—a short-term interest rate—that transmits itself across credit, equity, derivatives,\nand foreign exchange markets through arbitrage.\nBut, the hand we have been dealt today doesn’t look anything like the textbook ideal that I just\ndescribed. Instead, we are experiencing pervasive financial market failures with devastating\nmacroeconomic effects. The normal monetary transmission mechanism has been hobbled by\ndysfunctional money and credit markets. Risk spreads have ballooned on supposedly safe assets like\nagency debt and mortgage-backed securities (MBS). What does optimal monetary policy look like in this\nsituation? How do we gauge the effectiveness of policy actions, and how can we implement and\ncommunicate systematic policy responses under these conditions?\nThis question of how to conduct monetary policy when financial markets aren’t working well is\nillustrated by our large-scale asset purchase program. With the funds rate pinned near zero and spreads\non mortgages over Treasuries very elevated, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) embarked on\na program of purchases of agency-insured MBS, agency debt, and longer-term Treasury debt totaling\n$1.75 trillion. This program’s goal is to bring down private borrowing rates and thereby stimulate the\neconomy. In the ideal world of frictionless financial markets, such actions would be ineffective because\nprivate investors would simply readjust their portfolios to accommodate changes in the Fed’s portfolio.\nBut, in a world where financial markets are impaired, such balance sheet policies may influence asset\nprices and the economy.\nA market test of these policies came on March 18 when the FOMC’s announcement of an\nexpansion of these purchases was met with an immediate and sharp decline in interest rates on both\nTreasury securities and agency-backed MBS. Rates on corporate bonds and mortgages came down as\nwell. Similar effects on interest rates were felt in the United Kingdom after the Bank of England\nannounced a program to buy long-term government debt there. Despite these initial successes, there is\n\n2\n\n\fstill a lot we don’t know about the magnitude and duration of the effects of these policies. Our standard\nmonetary policy models do not incorporate financial frictions that lead to asset purchases having real\neffects. We lack both the data and theory to provide strong guidance on these policies. Truly, we are\nsailing in uncharted waters, marking our maps with every bit of information along the way.\nAsset price bubbles and monetary policy\nMy second point concerns asset prices. The role of the house price bubble in precipitating the\ncurrent financial crisis places new urgency on a long-standing question: Should central banks attempt to\ndeflate asset price bubbles before they grow large enough to cause big problems? Until recently, most\ncentral bankers would have said monetary policy should respond to an asset price only to the extent that it\nwill affect the future path of output and inflation. In essence, if you believe that financial markets work\nwell most of the time, then you would be highly reluctant to target asset prices, let alone pop asset price\nbubbles. But, as I have discussed, we have vivid proof that markets sometimes don’t work, and that the\nunwinding of a bubble can dramatically harm economic performance and threaten financial stability.\nFour main issues define this debate, and the current crisis bears on each of them. 1 First, some\nquestion whether bubbles even exist. They argue that asset prices reflect the collective wisdom of traders\nin organized markets who best understand the fundamental factors underlying asset prices. It seems to me\nthat this argument is difficult to defend in light of the poor decisions and widespread dysfunction we have\nseen in many markets during the current turmoil.\nSecond, it’s an open question whether policymakers can identify bubbles in time to act effectively\ngiven that our models of underlying fundamentals are imprecise. For example, fundamental values of\n\n1\n\nGlenn D. Rudebusch, “Monetary Policy and Asset Price Bubbles,” FRBSF Economic Letter 2005-18, August 5,\n2005. http://www.frbsf.org/publications/economics/letter/2005/el2005-18.html\n\n3\n\n\fhousing often are estimated by comparing the ratio of house prices to rents with a long-run average. 2\nThis is a rather crude method, and some experts doubted that a bubble existed even when this ratio\nreached record highs in 2006. That said, by 2005 I think most people understood that—at a minimum—\nthere was a substantial risk that houses were overvalued, although few anticipated that house prices would\nfall as sharply as they have. 3\nThird, even if we can identify bubbles as they happen, using monetary policy to address them will\nreduce our ability to attain other goals, so it makes sense for monetary policy to intervene only if the\nfallout is likely to be quite severe and difficult to deal with after the fact. For example, fluctuations in\nequity prices generally affect wealth and consumer demand quite gradually. A central bank may prefer to\nadjust short-term interest rates after the bubble bursts to counter the depressing effects on demand. The\ntech stock bubble seems to fit this mold. Still, some bursting bubbles are more virulent than others. It\nmay be that credit booms, such as the one that spurred recent house price and bond price increases, hold\nmore dangerous systemic risks than other asset bubbles. By their nature, credit booms are especially\nprone to generating powerful adverse feedback loops between financial markets and real economic\nactivity. 4 If all asset bubbles are not created equal, policymakers could decide to intervene in those cases\nthat seem especially dangerous.\nFourth, if a dangerous asset price bubble is detected and action to rein it in is warranted, is\nconventional monetary policy the best tool to use? Going forward, I am hopeful that capital standards and\nother tools of macroprudential supervision will be deployed to modulate destructive boom-bust cycles,\n\n2\n\nJoshua Gallin, “The Long-Run Relationship between House Prices and Rents,” Finance and Economics Discussion\nSeries 2004-50, Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Washington, D.C.

In the current episode,\nhigher short-term interest rates probably would have restrained the demand for housing by raising\nmortgage interest rates, and this might have slowed the pace of house price increases. In addition, tighter\nmonetary policy may be associated with reduced leverage and slower credit growth, especially in\nsecuritized markets. 6 Thus, monetary policy that leans against bubble expansion may also enhance\nfinancial stability by slowing credit booms and lowering overall leverage.\nCertainly there are pitfalls to trying to deflate bubbles. At the same time, policymakers often\nmust act on the basis of incomplete knowledge, and it is now patently obvious that not dealing with some\nbubbles can have grave consequences. I would not advocate making it a regular practice to lean against\nasset price bubbles. But, in my view, recent painful experience strengthens the case for using such\npolicies, especially when a credit boom is the driving factor.\nThe inflation objective and the zero bound\nFinally, I will turn to the question of the appropriate long-run inflation objective—that is, the rate\nthat best promotes the dual goals of maximum sustainable employment and price stability. This is a topic\n\n5\n\nThere is now widespread agreement among policymakers and in Congress on the need to overhaul our supervisory\nand regulatory system, and broad agreement on the basic elements of reform.

In the past, I had spoken in favor of a 1½ percent rate of PCE price inflation. In\nmy view, though, recent events provide reason to reexamine this critical subject.\nThe choice of an appropriate inflation objective depends on an evaluation of the costs and\nbenefits of very low inflation. The financial crisis and global recession have not qualitatively changed\nthese costs and benefits, but they may affect their quantitative evaluation, which in turn might influence\nhow policymakers view their inflation objectives. The benefits of low and stable inflation are abundantly\nclear to this audience and have not changed in any material way because of the recession. On the cost\nside, the zero lower bound on nominal interest rates is a critical concern. Japan’s experience with\ndeflation starting in the 1990s generated a large body of research on monetary policy strategy that takes\naccount of the zero lower bound. 7 Researchers emphasize the benefits of aggressively cutting rates when\nthe prospect of reaching the zero bound emerges, and of using clear communication about the central\nbank’s future policy intentions and its long-run inflation goals. The FOMC took this research to heart\nduring the deflation scare of the early 2000s and the current crisis.\nOne conclusion of the research is that, even if monetary policy acts appropriately, an inflation\nobjective of 1 percent or lower entails some costs in terms of stabilizing output, but the impact on average\nmacroeconomic performance at higher inflation objectives is minimal. 8 However, I have not found the\nexperience of the past several years at all reassuring on this point. We have had two deflation scares and\na severe global recession in a span of seven years, with several major central banks now confronting the\nzero bound. Of course, this may simply reflect very bad luck that is unlikely to be repeated. But, a\nnumber of considerations make me hesitant to endorse this view. Indeed, concern about the ability of the\n\n7\n\nFor example, see the special conference volume, “Monetary Policy in a Low-Inflation Environment,” in the\nJournal of Money, Credit, and Banking 32(4, part 2), November 2000.\n\n8\n\nSee David Reifschneider and John C. Williams, “Three Lessons for Monetary Policy in a Low Inflation Era,”\nJournal of Money, Credit, and Banking, November 2000, and Guenter Coenen, Athanasios Orphanides, and Volker\nWieland, “Price Stability and Monetary Policy Effectiveness when Nominal Interest Rates are Bounded at Zero,”\nAdvances in Macroeconomics 4(1) 2004. http://www.bepress.com/bejm/advances/vol4/iss1/art1/\n\n6\n\n\fFed to support employment following large negative shocks may explain why most FOMC members now\njudge a PCE inflation rate of 2 percent to be most consistent with the Committee’s dual mandate.\nCalculations of the effects of the zero bound depend crucially on assumptions regarding the\nmagnitude of disturbances that hit the economy, the level of the natural rate of interest, and the behavior\nof the rest of the global economy. Recent experience raises the possibility that the Great Moderation is\nbehind us, so we must be prepared for substantial shocks. Thus, an analysis of the zero bound needs to\nincorporate greater volatility than experienced over the past quarter century. With respect to the\nequilibrium real interest rate, the global savings glut that helped restrain real interest rates may persist or\neven intensify after the recession is over, leaving us with only a small cushion against reaching the zero\nbound. And, the theory that the global economy was decoupled did not hold up in the current recession.\nThis has weakened the transmission of monetary policy by short-circuiting the exchange rate channel in\nany one country. When all other countries are in recession and cutting rates, it is harder to stabilize the\neconomy and avoid deflation.\nFinally, the Fed’s experience with nontraditional monetary policy tools cuts two ways in\nanalyzing the effectiveness of monetary policy near the zero bound. On the one hand, the apparent\nsuccess of the Fed’s longer-term asset purchases and broader credit easing programs in lowering\nborrowing costs and stimulating spending suggests that the zero bound problem may not be as costly as\npreviously thought. On the other hand, the deployment of these new policy tools comes with its own set\nof risks and costs. In particular, we do not yet have good estimates of the quantitative impact of such\ninterventions. In addition, the use of nonstandard monetary policy instruments necessarily brings with it\nthe uncertainty and risks of unintended consequences. For example, some observers worry that the\nballooning of the Fed’s balance sheet may raise inflation because the Fed may face political and technical\nchallenges when it tries to unwind these policies—especially if the recession ends before the need for\n\n7\n\n\fsupport of the financial markets fades. 9 While I have not found these arguments convincing so far, the\nrecent rise in Treasury rates, if it is reflective of such concerns, is disconcerting.\nClearly, the events and monetary policy dilemmas of the past two years have laid before us an\nurgent and compelling research agenda. We simply must understand better—and ultimately develop\nreliable models of—the extraordinary financial and macro linkages that produced the current crisis. In\naddition, we need to more fully evaluate the costs and benefits of nonstandard monetary policy actions.\nI’ll close with an encouraging note. As the papers at this conference attest, researchers in the academic\nand policy worlds are rising to the occasion. These are vitally important tasks and I’m glad to see so many\nof my colleagues rolling up their sleeves.\n\n9\n\nSee Jeffrey Lacker, “Government Lending and Monetary Policy,” remarks to the National Association for Business\nEconomics, 2009 Washington Economic Policy Conference, Alexandria, VA, March 2, 2009\n(http://www.richmondfed.org/press_room/speeches/president_jeff_lacker/2009/lacker_speech_20090302.cfm); and\nCharles I.

Yellen, President and CEO, Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco\nFor delivery on, May 6, 2009, 3:00 PM Pacific, (May 7, 2009, 8:00 AM local time, Sydney,\nAustralia)\nIssues Raised by the Credit Crunch and Global Recession 1\nIt is a great pleasure to speak to this audience of distinguished Australian business\neconomists. While you are having your breakfast, we here in San Francisco are more than half\nway through our business day, although that day is yesterday for you. My topic is the U.S.\neconomy—where we stand, where we’re going, and what the Federal Reserve and the federal\ngovernment are doing to restore growth. A few years ago, there was much talk of “decoupling,”\nmeaning that what happened in the United States didn’t matter so much to the rest of the world.\nNow—after we’ve seen the bursting of housing and credit bubbles in the United States trigger\nthe deepest worldwide recession since the Great Depression—we know that theory was wrong.\nThe state of the U.S. economy matters very much in Singapore, Santiago and, of course, in\nSydney.\n\nI think the most useful thing I can do today is to give you my views on the current\neconomic situation and then examine some key issues that will shape the course of the economy\nas we try to dig out from a very deep hole. The story I’m going to tell involves many\ncrosscurrents and uncertainties. This murky picture may actually be good news. I’ve spent the\nlast year or so being so downbeat that I could actually see the faces in my audiences sink as I\nspoke. The fact that I can now talk about crosscurrents may mean that the economy is reaching\nan inflection point. It’s too soon for me to be convinced of that, and I see a lot of downside risk,\nbut at least there is some basis for optimism. That said, I expect the recovery, whenever it does\n1\n\nI would like to thank John Judd and Sam Zuckerman for assistance in preparing these remarks.\n1\n\n\fbegin, to be quite gradual compared with those following previous deep recessions. As always,\nmy comments represent my own views and not necessarily those of my colleagues in the Federal\nReserve System.\n\nThe recession is now in its sixth quarter and it’s shaping up as the most severe downturn\nsince the Great Depression. Last week we found out that real GDP contracted at an annual rate\nof slightly more than 6 percent in the first quarter, according to the Commerce Department’s\nadvance estimate. That is about the same pace of decline registered in the final quarter of last\nyear. These are the largest consecutive declines in real GDP since 1958. The recession is also\nvery broad-based. Housing, business fixed investment, exports, and imports are all falling at\neye-popping rates—down more than 30 percent each. The one sector that held up surprisingly\nwell in the first quarter is the largest—consumer spending—which rose by a respectable 2¼\npercent.\n\nWhether this is a harbinger of good things to come is uncertain, in part because, after\nadjusting for inflation, consumption slowed over the months of the quarter and declined\nabsolutely in March. Still, it does offer a glimmer of hope. In addition, business inventories fell\nby a very large amount in the first quarter. That too is a positive signal. When spending\ncontracted last year, inventories ballooned relative to sales and firms have been struggling to\nbring them into better alignment. The first-quarter data suggest that the necessary inventory\ncorrection may be quite far along. Recent data also offer some hints of stabilization in the\nhousing sector. Home construction contracted sharply in the first quarter as a whole, but we saw\nsigns of improvement late in the period. In the past couple of months, home sales and housing\n\n2\n\n\fstarts have leveled off. Meanwhile, depending on the index, home prices have either increased\nslightly or fallen at a slower pace.\n\nWhile output is at least showing potential for improvement going forward, recent news\nfrom the labor market is still very weak. The unemployment rate has risen by 1.7 percentage\npoints over the past four months and, as bad as that is, I think it actually understates the true\nmagnitude of the labor market deterioration. For one thing, the incidence of permanent, as\nopposed to temporary, layoffs is unusually high compared with past downturns. In addition,\ninvoluntary part-time work has increased during this recession far more than we would expect\nrelative to the rise in unemployment. My business contacts tell me, and the data confirm, that the\nuse of furloughs is now widespread. The result is that nationally, we have seen a surge in parttime work for economic reasons occurring broadly across occupations. The underemployment\nrate, a broad measure that adds individuals working part time for economic reasons to the\nunemployed, now stands at 14¼ percent. This is a whopping 6½ percentage points higher than at\nthe start of the recession, nearly twice the increase in the standard unemployment rate.\n\nLooking forward, my personal forecast for output growth is similar to the Blue Chip\nconsensus. I believe the most likely scenario is that real GDP will advance at a low, but positive,\nrate in the second half of this year followed by trend-like growth in 2010. A forecast that the\neconomy will soon switch from contraction to expansion strikes some people as optimistic. But,\nit takes less than you might think for real GDP growth rates to turn positive. Positive growth\nbecomes likely if some of the economy’s weak sectors stop dragging down GDP going forward.\nResidential construction in particular has been declining for several years, subtracting about 1\npercentage point from real GDP growth. This spending can sink only so far, and, as I said,\n\n3\n\n\fwe’ve seen some tentative signs of stabilization recently. If housing starts level out, the sector\nwould no longer weigh down the economy and faster growth would ensue. Similarly, as I noted\nearlier, inventory liquidation has been unusually severe in recent months, especially in motor\nvehicles. A reduction in the pace of liquidation also would raise the GDP growth rate. Finally,\nif consumers become more confident—and there is evidence from surveys that they have\nrecently—pent-up demand actually could boost spending on autos, durable goods, and even\nhousing, providing some real “juice” to economic growth.\n\nOf course, monetary and fiscal policy are also sharply focused on promoting economic\nrecovery. On the monetary side, the Federal Reserve has pushed its traditional policy lever—the\nfederal funds rate—close to zero. And we haven’t stopped there. We have put in place an array\nof unconventional approaches to spur the flow of credit to households and businesses. These\ninclude measures to improve liquidity and financial market functioning, and facilities to support\nthe issuance of asset-backed securities. Moreover, we are undertaking large-scale purchases of\nTreasury and agency-related debt. These initiatives appear to be lowering longer-term interest\nrates and easing financial conditions more generally. Mortgage and other private borrowing\nrates have fallen, and, as those who’ve been bold enough to open their 401(k) statements again\nwill attest, stock prices have risen: they’re up around 35 percent from the lows reached in March.\nWe’ve also seen improvements in key measures of financial market functioning, such as spreads\nof Libor over the expected federal funds rate. On the fiscal side, the stimulus package passed by\nCongress in February will provide an important economic shot in the arm. While the program\ndoes not appear large enough to solve the economy’s problems on its own, the support it will\nprovide to aggregate demand is significant and helpful. We will likely begin seeing its effects on\nthe economy this quarter.\n4\n\n\fSo, to summarize, I am hopeful that the recession will end in the second half of this year\ndue to aggressive monetary and fiscal policies, and the operation of typical business cycle\nmechanisms, such as inventory dynamics. Unfortunately, this combination of ingredients is not a\nrecipe for a resounding rebound. My forecast that output growth will turn positive in 2009 and\nproceed near trend in 2010 implies that the unemployment rate will rise from 8½ percent now to\naround 9½ percent by the end of this year, and remain at about that level through 2010. An\nimplication is that inflation is likely to decline below the 2 percent pace that I and most of my\ncolleagues consider most consistent with our congressional mandate to strive for full\nemployment and price stability. Substantial slack in labor and product markets combined with\nlower commodity prices is already restraining overall price increases for goods and services. If,\nas seems likely, this downward pressure continues, core consumer inflation is apt to fall from\nabout 2 percent last year to around 1½ percent this year, and go even lower in 2010. I’ll have\nmore to say about inflation later.\n\nThe forecast I just described implies that I am not in the ranks of those who believe that\n“V” is the letter that will best describe the economy’s trajectory going forward. Those who\nanticipate a V-shaped recovery argue that growth in the first year after a business-cycle trough\nhas typically been very rapid in previous U.S. downturns, including the deep recession that\noccurred in 1981 and 82. My own forecast, in contrast, implies a far less robust recovery. In my\nview, the explanation for the V-shaped pattern typical of past recessions relates to monetary\npolicy. Most deep recessions in the postwar era happened after the Fed tightened policy to fight\ninflation. Once the inflation scare passed, the central bank was able to cut its policy rate sharply,\nand the economy snapped back. But, of course, the current recession is far different, having been\ntriggered by a historic housing bust, and a banking and financial crisis. Carmen Reinhart and\n5\n\n\fKen Rogoff have compared recessions around the world and shown that it takes a long time to\nrecover from downturns caused by financial crises. 2 And that is what I expect this time as well.\n\nI can point to a number of specific factors in this recession that are likely to weaken\nrecovery. First, despite signs that consumer spending is stabilizing, the chance of strong and\nsustained consumption growth appears low. For years prior to the recession, households went on\na spending spree of major proportions. This occurred during what has come to be called the\n“great moderation,” a period of about two decades when recessions were infrequent and mild,\nand inflation was low and stable. This may have lulled households into a false sense of security.\nThe personal saving rate fell from around 8 percent two decades ago to almost zero in recent\nyears as households financed their lifestyles by drawing on increasing stock market and housing\nwealth, and taking on higher levels of debt.\n\nNow, the era of such low saving may be over. Falling house and stock prices have\nvaporized trillions of dollars in household wealth. The destruction of their nest eggs is\nprompting households to rebuild savings. The deleveraging of household balance sheets could\nrestrain spending for years. Indeed, the personal saving rate is finally on the rise, averaging\nmore than 4 percent so far this year. It wouldn’t surprise me if this effect persists, as the shock\nof the financial crisis convinces many households that they need to save higher fractions of their\nincomes for the long term. Of course, ultimately this would be good for economic growth,\nchanneling resources from consumption to investment. That said, the transition could be painful\nif subpar consumption growth restrains the pace of economic recovery.\n\n2\n\nCarmen M. Reinhart and Kenneth S. Rogoff, “Is the 2007 Sub-Prime Financial Crisis So Different? An\nInternational Historical Comparison,” unpublished manuscript, February 5, 2008.\nhttp://www.economics.harvard.edu/files/faculty/51_Is_The_US_Subprime_Crisis_So_Different.pdf\n6\n\n\fMeanwhile, the story for banks and other financial firms is eerily similar. In the buildup\nto the recession, financial institutions, like consumers, became highly leveraged. Their\nvulnerability was compounded because they often invested in complex and risky assets that were\nfunded with short-term debt. Since the crisis hit, in an attempt to increase the soundness of their\nindividual balance sheets, banks have tightened lending standards, trying to improve credit\nquality at the same time that rising unemployment and falling house prices have led to more\ncredit losses. The attempts by banks to cut back the volume of their assets to reduce leverage\nand conserve capital, combined with a breakdown in the flow of lending through securitization,\nhas constricted the provision of credit in the economy. One important purpose of the stress tests,\nnow nearing completion by banking regulators, is to ensure that our largest banking\norganizations establish capital buffers that are large enough for them to withstand losses, while\ncontinuing to provide credit to households and businesses, even if the recession turns out to be\nsignificantly worse than currently anticipated. Such lending is critical to recovery.\n\nThe challenges facing monetary policy makers are another factor that makes a strong\nrecovery uncertain. With the federal funds rate essentially at zero, the Fed’s traditional policy\ntool has reached its maximum degree of accommodation. Many versions of the Taylor rule, a\nwell-known policy benchmark, indicate that we ought to lower the funds rate well below this\nzero bound, if such a thing were possible. As I noted, the Fed has turned to unconventional\npolicy tools. Through a variety of programs, the Fed has augmented the flow of credit to the\neconomy, provided a reliable source of liquidity to the financial system, and helped prevent the\nfailure of systemically important depository and nondepository institutions. Most of the action\nrecently has involved boosting credit flows through large-scale asset purchases. To support the\nhousing sector, the Fed announced last November that it would start buying agency-insured\n7\n\n\fmortgage-backed securities (MBS) and agency debt. In March, this program was expanded\nsubstantially. In addition, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) launched a new\nprogram to purchase large quantities of longer-term Treasury debt. These asset purchases have\nthe potential to stimulate aggregate demand through a number of channels, most obviously by\nreducing yields on securities included in the program. Indeed, when the FOMC announced in\nMarch that the Fed would expand these purchases, interest rates declined on both Treasury\nsecurities and agency-backed MBS. Still, even though these programs appear to be having a\nuseful effect, we have little experience with them and the magnitude of their impact is uncertain.\nIn other words, it is difficult to tell if unconventional monetary policies will be as effective in\npromoting recovery as easing the funds rate has been in the past.\n\nFinally, the global nature of the recession is likely to hold back the pace of our recovery.\nWe haven’t seen anything like this global downturn since the Great Depression. Virtually all\nadvanced economies and many emerging economies are in recession. Financial systems around\nthe globe are under stress, housing markets in some countries have collapsed, and trade has\nshriveled. The International Monetary Fund recently forecast that the global economy would\nrecover very gradually. This makes sense. As I said, recessions caused by financial crises are\ngenerally followed by more measured upswings. In addition, when recessions occur in many\nregions simultaneously, recoveries are slower than when downturns are confined to just a few\ncountries. 3 Now we have a double whammy—a highly synchronized global recession and a\nfinancial crisis. That’s a daunting combination.\n\n3\n\nInternational Monetary Fund, World Economic Outlook, April 2009.\nhttp://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/weo/2009/01/index.htm\n8\n\n\fFor all of these reasons—the need for balance sheet repair by households and financial\nfirms, uncertainties about unconventional monetary policy tools, and the global nature of the\nrecession—I expect the U.S. recovery to be frustratingly tepid once it does get started. It likely\nwill take several more years to bring unemployment back to its long-run equilibrium value.\n\nAs we think about the course of the economy, we must also be wary of developments that\ncould derail recovery. I see the economy as vulnerable to a number of downside risks, including\nthe possibility of another disruptive financial event—another “shoe” dropping, if you will.\nCommercial real estate is an area that seems vulnerable. Nonresidential construction declined\nsharply in the first quarter as business activity slowed; new buildings came on line; vacancy rates\non office, industrial, and retail space rose; and property values fell. For developers, financing is\nextremely hard to get. The market for commercial MBS has all but dried up and banks are\ntightening lending standards. Many developers will have trouble rolling over debt when it comes\ndue. Banks—especially community banks—are major lenders to this sector and are vulnerable\nto losses.\n\nWe must also keep an eye on developing nations, which face stark challenges as markets\nfor their products shrink and capital inflows dry up. Emerging market defaults could trigger\nfurther financial turmoil. The downturn in eastern Europe poses especially significant financial\nrisks to western European banks, whose exposure amounts to an estimated $1.5 trillion. With\nconfidence in the global financial system already fragile, these problems easily could spill over\nto the United States.\n\nAnother risk I’d like to discuss is inflation—or perhaps I should say deflation. This is an\nextraordinary time when you can hear a warning about inflation from one quarter and a dire\n9\n\n\fprediction of deflation from another quarter. I hear from both sides, though more often from\nthose worried about inflation. Concerns about an inflationary surge focus on the expansion of\nthe Fed’s balance sheet, which has increased from under $900 billion in mid-2007 to over $2\ntrillion now, largely financed by increases in bank reserves. The inflation worriers may be\nfocused on these excess reserves as a potential source of inflation down the road. Their fears are\ncompounded because federal budget deficits are ballooning. While I understand that the\ncombination of Fed expansion and big federal budget deficits might seem scary, I don’t see a\nsurge in inflation as very likely. Expansionary monetary policy creates inflation by loosening\nfinancial conditions enough to create excess demand for goods and services. That’s obviously\nnot the problem we face now. In spite of the Fed’s best efforts to enhance the flow of credit,\nfinancial conditions, while somewhat improved, overall remain abnormally tight. In our current\nrecession, we need more demand—not less—to offset the slack in labor and product markets.\n\nThat said, in theory there’s one way inflation could rise before the economy recovers\nfrom the recession: inflation expectations might increase because of fears that the Fed will not\nshift gears quickly enough when the recession and credit crunch are over. Some people have\nargued that the Fed might find it politically difficult to stop lending to the private sector\nborrowers it has supported during the crisis. 4 I don’t find this argument persuasive and I don’t\nsee evidence that the broad public finds it convincing either. The Fed has accumulated\n\n4\n\nJeffrey Lacker, “Government Lending and Monetary Policy,” remarks to the National Association for Business\nEconomics, 2009 Washington Economic Policy Conference, Alexandria, VA, March 2, 2009\n(http://www.richmondfed.org/press_room/speeches/president_jeff_lacker/2009/lacker_speech_20090302.cfm); and\nCharles I. Plosser, “Ensuring Sound Monetary Policy in the Aftermath of Crisis,” speech to the U.S. Monetary\nPolicy Forum, The Initiative on Global Markets, New York City, February 27, 2009\n(http://www.philadelphiafed.org/publications/speeches/plosser/2009/02-27-09_us-monetary-policy-forum.cfm).\n\n10\n\n\fconsiderable anti-inflation credibility over the past 25 years or so. 5 This credibility was evident\na few years ago when prices for energy, food, and other commodities soared to historically high\nlevels. While the direct effects of those price increases showed up in headline consumer\ninflation, very little was passed through to core inflation. Right now, there’s little evidence that\ninflation expectations have deteriorated. Market indicators and survey measures of longer-run\nexpectations have been quite stable.\n\nOf course, the inflation worriers are correct in an important respect: The Federal Reserve\nwill need to remove monetary accommodation once the credit crunch eases, private spending\nrevives, and the economy picks up steam. If the Fed were to fail to tighten the stance of\nmonetary policy quickly enough, we would see higher inflation. But I want to assure you that\nthe Fed is well aware of this danger and is readying the tools even now. Most importantly, the\nFed is committed to maintaining price stability and, when the time to remove accommodation\ncomes, we have a number of tools in our kit bag that could be quite effective.\n\nThe simplest approach—the one that we have used traditionally—would be to shrink our\nbalance sheet by selling the Treasuries, agency debt, and agency MBS we accumulated during\nthe crisis. Many of the special liquidity and credit facilities we have developed will be phased\nout as financial markets recover. But it is conceivable that, even with the economy rebounding\nnicely, the credit crunch might not be fully behind us and some financial markets might still need\nFed support. In this case, we could increase the interest rate we pay on bank reserves. This\nwould induce banks to remove funds from the federal funds market and lend them to us, thereby\nincreasing the federal funds rate and longer-term interest rates that are more relevant to private\n\n5\n\nJohn C. Williams, “Inflation Persistence in an Era of Well-Anchored Inflation Expectations,” FRBSF Economic\nLetter 2006-27 (October 13, 2006). http://www.frbsf.org/publications/economics/letter/2006/el2006-27.html\n11\n\n\fborrowers. Importantly, this approach provides us with the flexibility to tighten monetary policy\nin response to an improving macroeconomic picture without shrinking the size of our balance\nsheet or our support to financial markets. It is the main method employed by many central banks\nto influence financial conditions. An alternative approach that could accomplish the same goal,\nand perhaps do it better, would be something completely new for the Federal Reserve—that’s to\nissue interest-bearing debt broadly to private investors. Let’s call this debt Fed bills. Congress\nwould have to authorize this, but it too is a tool available to many central banks. The sale of Fed\nbills would reduce the reserves of the banking system, as in a typical contractionary open-market\noperation. As with interest on reserves, we could accomplish a tightening of policy while\nmaintaining our support of credit markets. But Fed bills would have an advantage over interest\non reserves. The loans to the Fed would come from investors throughout the economy, not just\nfrom banks. At a time when we need banks to lend to the private sector to fight a credit crunch,\nthis is a decided plus.\n\nAs you can tell, I’m quite skeptical about the risk of higher inflation. My thoughts about\nthe possibility of deflation are more complex. At first blush, there is cause for concern. We are\nstarting from a situation where core inflation is already a bit below 2 percent. The economy has\na great deal of slack and unemployment is likely to rise further, which would put more\ndownward pressure on wage growth and inflation. Indeed, we have already seen evidence that\nwages are rising less rapidly and there have been some outright wage cuts. Furthermore, as I\nnoted, with the funds rate at the zero bound, monetary policy has been forced to ease its stance\nthrough unconventional instruments that are hardly tried and true. If deflation were to occur with\nthe funds rate near zero, the effects could be severe. In the textbook case, with no way of\nlowering the nominal funds rate, real interest rates would rise as prices fell. That could drive the\n12\n\n\feconomy into a spiral of larger and larger price decreases, with economic activity sinking more\nand more.\n\nThe risk of such a deflationary spiral depends crucially on the nature of inflation\nexpectations. 6 If expectations are unanchored, meaning that people have variable expectations\ndepending on the recent behavior of inflation, then the lower inflation that’s characteristic of\nrecessions can convince them that inflation will go still lower in the future. If a recession is\nsevere and long enough, this process eventually will cause prices to fall, and then create a\ndownward spiral. But I don’t think this is a likely scenario in the United States. I believe that\ninflation expectations are well anchored, in the sense that people expect inflation to be consistent\nwith the Feds’ goals and policies. Based on measures of inflation expectations, people appear to\nthink we will take policy actions that will maintain a positive rate of inflation. This expectation\nacts as a buttress holding inflation up. This does not mean that a short episode of deflation\ncouldn’t occur, but it does help to avoid a prolonged deflationary spiral.\n\nTo reinforce our commitment to price stability, the FOMC recently began releasing longrun inflation forecasts based on the assumption of appropriate monetary policy. These figures,\nwhich indicate where FOMC members would like inflation to settle in the longer run, show, as I\nmentioned, a consensus of 2 percent for consumer inflation. 7 Such words, backed by appropriate\nactions, help keep inflation expectations well anchored and reduce the chances of a deflationary\nspiral. So, for me the bottom line is this: I see little basis to worry that we will develop an\n\n6\n\nJohn C.

There is more of a reason to think that we could experience some deflation,\nbut the chances of a severe bout of that ailment seem remote.\n\nYou may have gotten a case of whiplash hearing me say that, although conditions are\npoor, some hopeful signs are visible, but significant risks remain. Your necks may not have felt\nany better when I said that I hear worries about inflation and deflation at the same time.\nHowever, that’s the situation we find ourselves in now. The good news is that, for the first time\nin a while, there is some good news to savor. But, when it comes to assessing the future of the\neconomy, the dominant theme is uncertainty. The one thing that is sure is that policymakers\naround the globe are working hard to restore economic growth. As for the Federal Reserve, it\nremains fully committed to doing everything in its power to foster recovery while maintaining\nprice stability.\n\n14\n\n\f"

Yellen, President and CEO, Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco\nFor delivery on May 5, 2009, 7:30 PM Pacific time, 10:30 PM Eastern\nIssues Raised by the Credit Crunch and Global Recession 1\nI’m delighted to be with you at the Haas School and be hosted by my friend Rich Lyons.\nAs you know, this is a homecoming for me. I spent almost 25 rewarding years of my\nprofessional life as a faculty member here. And I will always think of the Haas and broader\nBerkeley communities with great fondness. Now, of course, I am with the Federal Reserve, and\nthat’s another institution that means a great deal to me because it’s a place where many of the\nideas and issues that were central to both my teaching and research here at Haas are translated\ninto real-world policy. The decisions we make at the Fed have taken on added significance with\nthe nation and most of the world going through a deep and worrisome recession, one that has\ncaused millions of people to lose their jobs or homes, and threatened or destroyed businesses\nlarge and small.\n\nI think the most useful thing I can do tonight is to give you my views on the current\neconomic situation and then examine some key issues that will shape the course of the economy\nas we try to dig out from a very deep hole. The story I’m going to tell involves many\ncrosscurrents and uncertainties. This murky picture may actually be good news. I’ve spent the\nlast year or so being so downbeat that I could actually see the faces in my audiences sink as I\nspoke. The fact that I can now talk about crosscurrents may mean that the economy is reaching\nan inflection point. It’s too soon for me to be convinced of that, and I see a lot of downside risk,\nbut at least there is some basis for optimism. That said, I expect the recovery, whenever it does\n1\n\nI would like to thank John Judd and Sam Zuckerman for assistance in preparing these remarks.\n1\n\n\fbegin, to be quite gradual compared with those following previous deep recessions. As always,\nmy comments represent my own views and not necessarily those of my colleagues in the Federal\nReserve System.\n\nThe recession is now in its sixth quarter and it’s shaping up as the most severe downturn\nsince the Great Depression. Last week we found out that real GDP contracted at an annual rate\nof slightly more than 6 percent in the first quarter, according to the Commerce Department’s\nadvance estimate. That is about the same pace of decline registered in the final quarter of last\nyear. These are the largest consecutive declines in real GDP since 1958. The recession is also\nvery broad-based. Housing, business fixed investment, exports, and imports are all falling at\neye-popping rates—down more than 30 percent each. The one sector that held up surprisingly\nwell in the first quarter is the largest—consumer spending—which rose by a respectable 2¼\npercent.\n\nWhether this is a harbinger of good things to come is uncertain, in part because, after\nadjusting for inflation, consumption slowed over the months of the quarter and declined\nabsolutely in March. Still, it does offer a glimmer of hope. In addition, business inventories fell\nby a very large amount in the first quarter. That too is a positive signal. When spending\ncontracted last year, inventories ballooned relative to sales and firms have been struggling to\nbring them into better alignment. The first-quarter data suggest that the necessary inventory\ncorrection may be quite far along. Recent data also offer some hints of stabilization in the\nhousing sector. Home construction contracted sharply in the first quarter as a whole, but we saw\nsigns of improvement late in the period. In the past couple of months, home sales and housing\n\n2\n\n\fstarts have leveled off. Meanwhile, depending on the index, home prices have either increased\nslightly or fallen at a slower pace.\n\nWhile output is at least showing potential for improvement going forward, recent news\nfrom the labor market is still very weak. The unemployment rate has risen by 1.7 percentage\npoints over the past four months and, as bad as that is, I think it actually understates the true\nmagnitude of the labor market deterioration. For one thing, the incidence of permanent, as\nopposed to temporary, layoffs is unusually high compared with past downturns. In addition,\ninvoluntary part-time work has increased during this recession far more than we would expect\nrelative to the rise in unemployment. My business contacts tell me, and the data confirm, that the\nuse of furloughs is now widespread. I know that they are under consideration here at Berkeley as\na way to address the budget crunch. The result is that nationally, we have seen a surge in parttime work for economic reasons occurring broadly across occupations. The underemployment\nrate, a broad measure that adds individuals working part time for economic reasons to the\nunemployed, now stands at 14¼ percent. This is a whopping 6½ percentage points higher than at\nthe start of the recession, nearly twice the increase in the standard unemployment rate.\n\nLooking forward, my personal forecast for output growth is similar to the Blue Chip\nconsensus. I believe the most likely scenario is that real GDP will advance at a low, but positive,\nrate in the second half of this year followed by trend-like growth in 2010. A forecast that the\neconomy will soon switch from contraction to expansion strikes some people as optimistic. But,\nit takes less than you might think for real GDP growth rates to turn positive. Positive growth\nbecomes likely if some of the economy’s weak sectors stop dragging down GDP going forward.\nResidential construction in particular has been declining for several years, subtracting about 1\n\n3\n\n\fpercentage point from real GDP growth. This spending can sink only so far, and, as I said,\nwe’ve seen some tentative signs of stabilization recently. If housing starts level out, the sector\nwould no longer weigh down the economy and faster growth would ensue. Similarly, as I noted\nearlier, inventory liquidation has been unusually severe in recent months, especially in motor\nvehicles. A reduction in the pace of liquidation also would raise the GDP growth rate. Finally,\nif consumers become more confident—and there is evidence from surveys that they have\nrecently—pent-up demand actually could boost spending on autos, durable goods, and even\nhousing, providing some real “juice” to economic growth.\n\nOf course, monetary and fiscal policy are also sharply focused on promoting economic\nrecovery. On the monetary side, the Federal Reserve has pushed its traditional policy lever—the\nfederal funds rate—close to zero. And we haven’t stopped there. We have put in place an array\nof unconventional approaches to spur the flow of credit to households and businesses. These\ninclude measures to improve liquidity and financial market functioning, and facilities to support\nthe issuance of asset-backed securities. Moreover, we are undertaking large-scale purchases of\nTreasury and agency-related debt. These initiatives appear to be lowering longer-term interest\nrates and easing financial conditions more generally. Mortgage and other private borrowing\nrates have fallen, and, as those who’ve been bold enough to open their 401(k) statements again\nwill attest, stock prices have risen: they’re up around 35 percent from the lows reached in March.\nWe’ve also seen improvements in key measures of financial market functioning, such as spreads\nof Libor over the expected federal funds rate. On the fiscal side, the stimulus package passed by\nCongress in February will provide an important economic shot in the arm. While the program\ndoes not appear large enough to solve the economy’s problems on its own, the support it will\n\n4\n\n\fprovide to aggregate demand is significant and helpful. We will likely begin seeing its effects on\nthe economy this quarter.\n\nSo, to summarize, I am hopeful that the recession will end in the second half of this year\ndue to aggressive monetary and fiscal policies, and the operation of typical business cycle\nmechanisms, such as inventory dynamics. Unfortunately, this combination of ingredients is not a\nrecipe for a resounding rebound. My forecast that output growth will turn positive in 2009 and\nproceed near trend in 2010 implies that the unemployment rate will rise from 8½ percent now to\naround 9½ percent by the end of this year, and remain at about that level through 2010. An\nimplication is that inflation is likely to decline below the 2 percent pace that I and most of my\ncolleagues consider most consistent with our congressional mandate to strive for full\nemployment and price stability. Substantial slack in labor and product markets combined with\nlower commodity prices is already restraining overall price increases for goods and services. If,\nas seems likely, this downward pressure continues, core consumer inflation is apt to fall from\nabout 2 percent last year to around 1½ percent this year, and go even lower in 2010. I’ll have\nmore to say about inflation later.\n\nThe forecast I just described implies that I am not in the ranks of those who believe that\n“V” is the letter that will best describe the economy’s trajectory going forward. Those who\nanticipate a V-shaped recovery argue that growth in the first year after a business-cycle trough\nhas typically been very rapid in previous U.S. downturns, including the deep recession that\noccurred in 1981 and 82. My own forecast, in contrast, implies a far less robust recovery. In my\nview, the explanation for the V-shaped pattern typical of past recessions relates to monetary\npolicy. Most deep recessions in the postwar era happened after the Fed tightened policy to fight\n\n5\n\n\finflation. Once the inflation scare passed, the central bank was able to cut its policy rate sharply,\nand the economy snapped back. But, of course, the current recession is far different, having been\ntriggered by a historic housing bust, and a banking and financial crisis. Carmen Reinhart and\nKen Rogoff have compared recessions around the world and shown that it takes a long time to\nrecover from downturns caused by financial crises. 2 And that is what I expect this time as well.\n\nI can point to a number of specific factors in this recession that are likely to weaken\nrecovery. First, despite signs that consumer spending is stabilizing, the chance of strong and\nsustained consumption growth appears low. For years prior to the recession, households went on\na spending spree of major proportions. This occurred during what has come to be called the\n“great moderation,” a period of about two decades when recessions were infrequent and mild,\nand inflation was low and stable. This may have lulled households into a false sense of security.\nThe personal saving rate fell from around 8 percent two decades ago to almost zero in recent\nyears as households financed their lifestyles by drawing on increasing stock market and housing\nwealth, and taking on higher levels of debt.\n\nNow, the era of such low saving may be over. Falling house and stock prices have\nvaporized trillions of dollars in household wealth. The destruction of their nest eggs is\nprompting households to rebuild savings. The deleveraging of household balance sheets could\nrestrain spending for years. Indeed, the personal saving rate is finally on the rise, averaging\nmore than 4 percent so far this year. It wouldn’t surprise me if this effect persists, as the shock\nof the financial crisis convinces many households that they need to save higher fractions of their\nincomes for the long term. Of course, ultimately this would be good for economic growth,\n2\n\nCarmen M. Reinhart and Kenneth S. Rogoff, “Is the 2007 Sub-Prime Financial Crisis So Different? An\nInternational Historical Comparison,” unpublished manuscript, February 5, 2008.\nhttp://www.economics.harvard.edu/files/faculty/51_Is_The_US_Subprime_Crisis_So_Different.pdf\n6\n\n\fchanneling resources from consumption to investment. That said, the transition could be painful\nif subpar consumption growth restrains the pace of economic recovery.\n\nMeanwhile, the story for banks and other financial firms is eerily similar. In the buildup\nto the recession, financial institutions, like consumers, became highly leveraged. Their\nvulnerability was compounded because they often invested in complex and risky assets that were\nfunded with short-term debt. Since the crisis hit, in an attempt to increase the soundness of their\nindividual balance sheets, banks have tightened lending standards, trying to improve credit\nquality at the same time that rising unemployment and falling house prices have led to more\ncredit losses. The attempts by banks to cut back the volume of their assets to reduce leverage\nand conserve capital, combined with a breakdown in the flow of lending through securitization,\nhas constricted the provision of credit in the economy. One important purpose of the stress tests,\nnow nearing completion by banking regulators, is to ensure that our largest banking\norganizations establish capital buffers that are large enough for them to withstand losses, while\ncontinuing to provide credit to households and businesses, even if the recession turns out to be\nsignificantly worse than currently anticipated. Such lending is critical to recovery.\n\nThe challenges facing monetary policy makers are another factor that makes a strong\nrecovery uncertain. With the federal funds rate essentially at zero, the Fed’s traditional policy\ntool has reached its maximum degree of accommodation. Many versions of the Taylor rule, a\nwell-known policy benchmark, indicate that we ought to lower the funds rate well below this\nzero bound, if such a thing were possible. As I noted, the Fed has turned to unconventional\npolicy tools. Through a variety of programs, the Fed has augmented the flow of credit to the\neconomy, provided a reliable source of liquidity to the financial system, and helped prevent the\n\n7\n\n\ffailure of systemically important depository and nondepository institutions. Most of the action\nrecently has involved boosting credit flows through large-scale asset purchases. To support the\nhousing sector, the Fed announced last November that it would start buying agency-insured\nmortgage-backed securities (MBS) and agency debt. In March, this program was expanded\nsubstantially. In addition, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) launched a new\nprogram to purchase large quantities of longer-term Treasury debt. These asset purchases have\nthe potential to stimulate aggregate demand through a number of channels, most obviously by\nreducing yields on securities included in the program. Indeed, when the FOMC announced in\nMarch that the Fed would expand these purchases, interest rates declined on both Treasury\nsecurities and agency-backed MBS. Still, even though these programs appear to be having a\nuseful effect, we have little experience with them and the magnitude of their impact is uncertain.\nIn other words, it is difficult to tell if unconventional monetary policies will be as effective in\npromoting recovery as easing the funds rate has been in the past.\n\nFinally, the global nature of the recession is likely to hold back the pace of our recovery.\nWe haven’t seen anything like this global downturn since the Great Depression. Virtually all\nadvanced economies and many emerging economies are in recession. Financial systems around\nthe globe are under stress, housing markets in some countries have collapsed, and trade has\nshriveled. The International Monetary Fund recently forecast that the global economy would\nrecover very gradually. This makes sense. As I said, recessions caused by financial crises are\ngenerally followed by more measured upswings. In addition, when recessions occur in many\nregions simultaneously, recoveries are slower than when downturns are confined to just a few\n\n8\n\n\fcountries. 3 Now we have a double whammy—a highly synchronized global recession and a\nfinancial crisis. That’s a daunting combination.\n\nFor all of these reasons—the need for balance sheet repair by households and financial\nfirms, uncertainties about unconventional monetary policy tools, and the global nature of the\nrecession—I expect the U.S. recovery to be frustratingly tepid once it does get started. It likely\nwill take several more years to bring unemployment back to its long-run equilibrium value.\n\nAs we think about the course of the economy, we must also be wary of developments that\ncould derail recovery. I see the economy as vulnerable to a number of downside risks, including\nthe possibility of another disruptive financial event—another “shoe” dropping, if you will.\nCommercial real estate is an area that seems vulnerable. Nonresidential construction declined\nsharply in the first quarter as business activity slowed; new buildings came on line; vacancy rates\non office, industrial, and retail space rose; and property values fell. For developers, financing is\nextremely hard to get. The market for commercial MBS has all but dried up and banks are\ntightening lending standards. Many developers will have trouble rolling over debt when it comes\ndue. Banks—especially community banks—are major lenders to this sector and are vulnerable\nto losses.\n\nWe must also keep an eye on developing nations, which face stark challenges as markets\nfor their products shrink and capital inflows dry up. Emerging market defaults could trigger\nfurther financial turmoil. The downturn in eastern Europe poses especially significant financial\nrisks to western European banks, whose exposure amounts to an estimated $1.5 trillion. With\n\n3\n\nInternational Monetary Fund, World Economic Outlook, April 2009.\nhttp://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/weo/2009/01/index.htm\n9\n\n\fconfidence in the global financial system already fragile, these problems easily could spill over\nto the United States.\n\nAnother risk I’d like to discuss is inflation—or perhaps I should say deflation. This is an\nextraordinary time when you can hear a warning about inflation from one quarter and a dire\nprediction of deflation from another quarter. I hear from both sides, though more often from\nthose worried about inflation. Concerns about an inflationary surge focus on the expansion of\nthe Fed’s balance sheet, which has increased from under $900 billion in mid-2007 to over $2\ntrillion now, largely financed by increases in bank reserves. The inflation worriers may be\nfocused on these excess reserves as a potential source of inflation down the road. Their fears are\ncompounded because federal budget deficits are ballooning. While I understand that the\ncombination of Fed expansion and big federal budget deficits might seem scary, I don’t see a\nsurge in inflation as very likely. Expansionary monetary policy creates inflation by loosening\nfinancial conditions enough to create excess demand for goods and services. That’s obviously\nnot the problem we face now. In spite of the Fed’s best efforts to enhance the flow of credit,\nfinancial conditions, while somewhat improved, overall remain abnormally tight. In our current\nrecession, we need more demand—not less—to offset the slack in labor and product markets.\n\nThat said, in theory there’s one way inflation could rise before the economy recovers\nfrom the recession: inflation expectations might increase because of fears that the Fed will not\nshift gears quickly enough when the recession and credit crunch are over. Some people have\nargued that the Fed might find it politically difficult to stop lending to the private sector\nborrowers it has supported during the crisis. 4 I don’t find this argument persuasive and I don’t\n\n4\n\nJeffrey Lacker, “Government Lending and Monetary Policy,” remarks to the National Association for Business\nEconomics, 2009 Washington Economic Policy Conference, Alexandria, VA, March 2, 2009\n10\n\n\fsee evidence that the broad public finds it convincing either. The Fed has accumulated\nconsiderable anti-inflation credibility over the past 25 years or so. 5 This credibility was evident\na few years ago when prices for energy, food, and other commodities soared to historically high\nlevels. While the direct effects of those price increases showed up in headline consumer\ninflation, very little was passed through to core inflation. Right now, there’s little evidence that\ninflation expectations have deteriorated. Market indicators and survey measures of longer-run\nexpectations have been quite stable.\n\nOf course, the inflation worriers are correct in an important respect: The Federal Reserve\nwill need to remove monetary accommodation once the credit crunch eases, private spending\nrevives, and the economy picks up steam. If the Fed were to fail to tighten the stance of\nmonetary policy quickly enough, we would see higher inflation. But I want to assure you that\nthe Fed is well aware of this danger and is readying the tools even now. Most importantly, the\nFed is committed to maintaining price stability and, when the time to remove accommodation\ncomes, we have a number of tools in our kit bag that could be quite effective.\n\nThe simplest approach—the one that we have used traditionally—would be to shrink our\nbalance sheet by selling the Treasuries, agency debt, and agency MBS we accumulated during\nthe crisis. Many of the special liquidity and credit facilities we have developed will be phased\nout as financial markets recover. But it is conceivable that, even with the economy rebounding\nnicely, the credit crunch might not be fully behind us and some financial markets might still need\n\n(http://www.richmondfed.org/press_room/speeches/president_jeff_lacker/2009/lacker_speech_20090302.cfm); and\nCharles I.

In this case, we could increase the interest rate we pay on bank reserves. This\nwould induce banks to remove funds from the federal funds market and lend them to us, thereby\nincreasing the federal funds rate and longer-term interest rates that are more relevant to private\nborrowers. Importantly, this approach provides us with the flexibility to tighten monetary policy\nin response to an improving macroeconomic picture without shrinking the size of our balance\nsheet or our support to financial markets. It is the main method employed by many central banks\nto influence financial conditions. An alternative approach that could accomplish the same goal,\nand perhaps do it better, would be something completely new for the Federal Reserve—that’s to\nissue interest-bearing debt broadly to private investors. Let’s call this debt Fed bills. Congress\nwould have to authorize this, but it too is a tool available to many central banks. The sale of Fed\nbills would reduce the reserves of the banking system, as in a typical contractionary open-market\noperation. As with interest on reserves, we could accomplish a tightening of policy while\nmaintaining our support of credit markets. But Fed bills would have an advantage over interest\non reserves. The loans to the Fed would come from investors throughout the economy, not just\nfrom banks. At a time when we need banks to lend to the private sector to fight a credit crunch,\nthis is a decided plus.\n\nAs you can tell, I’m quite skeptical about the risk of higher inflation. My thoughts about\nthe possibility of deflation are more complex. At first blush, there is cause for concern. We are\nstarting from a situation where core inflation is already a bit below 2 percent. The economy has\na great deal of slack and unemployment is likely to rise further, which would put more\ndownward pressure on wage growth and inflation. Indeed, we have already seen evidence that\nwages are rising less rapidly and there have been some outright wage cuts. Furthermore, as I\nnoted, with the funds rate at the zero bound, monetary policy has been forced to ease its stance\n12\n\n\fthrough unconventional instruments that are hardly tried and true. If deflation were to occur with\nthe funds rate near zero, the effects could be severe. In the textbook case, with no way of\nlowering the nominal funds rate, real interest rates would rise as prices fell. That could drive the\neconomy into a spiral of larger and larger price decreases, with economic activity sinking more\nand more.\n\nThe risk of such a deflationary spiral depends crucially on the nature of inflation\nexpectations. 6 If expectations are unanchored, meaning that people have variable expectations\ndepending on the recent behavior of inflation, then the lower inflation that’s characteristic of\nrecessions can convince them that inflation will go still lower in the future. If a recession is\nsevere and long enough, this process eventually will cause prices to fall, and then create a\ndownward spiral. But I don’t think this is a likely scenario in the United States. I believe that\ninflation expectations are well anchored, in the sense that people expect inflation to be consistent\nwith the Feds’ goals and policies. Based on measures of inflation expectations, people appear to\nthink we will take policy actions that will maintain a positive rate of inflation. This expectation\nacts as a buttress holding inflation up. This does not mean that a short episode of deflation\ncouldn’t occur, but it does help to avoid a prolonged deflationary spiral.\n\nTo reinforce our commitment to price stability, the FOMC recently began releasing longrun inflation forecasts based on the assumption of appropriate monetary policy. These figures,\nwhich indicate where FOMC members would like inflation to settle in the longer run, show, as I\nmentioned, a consensus of 2 percent for consumer inflation. 7 Such words, backed by appropriate\n\n6\n\nJohn C. Williams, “The Risk of Deflation,” FRBSF Economic Letter 2009-12 (March 27, 2009).\nhttp://www.frbsf.org/publications/economics/letter/2009/el2009-12.html\n7\n\nThe price index for personal consumption expenditures is used for this calculation.\n13\n\n\factions, help keep inflation expectations well anchored and reduce the chances of a deflationary\nspiral. So, for me the bottom line is this: I see little basis to worry that we will develop an\ninflation problem. There is more of a reason to think that we could experience some deflation,\nbut the chances of a severe bout of that ailment seem remote.\n\nYou may have gotten a case of whiplash hearing me say that, although conditions are\npoor, some hopeful signs are visible, but significant risks remain. Your necks may not have felt\nany better when I said that I hear worries about inflation and deflation at the same time.\nHowever, that’s the situation we find ourselves in now. The good news is that, for the first time\nin a while, there is some good news to savor. But, when it comes to assessing the future of the\neconomy, the dominant theme is uncertainty. The one thing that is sure is that policymakers\naround the globe are working hard to restore economic growth. As for the Federal Reserve, it\nremains fully committed to doing everything in its power to foster recovery while maintaining\nprice stability.\n\n14\n\n\f"

Minsky Conference on the State of the U.S. and\nWorld Economies—“Meeting the Challenges of the Financial Crisis”\nOrganized by the Levy Economics Institute of Bard College\nNew York City\nBy Janet L. Yellen, President and CEO, Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco\nFor delivery on April 16, 2009, 8:00 PM Eastern Time, 5:00 PM Pacific\n\nA Minsky Meltdown:\nLessons for Central Bankers 1\n\nIt’s a great pleasure to speak to this distinguished group at a conference named for\nHyman P. Minsky. My last talk here took place 13 years ago when I served on the Fed’s Board\nof Governors. My topic then was “The ‘New’ Science of Credit Risk Management at Financial\nInstitutions.” It described innovations that I expected to improve the measurement and\nmanagement of risk. My talk today is titled “A Minsky Meltdown: Lessons for Central\nBankers.” I won’t dwell on the irony of that. Suffice it to say that, with the financial world in\nturmoil, Minsky’s work has become required reading. It is getting the recognition it richly\ndeserves. The dramatic events of the past year and a half are a classic case of the kind of\nsystemic breakdown that he—and relatively few others—envisioned.\nCentral to Minsky’s view of how financial meltdowns occur, of course, are “asset price\nbubbles.” This evening I will revisit the ongoing debate over whether central banks should act to\ncounter such bubbles and discuss “lessons learned.” This issue seems especially compelling now\nthat it’s evident that episodes of exuberance, like the ones that led to our bond and house price\nbubbles, can be time bombs that cause catastrophic damage to the economy when they explode.\nIndeed, in view of the financial mess we’re living through, I found it fascinating to read Minsky\n\n1\n\nI would like to thank John Judd and Sam Zuckerman for exceptional assistance in preparing these remarks.\n\n1\n\n\fagain and reexamine my own views about central bank responses to speculative financial booms.\nMy thoughts on this have changed somewhat, as I will explain. 2\nAs always, my comments are my own and do not necessarily reflect those of my\ncolleagues in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nMinsky and the current crisis\nOne of the critical features of Minsky’s world view is that borrowers, lenders, and\nregulators are lulled into complacency as asset prices rise.3 It was not so long ago—though it\nseems like a lifetime—that many of us were trying to figure out why investors were demanding\nso little compensation for risk. For example, long-term interest rates were well below what\nappeared consistent with the expected future path of short-term rates. This phenomenon, which\nended abruptly in mid-2007, was famously characterized by then-Chairman Greenspan as a\n“conundrum.” 4 Credit spreads too were razor thin. But for Minsky, this behavior of interest\nrates and loan pricing might not have been so puzzling. He might have pointed out that such a\nsense of safety on the part of investors is characteristic of financial booms. The incaution that\nreigned by the middle of this decade had been fed by roughly twenty years of the so-called “great\nmoderation,” when most industrialized economies experienced steady growth and low and stable\ninflation. Moreover, the world economy had shaken off the effects of the bursting of an earlier\nasset price bubble—the technology stock boom—with comparatively little damage.\n\n2\n\nI want to give credit to PIMCO’s always-astute Paul McCulley—who gave last year’s keynote address—for\nleading the Minsky revival and pointing out the relevance of Minsky’s work to our current financial troubles.\n3\nFor example, see Hyman P. Minsky, “The Financial Instability Hypothesis,” The Jerome Levy Economics Institute\nof Bard College, Working Paper No. 74, May 1992 (http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=161024);\nand Robert Pollin, “The Relevance of Hyman Minsky,” Challenge, March/April 1997.\n4\nAlan Greenspan, “Federal Reserve Board’s semiannual Monetary Policy Report to the Congress,” testimony\nbefore the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, U.S. Senate, February 16, 2005.\n(http://www.federalreserve.gov/Boarddocs/hh/2005/february/testimony.htm)\n2\n\n\fChairman Bernanke has argued that other factors besides complacency were responsible\nfor low interest rates in this period. 5 A glut of foreign saving mainly generated in developing\ncountries such as China and India fueled demand for dollar-denominated assets. This ample\nsupply of foreign savings combined with a low U.S. personal saving rate, large U.S. government\ndeficits, and high productivity gains to produce a huge current account deficit. As a result, vast\nquantities of funds began “sloshing around” in our economy seeking investment projects.\nFed monetary policy may also have contributed to the U.S. credit boom and the\nassociated house price bubble by maintaining a highly accommodative stance from 2002 to\n2004. 6 This accommodative stance was motivated by what Greenspan called “risk management\npolicy,” in which, to reduce the possibility of deflation, the funds rate was held below the level\nthat would otherwise have been chosen to promote a return to full employment. 7 In effect, the\nFed took a calculated risk. It took out some insurance to lower the chances of a potentially\ndevastating deflationary episode. The cost of that insurance was an increased possibility of\noverheating the economy. These policy actions arguably played some role in our house price\nbubble. But they clearly were not the only factor, since such bubbles appeared in many countries\nthat did not have highly accommodative monetary policies.\nAs Minsky’s financial instability hypothesis suggests, when optimism is high and ample\nfunds are available for investment, investors tend to migrate from the safe hedge end of the\nMinsky spectrum to the risky speculative and Ponzi end. Indeed, in the current episode,\n\n5\n\nBen S. Bernanke, “The Global Saving Glut and the U.S. Current Account Deficit,” remarks at the Sandridge\nLecture, Virginia Association of Economics, Richmond, Virginia, March 10, 2005.\n(http://www.federalreserve.gov/boarddocs/speeches/2005/200503102/)\n6\nJohn B. Taylor, “The Financial Crisis and the Policy Responses: An Empirical Analysis of What Went Wrong,”\nNBER Working Paper No. 14631, January 2009. (http://www.nber.org/papers/w14631)\n7\nAlan Greenspan, “Monetary Policy under Uncertainty,” remarks at a symposium sponsored by the Federal Reserve\nBank of Kansas City, Jackson Hole, Wyoming, August 29, 2003.\n(http://www.federalreserve.gov/boarddocs/speeches/2003/20030829/default.htm)\n\n3\n\n\finvestors tried to raise returns by increasing leverage and sacrificing liquidity through shortterm—sometimes overnight—debt financing. Simultaneously, new and fancy methods of\nfinancial engineering allowed widespread and complex securitization of many types of assets,\nmost famously in subprime lending. In addition, exotic derivatives, such as credit default swaps,\nwere thought to dilute risk by spreading it widely. These new financial products provided the\nbasis for an illusion of low risk, a misconception that was amplified by the inaccurate analyses of\nthe rating agencies. This created a new wrinkle that even Minsky may not have imagined. Some\nof the investors who put money into highly risky assets were blithely unaware of how far out on\na limb they had gone. Many of those who thought they were in the hedge category were shocked\nto discover that, in fact, they were speculative or Ponzi units.\nAt the same time, securitization added distance between borrowers and lenders. As a\nresult, underwriting standards were significantly relaxed. Much of this financing was done in\nthe “shadow banking system,” consisting of entities that acted a lot like banks—albeit very\nhighly leveraged and illiquid banks—but were outside the bank regulatory net. Although these\ndevelopments reached an extreme state in the U.S. subprime mortgage market, risky practices\nwere employed broadly in the U.S. financial system. And this activity extended far beyond our\nborders as players throughout the global financial system eagerly participated. As banks and\ntheir large, nonbank competitors became involved in ever more complicated securitizations, they\nbegan to employ sophisticated “new tools” to measure and manage the credit risks flowing from\nthese transactions. But those tools—which I described in my speech 13 years ago—proved\ninsufficient for the task.\nThis cult of risky behavior was not limited to financial institutions. U.S. households\nenthusiastically leveraged themselves to the hilt. The personal saving rate, which had been\n\n4\n\n\ffalling for over a decade, hovered only slightly above zero from mid-2005 to mid-2007. A good\ndeal of this leverage came in the form of mortgage debt. The vast use of exotic mortgages—such\nas subprime, interest-only, low-doc and no-doc, and option-ARMs—offers an example of\nMinsky’s Ponzi finance, in which a loan can only be refinanced if the price of the underlying\nasset increases. In fact, many subprime loans were explicitly designed to be good for the\nborrower only if they could be refinanced at a lower rate, a benefit limited to those who\nestablished a pattern of regular payments and built reasonable equity in their homes.\nIn retrospect, it’s not surprising that these developments led to unsustainable increases in\nbond prices and house prices. Once those prices started to go down, we were quickly in the\nmidst of a Minsky meltdown. The financial engineering that was thought to hedge risks\nprobably would have worked beautifully if individual investors had faced shocks that were\nuncorrelated with those of their counterparties. But declines in bond and house prices hit\neveryone in the same way, inflicting actual and expected credit losses broadly across the\nfinancial system. Moreover, the complexity of securitized credit instruments meant that it was\ndifficult to identify who the actual loan holders might be. Meanwhile, asset write-downs reduced\nequity cushions of financial firms and increased their leverage just when growing risks made\nthose firms seek less leverage, not more. When they tried to sell assets into illiquid markets,\nprices fell further, generating yet more selling pressure in a loss spiral that kept intensifying. We\nexperienced a “perfect storm” in financial markets: runs on highly vulnerable and systemically\nimportant financial institutions; dysfunction in most securitized credit markets; a reduction in\ninterbank lending; higher interest rates for all but the safest borrowers, matched by near-zero\nyields on Treasury bills; lower equity values; and a restricted supply of credit from financial\ninstitutions.\n\n5\n\n\fOnce this massive credit crunch hit, it didn’t take long before we were in a recession.\nThe recession, in turn, deepened the credit crunch as demand and employment fell, and credit\nlosses of financial institutions surged. Indeed, we have been in the grips of precisely this adverse\nfeedback loop for more than a year. A process of balance sheet deleveraging has spread to\nnearly every corner of the economy. Consumers are pulling back on purchases, especially on\ndurable goods, to build their savings. Businesses are cancelling planned investments and laying\noff workers to preserve cash. And, financial institutions are shrinking assets to bolster capital\nand improve their chances of weathering the current storm. Once again, Minsky understood this\ndynamic. He spoke of the paradox of deleveraging, in which precautions that may be smart for\nindividuals and firms—and indeed essential to return the economy to a normal state—\nnevertheless magnify the distress of the economy as a whole.\nThe U.S. economy just entered the sixth quarter of recession. Economic activity and\nemployment are contracting sharply, with weakness evident in every major sector aside from the\nfederal government. Financial markets and institutions remain highly stressed, notwithstanding a\nfew welcome signs of stability due mainly to Federal Reserve and federal government credit\npolicies. The negative dynamics between the real and financial sides of the economy have\ncreated severe downside risks. While we’ve seen some tentative signs of improvement in the\neconomic data very recently, it’s still impossible to know how deep the contraction will\nultimately be.\nAs I mentioned earlier, the Minsky meltdown is global in nature, reflecting the everincreasing interconnectedness of financial markets and institutions around the world. The\nrecession is the first during the postwar period to see simultaneous contractions in output in\nEurope, Japan, and North America. Economic growth in these areas has weakened sharply as the\n\n6\n\n\ffinancial pain has spread and the U.S. recession has spilled over to our trading partners.\nForecasts for growth in Europe and Japan in 2009 are now even weaker than for the United\nStates. What’s more, many developing nations face stark challenges as markets for their\nproducts have dried up and capital inflows have abruptly halted, making debt refinancing—if\nnecessary—difficult, if not impossible. The global nature of the downturn raises the odds that\nthe recession will be prolonged, since neither we nor our trade partners can look to a boost from\nforeign demand.\n\nBubbles and monetary policy\nThe severity of these financial and economic problems creates a very strong case for\ngovernment and central bank action. I’m encouraged that we are seeing an almost\nunprecedented outpouring of innovative fiscal and monetary policies aimed at resolving the\ncrisis. Of course, fiscal stimulus played a central role in Minsky’s policy prescriptions for\ncombating economic cycles. Minsky also emphasized the importance of lender-of-last-resort\ninterventions by the Federal Reserve, and this is a tool we have relied on heavily. I believe that\nMinsky would also approve of the Fed’s current “credit easing” policies. Since the\nintensification of the financial crisis last fall, the Fed has expanded its balance sheet from around\n$850 billion to just over $2 trillion and has announced programs that are likely to take it yet\nhigher. In effect, the government is easing the financial fallout resulting from virulent\ndeleveraging throughout the private sector by increasing its own leverage in a partial and\ntemporary offset. 8\n\n8\n\nPaul McCulley has emphasized the importance of such a government role to address what he refers to as the\n“reverse Minsky journey.” See “Saving Capitalistic Banking from Itself,” Global Central Bank Focus, PIMCO,\nFebruary 2009.\n7\n\n\fHowever, as I said at the beginning of my talk, this evening I want to address another\nquestion that has been the subject of much debate for many years: Should central banks attempt\nto deflate asset price bubbles before they get big enough to cause big problems? Until recently,\nmost central bankers would have said no. They would have argued that policy should focus\nsolely on inflation, employment, and output goals—even in the midst of an apparent asset-price\nbubble. 9 That was the view that prevailed during the tech stock bubble and I myself have\nsupported this approach in the past. However, now that we face the tangible and tragic\nconsequences of the bursting of the house price bubble, I think it is time to take another look.\nLet me briefly review the arguments for and against policies aimed at counteracting\nbubbles. The conventional wisdom generally followed by the Fed and central banks in most\ninflation-targeting countries is that monetary policy should respond to an asset price only to the\nextent that it will affect the future path of output and inflation, which are the proper concerns of\nmonetary policy. 10 For example, a surging stock market can be expected to lead to stronger\ndemand for goods and services by raising the wealth of households and reducing the cost of\ncapital for businesses. As a result, higher stock prices mean that the stance of monetary policy\nneeds to be tighter, but only enough to offset the macroeconomic consequences on aggregate\ndemand created by a larger stock of wealth. In other words, policy would not respond to the\nstock market boom itself, but only to the consequences of the boom on the macroeconomy.\n\n(http://www.pimco.com/LeftNav/Featured+Market+Commentary/FF/2009/GCB+February+2009+McCulley+Savin\ng+Capitalistic+Banking.htm)\n9\nDonald L.

Rudebusch, “Monetary Policy and Asset Price Bubbles,” FRBSF Economic Letter 2005-18, August 5,\n2005. (http://www.frbsf.org/publications/economics/letter/2005/el2005-18.html)\n8\n\n\fHowever, other observers argue that monetary authorities must consider responding\ndirectly to an asset price bubble when one is detected. This is because—as we are witnessing—\nbursting bubbles can seriously harm economic performance, and monetary policy is hard-pressed\nto respond effectively after the fact. Therefore, central banks may prefer to try to eliminate, or at\nleast reduce the size of, this threat directly. Under this approach, policymakers would push\ninterest rates higher than would be indicated under conventional policy. The result, of course,\nwould be that output and employment would be reduced in the near-term, which is the price of\nmitigating the risk of serious financial and economic turmoil later on.\nWhat are the issues that separate the anti-bubble monetary policy activists from the\nskeptics? First, some of those who oppose such policy question whether bubbles even exist.\nThey maintain that asset prices reflect the collective information and wisdom of traders in\norganized markets. Trying to deflate an apparent bubble would go against precisely those\n“experts” who best understand the fundamental factors underlying asset prices. It seems to me\nthough that this argument is particularly difficult to defend in light of the poor decisions and\nwidespread dysfunction we have seen in many markets during the current turmoil.\nSecond, even if bubbles do occur, it’s an open question whether policymakers can\nidentify them in time to act effectively. Bubbles are not easy to detect because estimates of the\nunderlying fundamentals are imprecise. For example, in the case of house prices, it is common\nto estimate fundamental values by looking at the ratio of house prices to rents, which can be\nthought of as equivalent to a dividend-price ratio for the stock market. 11 If this ratio rises\nsignificantly above its fundamental, or long-run, value, the possibility of a bubble should be\nconsidered. Indeed, from 2002 to early 2006, this ratio zoomed to about 90 percent above its\n11\n\nJoshua Gallin, “The Long-Run Relationship between House Prices and Rents,” Finance and Economics\nDiscussion Series 2004-50, Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Washington, D.C. (forthcoming in\nReal Estate Economics). (http://www.federalreserve.gov/pubs/feds/2004/200450/200450abs.html)\n9\n\n\flong-run value, far outstripping any previous level. Nonetheless, even when house prices were\nsoaring, some experts doubted that a bubble existed. That said, by 2005 I think most people\nunderstood that—at a minimum—there was a substantial risk that houses had become\novervalued. Even at that point though, many thought the correction in house prices would be\nslow, not the rapid adjustment that did occur. 12\nNow, even if we accept that we can identify bubbles as they happen, another question\narises: Is the threat so serious that a monetary response is imperative? It would make sense for\nmonetary policy makers to intervene only if the fallout were likely to be quite severe and\ndifficult to deal with after the fact. We know that the effects of booms and busts in asset prices\nsometimes show themselves with significant lags. In those cases, conventional policy\napproaches can be effective. For example, fluctuations in equity prices generally affect wealth\nand consumer demand quite gradually. A central bank may prefer to adjust short-term interest\nrates after the bubble bursts to counter the depressing effects on demand. The tech stock bubble\nseems to fit this mold. The price-dividend ratio for these stocks reached dizzying heights and\nmany observers were convinced that a crash was inevitable. But monetary policy makers did not\ntry to stop the relentless climb of tech stock prices, although they raised interest rates toward the\nend of the period to dampen emerging inflationary pressures. Instead, it was only after tech\nstocks collapsed that policy eased to offset the negative wealth effect and, as unemployment\nrose, to help return the economy to full employment. The recession at the beginning of the\ndecade was fairly mild and did not involve pervasive financial market disruptions.\n\n12\n\nKristopher Gerardi, Andreas Lehnert, Shane M. Sherlund, and Paul Willen, “Making Sense of the Subprime\nCrisis,” Brookings Papers on Economic Activity, Fall 2008, pp. 69–160.\n(http://www.brookings.edu/economics/bpea/~/media/Files/Programs/ES/BPEA/2008_fall_bpea_papers/2008_fall_b\npea_gerardi_sherlund_lehnert_willen.pdf)\n10\n\n\fStill, just like infections, some bursting asset price bubbles are more virulent than others.\nThe current recession is a case in point. As house prices have plunged, the turmoil has been\ntransmitted to the economy much more quickly and violently than interest rate policy has been\nable to offset.\nYou’ll recognize right away that the assets at risk in the tech stock bubble were equities,\nwhile the volatile assets in the current crisis involve debt instruments held widely by global\nfinancial institutions. It may be that credit booms, such as the one that spurred house price and\nbond price increases, hold more dangerous systemic risks than other asset bubbles. By their\nnature, credit booms are especially prone to generating powerful adverse feedback loops between\nfinancial markets and real economic activity. It follows then, that if all asset bubbles are not\ncreated equal, policymakers could decide to intervene only in those cases that seem especially\ndangerous.\nThat brings up a fourth point: even if a dangerous asset price bubble is detected and\naction to rein it in is warranted, conventional monetary policy may not be the best approach. It’s\ntrue that moderate increases in the policy interest rate might constrain the bubble and reduce the\nrisk of severe macroeconomic dislocation. In the current episode, higher short-term interest rates\nprobably would have restrained the demand for housing by raising mortgage interest rates, and\nthis might have slowed the pace of house price increases. In addition, as Hyun Song Shin and\nhis coauthors have noted in important work related to Minsky’s, tighter monetary policy may be\nassociated with reduced leverage and slower credit growth, especially in securitized markets. 13\nThus, monetary policy that leans against bubble expansion may also enhance financial stability\nby slowing credit booms and lowering overall leverage.\n13\n\nTobias Adrian and Hyun Song Shin, “Money, Liquidity, and Monetary Policy,” American Economic Review\nPapers and Proceedings, forthcoming.\n\n11\n\n\fNonetheless, these linkages remain controversial and bubbles may not be predictably\nsusceptible to interest rate policy actions. And there’s a question of collateral damage. Even if\nhigher interest rates take some air out of a bubble, such a strategy may have an unacceptably\ndepressing effect on the economy as a whole. There is also the harm that can result from “type 2\nerrors,” when policymakers respond to asset price developments that, with the benefit of\nhindsight, turn out not to have been bubbles at all. For both of these reasons, central bankers\nmay be better off avoiding monetary strategies and instead relying on more targeted and lowercost alternative approaches to manage bubbles, such as financial regulatory and supervisory\ntools. I will turn to that topic in just a minute.\nIn summary, when it comes to using monetary policy to deflate asset bubbles, we must\nacknowledge the difficulty of identifying bubbles, and uncertainties in the relationship between\nmonetary policy and financial stability. At the same time though, policymakers often must act\non the basis of incomplete knowledge. What has become patently obvious is that not dealing\nwith certain kinds of bubbles before they get big can have grave consequences. This lends more\nweight to arguments in favor of attempting to mitigate bubbles, especially when a credit boom is\nthe driving factor. I would not advocate making it a regular practice to use monetary policy to\nlean against asset price bubbles. However recent experience has made me more open to action.\nI can now imagine circumstances that would justify leaning against a bubble with tighter\nmonetary policy. Clearly further research may help clarify these issues. 14\n\n14\n\nThe following conference volumes provide an introduction and references to the research literature now available:\nAsset Price Bubbles: The Implications for Monetary, Regulatory, and International Policies, ed.

I am\nheartened that there is now widespread agreement among policymakers and in Congress on the\nneed to overhaul our supervisory and regulatory system, and broad agreement on the basic\nelements of reform. 15\nMany of the proposals under discussion are intended to strengthen micro-prudential\nsupervision. Micro-prudential supervision aims to insure that individual financial institutions,\nincluding any firm with access to the safety net, but particularly those that are systemically\nimportant, are well managed and avoid excessive risk. The current system of supervision is\ncharacterized by uneven and fragmented supervision, and it’s riddled with gaps that enhance the\nopportunity for regulatory arbitrage. Such arbitrage was a central component in the excessive\nrisk-taking that led to our current problems. It is now widely agreed that such gaps and overlaps\nmust be eliminated, and systemically important institutions—whether banks, insurance firms,\ninvestment firms, or hedge funds—should be subject to consolidated supervision by a single\nagency. Systemic institutions would be defined by key characteristics, such as size, leverage,\nreliance on short-term funding, importance as sources of credit or liquidity, and\n15\n\nSee, for example, Timothy Geithner, Testimony before the House Financial Services Committee, March 26, 2009\n(http://www.ustreas.gov/press/releases/tg67.htm); Ben S.

Another\ncritical shortcoming of the current system is that it lacks any legal process to enable supervisors\nof financial conglomerates and nonbanks to wind down the activities of failed firms in an orderly\nfashion. The need for a resolution framework that would permit such wind-downs of\nsystemically important firms is also widely accepted.\nThe current crisis has afforded plentiful opportunities for supervisors to reflect on the\neffectiveness of our current system of micro-prudential supervision. The “lessons learned” will\nundoubtedly enhance its conduct going forward. 16 But, regardless of how well micro-prudential\nsupervision is executed, on its own it will never be adequate to safeguard the economy from the\ndestructive boom and bust cycles that Minsky considered endemic in capitalistic systems.\nAnalogous to Keynes’ paradox of thrift, the assumption that safe institutions automatically result\nin a safe system reflects a fallacy of composition. Thus, macro-prudential supervision—to\nprotect the system as a whole—is needed to mitigate financial crises.\nThe roles of micro- and macro-prudential supervision are fundamentally different. In\nprinciple, many individual institutions could be managing risk reasonably well, while the system\nas a whole remained vulnerable due to interconnections among financial institutions that could\nlead to contagious cycles of loss and illiquidity. For example, it is prudent for institutions to sell\nrisky assets and pay off debt when a decline in asset prices depletes capital. But the\nsimultaneous behavior of many institutions to protect themselves in this way only intensifies the\ndecline in prices. Moreover, when many institutions try to de-lever simultaneously, market\n16\n\nSee President’s Working Group on Financial Markets, “Policy Statement on Financial Market Developments,”\nMarch 13. 2008 (http://www.treas.gov/press/releases/reports/pwgpolicystatemktturmoil_03122008.pdf); Financial\nStability Forum, “Report of the Financial Stability Forum on Enhancing Market and Institutional Resilience,” April\n7, 2008 (http://www.fsforum.org/publications/r_0804.pdf); Senior Supervisors Group, “Observations on Risk\nManagement Practices during the Recent Market Turbulence,” March 6, 2008.\n(http://www.newyorkfed.org/newsevents/news/banking/2008/SSG_Risk_Mgt_doc_final.pdf)\n\n14\n\n\fliquidity can instantly evaporate. Systemic risk is endogenous to the working of the financial\nsystem.\nCapital requirements could serve as a key tool of macro-prudential supervision. Most\nproposals for regulatory reform would impose higher capital requirements on systemically\nimportant institutions and also design them to vary in a procyclical manner. In other words,\ncapital requirements would rise in economic upswings, so that institutions would build strength\nin good times, and they would fall in recessions. This pattern would counteract the natural\ntendency of leverage to amplify business cycle swings—serving as a kind of “automatic\nstabilizer” for the financial system. Financial stability might also be enhanced by reforming the\naccounting rules governing loan loss reserves. A more forward-looking system for reserving\nagainst such losses could make regulatory capital less sensitive to economic fluctuations. 17 In\naddition, most proposals for financial reform emphasize the need for stronger liquidity standards.\nThe funding of long-term assets with short-term, often overnight liabilities, is a source of\nsystemic vulnerability. One interesting recent proposal would disincent overreliance on shortterm funding by relating an institution’s capital charges to the degree of maturity mismatch\nbetween its assets and liabilities. 18 There has been considerable discussion recently of the need\nfor a new macro-prudential or “financial stability” supervisor—whether the Fed or some other\nagency—with responsibility to monitor, assess, and mitigate systemic risks in the financial\nsystem as a whole.\nAt this stage, the proposed reforms involve broad principles. The translation of those\nprinciples into a detailed supervisory program will be challenging, to say the least. But I am\n\n17\n\nSee Eric S.

Yellen, President and CEO, Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco\nFor delivery on March 25, 2009, 1:00 PM EDT, 10:00 AM PDT\n\nThe Uncertain Economic Outlook and the Policy Responses 1\nGood afternoon and thank you for inviting me. I’m delighted to speak before a group of\nsuch distinguished forecasters. As a member of the Federal Open Market Committee, I too must\nregularly predict the course of the economy and lately that has become a particularly hazardous\noccupation. We are struggling to assess the effects of conditions we haven’t seen before,\nincluding a near-collapse of the financial system, and to predict the impacts of policies that\nhaven’t been tried before, including an array of new Fed initiatives designed to improve\nconditions in private credit markets.\nI share the guarded optimism of most professional forecasters that the economy may\nbegin to grow again within the next several quarters. But I must admit that I see considerable\ndownside risk, and my confidence in this outlook is greatly diminished by the nearly\nunprecedented set of circumstances we face, circumstances that severely challenge our ability to\nuse historical economic relationships to anticipate future developments. We face an\nextraordinarily uncertain future, and our main hope for economic recovery lies in the sorts of\ninnovative and aggressive economic policy responses that are being carried out by Federal\nReserve and federal government policymakers. We must use all available tools to fight off the\nsignificant forces for contraction now hitting the economy.\nLast week, the FOMC took some rather dramatic steps to ease the stance of monetary\npolicy. We decided to expand our program to purchase agency mortgage-backed securities\n1\n\nI would like to thank John Judd and Sam Zuckerman for assistance in preparing these remarks.\n1\n\n\f(MBS) and agency debt by up to $850 billion, and initiated a program to purchase up to $300\nbillion of longer-term Treasury securities. These actions again demonstrate the Federal\nReserve’s commitment to do whatever it takes to get the economy moving forward. I’ll have\nmore to say about Fed policy at the end of my talk.\nThe economic situation\nWith that, let me begin with my best effort at an appraisal of the current economic\nsituation. As always, my comments represent my own views and not necessarily those of my\ncolleagues in the Federal Reserve System.\nYou are well aware of how downbeat most of the economic news has been, despite some\nscattered positive signals. We are in the fifth quarter of recession and economic activity and\nemployment are contracting sharply, with weakness evident in every major sector aside from the\nfederal government. At the same time, financial markets remain highly stressed and the adverse\nfeedback loop between the economy and the financial sector shows little sign of slackening.\nThese negative dynamics create severe downside economic risks. A process of balance sheet\ndeleveraging has spread to nearly every corner of the economy: consumers are pulling back on\npurchases, especially on durable goods, to build their savings; businesses are cancelling planned\ninvestments and laying off workers to preserve cash; and financial institutions are shrinking their\nassets to bolster capital and improve their chances of weathering the current storm. Such\nprecautions may be smart for individuals and firms, but they intensify economic distress for the\neconomy as a whole.\nHousing construction and prices remain at the center of the storm and rising\nunemployment and the reduced availability of mortgage credit weigh on demand.\nUnfortunately, even though housing starts have fallen precipitously, we have yet to see any clear\n\n2\n\n\fsign that the contraction in home building is near its end. The recent news that housing starts\nand permits had jumped in February provides a ray of hope, but it’s too soon to know if this is\nnoise or a signal that the contraction will soon end. The ongoing decline in house prices poses\nsignificant downside risk to future consumer spending and the health of the financial system.\nThis correction in house prices, especially in combination with rising unemployment, has fueled\nmortgage delinquencies and foreclosures and the associated losses are seriously weakening\nbanks and the financial system more broadly. Of course, foreclosures also harm the affected\ncommunities.\nMortgage rates are a potent influence on housing demand, and it is encouraging that the\nrates on conforming mortgages backed by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have declined. The\nevidence suggests that the Fed’s decision to purchase mortgage-backed securities guaranteed by\nthese agencies played a role in bringing rates down, and the further rate declines following last\nweek’s FOMC announcement of expanded purchases is a hopeful sign that conforming mortgage\nrates may decline even more. The rates charged to borrowers seeking nonconforming jumbos\nhave come down too, although not nearly as much as those on conforming loans. However,\nmortgages are still all but unavailable to borrowers with less-than-stellar credit histories and\nthose who can’t make large down payments.\nThe burdens afflicting consumers are both serious and numerous, so it is hardly\nsurprising that consumer confidence is at a 30-year low and consumer spending has been weak.\nFollowing an outright contraction in the second half of last year, spending has shown signs of\nstabilizing recently. In addition to soaring unemployment, household balance sheets have\nimploded. The combined impact on household wealth of falling house prices and plummeting\nequity prices has been staggering. Household wealth fell by $5 trillion last quarter alone, and by\n\n3\n\n\f$13 trillion—or nearly 25 percent—since the peak in mid-2007. Unfortunately, households were\nnot well positioned for such a hit to their wealth, since many had leveraged to the hilt. The\ncombination of the loss in wealth and the overhang of household debt portends years of subdued\nspending as households go through an extended process of deleveraging. Households are likely\nto recognize the benefits of stronger balance sheets for precautionary purposes and for meeting\nlonger-term goals, such as down-payment requirements and retirement. Downward pressure on\nhousehold leverage will come not just from households themselves but also from lenders, as they\ndemand more collateral for loans—collateral that has been devastated by the collapse of housing\nand other wealth. The one partially offsetting positive for consumer spending is the sharp\ndecline in energy prices since the middle of last year. The bottom line though is that the private\nsaving rate is finally moving up from an exceptionally low level. It is difficult, but critical to the\nforecast, to judge just how far that rebound will ultimately go.\nSharp cutbacks in investment spending have reinforced the economic drag resulting from\nthe retrenchment in consumer spending. Outlays for equipment and software and structures\ndeclined sharply in the fourth quarter of 2008 and firms liquidated inventories at a sizeable pace.\nThe contraction in all of these spending categories appears to have intensified this quarter. This\nweakness in business investment spending reflects shrinking sales, uncomfortably high\ninventory-sales ratios, a higher cost of capital, and dysfunctional credit markets. Our business\ncontacts also emphasize that pervasive uncertainty about the length and severity of the current\ndownturn is causing them to defer commitments and more generally hunker down. They have\nbecome exceptionally cautious in undertaking commitments to capital spending projects, even\nwhen those projects are expected to be profitable in the long term. And they are hoarding\nliquidity to meet unexpected revenue shortfalls or financing needs.\n\n4\n\n\fThe budgetary problems facing my home state of California have been well publicized\nand are exceptionally severe, but state and local governments across the nation face similar\nproblems. Their budgets have been thrown into crisis by the financial and economic turmoil.\nReductions in tax collections due to falling income and the downturns in the housing and stock\nmarkets have been coupled with tighter credit conditions, making it harder to issue bonds. Many\nstates are cutting spending, drawing down rainy day funds, and, to a lesser extent, raising taxes in\nresponse. Fortunately, the recently enacted fiscal stimulus package included a substantial dose\nof funding for state and local projects, and this should provide meaningful relief. It is especially\nencouraging that this aid is going disproportionately to states with severe budgetary pressures,\nwhich are more likely to put the funds to immediate use.\nMore broadly, with the passage of the fiscal stimulus package, the federal government is\nlikely to boost its contribution to real GDP this year and next. The Congressional Budget Office\nestimates that real GDP will be lifted by between 1 and 3½ percent by the end of next year, and\nthat translates into a reduction in the unemployment rate of between ½ and 1¼ percentage points.\nWhile a program of this size is not sufficient on its own to solve the economy’s problems, the\nstimulus is welcome, and likely to start hitting the economy as soon as next quarter.\nThe final factor affecting the outlook for growth is net exports, but significant impetus\nfrom this source seems unlikely in coming quarters. Indeed, a truly sobering feature of the\ncurrent recession is its global nature. This recession is the first during the postwar period to see a\nsimultaneous contraction in output in Europe, Japan, and North America. Economic growth in\nthese areas has weakened sharply as the financial meltdown has spread and the U.S. recession\nhas spilled over to our trading partners. Forecasts for growth in Europe and Japan in 2009 are\nnow even weaker than for the United States. Many developing nations face stark challenges as\n\n5\n\n\fmarkets for their products have dried up and capital inflows have abruptly halted, making debt\nrefinancing—if necessary—difficult, if not impossible. Emerging market defaults would trigger\nfurther financial turmoil. The downturn in eastern Europe poses especially significant financial\nrisks to western European banks, whose exposure amounts to an estimated $1.5 trillion. Bank\nloans in Austria exceed 80 percent of GDP, while the exposure of banks in Sweden and Belgium\nexceed 30 percent of GDP.\nFinally, let me to turn to inflation. With the global recession putting downward pressure\non commodity prices and slack in both labor and product markets swelling, we’ve seen an\noutright decline in consumer prices over the past six months. I anticipate that unemployment\nwill continue to increase before peaking in 2010, and, as a consequence, I expect inflation to be\nextremely subdued for quite some time. It seems likely, in fact, that headline consumer inflation\nwill be barely positive for 2009 as a whole and core inflation could remain below 1 percent for\nthe next several years. Such rates are notably below the 2 percent pace that most FOMC\nmembers consider appropriate to best promote the Committee’s dual mandate for full\nemployment and price stability.\nSo let me put all of these observations together into an overall view of future economic\ngrowth. With the caveat that my forecast is subject to exceptional uncertainty in the present\nenvironment, my best guess is similar to that of most forecasters, who expect to see moderately\npositive real GDP growth rates beginning later this year or early in 2010, followed by a gradual\nrecovery. 2\nHowever, I am well aware that my views are strikingly more optimistic than those I hear\nfrom the vast majority of my business contacts. They tend to see conditions as dire and getting\n2\n\nFor example, the Blue Chip consensus shows modest positive growth rates in both the third and\nfourth quarters. Even the average of the lowest ten Blue Chip forecasters shows a small positive number\nin the fourth quarter.\n6\n\n\fworse. In fact, many of them can’t believe I would even suggest what they see as such a patently\nrosy scenario! So why is it that so many of us who prepare forecasts seem to be more optimistic\nthan many others? I think there are several reasons. First, as forecasters, we distinguish between\ngrowth rates and levels. It’s true that the Blue Chip consensus shows moderate positive growth\nrates in output in the second half of this year. But even so, the level of the unemployment rate\nwould still rise throughout 2009 and into 2010. So, in this sense, the worst of the recession is not\nexpected to occur until next year. And, even by the end of 2011, I would expect the\nunemployment rate to be above its full-employment level. So I wouldn’t call this a particularly\nrosy scenario.\nSecond, it takes less than many people think for real GDP growth rates to turn positive.\nJust the elimination of drags on growth can do it. For example, residential construction has been\ndeclining for several years, subtracting about 1 percentage point from real GDP growth. Even if\nthis spending were only to stabilize at today’s very low levels—not a robust performance at all—\na 1 percentage point subtraction from growth would convert into a zero, boosting overall growth\nby 1 percentage point. A decline in the pace of inventory liquidation is another factor that could\ncontribute to a pickup in growth. Inventory liquidation over the last few months has been\nunusually severe, especially in motor vehicles—a typical recession pattern. All it would take is a\nreduction in the pace of liquidation—not outright inventory building—to raise the GDP growth\nrate. In addition, pent-up demand for autos, durable goods, or even housing could emerge and\nboost demand for these items once their stocks have declined to low enough levels.\nThird, policies are in place that could jump-start the economy, including the fiscal\nstimulus package, the Administration’s housing program, and a growing list of Federal Reserve\nand Treasury credit programs that aim to improve financial market function and the flow of\n\n7\n\n\fcredit. These programs offer the prospect that financial distress may gradually give way to more\nnormal functioning over the course of the year.\nFinally, at some point, negative feedback loops can turn positive. For example, if federal\ngovernment and Federal Reserve policies were to jump-start the economy, credit losses of\nfinancial institutions could diminish and lenders might increase the supply of credit available to\nfinance spending. More credit, and better consumer and business confidence, could further boost\nthe economy and employment, which would feed back positively on credit conditions. In other\nwords, the negative feedback loop that is currently in play could be replaced by self-reinforcing\npositive dynamics.\nHeightened uncertainty\nWhile there are good reasons to think the economy could begin to recover fairly soon,\nI’m far from confident and thus don’t want to press the case too strongly. Indeed, in all humility,\nmost of us have failed to anticipate the depth of this downturn and have had to mark down our\nforecasts repeatedly. For example, the Blue Chip consensus for real GDP growth in 2009 has\nshown negative revisions in 12 of the past 13 months. Even Chairman Bernanke recently\ncompared his forecasting record to that of the losing Washington Nationals baseball team. The\nimponderables in forecasting are always large—and it’s always tempting to think that we face\nmore than the usual amount of uncertainty. But, for a host of reasons, this sentiment is actually\ntrue right now!\nFirst, the shocks hitting the economy from housing and the financial markets have pushed\nit well outside of the normal range of experience that allows for analysis based on history. For\nexample, research suggests that, in normal times, factors such as consumer and business\nconfidence do not warrant special attention in developing an outlook because they essentially\n\n8\n\n\fsummarize information, like income and equity prices, that are already taken into account. In\ncontrast, in these exceptional circumstances, psychological factors such as consumer and\nbusiness confidence may exert a large and independent influence.\nSecond, our models take for granted that financial markets are working normally and are\nlinked together through arbitrage, so that financial conditions can be captured with a few\nvariables such as equity prices, the exchange rate, and a short- and long-term interest rate. That\nassumption is obviously invalid now, so the historical relationships in our models linking the\nfinancial and the real sides of the economy may provide a less accurate characterization of the\ntransmission mechanism. As a consequence, they now may be less reliable forecasting guides.\nFinally, the Federal Reserve and the federal government are deploying policy tools that\nare unconventional, to say the least, and few, if any, models are prepared to tell us what macro\neffects they might have. For example, it’s very difficult to gauge the quantitative impact of such\npolicy actions as equity injections into banks, programs to prevent home foreclosures, purchases\nof mortgage-backed securities and longer-term Treasuries, and facilities to boost issuance in\ndysfunctional markets for asset-backed securities.\nEconomic policies\nFor me, this extreme uncertainty about the future creates a very strong case for bold\npolicy actions on a broad front—by both the monetary and fiscal authorities—to stimulate\neconomic activity and prevent inflation from falling any further. I am heartened by the\naggressive and innovative actions that policymakers are taking.\nTo address this crisis, the federal government has taken a number of steps to get the\neconomy moving again. In addition to the nearly $800 billion fiscal stimulus plan that was\nenacted into law recently, the administration has initiated a number of other programs. One\n\n9\n\n\fhelps homeowners restructure or refinance their mortgages to avoid possible foreclosure. In\naddition, a multifaceted Financial Stability Plan (FSP), involving the Treasury, the Fed, the\nFederal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and other financial agencies, provides additional capital\nto commercial banks and a mechanism for taking so-called toxic financial assets off private\nsector balance sheets. With regard to these assets, the Treasury earlier this week announced more\ndetails of its Public-Private Investment Program (PPIP), which facilitates the purchase of\nexisting, or legacy loans, and legacy securities. The goal of the PPIP is to facilitate price\ndiscovery and market liquidity.\nThe Fed has also acted vigorously to turn the economy around. In particular, the FOMC\ncut its federal funds rate target by roughly 5 full percentage points, establishing a target range of\n0 to ¼ percent since its December 2008 meeting. Although, for all practical purposes, this\ninterest rate cannot be pushed any lower, the Fed also has stated that an exceptionally low level\nof the funds rate would likely be warranted “for an extended period” due to weak economic\nconditions. By offering guidance about the likely course of future short-term interest rates,\nconditioned on the Committee’s economic forecast, the Committee hopes to influence longerterm interest rates and asset prices, which in turn affect the spending decisions of households and\nfirms.\nBeyond interest-rate policy, the Fed is using other tools to improve the functioning of\nfinancial markets and to lower longer-term interest rates. A variety of new unconventional\nprograms rely on the Fed’s balance sheet. These programs serve three basic purposes. First,\nthey provide a reliable source of liquidity to financial institutions so that they are better able to\nextend credit. Second, in cooperation with the Treasury, they have helped to prevent the failure\n\n10\n\n\fof several systemically important financial institutions. Third, again in concert with the\nTreasury, they work to augment the flow of credit to the economy.\nI would like to focus most of my attention on the third category, since that currently is\ntaking center stage. To open the flow of credit to the private sector, the Fed has taken several\napproaches. First, the Commercial Paper Funding Facility (CPFF) provides a liquidity backstop\nto U.S. issuers of highly rated three-month unsecured and asset-backed commercial paper. This\nfacility holds a substantial volume of this paper, and borrowing rates in these markets have fallen\nnoticeably.\nSecond, the Fed has developed the Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility (TALF)\nprogram jointly with the Treasury to help restore functioning in other impaired markets that\nprovide credit to households and businesses. The TALF supports the issuance of securities\ncollateralized by auto, student, credit card, and Small Business Administration loans—sectors\nwhere the issuance of new securities has slowed to a trickle. This approach may be expanded to\ninclude additional asset classes, such as commercial and residential mortgages. Purchases of\nnewly issued securities under this program began this month, but are still fairly small in scale. In\naddition, the TALF will be expanded to include legacy securities as part of the PPIP.\nTo support the housing sector, the Fed announced last November that it would begin to\npurchase agency-insured mortgage-backed securities and agency debt. And, of course, last week\nthis program was expanded substantially. In addition, the FOMC took the very significant step\nof launching a new program to purchase large quantities of longer-term Treasury debt.\nPurchases of such longer-term assets have the potential to stimulate aggregate demand through a\nnumber of channels, most obviously by reducing the yields on those securities included in the\nprogram. Indeed, last week’s announcement resulted in an immediate and sharp decline in\n\n11\n\n\finterest rates on both Treasury securities and agency-backed MBS. Similar effects on interest\nrates were felt in the United Kingdom after the Bank of England announced a program to buy\nlong-term government debt there.\nThere are good reasons to expect that the Fed’s longer-term asset purchases will also spill\nover broadly to other credit markets because many types of long-term debt are substitutes for\nTreasuries and agency MBS in private portfolios. Not surprisingly, corporate borrowing rates\nalso declined last Wednesday in tandem with the rates on Treasuries and agency MBS. Lower\ninterest rates should raise the demand for consumer durables, housing, and business investment.\nMoreover, lower rates should boost asset valuations, such as equity and house prices, providing\nadditional impetus to consumer spending through wealth effects. A reduction in mortgage rates,\nat the same time that the Administration has loosened loan-to-value requirements to refinance\nconforming mortgages, may spur many households to refinance in the coming months, which\nwould raise their disposable income and support more spending. But while it’s easy to\nenumerate the relevant channels, the sizes of the impacts through them are highly uncertain. We\nare using new policy tools and we simply don’t have the experience needed to pin down the\nmagnitude of the impacts. In light of these uncertainties, I fully support our diversified approach\nof using a variety to strategies and programs to spur the provision of credit in a wide range of\nmarkets.\nHowever, the wisdom of this diversified program is the subject of considerable debate.\nCritics of the current Fed strategy argue that monetary policy should address only overall credit\nconditions and should avoid influencing the allocation of credit across particular markets. The\njoint Treasury-Fed TALF initiative—and even the Fed’s purchases of agency debt and mortgagebacked securities—are controversial because arguably they do affect credit allocation.\n\n12\n\n\fA second concern is that close policy coordination between the legislative and executive\nbranches of government may compromise the independence of the Fed, and its credibility and\ncommitment to fulfill its dual mandate of price stability and full employment. For example, at\nsome point, monetary policy goals might require a less accommodative stance of policy, even\nthough credit markets might not be fully healed. The Fed might then face political pressure to\nkeep supplying credit to certain markets. 3\nAnother concern that I hear expressed with increasing frequency is that the huge expansion\nof Fed lending will trigger a surge in inflation. The worry seems to be that the Fed has financed\nits credit programs by increasing the excess reserves of commercial banks, and these reserves\ncould eventually fuel an inflationary surge. The Fed is therefore seen as needing a well-defined\nexit strategy from its current highly accommodative policy stance.\nI understand these concerns, but I don’t believe they warrant a retreat from our current\nbroad approach. In fact, I believe that the seriousness of our current economic problems argues\nfor using all available tools, including the purchase of Treasuries, agency debt, and agencybacked securities, along with lending programs—some joint with Treasury—to support a range\nof private credit markets. The Fed’s role in these joint programs is to lend against satisfactory\ncollateral while avoiding credit risk. The programs are necessitated by today’s extreme or, in the\nwords of the Federal Reserve Act, “unusual and exigent” circumstances, and are designed to\nimprove private credit conditions broadly, rather than to benefit narrowly defined sectors and\nclasses of borrowers.\n\n3\n\nMarvin Goodfriend, “Why We Need an ‘Accord’ for Federal Reserve Credit Policy: A Note,” Federal\nReserve Bank of Richmond Economic Quarterly, Winter (2001). See also Jeffrey Lacker, “Government Lending\nand Monetary Policy,” (remarks, National Association for Business Economics, 2009 Washington Economic Policy\nConference, Alexandria, VA, March 2, 2009); and Charles I. Plosser, “Ensuring Sound Monetary Policy in the\nAftermath of Crisis,” (speech, U.S. Monetary Policy Forum, The Initiative on Global Markets, University of\nChicago Booth School of Business, February 27, 2009).\n\n13\n\n\fThe principle that a central bank, charged with controlling inflation, should be\nindependent from the government is unassailable. It may also be true that it’s easier for the\ncentral bank to guard its independence from political pressure when it mainly holds government\nsecurities. I believe that we should return to such a balance sheet structure once the financial\nmarkets and the economy are back to normal. However, as I said, I also am convinced that, in\nthe current crisis, we must employ all available tools, and that includes bolstering private credit\nmarkets. In fact, actions to increase the supply of credit can be expected to have especially large\neffects in reducing interest rates in dysfunctional private markets, like the ones targeted by the\nFed’s commercial paper program and the TALF. I therefore support the joint statement issued\nby the Treasury and the Fed earlier this week that, “As long as unusual and exigent\ncircumstances persist, the Federal Reserve will continue to use all its tools working closely and\ncooperatively with the Treasury and other agencies … to foster stabilization and repair of the\nfinancial system.”\nWith regard to inflation, I think fears that inflation will jump once the economy begins to\nrecover are overdone for several reasons. First, and most important, the Fed is fully committed\nto maintaining price stability within its dual mandate. The recent Treasury-Fed joint statement\ncodifies the key principle that actions resulting in an expansion of the Fed’s balance sheet “must\nnot constrain the exercise of monetary policy as needed to foster maximum sustainable\nemployment and price stability.” As the economy recovers, the Fed will eventually have to\nreduce the quantity of excess reserves. To some extent, this will occur naturally as markets heal\nand some programs consequently shrink. It can also be accomplished, in part, through outright\nasset sales. And finally, several exit strategies may be available that would allow the Fed to\ntighten monetary policy even as it maintains a large balance sheet to support credit markets.\n\n14\n\n\fIndeed, the joint Treasury-Fed statement indicated that legislation will be sought to provide such\ntools. One possibility is that Congress could give the Fed the authority to issue interest-bearing\ndebt in addition to currency and bank reserves. Issuing such debt would reduce the volume of\nreserves in the financial system and push up the funds rate without shrinking the total size of our\nbalance sheet.\nSecond, for some time to come, disinflation, and even deflation, will represent greater\nrisks than inflation. With economic activity weakening, economic slack is likely to be substantial\nfor several more years. We need to be sure that we avoid the kind of deflation that Japan\nexperienced during its lost decade. While I don’t think such an outcome is likely, it should be on\nour list of concerns.\nIn sum, we face serious challenges as we try to right the economy, and the resumption of\ngrowth that we expect by the end of 2009 is far from assured. The best hope for recovery lies in\na diversified array of effective fiscal and monetary policy programs. I am heartened by the fact\nthat the federal government and the central bank have both reacted with creativity and vigor in\ncarrying out their responsibilities. And I’m convinced that this is no time to relax our efforts.\nThank you very much.\n\n15\n\n\f"

        "content": "Presentation to the 2009 U.S. Monetary Policy Forum conducted by the University of Chicago\nBooth School of Business and Brandeis International Business School\nNew York, New York\nBy Janet L. Yellen, President and CEO, Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco\nFor delivery on February 27, 2009, 10:45 AM Eastern time, 7:45 AM Pacific\n\nDiscussion of “Oil and the Macroeconomy: Lessons for Monetary Policy” 1\nIt’s a pleasure to discuss this thoughtful and comprehensive report on the macroeconomic\nimplications of oil price movements. 2 Even though we are no longer faced with sky-high oil\nprices, the issues discussed here remain important and policy relevant. It is hard to believe that\noil prices will not go up again sometime in the future, so it is vital that we learn from the last\nepisode, both about how the economy is likely to be affected and how monetary policy should\nrespond.\nPerhaps not surprisingly, most of my discussion relates to the latter topic, namely the\nFed’s policy response to the swings in oil prices over the last seven years. But I would like to\nstart by commenting on the paper’s discussion of the relationship between the market price of oil\nand the value of oil in the ground. Thinking of this relationship in terms of Tobin’s q is an\nelegant and insightful contribution. As the authors point out, oil in the ground is like any other\nirreproducible asset, which should be described by Hotelling’s theory that the price of such an\nasset minus marginal cost increases at a rate equal to the prevailing interest rate. But oil above\nthe ground has distinct characteristics. And a number of factors can cause its price to depart—\nfor some time—from the value implied by Hotelling’s model. Thus, q—the ratio of the market\n1\n\nI would like to thank Bharat Trehan, John Fernald, John Judd, John Williams, and Sam Zuckerman for\nassistance in preparing these remarks.\n\n2\n\nHarris, Kasman, Shapiro, and West (2009)\n\n\fprice of oil to its value in the ground—can and does deviate from unity. The authors provide an\nimportant and informative example of such a departure, which uses data on mergers and\nacquisitions to calculate the value of the oil in the ground and compare it to the market price of\noil over the last few years. This exercise, together with one based on the stock prices of large oil\ncompanies, suggests that the market price of oil was temporarily high in 2007, and that the jump\nin the first part of 2008 represented a further departure from the long-term value. I will return to\nthis topic later.\nLet me now turn to the paper’s discussion of oil prices and monetary policy, a topic that\nhas sparked much debate among academic economists and policymakers during my two stints as\na Fed policymaker. The authors have accurately summarized the main issues involved in the\ndebate that took place during 2002–2008, both inside and outside the Fed. As is well known, an\noil price shock typically poses a dilemma for policymakers: Higher oil prices depress output and\nraise inflation. While the reduction in output provides a reason for policy to ease, the uptick in\ninflation pushes policy in the opposite direction. It is rarely obvious which element deserves\ngreater weight in policy decisions, and that leads to debate about the appropriate response. The\noil shocks of the past several years were no exception.\nI agree with the authors’ assessment that the Fed focused primarily on core rather than\nheadline inflation to gauge the extent of underlying inflationary pressures during this period.\nThis strategy, as the authors note, can be justified on theoretical grounds. Since core inflation\nrose only slightly, the Fed’s main inflation gauge did not signal a need to tighten policy\ndramatically. But as energy costs soared, the economy did experience an uncomfortable increase\nin headline inflation. The authors argue that the Fed should have paid more attention to the\nacceleration in headline inflation and raised interest rates by more than it did from 2004 to 2006.\n\n2\n\n\fTheir argument is buttressed by two exercises, one of which examines some data on\nexpected inflation while the other is based on model simulations. I will comment on each of\nthese, in turn. Using a small vector autoregression model—where the price of oil is assumed to\nbe exogenous—the authors show that changes in the price of oil help predict (or, more\nspecifically, Granger cause) the Michigan survey’s measure of expected inflation and also one of\ntwo expectations measures based on Treasury yields. This result suggests to the authors that the\nFed may have lost, or been on the verge of losing, at least some of its inflation-fighting\ncredibility. Such a loss of credibility would obviously be problematic. For one thing, it would\nincrease the amount by which the Fed would have to increase rates to offset any given\ninflationary shock. 3\nIt’s not clear to me, however, that the Fed’s credibility was actually under such serious\nthreat. Even taking the results at face value, the increase in expected inflation was small.\nFigure 5.3 in the paper reveals, in particular, that for three of their four measures, expected\ninflation in 2008 was only about one-tenth of a percentage point higher than what it would have\nbeen in the absence of any increase in the price of oil over this period.\nBut I think there are good reasons not to take these results at face value. Consider, first,\nthe authors’ choice of survey measures. They argue that an increase in readings from the\nMichigan survey—following years of stability—reflects increasing inflation expectations. But\nthey discount the stability of inflation expectations in the Survey of Professional Forecasters\n(SPF), arguing that it indicates “…forecast inertia rather than a super-credible central bank.” I\nfind the authors’ preference for consumer surveys over those of professional forecasters\nsurprising since it is usually argued that households pay less attention to the latest data than do\n\n3\n\nSee, for example, Orphanides and Williams (2004, 2007).\n\n3\n\n\fthe professionals who are paid to make these forecasts. Moreover, households probably update\ntheir forecasts of inflation less frequently than professionals. It’s also worth pointing out that the\nlack of responsiveness of professional forecasts to relative price shocks appears to be a recent\nphenomenon, likely due, in my view, to increased Fed credibility and not some newly acquired\ninertia on the part of the forecasters. Research by my staff shows that while the SPF forecasts\nwere sensitive to headline inflation data in the past, these forecasts have responded in recent\nyears to core rather than headline inflation data. 4 This finding suggests that professional\nforecasters no longer expect relative price changes to have a persistent effect on inflation.\nI would also take issue with the authors’ assumption that oil prices are exogenous. For\none thing, this assumption is at odds with the paper’s extended discussion about how the price of\noil is determined by economic developments in the U.S. and other countries. Moreover, the\nassumption is probably not innocuous: previous research has shown that treating oil as\nendogenous in such models can greatly reduce the estimated effects of oil shocks. 5\nLast, and certainly not least, I would question the authors’ conclusion that inflation\nexpectations have become unanchored based on their finding that oil prices help predict the\nMichigan survey measures of expected inflation. This finding does imply that a jump in the\nprice of oil causes expected inflation to increase for a time. But it does not prove that the\nincrease is permanent rather than transitory. A permanent response of expected inflation to a\nchange in oil prices requires either that the expectations process be nonstationary or that oil\nprices be expected to continue rising forever. In other words, the authors’ finding of a link\nbetween oil prices and survey measures of expected inflation is perfectly consistent with a\n\n4\n\nTrehan (2009).\n\n5\n\nSee Trehan (1986) and Barsky and Kilian (2004) for discussions of this issue.\n\n4\n\n\ftemporary impact of oil price shocks on both inflation and inflation expectations. Importantly,\nthese are precisely the responses that are consistent with well-anchored expectations—except, of\ncourse, if consumers believe that the Fed would absorb the hit of an oil shock entirely in the form\nof reduced output.\nLet me turn now to the second exercise in the paper, which involves simulating a new\nKeynesian model to examine the effects of oil shocks. As the authors point out, their\nspecification reproduces a standard feature of such models, which is that it is better for monetary\npolicy to target core inflation than headline inflation. But the authors then proceed to conduct an\nunusual simulation. To mimic the pattern of oil price increases from 2002 to 2008, they subject\nthe model to a sequence of 26 quarterly shocks in which the average increase in the price of oil is\nabout 7½ percent. While they present results for several different parameter combinations, the\ntypical outcome entails a core inflation rate that is about 2 to 4 percentage points higher than the\nassumed inflation target of around 1¾ percent. The authors argue that such a sequence of oil\nprice and inflation increases could cause inflation expectations to become unanchored. The\nimplication is that the Fed should have tightened policy more than it did to keep expectations\nfrom being cast adrift.\nA key element of their simulation is the assumption of a long period of increasing oil\nprices. Was it reasonable to expect such an outcome on a priori grounds? We can use the\nauthors’ elegant framework to answer this question. The first factor that is relevant in\nforecasting oil prices in that framework is the price of oil in the ground, as determined by the\nHotelling model. However, the authors do not argue that this price changed substantially over\nthe last five years or so. The second relevant factor is the behavior of q. In the authors’\nframework, q should be expected to converge toward unity in the medium to long term. Thus,\n\n5\n\n\fthe theory of the oil market presented in the paper suggests that forecasters during the 2002–\n2008 period should have expected oil prices to gradually revert to more “normal” levels over\ntime, once q exceeded one. Of course, the model does not pin down precisely what might\nhappen to the market price of oil for the next four, six or even eight quarters. Oil prices are\nnotoriously hard to predict at these (and indeed at all) horizons, and there is plenty of room to\nargue about the role played by fundamentals, special factors, speculation, etc. But throughout\nmost of this period, futures prices were predicting, even as oil prices rose, that oil prices would\nnot rise further—and certainly not for six years running. And these were the most important\nreal-time indicators of market expectations available to the Fed. Of course, futures-market\nforecasts proved wrong, ex post. But it seems to me now, as it did at the time, that there were\nneither strong empirical nor theoretical reasons to forecast that oil prices would continue rising\nfor six years.\nSince the improbable did in fact come to pass and the Fed tightened less than the authors\nconsider optimal, it seems entirely appropriate to consider the costs of the Fed’s policy judgment.\nThe authors note that the onset of the recession makes it all but impossible to get an\nunambiguous answer, and I agree. But I still think we can form some judgments based on the\nbehavior of inflation during the more-than-five-year period, ending in mid-2008, during which\noil prices kept moving higher. In 2001—the year before oil prices began to rise—core PCE price\ninflation was 1.9 percent. It averaged 2.2 percent over 2005–2007 and registered 2.2 percent\nduring the first half of 2008. So, core inflation did rise somewhat. We can debate just how\nmuch of that increase should be attributed to oil shocks, rising capacity utilization levels, and the\nwearing-off of the unusual sequence of productivity shocks of the late 1990s, which had helped\nto push inflation to an unusually low level for a time. The important point, though, is that the\n\n6\n\n\factual increase in core inflation fell far short of the increase predicted by the model simulations\npresented in the paper.\nDuring the period of rising oil prices and high headline inflation, policymakers paid\nclose attention to the behavior of wages for possible signs that higher inflationary expectations\nmight be spilling over into wage bargains. Reassuringly, there was little evidence of any\nincrease in the rate of wage growth, a linkage that I consider necessary for a sustained increase in\nthe inflation rate. For instance, after increasing at a 4.3 percent pace in 2001—the year before oil\nprices began their sustained increase—the Employment Cost Index rose by an average of a little over 3.2\npercent per year over 2005–2007 and at an annual rate of 2.8 percent in the first half of 2008. Other\n\ncompensation measures also reveal relatively steady wage growth during this period. 6 So, data\non wages, like those on core inflation, reveal little evidence of any impact resulting from the long\nsequence of large oil price shocks.\nThe authors attribute the lack of any sizable run-up in core inflation to other shocks that\nmay have hit the economy at the same time. But it is important to emphasize that a significant\nbody of recent research instead suggests that the measured effect of oil price shocks has\ndiminished over the last several decades. Over a decade ago, Hooker (1996) showed that the\neffect of oil price shocks had diminished since the early 1980s and subsequent research has\nverified this finding. In fact, this influential research has shifted the academic debate concerning\noil shocks, with some authors now questioning whether such shocks were ever actually as\nimportant as was believed in the 1970s (Barsky and Kilian, 2004, Bernanke, Gertler, Watson,\n\n6\n\nOther wage and compensation measures reveal the same general behavior. Total compensation per hour in the\nnonfarm business sector rose by 4.1 percent in 2001, an average of 4 percent over 2005–2007, and by 2.4 percent at\nan annual rate in the first half of 2008. Average hourly earnings rose by 3.8 percent in 2001, an average of 3.6\npercent per year over 2005–2007, and at a 3.8 percent rate in the first half of 2008.\n\n7\n\n\f1997) and others investigating what structural changes in the economy may have diminished the\nimpact of such shocks (Blanchard and Gali, 2007).\nIt seems to me that a change in the conduct of monetary policy following the experience\nof the 1970s has probably caused inflation expectations to become better anchored, explaining\nwhy recent oil shocks have inflicted relatively little damage on the economy. This hypothesis\ncould at least partly explain why the huge run-up in energy prices through the middle of last year\nwas not accompanied by rising wage demands. That in turn enabled the Fed to follow an easier\nmonetary policy that gave greater weight to the output effect of rising oil prices than would have\notherwise been possible.\nSince mid-2008, oil prices have, of course, plummeted. But the extraordinary weakness\nin the economy means that the usual trade-offs associated with such supply shocks are absent\nright now. Any boost to spending from falling oil prices will be more than welcome in the\ncurrent circumstances. And with inflation now below desirable levels, a decline in inflationary\nexpectations that could push core inflation down over time would be most unwelcome. I argued\nearlier that the Fed’s inflation credibility helped over a number of years to keep inflationary\nexpectations anchored in the face of rising oil prices and high headline inflation. My hope is that\ninflationary expectations will remain similarly well-anchored now, serving to stabilize core\ninflation. The FOMC’s recently released longer-run inflation projections should be useful in this\nregard, helping to reinforce inflation expectations of around 2 percent.\nTo conclude, let me emphasize that I enjoyed reading the paper and found the discussion\nof recent developments quite informative. But, the arguments in this paper did not persuade me\nto change my opinion of recent Fed policy. As I noted, during the period of rising oil prices,\nthere was little evidence that policy was inappropriate: labor compensation growth remained well\n\n8\n\n\fcontained and inflation persistence appeared to be low, most likely because of increased Fed\ncredibility. The Fed must always be vigilant in guarding its inflation credibility. But I did not\nthink then, and I do not think now with the benefit of hindsight, that expectations became or\nwere close to becoming unanchored at any point. Nor do I think that the Fed should have taken\nout substantial insurance against the possible consequences of a highly unlikely sequence of\nshocks, especially when a growing body of research suggested that the impact of oil shocks had\ndeclined substantially since the 1970s.\n\nReferences\n\nBarsky, Robert B., and Lutz Kilian. 2004. “Oil and the Macroeconomy Since the 1970s.” Journal of\nEconomic Perspectives 18(4), pp. 115–134.\nBernanke, Ben S., Mark Gertler, and Mark Watson. 1997. “Systematic Monetary Policy and the Effects of\nOil Price Shocks.” Working Paper 97-25, C.V.

        "content": "Presentation to the 128th Assembly for Bank Directors\nBig Island, Hawaii\nBy Janet L. Yellen, President and CEO, Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco\nFor delivery on February 6, 2009, 12:45 PM Hawaii time, 2:45 PM Pacific, 5:45 PM Eastern\n\nThe Economic Outlook for 2009 and Community Banks 1\nGood afternoon and thank you for asking me to speak at your assembly. I’m glad to\nappear before bank directors because—as you know all too well—your industry is at the center\nof the turbulence now swirling around our economy. I look forward to your insights and\nquestions.\nI don’t need to tell you that our financial system has, in many important areas, broken\ndown, and this has precipitated a very serious credit crunch. Banks have played a role in the\ncredit crunch by tightening their terms and standards for lending. Tighter credit terms are a\nnatural response by banks to the losses they have suffered and the deterioration in the economic\nclimate. But diminished access to credit for households and businesses is intensifying the\neconomic contraction and, in turn, exacerbating financial distress. These negative dynamics are\ncreating the perception of intense uncertainty about the future, prompting a loss in confidence\nthat has left households and firms extremely wary about spending. In this environment,\ngovernment policies to restore confidence, create jobs by boosting the demand for goods and\nservices, and improve the functioning of our financial system, represent our main hope of\navoiding a very severe economic contraction. Fortunately, many innovative and bold policy\nsteps have already been implemented, or are being considered, by the Federal Reserve and the\n\n1\n\nI would like to thank John Judd, David Wright, and Sam Zuckerman for assistance in preparing these\nremarks.\n\n1\n\n\ffederal government, and this provides me with a measure of optimism that we may avoid the\nsignificant downside risks that we face.\nToday, I will give you my perspective on financial and economic conditions, and discuss\nthe implications for community banks. As always, my comments represent my own views and\nnot necessarily those of my colleagues in the Federal Reserve System.\nEconomic conditions\nLet me turn to the current economic situation. Unfortunately, there is not much good\nnews to report. Over a year into the recession, the U.S. economy is contracting sharply, and that\nweakness is evident in every sector.\nLet’s begin with the largest sector—consumer spending, which represents about 70\npercent of gross domestic product. It fell sharply in the third and fourth quarters of last year. As\na consequence, retailers experienced a dreadful holiday season and many are now shuttering\nstores and even declaring bankruptcy. Such retrenchment in consumer spending is\nunderstandable, given the truly tough conditions that households face. This morning’s dismal\nemployment data show that nonfarm jobs have declined for 13 months in a row. Since peaking\nin December 2007, some 3.6 million jobs have been lost. The unemployment rate now stands at\n7.6 percent, up from just under 5 percent a year ago. With respect to wealth, the combined\nimpact of falling equity and house prices has been staggering. Household wealth has declined by\nan estimated $10 trillion. Nor can households easily borrow to fund spending—consumer credit\nis both costlier and harder to get. Not surprisingly, consumer confidence is at a 30-year low.\nThe recent plunge in vehicle sales, in spite of lower gas prices and huge price incentives, reflects\nthis lack of confidence, as well as the difficulty of getting auto loans. These negative factors far\n2\n\n\foutweigh the boost to consumer spending from the sharp decline in energy prices since the\nmiddle of last year.\nHouseholds are hunkering down. The personal saving rate has jumped from around zero\nearly last year to about 3½ percent recently, as people have tried to rebuild lost wealth and some\ncushion to weather adversities, including possible job loss. While more personal saving\nstrengthens household balance sheets and makes sense for individual families, in current\ncircumstances it is magnifying the depth of the economic contraction.\nThe steep decline in residential investment that began three years ago was the leading\nedge of our current economic and financial problems. Unfortunately, there is no end in sight.\nHousing starts have plummeted over the past year, falling by nearly one-half. It’s hard to see\nwhen starts will bottom out, since inventories of unsold new and existing homes remain at high\nlevels relative to sales. Indeed, the possibility of ongoing contraction in this sector is intensified\nby the economic downturn, the loss in jobs, and the reduced availability of mortgage credit.\nWith the demise of the market for private-label mortgage-backed securities, Fannie Mae and\nFreddie Mac are now the main sources of funding for conventional conforming mortgages.\nVirtually the only piece of good news for housing is that interest rates on these mortgages have\ncome down recently in response to a new Federal Reserve program to purchase agency debt and\nagency-guaranteed mortgage-backed securities. However, the spreads above Treasury rates\ncharged to borrowers seeking nonconforming jumbos have risen sharply, and mortgages are all\nbut unavailable to borrowers with imperfect credit histories or those who can’t make large down\npayments.\n\n3\n\n\fEven beyond its negative implications for the pace of home construction, the ongoing\ndecline in house prices is a concern because it poses downside risks to future consumer spending\nand the health of the financial system. House prices in some of the largest metropolitan areas are\ndown by as much as 35 to 40 percent from their 2006 peak. Unfortunately, futures contracts for\nhouse prices suggest that further declines are likely this year and next. The correction in house\nprices has contributed to delinquencies and foreclosures on subprime and other mortgages. With\nan estimated 15 to 20 percent of homeowners underwater on their mortgages, it is likely that\nforeclosures will continue at a rapid pace throughout this year. The associated losses are\nseriously weakening banks and the financial system more broadly. And, of course, foreclosures\nare extremely painful for homeowners and create negative spillovers for neighbors and afflicted\ncommunities.\nBusiness capital investment is also dropping sharply, as firms face weak demand for their\nproducts, a higher cost of capital, restricted credit, and a high level of uncertainty about the\nfuture. With regard to credit, many companies, especially those with lower credit ratings, must\nnow pay extraordinarily high rates in the bond market. Bank lines of credit are more difficult to\nnegotiate, trade credit is being restricted, and many firms have become cautious in managing\nliquidity and in committing to capital spending projects. Some companies are drawing down\nexisting credit lines to have cash on hand in case these lines are capped by their banks. It is not\nsurprising that many of my business contacts report cancelling or delaying capital investment\nplans and paring back on their workforces in order to avoid being locked into commitments that\nmight prove burdensome.\nNonresidential construction declined modestly at the end of last year but, surprisingly\nenough, has not yet shown the steep declines that have been expected for some time. However,\n4\n\n\fsuch declines are almost surely imminent. With business activity slowing and new buildings\ncoming on line, vacancy rates on office, industrial, and retail space are all on the rise. For\ndevelopers, financing is indeed extremely hard to get. The market for commercial mortgagebacked securities has all but dried up. Banks and other traditional lenders have also become less\nwilling to extend funding. It’s no wonder that my contacts are talking about substantial cutbacks\non new projects and planned capital improvements on existing buildings. I know that this sector\nis of special interest to many community banks, and I will have more to say about this later in my\npresentation.\nThe budgets of many state and local governments have been thrown into crisis by the\nfinancial and economic mess. The downturns in housing, the stock market, and incomes have\nbitten into tax collections at the same time that financial market turmoil has made it harder to\nissue bonds. The aggregate budget deficit for the 50 states as a whole is growing. In response,\nmany states are cutting spending. Of course, the Obama administration’s plans for fiscal\nstimulus include a large dose of funding for state and local projects, and this should provide\nconsiderable support to this sector.\nUnfortunately, the economic downturn is hardly confined to the United States. Economic\ngrowth in the rest of the world—including Europe and Japan—has weakened sharply for a\nnumber of reasons, including spillovers from the U.S. recession and the financial meltdown that\nnow has spread globally. For these reasons, the world economy appears to have entered\nrecession in late 2008, and it seems likely that this contraction may last for some time, especially\nin some important industrial countries. Moreover, the dollar has appreciated over the past year,\nespecially against the euro and the British pound, making U.S. exports more expensive. It is\napparent that we cannot count on strong foreign demand for our exports to offset weakness in\n5\n\n\fdomestic demand. Indeed, real exports fell sharply in the final quarter of last year after years of\nstrong growth.\nNow, let me to turn to inflation. Not so long ago soaring commodity prices were pushing\ninflation to unacceptably high rates. However, things have changed dramatically, as weaker\neconomic activity around the world has reduced the demand for commodities, pushing their\nprices, and inflationary pressures, down substantially. At the same time, rising unemployment\nand unused industrial capacity are also putting downward pressure on inflation. Thus, in the\nfinal quarter of last year, our main measure of consumer inflation—the personal consumption\nexpenditures price index—fell at a 5½-percent rate; and when excluding food and energy prices,\nthis measure rose at only a ½-percent rate, the slowest pace since early 1961. With slack in labor\nand product markets likely to build significantly over the next couple of years, it seems likely\nthat inflation will remain, for some time, below levels that are consistent with price stability.\nAs I have indicated, the economy is in the midst of a downward spiral, and that calls for\nstrong policy responses. Economic weakness and a shortage of credit are inducing increasingly\ncautious households and businesses to spend less to strengthen their balance sheets and “weather\nthe storm.” These spending cuts serve to spread the pain, triggering additional job losses that\ndamage spending and intensifying the distress that weakens the financial system. The case for\npolicy actions—by both the monetary and fiscal authorities—to arrest this cycle and reverse the\ndownward spiral is exceptionally strong. There’s no question that the spiral presents\nextraordinary challenges for policymakers—challenges that, in my view, are the most significant\nand complex since the Great Depression. However, I am encouraged that bold actions are being\ntaken both here and abroad.\n\n6\n\n\fTo address the crisis, the Federal Reserve has taken a panoply of strong actions. In\nparticular, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) has cut its federal funds rate target by\nroughly 5 full percentage points, establishing a target range of 0 to ¼ percent at its December\nmeeting. Although, for all practical purposes, this interest rate cannot be pushed any lower, the\nFed also announced after both its December and January meetings that an exceptionally low\nlevel of the federal funds rate would likely be warranted for some time due to weak economic\nconditions. By offering guidance about the likely course of future short-term interest rates,\nconditional on the Committee’s economic forecast, the Committee hopes to influence longerterm interest rates and asset prices, which in turn affect the spending decisions of households and\nfirms.\nBeyond interest-rate policy, the Fed is using other tools to improve the functioning of\nfinancial markets and to lower longer-term interest rates in support of private spending. A\nvariety of new nonconventional programs rely on the Fed’s balance sheet. These programs serve\ntwo basic purposes. First, they provide a reliable source of liquidity to financial institutions and\nmarkets so that they are more willing to extend credit. Second, these programs directly augment\nthe flow of credit to the private sector.\nTo fulfill our role in providing liquidity, we have crossed traditional boundaries by\nextending the maturity of loans, the range of acceptable collateral, and the range of eligible\nborrowing institutions. As one example, we introduced a new auction system—called the Term\nAuction Facility (TAF)—to distribute discount window loans more effectively. We also have\ngreatly expanded the size of the auctions and the maturity of the allowable loans to address a\npersistent shortage of term funding in the money markets. In addition, we established a discount\nwindow facility for primary dealers and new facilities to provide liquidity to money market\n\n7\n\n\fmutual funds and the commercial paper market. We have also supported the provision of dollar\nliquidity beyond our own shores through a vast expansion of our network of swap lines with\nforeign central banks. Interest rates in a number of key money markets have come down in\nrecent months, and in my judgment, the suite of facilities that the Fed has created to improve\nmoney market conditions is working.\nTo directly improve the flow of credit to the private sector, the Fed announced several new\nprograms in November. In support of the housing sector, the Fed created a $600 billion program\nto purchase agency debt and agency-insured mortgage-backed securities. Yields on mortgagebacked securities and 30-year fixed-rate mortgages fell substantially right after the program was\nannounced, and these rates fell again when the first purchases were made in January. The Fed\nhas developed another very promising program jointly with the Treasury to help restore\nfunctioning in other impaired financial markets, called the Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan\nFacility (TALF). It will support the issuance of securities collateralized by auto, student, credit\ncard, and SBA, or Small Business Administration loans—sectors where the issuance of new\nsecurities has slowed to a trickle. This approach has the potential to be expanded substantially,\nwith higher lending volumes and additional asset classes, such as commercial mortgage-backed\nsecurities.\n\nNow I’d like to say a few words about the role of fiscal policy in the current crisis. Fiscal\npolicy must play two distinct roles. First, it is needed to help restore the financial system to\nbetter health. Much has been done already in this arena through the TARP, which has provided\ncapital to the banking system to stabilize it and encourage more lending, as well as funding for\nthe TALF program with the Federal Reserve, and guarantees against losses for several\nsystemically important financial institutions including Citigroup, Bank of America and AIG.\n8\n\n\fFurther actions are still needed, however, to get credit flowing. The Administration is expected\nto soon propose a comprehensive program to help banks address the bad assets on their balance\nsheets and assist homeowners in avoiding preventable foreclosures. A lesson from past\nexperience with banking crises around the globe is that the removal of bad assets from bank\nbalance sheets, along with the injection of new capital, is needed to restore health to the banking\nsystem. As long as hard-to-value, troubled assets clog their balance sheets, banks find it difficult\nto attract private capital and to focus on new lending.\n\nThe second role for fiscal policy is to provide stimulus to the economy through higher\nspending and tax cuts. In ordinary circumstances, there are good reasons why monetary, rather\nthan fiscal, policy should be used to stabilize the economy. An important argument against using\nfiscal policy to fight recessions is that it often takes a long time to implement due to the\ncomplexity of executive and legislative decision-making processes and the lags involved in\nspending the money that Congress appropriates. The result is that fiscal stimulus sometimes\nkicks in only after the need has passed. However, the current situation is extraordinary, making\nthe case for fiscal action very strong.\n\nOf course, a fiscal stimulus package, involving a combination of tax cuts and spending\nincreases, is a top priority for the new Obama administration and is now moving through\nCongress. There is—and there should be—vigorous debate about the form it should take and\nabout the likely effectiveness of particular fiscal strategies. However, it is critical that decisions\non these matters be made on a timely basis so that the economy’s downward spiral is not allowed\nto deepen.\n\n9\n\n\fPolicy actions by the Fed and federal government that have already been taken, and that\nseem to be in train, offer the prospect that we may be able to avoid dire outcomes for the\neconomy. My best guess is that we may see economic activity begin to grow late this year as\nhousing construction stabilizes and the financial sector begins to heal. But substantial downside\nrisks remain.\n\nBanking conditions\n\nYou are all well aware that current circumstances create formidable problems for banking\norganizations. For some time now, institutions have been taking losses on their holdings of\nresidential mortgages and securities, and on their residential construction and development loans.\nIn addition, losses have been incurred because of exposure to other financial institutions and offbalance-sheet vehicles that were damaged by those same housing-related assets. Moreover, as\nthe recession has deepened, we have seen rising credit problems in traditional commercial and\nconsumer loan portfolios. As a result, many banks are taking large provisions for expected\nlosses. Judging from the data so far, it appears likely that the commercial banking industry will\nincur a significant loss in the fourth quarter, and that the results for 2008 as a whole will be the\nweakest since at least the banking crisis of the early 1990s.\nTraditionally, the crest of bank credit losses has extended for some time beyond the end\nof recessions. This is not surprising, given that the unemployment rate typically peaks well after\nbusiness cycle troughs. As a result, and given the outlook for the economy, I would expect to\nsee more deterioration in corporate, commercial real estate, and consumer portfolios over the\ncourse of this year and into next year. How well any individual bank fares during this especially\ndifficult credit cycle will depend on the quality of its past and present underwriting; ongoing risk\n10\n\n\fmanagement practices; and the profitability of its core lending, deposit-taking, and feegenerating operations.\nMany community banks have significant commercial real estate concentrations, and these\nloans are a particular concern in the current environment. At present, the performance of such\nloans has deteriorated only mildly. But, as I suggested earlier, we can’t count on that situation to\ncontinue, since the downturn in commercial real estate construction is just getting started and is\nlikely to be quite challenging.\nOne saving grace is that many commercial real estate loans currently do not have the\nsame characteristics that infected the residential real estate boom or the commercial real estate\ncycles in the early 1980s and 1990s. In recent years, underwriting standards on commercial real\nestate loans generally have been fairly conservative. By and large, lenders have focused on\nmaking loans supported by significant cash flow and have required relatively conservative loanto-value ratios. The equity cushions on many of these loans, coupled with low interest rates,\nshould give borrowers quite a bit of “breathing room.” Still, as commercial real estate loans and\nrelated securities are refinanced amid rising vacancies, falling collateral values, and an economic\nrecession, we can expect higher delinquencies, defaults, and losses.\nThis situation represents an obvious challenge to risk-management practices, putting a\npremium on active monitoring and stress-testing. These stress tests can provide bank\nmanagement with advance warnings of the potential effects of higher-than-expected vacancies\nand falling collateral values on their borrowers’ ability to perform and on the bank’s potential\nlosses. This analysis in turn can be used to evaluate the full effect of a commercial real estate\n\n11\n\n\fconcentration on the bank’s earnings and capital, and lead to better decision-making throughout\nthe cycle.\nLarge real estate losses could put pressure on capital levels and should therefore prompt\nbanks to review their dividend policies. In this highly volatile period, when future, but currently\nunidentified, losses are highly likely and capital markets are still not functioning well, capital\nmaintenance is critical.\nIn addition, banks must be attentive to liquidity. Over the past year, we have seen that\nlarge and small banks alike can be extremely vulnerable to losses in confidence, and that past\nchoices in funding a bank’s operations may severely constrain efforts to take corrective action.\nEven multiple sources of liquidity can dry up at the same time, undermining the effectiveness of\ncontingency plans for maintaining access to funding. Many community banks have relied\nsignificantly on Federal Home Loan Bank advances and brokered deposits. While these sources\nof funds can be managed, they do pose risks. For example, the amount of a bank’s borrowing\ncapacity can quickly decline when Home Loan Bank collateral margin requirements tighten.\nSimilarly, institutions whose capital ratios fall from the well-capitalized category to the\nadequately capitalized category may not be permitted to acquire or roll over brokered deposits,\nresulting in liquidity strains.\nAs I have indicated, the work of public officials to stabilize the financial system and\nimprove the flow of credit should help banks meet challenges in these tougher economic times.\nThe measures taken by the Fed, Treasury, and the FDIC have buttressed public confidence,\nprovided new sources of liquidity, and helped cushion banks from losses. All of these special\nmeasures reflect a recognition that banking organizations play a unique and essential role in the\nU.S. economy.\n12\n\n\fIt’s also important to acknowledge that banking organizations find themselves under\nintense scrutiny and are subject to conflicting pressures. At a time of nearly unparalleled\nchallenges for financial institutions, you find yourselves called on simultaneously to preserve\ncapital, avoid excessive risk, and step up your lending. Policymakers are mindful how difficult it\ncan be to balance those mandates. In November, the Fed, the FDIC, the Office of the\nComptroller of the Currency, and the Office of Thrift Supervision issued a joint statement to help\nbanks and thrifts navigate these waters. The statement noted that “at this critical time, it is\nimperative that all banking organizations and their regulators work together to ensure that the\nneeds of creditworthy borrowers are met.” The statement also noted that “prudent bank lending\npractices” should be carried out “consistent with safety and soundness principles and existing\nsupervisory standards.”\nThe policy objective has been to equip banking organizations to serve the needs of\ncreditworthy borrowers by augmenting their capital, providing FDIC guarantees of debt,\nenhanced deposit insurance, and better access to liquidity. In the current circumstances, banks,\nlike households and firms, may be tempted to hunker down. My hope is that, while avoiding\nimprudent practices that would put your institutions at risk, you will also resist extreme risk\naversion, since it would undermine efforts to get the economy going again.\nIn sum, 2009 is shaping up to be, by many measures, the most challenging economic\nenvironment of the postwar period. At the same time though, the vigorous application of\nmonetary and fiscal policy offer the prospect of improvement. I am hopeful that the steps\npolicymakers are taking will stabilize the financial system and provide the broader economy with\na foundation for renewed growth.\n\n13\n\n\f"

I am very\npleased that one of my first speeches of the year is to the Financial Women’s Association.\nThose of you who work in the financial sector are keenly aware of the problems we now\nface in the financial markets and the economy, and I very much welcome your questions\nand insights.\nAs you all know, sound, well-functioning financial markets and institutions are\nessential to a sound, well-functioning economy. They provide the credit that firms\nrequire to finance inventory, hire workers, and invest in new capital equipment and that\nhouseholds need to buy houses and cars and to send their kids to college.\nToday, financial markets have, in many cases, broken down and the ramifications\nfor the economy have been severe due to the essential interconnections between the two:\nFinancial distress precipitated a credit crunch, sending the economy into recession. And\nweakness in the economy has intensified financial distress, further diminishing access to\ncredit. These ongoing, negative dynamics create severe downside economic risks, and\nthe perception of intense uncertainty about the future has prompted a loss in confidence,\nleaving households and firms wary about spending. For example, consumers are pulling\nback on purchases, especially on durable goods, to save more, and businesses are\n1\n\nI would like to thank John Judd, Rob Valletta and Judith Goff for outstanding assistance in preparing\nthese remarks.\n\n1\n\n\fcancelling capital investment plans and laying off workers to preserve cash. Such actions\nare sensible on an individual basis, but they intensify economic distress for the economy\nas a whole.\nI consider it imperative for policymakers to act boldly to restore confidence and\nimprove the functioning of financial markets in order to get the economy back on its feet.\nThe Federal Reserve has already implemented aggressive, creative, and substantial\npolicies, and more can be done. In addition, there is now a consensus that the economy\nneeds strong fiscal action, and prospects are good that a federal stimulus program will be\nforthcoming. Finally, I am heartened that policymakers around the world are responding\nforcefully and cooperatively to address the financial and economic crisis as it has spread\nthroughout the global economy. My goal today is to give you my perspective on the\nfinancial and economic turmoil and to discuss and explain the policy responses and their\nrationales. As always, my comments represent my own views and not necessarily those\nof my colleagues in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nEconomic conditions\nI will begin with a review of current economic conditions. Unfortunately, there is\nnot much good news to report. Recent data indicate that, over a year into the current\nrecession, the U.S. economy is still contracting sharply. For example, the latest Blue\nChip consensus estimates that output declined at an annual rate of over 5 percent last\nquarter and is likely to continue contracting, at a pace exceeding 3 percent, in the current\nquarter.\n\n2\n\n\fEconomic weakness is evident in every sector of the economy. After declining\nslightly in the third quarter, real personal consumption expenditures appear to have fallen\nmore sharply in the fourth. Such retrenchment in consumer spending is understandable,\ngiven the truly tough conditions that households face, but especially troubling because\nthis sector represents over 70 percent of GDP. With respect to jobs, employment has\ndeclined for twelve months in a row, and the unemployment rate now stands at 7¼\npercent up from 5 percent just a year ago. With respect to wealth, the combined impact\nof falling equity and house prices has been staggering. Household wealth has declined by\nan estimated $10 trillion. With respect to consumer credit, it is both costlier and harder to\nget. Not surprisingly, consumer confidence is at a 30-year low and the personal saving\nrate is on the rise, as people try to rebuild their wealth and provide a cushion against the\npossibility of job loss. The recent plunge in vehicle sales, in spite of lower gas prices and\nhuge price incentives, reflects this lack of confidence as well as the difficulties people are\nhaving in getting auto loans.\nBusiness spending is also feeling the crunch, as firms face weak demand for their\nproducts, a higher cost of capital, and restricted credit. In particular, many companies,\nespecially those with lower credit ratings, are experiencing difficulty borrowing in the\ncommercial paper market, an important source of short-term funding. Bank lines of\ncredit reportedly are more difficult to negotiate, trade credit is being restricted, and many\nfirms have become cautious in managing liquidity and in committing to capital spending\nprojects. Some companies are drawing down existing credit lines to have cash on hand in\ncase these lines are capped by their bank. This caution has spread to venture capital\nspending as well, where activity has dropped significantly; in consequence, information\n\n3\n\n\ftechnology and biotech companies in Silicon Valley and elsewhere are scaling back on\nbusiness expansion plans.\nNonresidential construction, surprisingly enough, has continued to show some\ngrowth up to this point, but this is not likely to last much longer. I’m hearing talk about\nsubstantial cutbacks on new projects and planned capital improvements on existing\nbuildings for two all-too-familiar reasons—demand is falling as the economy weakens\nand financing is hard to get. In particular, the market for commercial mortgage-backed\nsecurities, a mainstay for financing large projects, has all but dried up. Banks and other\ntraditional lenders have also become less willing to extend funding.\nAlthough residential investment accounts for under 5 percent of overall economic\nactivity, the decline in this sector over the past three years has been big enough to create a\nmajor drag on growth. Housing starts have plummeted, falling to nearly one-half of their\nyear-ago level, and it is hard to see when they will bottom out, since inventories of unsold\nnew and existing homes remain at high levels relative to sales. Indeed, the possibility of\nongoing contraction in this sector is intensified by the economic downturn, the loss in\njobs, and the reduced availability of mortgage credit. At this point, the market for\nprivate-label mortgage-backed securities is essentially closed for business, leaving the\ngovernment agencies, especially Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, as the main source of\nfunding or backing for conventional conforming mortgages. One piece of good news is\nthat interest rates on conforming mortgages have come down recently in response to a\nnew Federal Reserve program to purchase agency debt and significant quantities of\nagency-guaranteed mortgage-backed securities.\n\n4\n\n\fThe ongoing decline in house prices is a source of particular concern not only\nbecause of its impact on consumer spending, but also because it contributes importantly\nto delinquencies and foreclosures on subprime and other mortgages. Foreclosures are\nextremely painful for homeowners and create negative spillovers for neighbors and\nafflicted communities. As you may know, some of the earliest and sharpest price\ndeclines nationwide occurred in parts of California and other western states, such as\nArizona and Nevada. Foreclosure rates in these states are well above their historic highs\ndating back at least to the late 1970s, and home prices in the largest metro areas are down\nby as much as 35 to 40 percent from their 2006 peak. Unfortunately, futures contracts for\nhouse prices suggest that further declines are likely this year and next.\nMany state and local governments have been dragged into the financial mess.\nThe downturns in the housing markets and the economy have bitten into tax collections at\nthe same time that the financial market turmoil has made it harder to issue bonds. These\nproblems are particularly acute in California. Despite a successful bond issuance in\nOctober, ongoing erosion in revenues has raised the possibility that the state will run out\nof money in February. The latest projection is for a deficit of about $40 billion that will\naccumulate over the current and next fiscal year. This is a huge shortfall relative to\nannual revenue of $100 billion, and the actions needed to overcome it are only likely to\nadd to the recession in the state.\nMoving from the local to the global, the situation is not much brighter. The\nstrong foreign demand for our exports that gave a major boost to the U.S. economy\nthrough the third quarter of last year is not likely to continue. Economic growth in the\nrest of the world, particularly in Europe and Japan, has weakened sharply for a number of\n\n5\n\n\freasons, including spillovers from the U.S. recession and from the financial meltdown\nthat now has spread globally. In addition, the dollar has appreciated against the euro and\nBritish pound over the past year, offsetting a portion of the depreciation that was\nsupporting U.S. exports. For these reasons, it now looks likely that the data will show\nworldwide recession in late 2008 and early 2009, with a more severe and long-lasting\ncontraction in many industrial countries.\nTo conclude my review of current conditions, let me to turn to inflation. Not so\nlong ago we were worried about rising inflation in the wake of soaring commodity prices.\nThose days are gone. Weaker economic activity around the world has reduced the\ndemand for commodities, pushing their prices, and inflationary pressures, down\nsubstantially. At the same time, rising unemployment and unused industrial capacity are\nalso putting downward pressure on inflation. In fact, with slack in labor and product\nmarkets likely to build significantly over the next couple of years, it seems likely that\ninflation will move, for a time, below levels that are consistent with price stability.\n\nConventional Federal Reserve policies\nBy now, I hope my remarks have made it clear that the interaction between the\nfinancial shock and the recession, as well as the associated crisis in confidence, present\nextraordinary challenges for policymakers—challenges that certainly are the most\nsignificant and complex since the deep recession in 1980-82, and perhaps since the Great\nDepression. An important lesson from both theory and history is that such circumstances\ncall for prompt and aggressive policy action. I believe we have heeded that lesson,\nresponding vigorously. The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) has cut its federal\n\n6\n\n\ffunds rate target by roughly 5 full percentage points, lowering it essentially to its “zero\nbound,” by establishing a target range of 0 to ¼ percent at its meeting last December.\n\nFederal Reserve communications policy\nObviously, with the funds rate at the zero bound, the Committee cannot push it any\nlower to stimulate the economy. But that does not mean that the Committee is out of\noptions. An extensive body of literature suggests that communications can play a helpful\nrole in addressing the zero-bound constraint. In particular, by offering guidance about the\nlikely course of future short-term interest rates, conditional on the Committee’s economic\nforecast, the Fed may be able to influence longer-term rates and asset prices. The Fed\nemployed such an approach between 2003 and 2005, and has taken an important step\nalong the same path in its December announcement by stating that “exceptionally low\nlevels of the federal funds rate” are likely to be warranted “for some time” due to “weak\neconomic conditions.”\nCommunication also can be important in the Fed’s efforts to anchor long-term\ninflation expectations. As I mentioned at the outset, the odds are high that over the next\nfew years, inflation will decline below desirable levels. It is especially important in such\ncircumstances for the Fed to emphasize its commitment to returning inflation over time to\nthe higher levels that are most appropriate to the attainment of its longer-term objectives.\nA decline in inflationary expectations when economic conditions are weak is pernicious,\nespecially so when the federal funds rate has reached the zero bound, because any\ndowndrift in inflation expectations leads to an updrift in real interest rates and a\ntightening of financial conditions.\n\n7\n\n\fOver the past few years, the FOMC has taken important incremental steps toward\nmaking its longer-term inflation goals more explicit. For example, we are now\npublishing FOMC members’ inflation forecasts for the next three years under the\nassumption of “appropriate monetary policy,” and the publication of such forecasts has\nhelped shape public understanding concerning the range of inflation outcomes that\nFOMC members regard as desirable in the longer term. Looking forward, there could be\nscope for the Committee to improve the clarity of these communications. I am optimistic\nthat, by clearly communicating the Fed’s commitment to low and stable inflation and by\nbacking that commitment up with determined policy actions should the need arise, any\ndeflationary pressures caused by the weak economy can be contained.\n\nThe Federal Reserve’s balance sheet policies\nBeyond interest rate policy, the Fed has other tools at its disposal to improve the\nfunctioning of financial markets and to lower longer-term interest rates to support private\nspending. Indeed, the Fed has done a lot already through “nonconventional” programs\nthat use its balance sheet. These programs serve two main purposes: first, to provide a\nreliable source of liquidity to financial institutions and markets and second, to augment\nthe flow of credit to the private sector.\nThe provision of liquidity is important to prevent “runs” that create systemic risks\nto the economy as a whole. The Federal Reserve has long fulfilled this “lender of last\nresort” function for commercial banks, which have been protected both with access to the\nFed’s discount window and deposit insurance. In the current crisis, however, systemic\nrisk has been a concern for some financial institutions outside the commercial banking\n\n8\n\n\fsector. I am referring particularly to institutions comprising the so-called “shadow\nbanking sector.” This sector includes investment banks that commonly finance their\nsecurities portfolios through very short-term repurchase agreements with money market\nmutual funds and Structured Investment Vehicles (SIVs) and conduits—entities that issue\nshort-term asset-backed commercial paper to fund holdings of higher-yielding assetbacked securities. Entities like these subject the economy to systemic risk, because, like\nbanks, they are subject to runs. Indeed, any institution, however sound, that borrows very\nshort to hold a portfolio of longer-term, illiquid assets may be unable to satisfy the\ndemands of their lenders for repayment when they flee en masse.\nThe Fed’s balance sheet programs are also intended to augment the flow of credit\nto households and firms, thereby offsetting, at least in part, the reduced flow of credit\nfrom financial institutions and markets. One reason that the availability of credit has\ndiminished is because the markets for most asset-backed securities, with the exception of\nagency-guaranteed mortgage-backed securities, are highly impaired so that issuance has\ndiminished to a trickle. A second cause of the credit crunch is that financial institutions,\nespecially those in the shadow banking sector are scaling back their balance sheets.\nThese institutions suffer from a shortage of capital—or, to put it another way, are too\nhighly leveraged. Unfortunately, the commercial banking sector is unable to pick up all\nof the slack, in spite of the recent capital injections they have received, because banks are\nafflicted with losses from write-downs of impaired assets and mounting credit losses,\nparticularly on real estate loans.\nI’d like to next sketch out some of the programs that the Fed has already put in\nplace to provide liquidity and increase the flow of credit and address some frequently\n\n9\n\n\fasked questions about the Fed’s unconventional policies: Are they working? What is the\nscope for expanding these policies? How does the Fed’s approach compare to the\nquantitative easing policy implemented by the Bank of Japan between 2001 and 2006?\nTo fulfill our role in providing liquidity to financial institutions and markets, we\nhave crossed traditional boundaries by extending the maturity of the loans, the range of\nacceptable collateral, and the range of eligible borrowing institutions. We introduced a\nnew auction system—called the Term Auction Facility (TAF)—to distribute discount\nwindow loans more effectively, and then greatly expanded the size and term of the\nauctions to address a persistent shortage of term funding in the money markets. We have\nalso supported the provision of dollar liquidity beyond our own shores through a vast\nexpansion of our network of swap lines with foreign central banks.\nWe realized early on that stabilizing the financial system would require lending\nnot only to institutions in the traditional banking sector but also to those in the shadow\nbanking sector. Doing so required invoking section 13(3) of the Federal Reserve Act,\nwhich authorizes lending to nonbanks only in “unusual and exigent circumstances.” For\nexample, it was used to facilitate the acquisition of Bear Stearns and to stabilize AIG and\nCitigroup—three systemically important financial firms. This authority was also used to\nestablish a discount window facility for primary dealers—the Primary Dealer Credit\nFacility (PDCF)—and a new facility to enhance the ability of primary dealers to finance\ntheir securities inventories through the market for repurchase agreements—the Term\nSecurities Lending Facility (TSLF).\nThe collapse of Lehman and the near-collapse of AIG this past fall triggered severe\ndisruptions in short-term money markets, as investors in prime money market mutual\n\n10\n\n\ffunds fled to the safety of the shortest-term Treasury securities to the point that the threemonth T-bill rate hovered near zero. These disruptions also triggered dysfunction in the\ncommercial paper market, a large and important source of short-term financing for both\nfinancial and nonfinancial corporations. In response, the Fed set up new facilities to\nprovide liquidity to money market funds and the commercial paper market.\nIn my judgment, the suite of facilities that the Fed has created to improve money\nmarket conditions is working. Conditions are still abnormal, but money market\nfunctioning has improved markedly relative to the dark days of last September and\nOctober. For example, term Libor rates have declined along with the spreads of these\nrates over the federal funds rate. Since term Libor rates are a benchmark for many\nadjustable-rate loans, including mortgages, the benefits of these reductions are rippling\nthroughout the private sector. For highly rated commercial paper eligible for the\nCommercial Paper Funding Facility (CPFF), spreads have also narrowed substantially.\nTo improve the flow of credit to the private sector, the Federal Reserve\nannounced several new programs in November. In this arena there remains considerable\nscope for further action. In particular, in support of the housing sector, the Fed\nannounced and commenced a $600 billion program to purchase agency debt and agencyinsured mortgage-backed securities. Yields on mortgage-backed securities and 30-year\nfixed-rate mortgages fell substantially right after the program was announced, and these\nrates fell again when the first purchases were made earlier this month. Moreover, there\nhas been an upsurge in refinancing activity in recent weeks. The FOMC could also\nexpand its purchases of longer-term Treasury debt, which might lower government\nborrowing rates and spill over into private borrowing rates more broadly.\n\n11\n\n\fThe Fed has developed another very promising program to help restore functioning\nin other impaired financial markets. It is called the Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan\nFacility (TALF), and it will support the issuance of securities collateralized by auto,\nstudent, credit card, and SBA, or Small Business Administration loans—sectors where\nthe issuance of new securities has slowed to a trickle. The high borrowing spreads on\nsuch securities, even when the underlying loans are government-guaranteed—as in the\ncase of SBA and many student loans—suggest not only heightened credit risk but also an\nimpairment of market liquidity which the facilities can address. By improving the\nfunctioning of markets for securitized assets, the Fed has the potential to boost privatesector credit flows in support of the economy. This new facility is a joint Fed-Treasury\ninitiative; cooperation with the Treasury is necessary because the program entails some\nrisk of loss and, under the Federal Reserve Act, all Fed lending must be appropriately\nsecured.\nThe approach employed by the TALF has the potential to be expanded\nsubstantially, with higher lending volumes and additional asset classes, such as\ncommercial and non-agency residential mortgage-backed securities. As I noted, these\nmarkets have all but dried up since the credit crisis began, and the shortage of credit in\nthese critical sectors has made private borrowing costs exceptionally high.\nThe use of the Fed’s balance sheet to stimulate the economy might seem quite a lot\nlike the “quantitative easing” policy pursued by the Bank of Japan in the early 2000s,\nwhen it was at the zero bound. However, to my mind, the differences outweigh the\nsimilarities. The main similarity is that the Fed, like the Bank of Japan, has increased the\ntotal quantity of bank reserves well above the minimum level required to push overnight\n\n12\n\n\finterbank lending rates—in our case, the federal funds rate—to the vicinity of the zero\nbound. The creation of such a large volume of reserves, in the Fed’s case, results from\nthe enormous expansion in discount window lending, foreign exchange swaps, and asset\npurchases through our various liquidity facilities. In the Bank of Japan’s case, the\nexpansion in reserves resulted from the deliberate adoption of an explicit numerical target\nfor them. The concept underlying the Bank of Japan’s intervention was that banks might\nbe encouraged to lend by replacing their holdings of short-term government securities\nwith excess cash. However, near the zero bound, short-term government securities and\ncash are almost perfect substitutes, so exchanging one for the other should have little\neffect on banks’ desire to lend. And the Japanese experience suggests that simply\nexpanding bank reserves—even by a very large amount—had little effect on bank lending\nor on the economy more broadly.\nThe consequence of all of the Fed’s balance sheet initiatives is that our balance\nsheet has ballooned from about $900 billion at the beginning of 2008 to more than $2\ntrillion currently—and is rising. However, the impact of the totality of Fed programs\nshould not be judged by the overall size of the Fed’s balance sheet. Instead, that size will\nbe the result of decisions concerning the appropriate scale of each particular program and\nthe extent to which the various programs and facilities are actually used by market\nparticipants. The take-up rates on these programs and facilities are likely to fluctuate\nover time as market conditions change. For example, early in a new Fed lending\nprogram, its impact on economic activity might rise with the associated expansion of the\nFed’s balance sheet. Later on, if the program helps to improve the functioning of the\nprivate market, success could be associated with the contraction of the Fed’s balance\n\n13\n\n\fsheet as the Fed exits from the market, leaving the determination of credit flows to\nprivate participants. Furthermore, the mere availability of backup liquidity through a\nfacility may improve market functioning, even if the volume of borrowing is low.\n\nFiscal policy\nI’d like to conclude by stepping a bit outside the scope of monetary policy to say a\nfew words about the role of fiscal policy in the current crisis. In ordinary circumstances,\nthere are good reasons why monetary, rather than fiscal, policy should be used for\nstabilization purposes. But we are in extraordinary circumstances, and the case for\nsubstantial fiscal stimulus over the next few years is very strong. First, as I have\nindicated, with the economy contracting significantly, it is time to “pull out all the\nstops”—that is, to deploy both monetary and fiscal policy—to avoid a deep and lingering\nrecession. Second, the case for fiscal stimulus is strengthened by the fact that monetary\npolicy has already moved its short-term interest rate essentially to zero.\nIn fact, a substantial fiscal stimulus package is now under consideration by the\nincoming Obama administration and the Congress, and there will be—and should be—\nvigorous debate about the form it should take and about the likely effectiveness of\nparticular fiscal strategies. While engaging in that debate is not my job today, I would\nnote that fiscal policy can play two logically distinct roles in the present crisis. The first\nis to support aggregate demand. Of course, we don’t know the full details of the bill that\nwill be passed, but the proposed legislation would provide for considerable stimulus—a\ncombination of tax cuts and spending increases perhaps totaling nearly $800 billion.\n\n14\n\n\fThe second role, which is important in the current crisis, is to address the\nmaladies that now afflict the financial sector. Indeed, fiscal resources have already been\ndeployed to bolster the capital of the banking system, to stabilize systemically important\ninstitutions, and to support programs designed to assist homeowners and mitigate\nforeclosure. Fiscal policy can play a further supportive role in unclogging credit market\nflows. I have already mentioned one example: the TALF, which is a joint program\nbetween the Fed and the Treasury that uses funds from the Troubled Assets Relief\nProgram (TARP) and is designed to improve the flow of credit to households and\nbusinesses.\nThe resolution of financial sector difficulties, and the stimulus to aggregate\ndemand in our economy, are essential for a return to sustained growth, and I am\nheartened that the Fed and other policymakers in the U.S. and around the world are\ntaking bold steps.\n\n###\n\n15\n\n\f"

        "content": "Presentation to the Andrew Brimmer Policy Forum\nIBEFA/ASSA Meeting\nSan Francisco, CA\nBy Janet L. Yellen, President and CEO, Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco\nFor delivery on January 4, 2009, 2:30 PM Pacific, 5:30 PM Eastern\nU.S. Monetary Policy Objectives in the Short and Long Run1\nIntroduction\nToday the Federal Reserve faces some of the greatest challenges in its history as it strives to\nrestore economic growth, job creation, and financial stability and to preserve price stability. To\nachieve these policy objectives, the Federal Reserve is committed to using every tool at its\ndisposal.\nThe challenges are all too well known. Almost eighteen months since the onset of the nowglobal financial crisis, the functioning of financial markets remains greatly impaired, and\ndiminished credit flows are impeding the ability of households and firms to borrow and spend. As\na consequence, the U.S. economy is undergoing a sharp contraction, with almost two million jobs\nlost thus far and unemployment poised to rise further in the year ahead. And the adverse feedback\nloop goes on, as these deteriorating economic conditions, in turn, are intensifying financial sector\ndistress. Regarding price stability, pressures from soaring commodity prices at the onset of the\ncrisis have ebbed dramatically, and inflation is subsiding. Indeed, with growing economic slack,\ninflation may well decline, for a time, below levels that best promote the dual goals of full\nemployment and price stability.\nAn important lesson of theory and history is that circumstances like these call for prompt and\naggressive action. And the Federal Reserve has responded vigorously. Since September 2007, the\n1\n\nThe views expressed here are my own and do not necessarily represent those of my colleagues in the Federal\nReserve System. I would like to thank the staff of the San Francisco Fed’s Economic Research Department, and\nEric Swanson and John Judd in particular, for outstanding support in developing these remarks.\n\n1\n\n\fFOMC has cut the federal funds rate target roughly 500 basis points. In December, the Committee\ntook the historic final step of lowering the federal funds rate essentially to its “zero bound,”\nestablishing a target range of 0 to ¼ percent and communicating its expectation that weak\neconomic conditions would likely warrant exceptionally low levels of the federal funds rate for\nsome time. This move exhausts the Fed’s ability to provide stimulus through “conventional”\nmonetary policy actions. But it by no means exhausts the Fed’s options to stimulate the economy\nthrough other measures. The Committee’s focus going forward will be on “non-conventional”\nprograms that use its balance sheet to improve the functioning of financial markets, an arena where\nconsiderable scope for action remains. In my remarks today, I will describe the balance sheet\nmeasures that the Fed has already put in place, addressing some frequently asked questions: Have\nthe programs worked? What is the scope for expanding these policies going forward? How does\nthe Fed’s approach compare to the quantitative easing policy implemented by the Bank of Japan\nbetween 2001 and 2006? I will also discuss the potential role that enhanced Fed communications\nmight play in helping to achieve both short- and long-run objectives.\nTo preview my answers, I will argue that the suite of programs that the Fed has already\nannounced or put in place are an appropriate and creative response to alleviate strains from the\nongoing credit crunch. The evidence suggests to me that they have improved liquidity in the\nmoney markets and lowered the cost of private credit. Going forward, asset purchases and lending\nprograms could be expanded and extended to additional sectors impacted by the credit crunch. As\nfor the comparison to Japan’s experience, to my mind, the differences outweigh the similarities.\nRoughly speaking, the Fed is focused on the potential for targeted programs on the “asset side” of\nits balance sheet to improve credit flows in specific impaired markets, whereas the Bank of Japan\nwas primarily focused on the potential for an expansion of the total quantity of its liabilities—the\nexcess reserves of the banking system—to spur additional bank lending.\n2\n\n\fThe Fed’s Balance Sheet Policies\nSince the onset of the crisis, the Fed has massively expanded the provision of liquidity to\nfinancial institutions, thereby easing the broader credit crunch. Serving as lender of last resort is a\ntime-honored function for central banks and is critical in mitigating systemic risk. But in doing so\nduring the current crisis, the Fed has crossed traditional boundaries by extending the maturity of\nthe loans, the range of acceptable collateral, and the range of eligible borrowing institutions. At\nthe onset of the crisis, the Fed encouraged banks to use the discount window. The apparent stigma\nassociated with use of the window, however, discouraged banks from borrowing. To address this\nproblem, the Fed introduced and has substantially expanded a new auction system (the Term\nAuction Facility or TAF) to distribute discount window loans. Auctions of longer-term (up to 84day) loans at regular intervals were added to address a persistent shortage of term funding in the\nmoney markets, as evidenced, for example, by exceptionally high spreads of term versus overnight\nLibor loans. To further ease severe liquidity pressures at quarter- and year-end, the Fed introduced\na system of forward auctions on TAF loans. In addition, the Fed supported the provision of dollar\nliquidity beyond our own shores through a vast expansion of its network of swap lines with foreign\ncentral banks, raising the size of borrowing lines with existing swap partners and adding additional\ncentral banks to the network.\nA unique feature of the current financial crisis is that it has engulfed not only the banking\nsystem but also an enormous sector comprising the so-called “shadow banking system,” which\nincludes an array of non-bank financial institutions. It was apparent early on that confining the\nprovision of liquidity to depository institutions alone would be insufficient to meet the liquidity\nneeds of the broader financial markets. In response, the Fed invoked, for the first time since the\nGreat Depression, its authority under section 13(3) of the Federal Reserve Act to lend in “unusual\n3\n\n\fand exigent circumstances” to “individuals, partnerships, or corporations” that are “unable to\nsecure adequate credit accommodations from other banking institutions.” Discount window\nlending under this authority was used to facilitate the acquisition of Bear Stearns and to stabilize\nAIG and Citigroup—three systemically important financial firms. It has also been invoked to\nestablish a discount window facility for primary dealers (the Primary Dealer Credit Facility or\nPDCF) and a new facility to enhance the ability of primary dealers to finance their securities\ninventories through the repo market. This Term Securities Lending Facility (TSLF), through an\nauction mechanism, lends out Treasury securities from the Fed’s own holdings to primary dealers\nin exchange for investment grade securities. The facility, in effect, offers collateral to dealers for\nuse in repos that is more desirable in the market than most asset-backed securities.\nThe Fed’s use of its balance sheet to support the functioning of credit markets expanded\ndramatically following such events as the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers and the near-collapse of\nAIG. Those events triggered severe disruptions in short-term money markets as investors in prime\nmoney market funds fled to the safety of the shortest Treasury securities. These disruptions also\ntriggered dysfunction in the commercial paper market, a large and important source of short-term\nfinancing for both financial and nonfinancial corporations. Two new facilities (the Asset-Backed\nCommercial Paper Money Market Mutual Fund Liquidity Facility (AMLF) and Money Market\nInvestor Funding Facility (MMIFF) were introduced to provide backup liquidity to money market\nmutual funds to help them cope with redemptions that could otherwise cause them to “break the\nbuck.” The AMLF provides nonrecourse discount window loans to banks to enable them to\npurchase asset-backed commercial paper from money market mutual funds, and the MMIFF\nprovides loans to a private-sector vehicle established to purchase a broad range of assets from\nthese funds.\n4\n\n\fIn order to restore functioning to the commercial paper market, the Fed has also committed to\nproviding loans to a new Commercial Paper Funding Facility (CPFF) that was set up to purchase\ncommercial paper from highly rated (A1P1) issuers. Importantly, the ultimate purpose of all of\nthese facilities is to enhance the provision of credit to a broad range of private borrowers by\nrestoring the liquidity and functioning of short-term money markets.\nIn my judgment, the suite of facilities that the Fed has created to improve money market\nconditions is working to satisfy the financial system’s greatly increased demand for safe assets and\nliquidity. Conditions are still abnormal, but money market functioning has clearly improved\nrelative to the dark days of last September and October. For example, term Libor rates have\ndeclined along with the spreads of these rates over the federal funds rate. Since term Libor rates\nare a benchmark for many adjustable-rate loans, including mortgages, the benefits of these\nreductions are rippling throughout the private sector. For highly rated commercial paper, eligible\nfor the CPFF, spreads have also narrowed substantially. In contrast, the borrowing spreads for less\nhighly rated paper (A2P2) remain extremely elevated.\nMoving beyond the money markets, interventions have only just begun, and considerable\nscope remains for targeted asset purchases and discount window lending programs to improve the\nflow of credit and reduce its cost in sectors that have been severely impacted by the financial crisis.\nIn November, the Fed announced and commenced a $600 billion program to purchase agency debt\nand agency-insured mortgage-backed securities. A successful initiative in this area could provide\nsignificant support to the housing sector. Scope remains for larger interventions, and in December\nthe FOMC reiterated its readiness to expand upon these purchases “as conditions warrant.” Even\nat this early stage, the program appears to be having an impact. For example, yields on mortgagebacked securities and 30-year fixed-rate mortgages fell substantially immediately after the program\n5\n\n\fwas announced. The decline in mortgage rates, which also has been affected by a decline in\nTreasury yields, has prompted an upsurge in refinancing activity in recent weeks. The FOMC\ncould also expand its purchases of longer-term Treasury debt—an initiative that could lower\ngovernment borrowing rates and spill over into private borrowing rates more broadly. In its\nDecember statement, the FOMC noted that it is evaluating the potential benefits of such purchases.\nThe Federal Reserve Act confines the System’s outright asset purchases to securities issued\nor guaranteed by the U.S. Treasury or U.S. agencies. Even so, the Fed has the potential to use its\nbalance sheet to restore functioning in other impaired financial markets. The recently announced\nTerm Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility (TALF) provides a model for doing so. This new Fed\nfacility is designed to spur lending to meet the credit needs of households and small businesses.\nThe facility will support the issuance of securities collateralized by auto, student, credit card, and\nSmall Business Administration (SBA) loans—sectors where the issuance of new securities has\nslowed to a trickle. The high borrowing spreads on such securities, even when the underlying\nloans are government-guaranteed—as in the case of SBA and many student loans—suggest not\nonly heightened credit risk but also an impairment of market liquidity which the facilities can\naddress. The inability of financial institutions to securitize such loans, and of potential investors in\nsuch securities to borrow against them on reasonable terms, reflects an important breakdown in\ncredit markets. By improving the functioning of markets for securitized assets, the Fed has the\npotential to boost private-sector credit flows in support of the economy. Under the TALF, which is\na joint Federal Reserve-Treasury initiative, the Fed has agreed to provide nonrecourse loans to\nholders of eligible highly rated asset-backed securities. Cooperation with the Treasury is necessary\nbecause the program entails some risk of loss and, under the Federal Reserve Act, all Fed lending\nmust be appropriately secured. The Treasury has committed $20 billion of TARP funds to protect\nthe Fed against losses on the Fed’s lending commitment of up to $200 billion.\n6\n\n\fThe approach employed by the TALF can be expanded substantially, with higher lending\nvolumes and additional asset classes covered by the program. Indeed, the Federal Reserve and the\nTreasury have announced that the facility could be expanded over time to include commercial and\nnon-agency residential mortgage-backed securities. Securitization activity in these markets has all\nbut dried up since the credit crisis began, and the shortage of credit in these critical sectors has\nmade private borrowing costs exceptionally high. Along these lines, the FOMC stated that it “will\ncontinue to consider ways of using its balance sheet to further support credit markets and economic\nactivity.”\nIt is worth noting that, as the nation’s central bank, the Fed can issue as much currency and\nbank reserves as required to finance these asset purchases and restore functioning to these markets.\nIndeed, the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet has already ballooned from about $900 billion at the\nbeginning of 2008 to more than $2.2 trillion currently—and is rising.\nThe Fed’s current “balance sheet approach” to monetary policy creates an entirely new set of\npolicy issues and challenges. For example, the Fed normally eschews interventions that directly\naffect the allocation of credit, and to a considerable extent, the new facilities rely on financial\nmarkets to channel funds to individual borrowers. However, the new facilities do influence credit\nallocation because they must be targeted at particular sectors of the credit market. In effect, the\nFed must judge where to intervene, deciding where market dysfunction is greatest and where\nadverse consequences for the overall economy are particularly severe. Furthermore, many of the\ninterventions are novel, so no straightforward methods are available to quantify their effectiveness.\nThere are also no clear guidelines for the Fed to gauge the appropriate size of its interventions and\nfew precedents for the Fed to use in communicating its policy stance to the public beyond\nannouncing new programs and describing their terms in detail. Although the purpose of most\nprograms is to lower borrowing costs, the Fed must be careful to avoid the risks that could result\n7\n\n\ffrom targeting some predetermined yield or spread. Finally, the Fed must ensure that it has an exit\nstrategy to wind down the facilities in a timely and effective way when they are no longer needed.\nThese challenges notwithstanding, I believe that the approaches I have described have considerable\npotential to contribute to a strong economic recovery.\nQuantitative Easing?\nOn the surface, it may seem appropriate to equate the Fed’s use of its balance sheet to\nstimulate the economy with the quantitative easing policy pursued earlier by the Bank of Japan.\nBut as I noted at the outset, the differences outweigh the similarities in my opinion. The main\nsimilarity is that the Fed, like the Bank of Japan, has increased the quantity of excess reserves in\nthe banking system well above the minimum level required to push overnight interbank lending\nrates to the vicinity of zero. The creation of such a large volume of excess reserves, in the Fed’s\ncase, results from the enormous expansion in the Fed’s discount window lending, foreign exchange\nswaps, and asset purchases. In the Bank of Japan’s case, the expansion in excess reserves resulted\nfrom the deliberate adoption of an explicit numerical target for them. The theory underlying the\nBank of Japan’s intervention was that banks might be encouraged to lend by replacing their\nholdings of short-term government securities with excess cash. The problem with this idea is that,\nnear the zero bound, short-term government securities and cash are almost perfect substitutes—\nboth are essentially riskless assets that yield a zero or near-zero rate of return; thus, exchanging one\nfor the other should have little effect on banks’ desire to lend. Indeed, the Japanese experience\nduring their quantitative easing program in the early 2000s suggests that simply expanding excess\nbank reserves—even by a very large amount—had little effect on bank lending or on the economy\nmore broadly. The policy may have lowered longer-term borrowing rates, however, by\nsymbolizing and highlighting the Bank of Japan’s commitment to fighting deflation by holding its\n8\n\n\fshort-term interest rate at zero for an extended time—until deflationary pressures had been\nconvincingly dissipated.\nIn contrast, the overall size of assets on the Fed’s balance sheet will be the result of decisions\nconcerning the appropriate scale of each particular program and the extent to which the various\nprograms and facilities are actually used by market participants. The take-up rates on these\nprograms and facilities are likely to fluctuate over time as market conditions change. For example,\nearly in a new Fed lending program, its impact on economic activity might rise with the associated\nexpansion of the Fed’s balance sheet. Later on, if the program helps to improve the functioning of\nthe private market, success could be associated with the contraction of the Fed’s balance sheet as\nthe Fed exits from the market, leaving the determination of credit flows to private participants.\nFurthermore, the mere availability of backup liquidity through a facility may improve market\nfunctioning, even if the volume of borrowing is low. Thus, the impact of the totality of Fed\nprograms should not be judged by the overall size of the Fed’s balance sheet. Rather, it will be\nnecessary to evaluate the success of each individual program in improving market function and\nfacilitating the flow of credit.\nFederal Reserve Communications\nAn extensive literature and some recent experience suggest that central bank communications\nmay also play a helpful role in addressing the constraints relating to the zero-bound. For example,\nDavid Reifschneider and John Williams (2000) and Gauti Eggertsson and Michael Woodford\n(2003) showed that the constraints imposed by the zero lower bound are not very restrictive if the\nFed can credibly commit to keeping the funds rate low for an extended period of time. The idea is\nthat the FOMC can work around the zero lower bound on the overnight interest rate by lowering\ninterest rate expectations in the future, thus pushing down longer-term interest rates to stimulate\nprivate spending. The Fed employed such an approach between 2003 and 2005, and has taken an\n9\n\n\fimportant step along the same path in its December announcement by stating that “exceptionally\nlow levels of the federal funds rate” are likely to be warranted “for some time” due to “weak\neconomic conditions.” I believe that such statements can play a useful role in more clearly\nindicating to markets the Committee’s own expectations concerning the federal funds rate path,\nconditional on the Committee’s economic forecast.\nCommunication also can be important in the Fed’s efforts to anchor long-term inflation\nexpectations. As I mentioned at the outset, the odds are high that over the next few years, inflation\nwill decline below desirable levels. It is especially important in such circumstances for the Fed to\nemphasize its commitment to returning inflation over time to the higher levels that are most\nappropriate to the attainment of its longer-term objectives. A decline in inflationary expectations\nwhen economic conditions are weak is pernicious, especially so when the federal funds rate has\nreached the zero bound, because any downdrift in inflation expectations leads to an updrift in real\ninterest rates and a tightening of financial conditions.\nWork by Refet Gürkaynak, Eric Swanson, and coauthors (2005, 2006) suggests that\ncommitting a central bank to a long-run inflation objective helps anchor longer-run inflation\nexpectations in that country. Over the past few years, the FOMC has in fact taken important\nincremental steps toward making its longer-term inflation goals more explicit. For example, we\nare now publishing FOMC members’ inflation forecasts for the next three years under the\nassumption of “appropriate monetary policy,” and the publication of such forecasts has helped\nshape public understanding concerning the range of inflation outcomes that FOMC members\nregard as desirable in the longer term. Looking forward, there could be scope for the Committee to\nimprove the clarity of these communications. I am optimistic that, by clearly communicating the\nFed’s commitment to low and stable inflation and by backing that commitment up with determined\n10\n\n\fpolicy actions should the need arise, any deflationary pressures caused by the weak economy can\nbe contained.\n\nReferences\nEggertsson, Gauti, and Michael Woodford (2003), “The Zero Bound on Interest Rates and Optimal\nMonetary Policy,” Brookings Papers on Economic Activity 2003(1), pp. 139-211.\nGürkaynak, Refet, Brian Sack, and Eric Swanson (2005), “The Sensitivity of Long-Term Interest\nRates to Economic News: Evidence and Implications for Macroeconomic Models,” American\nEconomic Review 95(1), pp. 425-436.\nGürkaynak, Refet, Andrew Levin, and Eric Swanson (2006), “Does Inflation Targeting Help\nAnchor Inflation Expectations?

        "content": "Presentation to the Annual AEA/ASSA Conference\nSan Francisco, CA\nBy Janet L. Yellen, President and CEO, Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco\nFor delivery on January 4, 2009, 10:15 AM Pacific, 1:15 PM Eastern\nComments on “The Revival of Fiscal Policy” 1\nF\n\nI’m delighted to have the opportunity to comment on the papers of my\ndistinguished colleagues, Martin Feldstein, John Taylor, and Alan Auerbach at a session\ndevoted to a topic of such critical policy importance. With the U.S. economy in a year-old\nrecession, marked by a particularly sharp contraction in recent months, and ensnared in\nongoing financial market distress, fiscal policy intervention is certainly needed. It is\nimportant that it be informed by the kind of cogent thinking and analysis that these papers\nembody.\nI agree with Marty that the current downturn is likely to be far longer and deeper\nthan the “garden-variety” recession in which GDP bounces back quickly. As Marty points\nout, a defining characteristic of this downturn is its cause. Typically, recessions occur\nwhen monetary policy is tightened to subdue the inflationary pressures that emerge during\na boom. This time, the cause was the eruption of a severe financial crisis. Cross-country\nevidence suggests that, following such an event, GDP remains subdued for an extended\nperiod. 2 And consistent with this evidence, many forecasters expect this to be one of the\nF\n\nF\n\n1\n\nThe views expressed here are my own and do not necessarily represent those of my colleagues in the\nFederal Reserve System. I would like to thank the staff of the San Francisco Fed’s Economic Research\nDepartment, and John Fernald and John Judd in particular, for outstanding support in developing these\nremarks.\n2\n\nSee, for example, Carmen Reinhart and Kenneth Rogoff, “Is the 2007 U.S. Subprime Crisis So\nDifferent?” American Economic Review Papers and Proceedings 98(2), May 2008, or International\nMonetary Fund, World Economic Outlook, October 2008, Chapter 4. (http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/\nweo/2008/02/pdf/text.pdf).\n\n\flongest and deepest recessions since the Great Depression. Indeed, the crisis is ongoing.\nRisk-aversion in financial markets remains exceptionally high; deleveraging is widespread;\nthe markets for most private asset-backed securities are dysfunctional; financial\ninstitutions, both large and small, have failed; and the economic downturn is causing\ndelinquencies to rise, threatening further financial distress; households and businesses face\nan ongoing credit crunch; and housing and financial wealth has plunged. Marty points out,\nand I agree, that the likely impact on consumer spending of the decline in wealth thus far—\none of a number of factors weighing on this sector—is, on its own, quite substantial. And\nhouse prices are continuing to slide.\nThe Federal Reserve has responded aggressively since the onset of the crisis with\nboth interest rate reductions and a variety of new, specialized liquidity facilities to improve\nthe functioning of impaired financial markets. At the FOMC’s last meeting in December,\nthe Committee reduced its target for the federal funds rate to a range of 0 to ¼ percent,\neffectively hitting the “zero bound” for the first time since the Great Depression. With\nnominal interest rates now essentially zero, we have reached the limits of what\nconventional monetary policy, working through short-term interest rates, can do to\nstimulate the economy. A special concern in the current circumstances is that a decline in\ninflationary expectations could cause real interest rates to rise. The potential for real\ninterest rates to rise as inflation declines creates a significant downside risk because, with\nan extended period of abnormally high unemployment in the forecast, it is increasingly\nlikely that inflation will fall to undesirably low levels. This is an additional consideration\nthat, to my mind, militates in favor of strong policy responses.\n\n2\n\n\fI certainly agree with John Taylor that the zero bound doesn’t mean that monetary\npolicy has run out of options. At another session this afternoon, I will discuss in detail a\nrange of non-conventional measures, using the Fed’s “balance sheet,” that will be a prime\nfocus for monetary policy going forward. The Fed has already announced or undertaken,\nand can expand, programs designed to improve the functioning of credit markets. These\nprograms complement the actions of the Treasury, the FDIC, and the Fed to inject capital\ninto the banking system, to stabilize systemically important financial institutions, to expand\ndeposit insurance, and to temporarily guarantee the senior debt of banking organizations.\nA clear lesson of history is that a sine qua non for sustained economic recovery following a\nfinancial crisis is a thoroughgoing repair of the financial system. The necessary steps are\noccurring now, but restoration of the financial system to full health will be a long, drawnout process.\nLess clear, and here I part ways with John, are the lessons from Japan’s recent\nexperience with “quantitative easing.” In his paper for this session, John asserts that the\nBOJ’s quantitative easing strategy worked well, while fiscal policy was ineffective. My\ninterpretation of the evidence is exactly the opposite. The BOJ targeted an extraordinarily\nhigh level of excess reserves in the banking system, in the hope that a flood of such\nreserves might stimulate additional bank lending. The BOJ’s quantitative easing policy\nprobably had some beneficial effect, but mainly because it symbolized the BOJ’s\ncommitment to combat deflation by keeping interest rates at zero for an extended time.\nThe expectation of an extended period of zero short-term interest rates was probably\ninstrumental in lowering longer-term nominal rates. But the expansion of excess reserves\nto extraordinary levels appears, on its own, to have had very little impact on financial\n\n3\n\n\fconditions. The Fed’s “balance sheet” strategy has a different motivation. We are focused\non pursuing carefully tailored programs to remedy specific financial market dysfunctions.\nFor example, our suite of programs is designed to enhance liquidity in financial markets, to\nimprove the availability of term funding in the money market, to restore the functioning of\nthe commercial paper market, and to stimulate the issuance of new asset-backed securities\nto support lending to consumers and small businesses.\nI am sanguine that the Fed’s new programs will be helpful in restoring credit flows.\nBut many of the new approaches are experimental, and there is a great deal of uncertainty\nconcerning their likely effects. Even with vigorous Fed action to restore credit flows, an\nextended period of economic weakness is likely. This explains why, in the statement\nfollowing its December meeting, the FOMC noted that it anticipates that an exceptionally\nlow level of the federal funds rate will be appropriate for some time.\nFor all of these reasons, I support Marty’s conclusion that there is an exceptionally\nstrong case for substantial fiscal stimulus over the next few years. In ordinary\ncircumstances, there are good reasons why monetary, rather than fiscal policy, should be\nused for stabilization purposes. But these are exceptional circumstances, and fiscal policy\ncan help get the economy going.\nGiven that a substantial fiscal stimulus package is now under consideration, it is\nimportant for economists to debate the form it should take and raise questions about the\nlikely effectiveness of particular fiscal strategies. With respect to optimal fiscal design, I\nhave heard more alliterative mantras during the past year than at any time in my\nprofessional career! A year ago, the mantra was “Timely, targeted, and temporary.” More\n\n4\n\n\frecently, I’ve heard “Speedy, substantial, and sustained.” 3 In recent testimony, John\nF\n\nF\n\nargued for fiscal policies that are “Permanent, pervasive, and predictable.” 4 And the\nF\n\nF\n\naward for the longest, most detailed, and least alliterative list goes to the International\nMonetary Fund whose staff this week recommended a package that is “large, lasting,\ndiversified, contingent, collective, and sustainable.” 5\nF\n\nF\n\nConceptually, I would note that fiscal policy can play two logically distinct roles in\nthe present crisis. The first, which is the main topic of the papers in this session and my\nsubsequent comments, is to support aggregate demand. I will discuss some issues that\nshould be considered in formulating a stimulus package for this purpose. The second,\nwhich is crucially important in the current crisis, is to address the maladies that now afflict\nthe financial sector. Indeed, fiscal resources have already been deployed to bolster the\ncapital of the banking system, to stabilize systemically important institutions, and to\nsupport programs designed to assist homeowners and mitigate foreclosure. Fiscal policy\ncan play a further supportive role in unclogging credit market flows. For example, the new\nTerm Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility (TALF) is a joint program between the\nFederal Reserve and the Treasury, using TARP funds, and is designed to improve the flow\nof credit to households and businesses. The Fed cannot conduct such programs on its own,\nsince taxpayer funds are at risk. As I noted earlier, the resolution of financial sector\n\n3\n\nLawrence Summers, November 2008, quoted at http://blogs.wsj.com/economics/2008/11/17/summerssnew-view-on-stimulus-sustained-not-temporary/ (downloaded December 31, 2008).\n4\nJohn Taylor, “The State of the Economy and Principles for Fiscal Stimulus,” Testimony before the\nCommittee on the Budget, United States Senate, November 19, 2008.

This\nconclusion is endorsed by the IMF in its recent position paper. 6\nF\n\nF\n\nLet me now turn to some design issues that relate to the use of fiscal policy for\nstabilization purposes. First, as both John and Alan highlight, automatic stabilizers have an\nimportant role to play, and this role could be expanded. These stabilizers have the\ndesirable property of being predictable and automatic—agents know they’re coming, and\nthey inevitably provide a boost just when it’s needed. Using aggregate CBO data on the\ncyclical contribution to the budget deficit, John argues that these stabilizers are as effective\nas ever; it is hard, though, to square this finding with Alan’s analysis showing that the\nautomatic stabilizers have become smaller over time, as marginal tax rates have declined.\nIn the current context, however, I don’t think that existing automatic stabilizers—of\nwhatever size—are likely to provide a sufficient boost to aggregate demand. Moreover,\nboth John and Alan make the important point that the predictable fiscal policy response to\nchanging economic conditions does not rely solely on automatic stabilizers. Alan\nhighlights the specific examples of countercyclical fiscal policy in the 2000s, as well as the\npredictable component over a long period of time in discretionary investment incentives.\nJohn notes, but does not emphasize, that the structural component of the budget deficit—\nreflecting specific, discretionary changes in legislation—has been highly responsive over\nthe past decade or longer to changes in the output gap.\nHence, private agents rationally expect that in times of economic weakness, fiscal\npolicy will respond and that expectation itself serves as a kind of automatic stabilizer in its\nown right, reassuring households and businesses that the government will do everything in\n6\n\nSee Spilimbergo et al., 2008.\n\n6\n\n\fits power to prevent a long period of intense economic distress. Agents have almost surely,\nat least implicitly, built some such expectation about discretionary fiscal policy into their\ncurrent behavior, even if they are highly uncertain about the details of the response.\nPerhaps it would be desirable in the longer run to make the policy rule more explicit and\npredictable—and, as Alan emphasizes, to devote more analysis to understanding the effects\nof different policy rules. But I don’t think now is the time to change the implicit, if\nimprecise, rules and disappoint agents’ expectations about the discretionary fiscal response\nto the present crisis.\nA second design principle that must be kept in mind, given the huge, long-term\nbudget challenges facing the country, is that current responses need to be consistent with\nlong-term fiscal discipline. Conceptually, the choices about the long-term size of\ngovernment—with revenues that are consistent with the desired level of spending—and the\nchoices about the optimal short-run stimulus are quite separate. But long-run expectations\nabout fiscal sustainability do matter, even in the short run. If agents don’t believe that tax\ncuts and/or spending increases are temporary, and are concerned that policy responses\nthreaten the sustainability of the long-run run budget picture, then long-term real interest\nrates are likely to rise in response, undercutting, conceivably even overwhelming, the\nshort-term stimulus. In the 1990s, the term “Rubinomics” came to summarize this\npossibility (in reverse): that “contractionary” measures to improve long-run fiscal balance\ncould provide net, short-term stimulus through this channel.\nIn the present context, this logic creates potential tradeoffs between short-run and\nlong-run considerations. In particular, the permanent income hypothesis implies that\npermanent tax cuts affect spending in the short run by more than temporary tax cuts; but if\n\n7\n\n\fthese tax cuts are not consistent with long-run spending realities, then they are inconsistent\nwith fiscal sustainability and are not credible. For this reason, I am a bit skeptical about\nMarty’s suggestion that we implement broad-based, permanent tax cuts. Especially given\nfuture obligations for social security and Medicare, voters and legislators might resist the\nsizeable reductions in other spending that would be required to keep taxes permanently\nlower than current legislation implies.\nOf course, a concern for fiscal discipline is one reason why temporary tax rebates\nseemed desirable to many observers last year. The rebates were explicitly targeted at lowerincome individuals who were more likely to be credit constrained and thus responsive to\ntemporary as well as permanent changes in income. Some micro evidence suggests that the\nrebates were effective in boosting spending. 7 On the basis of aggregate data, however,\nF\n\nF\n\nboth Marty and John agree that the tax rebates were a bust—they failed to have enough of\nan impact on consumer spending to make a dent in the aggregate spending data. There are\ndifficult econometric issues here—for example, credit constraints on households were\ntightening around the same time the checks were arriving, which could have obscured the\ntrue effects. Nevertheless, the rebate checks at best delayed the most severe period of the\ncurrent recession, and at worst were ineffective.\nHow about investment incentives? In contrast to temporary tax rebates, economic\ntheory implies that temporary investment incentives should be even more effective in\nstimulating aggregate demand than permanent incentives. Hence, they should work well in\nterms of providing large short-term bang for the buck with little damage to long-run fiscal\n7\n\nChristian Broda and Jonathan Parker (2008), “The Impact of the 2008 Tax Rebates on Consumer\nSpending: Preliminary Evidence,” mimeo University of Chicago, GSB, July 2008.\nhttp://faculty.chicagogsb.edu/christian.broda/website/research/unrestricted/Stimulus%20Payments%20and\n%20Spending.pdf.\n\n8\n\n\fbalance. Unfortunately, Alan’s work suggests that, while this logic might hold, it isn’t the\nwhole story. Investment incentives are clearly countercyclical—when the economy slows,\ninvestment incentives rise and firms contemplating capital investment know this. So the\nanticipation effects could cause undesirable fluctuations in investment and economic\nactivity.\nIn theory, as Marty suggests, temporary increases in government spending—or,\nperhaps, changes in the timing of government spending—fit the bill well. Such spending\nhas the advantage of hitting aggregate demand directly. There is uncertainty in the\nacademic literature about the multiplier, although I think that the multiplier is likely to be\nlarger than usual now because private spending is less likely than usual to be crowded out.\nOf course, it is unclear how quickly temporary spending programs can be ramped up and,\nas Marty suggests, there could be bottlenecks of various sorts.\nTogether, these considerations reinforce the IMF’s recent suggestion that a\ndiversified package of policies should be deployed. That is, within the class of fiscally\nsustainable policies, there is considerable uncertainty about the effects of any individual\npolicy. So we should try a lot of things, including, as Marty suggests, government\nspending.\nOf course, there are many things the government could spend money on and this\nbrings me to a third design principle: Policy should aim to promote spending on goods and\nservices with higher rather than lower social value. After all, the goal of policy is to raise\nwelfare. And spending money on projects that aren’t viewed as having much social value\n—such as digging holes and filling them in again—adds a lot less to social welfare than\n\n9\n\n\favailable alternatives, even if such low-value activities can succeed in increasing aggregate\ndemand. Tax cuts do have the advantage of giving individuals the choice about how to\nspend their money. But, as I’ve already noted, it is unclear whether fiscally sustainable tax\ncuts will have sufficient stimulative effect.\nIn this context, as Marty’s argument implies, there are clear macroeconomic gains\nfrom direct government spending. In cost-benefit terms, the aggregate demand\nexternalities increase the benefits of government spending relative to the costs. Hence,\nprograms that already look worthwhile ought to be implemented; and some programs that\nmight not otherwise pass a cost-benefit test could also be justified given the considerable\nslack in the economy. There are real dangers, however, in pushing this logic too far and\nJapan’s experience, to my mind, illustrates them. John suggested that discretionary fiscal\npolicy made no meaningful contribution to Japan’s recovery. I disagree with that\ncharacterization. Japan’s decision to raise its consumption tax and cut public spending in\n1997 aborted an incipient recovery then in progress; and the fiscal stimulus put in place in\n1998 and 1999 appears to have prompted a rebound. Most studies find that fiscal measures\ndid have a positive stimulative effect, although estimates of the fiscal multipliers vary. 8\nF\n\nF\n\nEven so, I have the impression that John’s view is widely held in Japan. I suspect that\nfiscal policy was both unpopular, and widely viewed as ineffective, in Japan because so\nmuch of it involved spending on “bridges to nowhere”—public works projects of dubious\nsocial value. Such spending appears to have undermined popular support for fiscal\nstimulus.\n\n8\n\nThis is consistent with the view expressed in Spilimbergo et al. (2008, page 25).\n\n10\n\n\fIf ever, in my professional career, there was a time for active, discretionary fiscal\nstimulus, it is now. Although our economy is resilient and has bounced back quickly from\ndownturns in the past, the financial and economic firestorm we face today poses a serious\nrisk of an extended period of stagnation—a very grim outcome. Such stagnation would\nintensify financial market strains, exacerbating the problems that triggered the downturn.\nIt’s worth pulling out all the stops to ensure those outcomes don’t occur.\n\n11\n\n\f"
