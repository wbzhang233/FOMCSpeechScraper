Lacker\nPresident\nFederal Reserve Bank of Richmond\nMaryland Bankers Association’s Sixth Annual First Friday Economic Outlook Forum\nBaltimore, Md.\n\nThank you for that kind introduction. It’s a pleasure to join you at the turn of the year. This\ntraditionally is a time to reflect on the year just past and take a look at what the new year might\nhold in store for us. I think I can guess what many of you are concerned about regarding the year\nahead, so I should warn you that I will have nothing to say about the prospects of the Ravens or\nthe Redskins. Instead, my focus today will be on the economic outlook, and while for some that\nmight be less interesting than pigskin prognostication, it might be a good thing to take our minds\noff sports for a time. Before I begin, however, I should emphasize that the views expressed are\nmy own and should not be attributed to anyone else in the Federal Reserve System. 1\nI will begin with the outlook for inflation, since maintaining price stability over time is really the\nFed’s primary mission as the nation’s central bank. Over the last 20 years, the Fed has had a\ncommendable record on inflation, averaging 2 percent inflation per year. There have been yearto-year fluctuations, to be sure. But these temporary swings have evened out over time, and\ninflation has tended to return to around 2 percent. In fact, inflation has averaged quite close to\nthat figure since the end of the Great Recession in June 2009. Overall inflation has subsided of\nlate, led by the recent easing in energy prices; headline inflation was just 1.4 percent, year over\nyear, in November. But the same measure of inflation was 2.6 percent in November 2011, which\nis a good illustration of the short-term swings we’ve been seeing. With futures markets\nforecasting flat or declining energy prices, most economists expect headline inflation to average\na little less than 2 percent this year. I agree with that outlook.\nThe record of low and fairly stable inflation over the last two decades is a substantial\nimprovement over previous decades. 2 The Federal Open Market Committee, or FOMC (the\ngroup that determines monetary policy), issued an important statement in January 2012 on its\n“Longer-Run Goals and Policy Strategy.” 3 In that document, the Committee stated that inflation\nat the rate of 2 percent, as measured by the annual change in the price index for personal\nconsumption expenditures, is most consistent over the longer run with the Federal Reserve’s\nstatutory mandate. This formally committed the FOMC to what Fed watchers had long believed\nwas the FOMC’s unofficial target of 2 percent inflation.\nA formal commitment to a numerical inflation objective is important for transparency and\naccountability, but it’s also important for keeping expectations regarding future inflation well\nanchored. Because doubts about whether the Fed will keep inflation low and stable can\n1\n\n\fthemselves give rise to inflation pressures, history has shown that restoring our credibility can be\nan arduous and costly process. Fortunately, current measures of inflation expectations suggest\nthat consumers, business firms and investors anticipate continued stability in inflation in coming\nyears. These measures include survey-based indexes and measures of inflation expectations\nderived from the relative yields of indexed and unindexed U.S. Treasury securities. Each of these\nmeasures has its own peculiarities, but they’re all providing readings consistent with the low and\nstable inflation rates of the last two decades.\nIn contrast to inflation, real economic growth and labor market conditions are affected by a wide\nrange of factors outside a central bank’s control. In fact, the effects of monetary stimulus on real\noutput and employment are less than is widely thought; they consist largely of the transitory\nbyproducts of frictions that delay the timely adjustment of prices by businesses. Attempts to\noverstimulate real economic activity via monetary policy can instead run the risk of raising\ninflation. Indeed, for reasons I will discuss later on, I see material upside risks to inflation in\n2014 and beyond, given the current trajectory for monetary policy, though my baseline outlook is\nfor inflation to move toward the Fed’s long-run goal of 2 percent in coming years.\nTurning to the outlook for real economic growth, since the Great Recession officially bottomed\nout at the end of the second quarter of 2009, economic activity has expanded at only a modest\npace. Real gross domestic product, for example, has risen at an average annual rate of 2.2 percent\nsince the end of the recession. This pace is widely viewed as disappointing, since it falls short of\nthe average gross domestic product growth of 3-1/2 percent the U.S economy achieved over the\ncourse of the 20th century. Virtually this entire shortfall represents a difference in the average\ngrowth in employment — that is, the growth in output per worker is not terribly different\nbetween the two periods. Typically, one would expect growth to exceed the long-run average at\nsome point during an expansion to make up for the negative growth recorded during recessions.\nSeveral factors appear to be impeding a more rapid expansion in the U.S. economy. First, the\nhousing boom created a substantial oversupply of new homes, and while significant progress is\nevident, we have not completely worked through that oversupply. Thus home construction and\nhome prices were essentially flat for the first two years of the recovery. Last year, however,\nhousing activity picked up and was a source of modest strength for the economy. Prices in many\nmarkets bottomed out and began to rise, and new construction activity has been steadily\nimproving. Having said that, my sense is that there is a substantial overhang of homes that are a\npoor match for what consumers want and can afford right now. Thus, we should not expect, nor\nshould we desire, a return to the booming housing market conditions that we saw prior to the last\nrecession.\nA second, and related, factor behind the slow recovery was the significant shift in economic\nactivity away from industries related to residential construction. The rapid loss of jobs in these\nindustries, layered on top of ongoing longer-run sectoral shifts, resulted in large inflows into the\nranks of the unemployed and an adverse shift in the composition of the pool of unemployed. This\noften occurs in recessions, when the need for capital investment and retraining to facilitate the\nshift of workers to new sectors slows down the decline in unemployment. The magnitude of the\nresidential construction job loss in this recession was unprecedented, however, so this effect is\nlikely to be significantly larger now.\n2\n\n\fThird, the recession appears to have made many consumers more cautious and less willing to\nspend, relative to their income and wealth. The magnitude of the decline in jobs and aggregate\nincome in this recession was far larger than anything American households have seen in the prior\n25 years. And it was accompanied by an unusually large decline in home equity and household\nnet worth. Moreover, given lenders’ loss experience following the last recession, terms and\nqualification standards for secured and unsecured consumer credit have become more stringent.\nThus households understandably have become more apprehensive about their future income\nprospects and more interested in paying down financial obligations and building up savings. So\nwhile consumer spending has grown during this recovery, the tempered pace of that growth has\nlimited the overall pace of the expansion, relative to historical experience.\nFinally, our Fifth District business contacts have long been emphasizing that uncertainty has\ncaused them to delay hiring and investment commitments. These reports became more frequent\nthis past spring and more focused on the uncertainties related to the year-end “fiscal cliff.” The\narray of conceivable fiscal policy remedies would affect a wide range of economic decisions, and\nin response, many businesses have expressed a preference for sitting on the sidelines. But apart\nfrom ambiguity about how Congress and the administration will navigate past the fiscal cliff and\nthe debt ceiling, significant uncertainty remains about the longer-run tax and spending paths, the\nbroad regulatory realignments that are currently in train, and the uncertain prospects for\nEuropean economies.\nIn short, a range of factors appear to be restraining our current pace of economic expansion.\nWhile that pace is below the long-run average for the U.S. over the last century, it’s not hard to\nidentify potential explanations for that shortfall. In fact, if you look back at how other advanced\neconomies have typically behaved following recessions associated with significant housing\nslumps, you will find that the current U.S. expansion is actually not out of the ordinary. 4 This\neconomic expansion, while disappointing, may be the best we should expect given the large\ndecline in the housing market.\nThe data we’ve seen over the course of 2012 have been consistent with this picture of an\neconomy expanding at a moderate pace. Last year this time, growth appeared to be\nstrengthening, and measures of output and employment were picking up pace. In the late spring\nand early summer, however, growth appeared to slow as business investment and exports\nflattened. The reluctance of businesses to invest persisted into the fourth quarter, but some of the\nslowdown in job growth at midyear was later revised away. Early readings on consumer\nspending for the fourth quarter have been encouraging, though survey measures of consumer\nsentiment have fallen sharply, perhaps in response to the post-election media focus on the fiscal\ncliff negotiations. And the modest strengthening in residential construction has continued into\nthe last half of 2012.\nAs for the outlook for the U.S. economy, my best guess is that growth will continue into next\nyear at an annual rate of around 2 percent, as many of the recent impediments to faster growth\ncontinue to restrain activity. Beyond 2013, the rate of growth could rise if the effects of these\nrestraining factors ease, which seems plausible. Meaningful progress on federal budget issues,\nparticularly the long-run imbalance that must be addressed, would alleviate some of the policy\n3\n\n\funcertainty that appears to have dampened growth in 2012. The risks emanating from Europe\ncould diminish this year as it emerges from a recession and makes progress toward new\ninstitutional arrangements. Improved European growth prospects for 2014, which most\neconomists are forecasting, would be a positive for U.S. exports.\nAnd I think U.S. households could well be more confident and better disposed to spending a year\nfrom now. Improvements in the effectiveness of labor markets at matching workers and job\nopenings would lead to gains in household income. Modest additional growth in home prices,\nalong the lines of what we saw in 2012, would add to net household wealth and aid the\ndeleveraging process. All of these developments would tend to reduce consumer apprehension\nabout downside risks and thereby bolster spending.\nThis outlook is not without risks, of course. Significant energy price increases or an unexpected\ndownturn in some major trading partners could temporarily reduce overall U.S. growth. Failure\nto resolve a significant measure of the uncertainty hanging over federal tax and spending policy\nthis year would indefinitely prolong the reluctance of businesses to commit to investment and\nhiring in the U.S. Moreover, even with a resolution of fiscal uncertainty, significant uncertainty\nregarding regulatory policies could continue to dampen growth. On the other hand, a strongerthan-expected resurgence in confidence is not inconceivable; rapid and convincing progress\ntoward fiscal sustainability, for example, might release a rush of pent-up spending, perhaps\nleading to the above-trend growth that has so far eluded us.\nEven though growth has been below our long-run trend rate since the recession, and may remain\nbelow trend for some time, I believe that the fundamental prospects for longer-term U.S. growth\nremain quite strong. The flexibility and resilience of our markets, along with a relatively welleducated population, make this an advantageous place to implement innovations. One sector\nwhere this longer-term strength of our economy is evident is manufacturing, where growth\nduring the current expansion has actually been fairly strong compared to the decade leading up to\nthe recession. The backstory in manufacturing, of course, is the global outsourcing of low-skilled\noperations that has occurred over the last several decades. But we’ve seen countervailing growth\nin cases where locating domestically has significant advantages. For some suppliers, for\nexample, proximity to downstream operations is critical, as in the automobile industry. For\nothers, proximity to key research and design personnel are important, as with advanced\nmanufacturing that uses more sophisticated capital equipment. In addition, the emergence of\ninexpensive new energy resources in the U.S. — in the shale bed regions — could support costeffective domestic production in industries that are relatively energy-intensive or reliant on\npetrochemical feedstocks.\nOur major challenge over the longer haul is finding effective ways to deepen the knowledge and\nskills of our people. Expanding our human capital is fundamental to improving our standards of\nliving because implementing new technologies has generally required a more skilled workforce.\nIn this arena, an array of strategies could yield beneficial returns over the long run, from ensuring\nthe continued vitality of institutions of higher education and research to investing in high-quality\nearly childhood education. Particular attention is warranted, I believe, to career and technical\ntraining, which can provide flexible, market-responsive skill development for both new entrants\nto the labor force and those workers transiting from declining to expanding sectors. 5\n4\n\n\fWhat role does monetary policy play in this outlook? Our primary responsibility at the Federal\nReserve is to keep inflation low and stable; this allows businesses and consumers to make\neconomic decisions without needing to worry about the purchasing power of money. My\neconomic outlook presumes that the FOMC will not allow monetary instability to disrupt\neconomic growth, as arguably took place in the 1970s. But beyond avoiding the economic\ndamage associated with high and variable inflation, I believe it is unlikely that the Federal\nReserve can push real growth rates materially higher than they otherwise would be, on a\nsustained basis.\nNonetheless, at its December meeting, the FOMC adopted measures to attempt to bolster\neconomic growth. Notably, the Committee decided to continue the monthly purchases of $40\nbillion in agency mortgage-backed securities and $45 billion in long-term U.S. Treasury\nsecurities. It also underscored its attention to real economic activity and employment by stating\nits forward guidance for interest rate policy in terms of a 6.5 percent threshold for the\nunemployment rate.\nI dissented from these Committee actions and have expressed my concerns at length elsewhere. 6\nBriefly, as I’ve touched on today, I think that further monetary stimulus is unlikely to materially\nincrease the pace of economic expansion, and that these actions will test the limits of our\ncredibility. At some point, we will need to withdraw stimulus by raising interest rates and\nreducing the size of our balance sheet, and the larger our balance sheet, the more vulnerable we\nwill be to seemingly minor miscalibrations in policy. Accordingly, I see an increased risk, given\nthe course the Committee has set, that inflation pressures emerge and are not thwarted in a timely\nway. I intend to remain alert for signs that our monetary policy stance needs adjustment.\nIn closing, I should reiterate that despite the unique nature of the monetary and fiscal policy\nchallenges facing us, U.S. economic fundamentals are strong and auger well for growth\npossibilities in the years just ahead. To me, this suggests that the rewards are high for getting\neconomic policy right. And as an economist, I have to believe that people, including policy\nofficials, respond to incentives.\n1\n\nI am grateful to Roy Webb, John Weinberg and Andy Bauer for assistance in preparing these remarks.\nFor an account, see Marvin Goodfriend, “Monetary Policy Comes of Age: A Twentieth Century Odyssey.” Federal\nReserve Bank of Richmond Economic Quarterly, Winter 1997, vol. 83, no. 1, pp. 1-22.\n3\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, “Longer-Run Goals and Policy Strategy.” News and Events,\nMonetary Policy Press Release, January 25, 2012.\n4\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, “Are Recoveries from Banking and Financial Crises Really So\nDifferent?” International Finance Discussion Papers, no. 1037, November 2011.\n5\nJeffrey M.

        "content": "Economics and the Federal Reserve After the Crisis\nFebruary 12, 2013\nJeffrey M. Lacker\nPresident\nFederal Reserve Bank of Richmond\nFranklin & Marshall College\nLancaster, Pa.\n\nThe invitation to address you this evening is a great honor for me. I matriculated in 1973, filled\nwith a sense of awe and anticipation about the world of learning that was opening up before me.\nLittle did I know that I was in for an intense period of personal growth and discovery as well.\nBut just as important, it was here at Franklin & Marshall College that I made the choices that\nwould set the course of my professional work for decades to come. I am very grateful to F&M\nfor all it provided me.\nMy topic tonight is “Economics and the Federal Reserve After the Crisis.” F&M is where I first\nseriously studied economics, so that seems appropriate as a subject. The financial crisis of 2007–\n08 had significant consequences, to say the least, and the Federal Reserve was at the center of it\nall. So I thought I would share some reflections with you. But as I have thought back on those\nevents in the intervening years, a vivid memory from my F&M days comes to mind. It was not\nfrom an economics class but a seminar in the government department — International Politics, I\nbelieve it was called, with Professor Robert Gray. We spent some time studying the Cuban\nmissile crisis, and I believe we read Graham Allison’s book, 1 which was popular at the time. One\nbroad insight I took away from the course was that a critical influence on the choices made by\npolicymakers was the theory they brought to the table — their conceptual understanding of the\nfundamental forces at work in the world they are dealing with. Moreover, it is often the case that\nseveral plausible alternative theories are also available to policymakers.\nSince the recent financial crisis, I have reflected often on the role of economics in shaping the\npolicy response. 2 There is no substitute for theorizing about how the world works because there\nis no other way to form a judgment about whether a given policy action will be good or bad. To\nput it another way, if you think you know how a policy intervention might work in the world,\nyou have a theory in mind. The challenge for policymakers, particularly for central bankers these\ndays, is choosing which theories to place weight on. One can search for appropriate models by\ncomparing alternatives to real-world observations, but at times a given set of observations is\nconsistent with several different models. Sometimes additional observations can be found that\ndiscriminate between contending theories, but if not, policymakers may be forced to choose\nbetween competing theories.\nIn recent years, a trove of new, previously classified information about the Cuban missile crisis\nhas been released, including transcripts of recordings President John F. Kennedy secretly made\n1\n\n\fof his meetings with his top advisers, the Executive Committee of the National Security Council.\nThese have shed new light on the thinking of the president’s policy advisers during this critical\nepisode. Our understanding of the financial crisis is similarly benefiting from the emergence of\nnew, previously classified information. The Federal Open Market Committee, the policymaking\narm of the Federal Reserve, releases transcripts of its meetings and conference calls with a fiveyear lag. On January 18 of this year, the transcripts were posted for 2007, the year the financial\nmarket turmoil began. 3 These records of the FOMC’s deliberations provide a fascinating window\ninto policymakers’ thinking as the crisis began to unfold.\nPopular accounts of the financial crisis focus heavily on the events that took place later, in the\nfall of 2008. Indeed, much of the media coverage of the release of the transcripts focused on the\nextent to which the Committee did or did not appear to predict exactly what was just around the\nbend. The critiques of Monday morning quarterbacks are entertaining, to be sure, and I agree that\nthe events of the fall of 2008 had their roots in what happened in 2007 and earlier. But it’s\nultimately unproductive to act as if policymakers should have been omniscient. The transcripts\nshow Committee participants grappling with how to interpret what was happening and what to\ndo about it. Alternative assessments were plausible, given the information that was available in\nreal time, although each had different implications for how the future might unfold.\nIn my remarks tonight, I would like to provide an overview of what economics had to offer to\npolicymakers as the financial crisis began to unfold in 2007. A wide variety of research over the\nlast couple of decades was directly relevant to financial market instability, and I do not intend to\nsurvey it all. But, at the risk of oversimplification, I will highlight two broad alternative views\nthat have emerged, each with significantly different implications for the handling of the crisis. In\n2007, the transcripts show that one was chosen, and it guided the diagnosis and prescriptions of\nsenior Fed policymakers for the rest of the crisis. Indeed, that view has had a major influence on\nthe legislative and regulatory responses designed to prevent future crises. Before I begin with an\noverview of these two views, I need to warn you that my remarks reflect my own views and not\nnecessarily those of other Federal Reserve officials. If you have any doubt, the 2007 transcripts\nconfirm this assertion. 4\nAlternative Theories\nThe banking system was obviously at the heart of the crisis, and economists have made a good\ndeal of progress in recent decades on the theory of banking. The essence of what it means to be a\nbank is the use of short-term funding to invest in longer-term assets, a process called “maturity\ntransformation.” Traditionally this would take the form of loan portfolios funded through the\nissuance of deposits. Immediately demandable deposits are a short-term liability, unlike bank\nloans that are repaid over a number of years. Maturity transformation by financial intermediaries\nprovides the benefit of insurance to depositors who might quickly need their funds — to\npurchase goods and services, for example, or to pursue an unanticipated investment opportunity.\nBy pooling the funds of many such investors, a bank can make a set of longer-term investments\nthat individual investors on their own would view as too risky to support.\nMaturity transformation involves a potential risk of its own, however. If a large number of\ndepositors sought to withdraw their deposits simultaneously, the bank might have trouble raising\n2\n\n\fenough funds through liquidating its asset holdings. As a result, a firm with a mismatched\nbalance sheet is vulnerable to a “run,” in which people try to get their money out before the firm\nis no longer able to make immediate payment. Even though it may be individually rational, such\na run can cause damage by inducing the untimely liquidation of bank assets.\nIn economists’ terms, what I’ve just described is a situation subject to “multiple equilibria.” One\npossibility (equilibrium) is that depositors run, even if they don’t need their money now, because\nthey expect other depositors are running as well. The other possibility is that depositors don’t\nwithdraw unless they truly need their money because they expect others to behave similarly. One\nway to prevent the possibility of the bad outcome is to provide government-backed insurance to\nthe depositors. In fact, in the simplest versions of this theory, such insurance has almost magical\npowers. The mere presence of the backstop commitment makes depositors confident that other\ndepositors won’t be heading for the exits — with the result that people only take their funds out\nwhen they really need to. The magical aspect is that the government backstop is never actually\nused.\nThis intuition may seem pretty easy to grasp, but it wasn’t until 1983 that two economists —\nDouglas Diamond and Philip Dybvig — published an article laying out this logic in a precise,\nrigorous fashion. 5 This insight has had a tremendous influence on economists’ thinking about\nbanking and financial markets. And as I’ll discuss, their portrayal of inherent financial fragility\nhas had a tremendous impact on policy during the crisis and beyond.\nGovernment-supplied deposit insurance has always been understood to carry its own risks,\nhowever. In the late 1970s John Kareken and Neil Wallace pointed out that deposit insurance\ncreated incentives that could lead to socially excessive risk-taking. 6 Banks that can raise insured\ndeposits have less incentive to avoid large losses, and their depositors have less incentive to\nmonitor and constrain such risk-taking, because taxpayers could end up holding the bag. Thus,\ndeposit insurance was paired with a system of comprehensive regulatory oversight. Indeed, such\noversight is today a major function of the Federal Reserve System and other bank regulators and\nis a significant responsibility of Reserve Banks like Richmond’s.\nRegulation comes with its own implications, of course. In this context, one of the most important\nis the incentive it provides market participants to perform functionally equivalent services just\nbeyond the reach of regulations, effectively by-passing those regulatory constraints. This gives\nrise to what’s called “shadow banking” — bank-like activities conducted outside the legal\nconfines of the banking industry. One example of shadow banking is the market for repurchase\nagreements, or “repos,” in which a lender purchases an asset from a borrower with a\nsimultaneous agreement to resell it at a later date, often the next day. Maturity transformation is a\nkey feature of the repo market and contributed to the demise of Bear Stearns in 2008.\nBut a government backstop is not the only mechanism for preventing self-fulfilling runs. The\nlikelihood of such behavior also can be influenced by the details of the contracts between the\nbank and its depositors. For instance, if the arrangement includes conditions under which the\nbank can suspend depositors’ right to withdraw, then the self-fulfilling run outcomes also can be\naverted. Such a practice was common during U.S. financial panics in the 19th century, before the\nadvent of government deposit insurance. Banks would suspend withdrawals, for exactly the\n3\n\n\fpurpose of interrupting the dynamics of an emerging bank run. This type of mechanism reduces\nsomewhat the services provided by the deposit but in the interest of altering incentives and\nensuring the sustainability of the overall arrangement, much the way high insurance deductibles\nimprove the sustainability of insurance coverage.\nClose attention to contractual details like the ability to suspend payments highlights an important\npoint in the study of financial institutions and their behavior. Financial contracts are not one size\nfits all — they vary dramatically across various settings and sectors. For example, equity\ncontracts have long been an important source of finance for some groups, such as small high-tech\nstartups, while in other settings, simple debt is more dominant.\nEconomists have made progress in understanding which financial contracts are best adapted to\nwhich settings using the tools of a branch of economics known as mechanism design. 7 These\ntools allow you to ascertain the extent to which a given contract is consistent with opportunistic\nbehavior by trading partners, taking into account that they may have superior information and\nmay be able to take actions you cannot observe. In a famous example, over 30 years ago the\neconomist Robert Townsend showed that in certain settings a plain-vanilla debt contract is\nexactly the optimal contract, in the sense that no other form of financial contract would make the\nborrower or lender better off without making the other one worse off. 8 The same logic applies to\nfinancial institutions, such as banks, which can be thought of as a complex multilateral array of\ncontracts. Equally famous work by the economist Doug Diamond showed that in certain settings\nbanks do better than a system of bilateral lending. 9\nMechanism design, as an approach to understanding financial markets, emphasizes the\nendogeneity of contracts and institutions. It takes into account in a systematic way the various\nfrictions and transactions costs that make borrowing and investing challenging, such as limits to\nthe information of various parties or the inability to precommit to future actions. It builds on the\nnotion that contracting parties choose the form of contract for their mutual benefit. Mechanism\ndesign provides a way to understand and predict how financial contracts and institutions might\nadapt and evolve in response to changes in their economic environment.\nOne important part of the economic environment to which private financial institutions and\ncontracts adapt is the set of rules imposed and actions taken by the government in its interactions\nwith financial markets. Take, for instance, the two means of preventing the inefficient, selffulfilling bank runs that I discussed earlier. One relies on the expectation of government support\nin the event of financial stress. The other relies on the incentives of market participants to adopt\ncontractual arrangements that are as robust as possible to potential stresses. But the private\nincentives that drive this second approach depend on what people believe about the likelihood of\ngovernment support in the event of a crisis. If they believe such support is likely, then their\nincentive to adopt more resilient arrangements is weaker.\nThe interaction between government backstops and endogenous financial arrangements poses a\nvery general problem for policymaking. If we observe financial institutions or markets that are\nvulnerable to runs, it could reflect inherent fragility, or alternatively it could reflect expectations\nof government support that short circuit the incentive to adopt more robust arrangements.\n\n4\n\n\fAs policymakers entered 2007, the economics literature offered them two broad but\nfundamentally different views of the world — two theories of financial instability. One tends to\nview market institutions and contracts as relatively fixed and the resulting financial system as\ninherently prone to the type of instability depicted by the simple model of bank runs. Under this\ntheory, an expectation of government support may be necessary to make crises less likely,\nalthough that support necessitates regulatory oversight and constraints on banks to replace the\nmarket discipline that is lost when counterparties feel protected by government guarantees.\nIn the alternative view, private financial arrangements are themselves adaptable and endogenous.\nMuch of the vulnerability observed in financial markets is itself the induced response of market\ninstitutions and behaviors to the expectation of government backstop support in the event of\ndistress. In the absence of that expectation, there would be stronger incentives to seek more\nrobust arrangements.\nSo on the eve of 2007, policymakers were faced with two broad, competing views on the origins\nof financial market fragility — either it was inherent in the structure of financial arrangements,\nor it was induced by expectations of government support.\nThe Backstory\nBefore discussing the policy debates of 2007, it’s worth briefly reviewing the lead up to the\ncrisis. Three threads course through this backstory. The first consists of the instances of financial\nstress that recur from time to time in U.S. history. There were significant panics in the second\nhalf of the 19th century in which investors sought to convert their deposits into currency. Bank\nfailures were widespread at the start of the Great Depression, when deflation made it hard for\nborrowers to repay fixed-dollar debts. Bank failures were small and isolated in the 1950s and\n1960s but began growing in size and frequency in the 1970s. Inflation and subsequent regulatory\nforbearance led to widespread failures among savings and loan institutions in the 1980s.\nForbearance also extended to large, money center institutions, which were hammered by losses\non loans to less developed countries in the 1970s and 1980s.\nOfficial government support is the second thread in this backstory. The founding of the Federal\nReserve in 1913 gave the Fed the capacity to act as a public sector backstop to banks — a\n“lender of last resort” — in the event of a run. Despite this there were widespread bank failures\nin the Great Depression. The associated losses of deposit savings by households and firms\nprompted tighter restrictions on bank activities and the creation of the Federal Deposit Insurance\nCorp., or FDIC. 10\nThe third key feature of the backstory is the increasing frequency, starting in the 1970s, of\ngovernment support being extended beyond the official scope of deposit insurance. This\ninvolved a series of successively larger institutions, including the noteworthy Continental Illinois\nin 1984, which prompted Congressional testimony that saw a senior federal bank regulator\nacknowledge that the largest 11 banks would not be allowed to fail without government\nassistance. 11 This was the first public articulation of the notion of “too big to fail.”\n\n5\n\n\fOther actions, beyond traditional banking, also contributed to the perception of an implicit\ngovernment commitment to dampen financial instability, most notably the handling of the\ncollapse of Penn Central in 1970, the response to the stock market crash of 1987 and the\nresponse to financial distress at Long-Term Capital Management in 1997.\nThis history created a situation at the beginning of this century in which it was widely\nacknowledged that a large fraction of our financial system was believed to be backed by explicit\nor implicit government guarantees. 12 In fact, in 2002 at the Richmond Fed we estimated that, as\nof the end of 1999, the share of financial sector liabilities likely to benefit from government\nprotection was about 45 percent. Out of this, 27 percent was explicit protection, while the\nremaining 18 percent was implicit. 13\nAugust 16, 2007\nTurning to the crisis itself, the story should be more familiar. As home prices crested and began\nto decline in many markets in late 2006 and early 2007, the cumulative rates of default on the\nmost recent vintage mortgages began to rise precipitously, particularly for loans with\nnonstandard features — low credit scores, low down payments and minimal documentation, for\ninstance. The clear implication was that that the ultimate loss rates on those mortgages were\ngoing to exceed original expectations by a significant margin. Most of these loans had been\nsecuritized and sold, which dispersed the risk across the financial system. In early 2007, several\nfirms involved in originating and securitizing such loans experienced financial distress, and some\nfailed. The FOMC transcripts for 2007 show that as the housing market worsened — and strains\nemerged in housing finance — Committee participants actively discussed the likely magnitude of\nthe fall out for the rest of the economy.\nHousing-related financial market turbulence came to a head in August 2007, particularly in the\nmarket for asset-backed commercial paper, or ABCP. These securities were backed by the\nissuer’s holdings of a variety of assets, including mortgage-backed securities of various types. A\nsponsoring financial firm — typically a large commercial or investment bank — would transfer a\nportfolio of assets into a separate legal entity, which in turn would issue the commercial paper.\nAs the incoming housing market data called into question the value of mortgage-backed\nsecurities, the spread between interest rates on ABCP and interest rates on comparable Treasury\nsecurities began to rise. As maturing paper came due, some sponsoring firms took the underlying\nassets back onto their own balance sheets, and the volume of ABCP issued fell dramatically. 14\nWith more banks turning to the unsecured interbank markets for funding, interest rates there rose\nsignificantly on August 9 and 10.\nIn this environment the Fed took its first official action in response to the financial crisis. The\nFOMC typically sets a target value for the federal funds rate — the rate at which banks lend to\neach other in the overnight market. For many years the interest rate that the Federal Reserve\nBanks set on their discount window loans to banks had been set at a fixed margin of one\npercentage point over the federal funds rate target. On a videoconference call the evening of\nAugust 16, the FOMC decided to lower that spread to one half of a percentage point.\n\n6\n\n\fThis move reflected a judgment that deteriorating conditions in the ABCP market were creating\nstrains in the banking system that, without an expansion of Fed lending, threatened to reduce the\nsupply of credit to the rest of the economy. The problem was compounded, in this view, by the\nstigma that banks seemed to associate with the Fed’s discount window — the idea that if\ncounterparties found out that you borrowed from the window, they might downgrade their\nassessment of your creditworthiness. 15 Announced at 8 a.m. the morning of August 17, the Fed’s\ndiscount rate reduction — from 6-1/4 percent to 5-3/4 percent — was meant to encourage more\nborrowing. Later that morning Fed officials spoke with a group of bankers and urged them not to\nthink of borrowing from the Fed as a sign of weakness. The following week, the four largest U.S.\nbanks borrowed from their discount windows on a coordinated basis to demonstrate the propriety\nof borrowing from the Fed.\nThe diagnosis underlying the actions taken in August 2007 set the direction for policy\nprescriptions as the financial crisis unfolded; central bank credit would be used to alleviate\nstrains in an inherently fragile financial system. When the flow of borrowing from the Fed\nseemed to remain relatively low even after the discount rate reduction, the Fed introduced new\nprograms to push more credit out to the banking system, beginning with the Term Auction\nFacility, or TAF, in December 2007. This was followed by the rescues and an array of lending\nprograms introduced over the course of 2008.\nAt the time of the August 2007 discount rate cut, I questioned the presumption that the markets\nwere suffering from a problem for which increased Fed credit was the solution. An alternative\ndiagnosis of the situation was that the deterioration in housing market conditions was causing a\nfundamental revaluation of housing-related financial instruments. Because exposures to this\nrevaluation were distributed throughout the financial system, uncertainty about the\ncreditworthiness of counterparties had increased substantially, and this caused investors to\ndemand higher-risk premiums in compensation. For ABCP sponsors, bringing assets back onto\ntheir balance sheet was often less costly than paying elevated premiums to investors. This\nexplained the reduced volumes in the ABCP market, but it required raising funds from other\nsources, such as the interbank market, which in turn contributed to the observed volatility and\nelevated interest rates on the interbank market. The ABCP market didn’t “seize up,” under this\ninterpretation, it simply moved elsewhere.\nAnother source of additional bank funding in August 2007 was the Federal Home Loan Banks.\nThese institutions are government-sponsored intermediaries that lend to their member banks.\nBecause they are viewed as likely to be rescued by Congress in the event of distress, they\ngenerally can borrow from institutional investors at very favorable terms and pass on the funding\nadvantage to their borrowers. Lending by the Home Loan Banks surged by $110 billion during\nthe turmoil in August 2007 because they charged interest rates that were well below those\ncharged by the Fed. Indeed, when the Fed began to auction off credit in the TAF, a large share of\nthe borrowings was taken by foreign banks, which did not have access to Home Loan Bank\nfunding.\nEvidence from research conducted since 2007 is consistent with the notion that increases in\ncounterparty credit risk drove the financial market turmoil that August. A study by Daniel M.\nCovitz, Nellie Liang and Gustavo A. Suarez showed that the extent to which counterparties\n7\n\n\fpulled away from issuers of ABCP was directly related to the extent of their holdings of risky\nhousing-related assets. 16 And work by John Taylor and John Williams suggests that the evidence\non the behavior of interest rate spreads around that time is consistent with counterparty risk. 17\nWhile these research results were not available to policymakers in real time, they do support the\nhypothesis that markets were responding in a plausibly efficient manner to a significant revision\nin expectations about the underlying economic fundamentals. If that’s true, then central bank\nlending, by subsidizing borrowers, is likely to have simply undercut the private lending that\nwould have taken place. This increases moral hazard by reducing the perceived cost to financial\ninstitutions of getting into funding difficulty in the future.\nThis trade-off between cushioning the blow of financial market disruptions and distorting banks’\nincentives is typically thought of as a long-run issue. Because financial crises are relatively\ninfrequent, the incentive distortion will only affect outcomes in the relatively distant future, in\nthis view. This may be why policymakers often seem willing to act so aggressively against\ncurrent turmoil and often seem confident that sufficient time remains to contain moral hazard\neffects through tougher regulation. But the crisis we have just been through tells a more\ncomplicated story. It wasn’t just some distant future crisis that was affected by the precedents\nbeing set; it was the next chapter in the current crisis. Each new move to expand institutions’\nreliance on Fed lending also had the effect of increasing expectations of official support in the\nmonths ahead.\nSo it seems quite plausible to me that the signal sent by the Fed’s lending actions in August 2007\ndampened the willingness of troubled institutions, such as Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers, to\nseek safer solutions to the strains they were facing — whether by raising capital, selling assets or\nreducing reliance on short-term funding. In March 2008, Bear and many other large investment\nbanks remained dependent on overnight repo markets to fund holdings of some illiquid\nmortgage-related assets. The perceived likelihood of Fed support in the event that investors\npulled away is bound to have influenced the choice to continue that dependence.\nWhen Bear lost funding in mid-March, the critical fear was that without government support,\ninvestors would pull away from other investment banks as well. Backstop lending was thus\nnecessitated by expectations of backstop lending. The assisted purchase of Bear Stearns seems\nlikely to have influenced in turn the perceptions of government support for other large financial\ninstitutions, which seems likely to have affected how such firms were positioned as the events of\nthe fall unfolded. I believe that a more measured response by the Fed in August 2007 could have\nresulted in significantly less instability in 2008, although I recognize that I say this with the\nbenefit of hindsight.\nFinancial Stability Policy After the Crisis\nAfter the crisis, attention has naturally turned to financial reform. Not surprisingly, alternative\nvisions of financial stability yield different prescriptions for the path forward. The main engine\nof post crisis financial policy is the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection\nAct, a massive new rule book with enhanced standards for regulation and market practices. Both\nthe inherent fragility view and the induced fragility view find voice in this legislation.\n8\n\n\fAccordingly, the law itself contains some internal contradictions: some good points, some bad\npoints. There’s no doubt that interpretation and implementation of this law, and other policy\nactions to promote financial stability, will continue to be influenced by the alternative theoretical\nperspectives I’ve discussed.\nIt would take a separate lecture to do justice to the Dodd-Frank Act. I will just highlight one\nproject that in my view holds out the promise of improving financial stability no matter which\nview one subscribes to. Title I of Dodd-Frank requires that important financial firms submit\ncredible “living wills” — that is, plans for exactly how they would be wound down in the event\nof bankruptcy. Credible plans for resolving large failing financial institutions without\ngovernment support can bolster policymakers’ commitment to refrain from fragility-inducing\nrescues. And a detailed living will provides a road map for restructuring a firm so that it is not\ninherently fragile.\nMany commentators argue that the crisis discredited modern economic science. I disagree. As I\nhave pointed out along the way, several economists warned long ago about the risks associated\nwith maturity transformation and government backstops. For some commentators, the crisis\ndemonstrated that financial arrangements are inherently more fragile than we had thought. But\none could just as well argue that the crisis showed how much fragility can be induced by\nambiguous rescue policy.\nThere’s no doubt that the crisis will stimulate research for decades to come. Given the magnitude\nof the interventions we’ve seen, research that improves financial policy could yield enormous\nsocial benefits. In this connection I would note that our most recent estimates at the Richmond\nFed are that, as of December 31, 2011, 57 percent of financial sector liabilities benefit from\nperceived government support. This is up from 45 percent over a decade ago and reflects in part\nan expansion of implied commitments based on new precedents set during this crisis. In my\nview, this growth in government support for the financial sector is not sustainable. As economic\npolicy challenges go, I would rate this as second only to the looming federal fiscal imbalance. I\nsincerely hope we can make progress in the years ahead.\n\n1\n\nGraham Allison, “Essence of Decision: Explaining the Cuban Missile Crisis,” 1st edition, New York: Little Brown,\n1971.\n2\nJeffrey Lacker, “Economics After the Crisis: Reflections on a Return to Madison,” Speech at the University of\nWisconsin-Madison, Madison, Wis., October 3, 2011; and “Reflections on Economics, Policy, and the Financial\nCrisis,” Speech to the Kentucky Economic Association, Frankfort, Ky., September 24, 2010.\n3\nThese transcripts are available online at http://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomchistorical2007.htm.\n4\nI would like to thank John Weinberg, Kartik Athreya, Ned Prescott and Huberto Ennis for assistance in preparing\nthis lecture.\n5\nDouglas W.

        "content": "Ending ‘Too Big to Fail’ Is Going to Be Hard Work\nApril 9, 2013\nJeffrey M. Lacker\nPresident\nFederal Reserve Bank of Richmond\nUniversity of Richmond\nRichmond, Va.\n\nLet me start by welcoming the Global Interdependence Center to Richmond, Va., and by\nthanking them for the invitation to speak with you this morning. My topic concerns the\nrelationship between the financial sector and the public sector in the United States. The financial\ncrisis of 2007–08 exposed fundamental flaws in that relationship, and a wide range of reform\nproposals subsequently emerged, many of which were considered in the debate leading up to the\nDodd-Frank financial regulatory legislation of 2010. Some found their way into the act itself, but\nthat did not put an end to debates about finance and government in our postcrisis world. Indeed,\nan array of proposals have garnered attention in recent months, from breaking up large financial\ninstitutions to expanding existing government backstops to a broader range of financial market\nactivities. While many ideas have been put forth, there appears to be widespread agreement on at\nleast one of the goals of financial reform ― ending “too big to fail.” This morning, I would like\nto discuss what I believe needs to be done to end “too big to fail.” As always, my remarks today\nwill reflect my own views and are not necessarily shared by others in the Federal Reserve\nSystem. 1\nThe phrase “too big to fail” has become something of an all-purpose descriptor for problems\nafflicting financial markets. It’s actually a bit of a misnomer, though, because of the multiple\nmeanings of the word “failure.” One might think that protecting a firm from failure means\nprotecting shareholders from losses. But the incentive problems associated with the phenomenon\nwe call “too big to fail” stem more from the protection of creditors. A firm could “fail” in the\nsense that its equity is wiped out and management of the firm’s operations is removed, but if\ncreditors expect government support that limits their losses, then their incentive to avoid risk will\nbe severely depressed. A firm that can borrow with implicit government guarantees will find\ndebt to be relatively inexpensive and will be more highly leveraged than if its debt were fairly\npriced.\nBroadly stated, “too big to fail” consists of two mutually reinforcing problems. First, creditors of\nsome financial institutions feel protected by an implicit government commitment of support\nshould the institution become financially troubled. Second, policymakers often feel compelled to\n1\n\n\fprovide support to certain financial institutions to insulate creditors from losses. Instances of\nsuch intervention reinforce creditors’ expectations of support and encourage reliance on highly\nliquid funding sources that make such support more likely. Creditor expectations of support, in\nturn, force policymakers to intervene in the event of distress, since disappointing those\nexpectations by withholding support would provoke a sudden, turbulent readjustment of investor\nexpectations regarding support for other, similarly situated firms. Perceived guarantees thus\nencourage fragility, which induces interventions, which encourages further fragility. The result is\nseriously distorted incentives to monitor and control risk and taxpayer-funded subsidies to\nfinancial firms that are widely viewed as deeply unfair.\nTo end “too big to fail,” therefore, we need to bring about two mutually reinforcing conditions.\nThe first is that creditors do not expect government support in the event of financial distress. The\nsecond is that policymakers allow financial firms to fail without government support. If we can\nachieve that commitment and make it credible to market participants, we can improve private\nsector incentives to avoid fragile financing arrangements and limit risk-taking, thereby reducing\nthe pressure for government intervention.\nAllowing a financial firm to fail without government support for creditors does not mean that the\noperations and activities of the failing firm will simply come to an abrupt halt. Outside of the\nfinancial sector, most firms ― even relatively large ones ― fail by filing for bankruptcy, thereby\ninitiating court-supervised procedures to either restructure obligations and continue operations or\nliquidate assets and distribute the proceeds to creditors. If it proves more valuable to creditors,\ncollectively, to continue the firm’s operations as a going concern than to liquidate, bankruptcy\nprovides a mechanism for doing so. Indeed, several large airline companies have gone through\nbankruptcy reorganization while continuing regular flight operations.\nA key provision of Title I of the Dodd-Frank Act requires that bank holding companies larger\nthan $50 billion in assets, as well as certain nonbank financial companies, draw up detailed plans\nfor their orderly resolution in bankruptcy, without government assistance, and submit them to\nregulators. 2 In my remarks, I will discuss the work currently underway on these resolution plans,\nalso known as “living wills.” I will argue that resolution planning represents the most promising\npath toward ending “too big to fail.” Indeed, I believe that without robust and credible resolution\nplans, other financial reform strategies will be incomplete and likely to fall short.\nWe Didn’t End ‘Too Big to Fail’\nMuch of the financial reform agenda since the crisis has focused on enhancing the supervision of\nlarge financial firms, with the goal of reducing the probability that they experience financial\ndistress. For example, regulators have implemented enhanced capital and liquidity standards for\nso-called “systemically important financial institutions.” Through the capital stress test process,\nregulators regularly assess whether firms’ current and planned capital positions would prove\nadequate under plausible adverse scenarios. These and other supervisory enhancements are\nessential to containing moral hazard and improving financial stability.\nWhile capital levels at large U.S. financial firms have improved, some critics argue that\nsubstantial further increases in capital requirements are warranted. 3 Higher capital ratios, all else\n2\n\n\fconstant, would reduce the probability that a financial firm incurs losses large enough to make it\ninsolvent. One clear lesson of the financial crisis, in my view, is that capital ratios at large\nfinancial firms were inadequate. But another lesson of the financial crisis is that we need some\nattention as well to what actually happens in the event that a large financial firm becomes\ninsolvent, as rare as that may be. Once a firm’s capital has been eroded, the fact that it had higher\ncapital before being hit by shocks is of little comfort. The complexity of modern financial firms\nand the resulting apprehensions about the consequences of their unassisted failure motivated the\nwide array of government and Fed actions taken during the financial crisis. The anticipation of\nthose responses can have powerful incentive effects in normal times. Because we are unlikely to\nraise capital levels high enough to completely eliminate the possibility of financial failure, it’s\nessential that we be prepared to handle such failures, should they occur.\nSome observers argue that the problems associated with resolving a large or complex financial\ninstitution have largely been addressed. In particular, they point to the Federal Deposit Insurance\nCorp.’s Orderly Liquidation Authority, or OLA, as credible mechanism for resolving financial\nfirms without bailouts. This portion of the Dodd-Frank Act, Title II, gives the FDIC the\nauthority, with the agreement of other financial regulators, to take a firm into receivership if it\nbelieves the firm’s failure poses a threat to financial stability. 4 Many provisions of Title II mirror\nprovisions of the bankruptcy code, and in winding down a firm under the OLA, the FDIC is to be\nguided by what various claimants would be estimated to receive in a bankruptcy proceeding. But\nthe FDIC does have the ability to deviate in some important ways from what might occur under\nbankruptcy. In particular, it can make payments to creditors it deems “necessary,” and it can\ndraw on funds from the Treasury to do so. 5 Indeed, the FDIC has announced its willingness to do\nso in some circumstances. 6 This ability, and willingness, opens the door for creditors to believe\nthey might benefit from such treatment and therefore to pay less attention to risk than they\nshould. If expectations of support for financially distressed institutions in orderly liquidation\nbecame widespread, regulators would likely feel forced to provide support simply to avoid the\nturbulence of disappointing expectations. We will have replicated the two mutually reinforcing\nproblems that define “too big to fail.”\nWhat to Do?\nThis feature of the implementation of Title II ― that it recreates the capabilities and incentives\nthat originally gave rise to excessive government rescues ― motivates the view that more needs\nto be done in order to truly end “too big to fail.” Many recent proposals to address the problem\nwould make structural changes to financial firms ― imposing quantitative limits on their size,\nfor instance, or prohibiting certain risky capital market activities. 7 In my view, it makes perfect\nsense to constrain the scale and scope of financial firms in a way that ensures that they can be\nresolved in an orderly manner, without government protection for creditors. But how would you\nknow you have chosen the right limits? Is size alone the issue, and if so, how small should you\nmake them? If activities are the problem, which ones make them hard to resolve? And how do\nyou know you haven’t gone too far and sacrificed valuable efficiencies that may derive from the\ncurrent industrial organization of the financial system?\nThe only approach I can envision to answering such questions is resolution planning ― that is,\nthe hard work of mapping out in detail just what problems the unassisted bankruptcy of a large\n3\n\n\ffinancial firm as it’s currently structured might encounter. Such maps would provide an objective\nbasis for judgments about how the structure or activities of such firms need to be altered in order\nto give policymakers the confidence to choose unassisted bankruptcy in the event of distress, but\nwithout going too far and unnecessarily eliminating efficiencies associated with economies of\nscale and scope. In addition, the process of writing credible living wills would illuminate efforts\nto identify ways in which the bankruptcy code could be improved to make the resolution of\nfinancial firms more orderly. 8\nLiving Wills\nThe Dodd-Frank Act requires that bank holding companies larger than $50 billion in assets, as\nwell as nonbank financial companies supervised by the Fed, submit resolution plans annually to\nthe Federal Reserve and the FDIC. 9 A final rule implementing this provision was announced by\nthe Fed and the FDIC in October 2011. A plan, or “living will,” is a description of a firm’s\nstrategy for rapid and orderly resolution under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code in the event of material\nfinancial distress or failure. It must contain a detailed description of the firm’s organizational\nstructure, key management information systems, critical operations and a mapping of the\nrelationship between core business lines and legal entities. The heart of the plan is specification\nof the actions the firm would take to facilitate rapid and orderly resolution and prevent adverse\neffects of failure, including the firm’s strategy to maintain operations of and funding for material\nentities. Firms are required to provide analysis under the three economic scenarios stipulated in\nthe Board of Governors capital stress test analysis ― “baseline,” “adverse” and “severely\nadverse.” Plans may not rely on the provision of extraordinary support by the U.S. government.\nThe Federal Reserve and the FDIC can jointly determine that a plan is not credible or would not\nfacilitate an orderly resolution under the Bankruptcy Code, in which case the firm would be\nrequired to submit a revised plan to address identified deficiencies. A resubmission could include\nplans to change the business operations and corporate structure in order to eliminate deficiencies.\nIf the Fed and the FDIC jointly determine that the revised plan does not remedy identified\ndeficiencies, they can require higher capital, leverage liquidity requirements or restrict the\ngrowth, activities or operations of the firm. In essence, regulators can order changes in the\nstructure and operations of a firm to make it resolvable in bankruptcy without government\nassistance.\nRegulators last year required the first round of submissions from the largest U.S. firms and\nforeign-based companies with significant U.S. assets. 10 These plans reflect considerable effort by\ncovered companies to address requirements of the resolution plan rule. Through the process of\ndeveloping the plans, firms deepened their understanding of their own structure and operations,\nas well as the vulnerabilities that may arise in resolution. The plans have provided improved\ninsight into the workings of firms, including their complex legal entity structures, financial and\noperational interconnectedness across the different affiliates, and those critical operations that are\ncrucial to financial stability. These insights are being used to enhance supervision more broadly\nand promote industry best practices.\nThe process of constructing a set of robust and credible living wills must be iterative. Because of\nthe magnitude of the planning efforts required, it made sense to have streamlined requirements\n4\n\n\ffor the initial round of submissions; for example, firms were asked for analysis under just one\neconomic scenario, rather than three. First-round submissions have provided valuable lessons\nlearned, both for covered firms and for supervisors, about areas where further analysis is needed.\nRegulators intend to provide feedback to these firms to help guide subsequent rounds of\nsubmissions. Over time, our collective understanding of how the unassisted resolution of a large\nfinancial entity works will deepen. Armed with that understanding, we can bolster policymakers’\nconfidence in the plans through appropriate preparations, including structural changes in the\nnature and organization of the business operations of financial firms. This confidence can move\nus closer to the day when bankruptcy is as much of a nonevent in finance as it is in the airline\nindustry.\nHard Work Ahead\nSeveral critical challenges must be addressed, however, for the living wills project to succeed.\nOne relates to globally active financial firms with interdependent entities in different national\njurisdictions. Achieving an orderly resolution of such a firm can be difficult, because regulatory\nauthorities in different jurisdictions may be concerned primarily with the continuity of operations\nand taxpayer impact in their own country. 11 One approach to this problem is to require globally\nactive firms to form distinct legal subsidiaries, with separate capital and liquidity holdings, to\nconduct material overseas operations, so that they can be resolved separately in the event of\ndistress. 12 The ability to expeditiously sell material foreign operations would provide valuable\nflexibility and would obviate dependence on cross-national negotiations about interaffiliate\nmovements in capital and funding. Widespread use of subsidiarization could well impose\nadditional operational costs on such firms or limit their ability to shift capital among affiliates. If\nsubsidiarization is what it takes to make a resolution plan credible, however, then the resulting\nburden to private firms should be viewed as a measure of the subsidization attributable to their\n“too big to fail” status. This is a good example of the types of trade-offs that the living wills\nwork will help us understand.\nSubsidiarization has potentially broader uses in the preparation of living wills. One simple\napproach to resolution is for the highest-level parent company to file for bankruptcy, treating all\nthe (domestic) affiliates as part of a single concern. This parallels the FDIC’s announced\nintention to handle resolutions under its OLA through a “single point of entry.” At the same time,\nhowever, we should devote ample effort to being able to sell off significant subsidiaries as standalone entities where that might make good economic sense. This might mean investing ahead of\ntime in distinct operational infrastructures or in writing service agreements that would survive\nthe bankruptcy of one affiliate. We should not assume that “all hands go down with the ship” in a\nsingle-point-of-entry scenario, when preparing sturdy lifeboats might make better sense.\nPerhaps the most critical challenge for resolution planning concerns funding. The U.S.\nBankruptcy Code allows the bankrupt firm to obtain, subject to court approval, “debtor-inpossession,” or DIP, financing that is generally senior to pre-existing creditors. Such financing\ncan be useful to fund ongoing operations — for example, to pay off certain creditors, such as\nvendors, rather than retain them in bankruptcy proceedings. Other creditors often find it\nadvantageous to approve DIP funding, despite the dilution of their own claims, because it\nensures continued access to trade credit. The FDIC’s authority to lend to distressed institutions\n5\n\n\funder its OLA amounts to government-provided DIP financing. The beneficial feature of\nprivately provided DIP financing is the presumption that, because it’s provided by market\nparticipants but also approved by creditors and the court, it’s fairly priced and thus unsubsidized\nand does not unduly disadvantage any particular class of creditors. Indeed, this is why unassisted\nbankruptcy is so critical to ending “too big to fail,” and is why firms were prohibited from\nassuming extraordinary government support in their resolution plans.\nFor large financial firms, creating a credible funding plan that avoids adverse effects, without\nresorting to government DIP financing, might seem daunting, given their scale and the limited\nobserved size of private DIP financing to date. 13 The scale of a firm’s potential liquidity need,\nhowever, is heavily influenced by how it manages liquidity prior to experiencing financial\ndistress. Just as operational obstacles to an orderly resolution can be remedied by reorganizing\noperations ahead of time, funding challenges that would otherwise arise in the bankruptcy of a\nlarge financial firm can be contained through appropriate changes in liquidity management in\nnormal times.\nOne might worry that the changes in liquidity management required to render a resolution plan\ncredible without government-provided DIP financing might squelch socially beneficial maturity\ntransformation. One should also be concerned, however, that “too big to fail” has resulted in a\nsocially excessive scale of maturity transformation, since the associated fragility is more likely to\nelicit government support to protect creditors than intermediation that does not involve maturity\ntransformation. In my own view, the latter should be our dominant consideration in the wake of\nthis crisis.\nConclusion\nIn conclusion, it’s vitally important that regulators work together to ensure the adoption of robust\nand highly credible resolution plans for large financial institutions. The financial industry also\nhas an interest in ending “too big to fail” and thereby strengthening reliance on market discipline,\nbecause the alternative implies an ever-expanding blanket of safety and soundness regulations\nthat threatens to smother the ability to offer useful financial products and services.\nThe living wills program will require a great deal of hard work and detailed analysis. But I see\nno other way to reliably identify exactly what changes are needed in the structure and operations\nof financial institutions to end “too big to fail.” I see no other way to achieve a situation in which\npolicymakers consistently prefer unassisted bankruptcy to incentive-corroding intervention and\ninvestors are convinced that unassisted bankruptcy is the norm.\nCredible living wills may require significant changes for financial firms. They could lead to\nmore capital, less complex relationships among affiliates and perhaps even to smaller firms.\n“Too big to fail” is unsustainable. Ambiguous implied commitments induce fragilities that in\nturn induce intervention that expands implied commitments. Richmond Fed economists\nestimated that, at the end of 1999, about 45 percent of financial sector liabilities were explicitly\nor implicitly government guaranteed. At the end of 2011, as a result of the precedents set during\nthe crisis, they estimated the figure to have grown to 57 percent. 14 This fraction is likely to\n\n6\n\n\fcontinue to grow unless we end “too big to fail.” And to end “too big to fail,” we need to do the\nhard work of learning what it takes to make all firms safe to fail without government rescues.\n1\n\nI am grateful for assistance from John Weinberg in preparing these remarks.\nSee section 165(d) of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act.\n3\nSee Anat Admati and Martin Hellwig, “The Banker’s New Clothes: What’s Wrong with Banking and What to Do\nabout It,” Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 2013.\n4\nFor a comparison of the Orderly Liquidation Authority provisions with the bankruptcy process, see Sabrina R.\nPellerin and John R. Walter, “Orderly Liquidation Authority as an Alternative to Bankruptcy,” Federal Reserve Bank\nof Richmond Economic Quarterly, First Quarter 2012, vol. 98, no. 1, pp. 1-31.\n5\nFunds paid in excess of what a creditor would have received in bankruptcy must be recovered from the\ndisposition of the failed firm’s assets, or if this amount is insufficient, from clawing back any additional payments\n(payments beyond what would have been received in a liquidation) made to creditors, and, if that is insufficient, by\ntaxing all large bank holding companies and other SIFIs. See section 210(o) of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform\nand Protection Act.\n6\nSee remarks by Martin J. Gruenberg, acting chairman of the FDIC, to the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago Bank\nStructure Conference, May 10, 2012. Gruenberg stated: “The new resolution authority comes with access to a new\nsource of liquidity support provided by the Dodd-Frank Act: the Orderly Liquidation Fund, or OLF, located in the\nTreasury Department. The OLF must either be repaid from recoveries on the assets of the failed firm or from\nassessments against the largest, most complex financial companies. Taxpayers cannot bear any loss from the\nresolution of a financial company under the Dodd-Frank Act. The OLF does address a critical issue to prevent a\nsystem-wide collapse, as we saw with the Lehman bankruptcy, because it provides an emergency source of\nliquidity to allow the bridge financial company to complete transactions that provide real value and prevent\ncontagion effects. While the OLF can be a source of direct funding for the resolution, it can also be used to provide\nguarantees, within limits, on the debt of the new company.”\n7\nSee, for instance, Richard W.

        "content": "Economic Outlook, May 2013\nMay 3, 2013\nJeffrey M. Lacker\nPresident\nFederal Reserve Bank of Richmond\nRisk Management Association, Richmond Chapter\nRichmond, Va.\n\nIt’s a pleasure to address the Richmond Chapter of the Risk Management Association once\nagain. We’ve typically held this event on a cold, blustery January day. Shifting the date to early\nMay puts us in the midst of a truly wonderful springtime in Richmond this year. Our landscape is\ngraced now with an abundance of dogwoods and azaleas in full bloom, which makes it hard not\nto feel a bit more optimistic about the world. I’ll be discussing economic conditions, however,\nand they call economics the dismal science for a reason; so my description of the outlook may\ncontrast with the cheery thoughts inspired by our magnificent spring. Nevertheless, I will argue\nthat our situation is not as dismal as many would have you think, and the economic landscape\ndoes have its attractive elements. Before I begin, I should emphasize that the views expressed are\nmy own and should not be attributed to anyone else in the Federal Reserve System. 1\nI’ll start with some good news about the economic situation; inflation remains well contained.\nOver the last four quarters, our most reliable measure of prices, the price index for personal\nconsumption expenditure, has risen 1.2 percent. That’s on the low side of our recent experience.\nInflation has been fluctuating around 2 percent, and just a year and a half ago, inflation was 2.8\npercent. There is widespread confidence that the Federal Reserve will keep inflation low and\nstable, consistent with our announced inflation goal of 2 percent. 2 Indeed, most forecasters\nexpect inflation to run at or a little below 2 percent over the next few years, and household\nsurveys and financial market measures also indicate that inflation is expected to remain near its\nlonger-term average. One local example of this confidence was the announcement by The\nCollege of William and Mary that tuition charges would remain fixed over a student’s entire\nfour-year term, which suggests some assurance that inflation will be held in check. My own view\nis that inflation is likely to begin to edge back toward the Federal Open Market Committee’s\n(FOMC) target of 2 percent by next year.\n\n1\n\n\fIn contrast to inflation, which over time is determined by central bank actions, real economic\ngrowth and labor market conditions are affected by a wide variety of factors outside a central\nbank’s control. And it’s real economic conditions that many view as disappointing lately.\nTo get a handle on that disappointment, think back to the beginning of the new millennium and\nrecall the pervasive optimism of the time. Much of that optimism was based on past experience.\nFor example, over the previous half-century we had enjoyed remarkable economic performance\n— real gross domestic product (GDP) grew at a 3.5 percent annual rate between 1950 and 2000.\nSince 2000, though, growth has fallen short of that long-run average. We had a very severe\nrecession in 2008 and 2009, our worst since the 1930s, and growth has averaged 2.1 percent\nsince then, well below the longer-run average. Looking ahead, the key question regarding the\neconomic outlook is whether growth will remain relatively low, or will instead return to rates we\nsaw in the last half of the 20th century.\nThis is an active area of economic research, and would make a suitable topic for a university\nseminar, or perhaps a massive open online course. So I won’t attempt to be comprehensive, but I\ndo want to take a closer look at a few of the features of the post-recession economic expansion\nthat distinguish it from our pre-2000 growth experience.\nFirst, let’s break down GDP growth into two components. One is the growth in employment and\nthe other is growth in labor productivity, measured as GDP per worker. Labor productivity\nincreased at an average of 1.8 percent per year from 1950 to 2000. In this expansion, labor\nproductivity increased rapidly in the last half of 2009, as is typical when coming out of a deep\nrecession. But since then the trend in productivity has been only about 1 percent at an annual\nrate, which has contributed to the slowness of the expansion. Slower productivity growth\ntherefore is responsible for a significant portion of the growth shortfall in this expansion, relative\nto the late 20th century. Productivity growth is the consequence of many disparate factors,\nincluding research and development, business capital expenditures, labor force skills and public\nsector infrastructure investment. Note that monetary policy is not on this list.\nSetting aside labor productivity growth, the rest of real GDP growth is attributable to the growth\nin labor inputs. Employment grew at a 1.7 percent annual rate from 1950 to 2000. Employment\nfell dramatically during the recession and its immediate aftermath, but has expanded at only a 1.1\npercent annual rate since the end of 2009. So a significant portion of the growth shortfall is\nattributable to slower growth in employment.\nMovements in employment have been mirrored by movements in unemployment. During the\nrecession the unemployment rate — the fraction of the labor force that is out of work — rose\nfrom 5.0 percent in December 2007 to 10.0 percent in October 2009. During this expansion, the\nunemployment rate has fallen to a level of 7.6 percent as of March of this year, a pace of seventenths of a percentage point per year. This is faster than the pace at which unemployment fell in\nlast two business-cycle expansions. Thus, this expansion resembles other recent expansions in\nthe pace at which we’ve been able to reduce the pool of unemployed workers.\n\n2\n\n\fThe unusual feature of this expansion, relative to our 20th century experience, is the evolution of\nthe size of the labor force. The fraction of the working age population that is either working or\nactively looking for work — economists call this the labor force participation rate — rose\nsteadily from 1950 to 2000, as women entered the work force in ever larger numbers, and\nimproving health allowed people to work later in life. Since 2000, labor force participation has\nfallen significantly, from a peak of over 67 percent to a rate of 63.3 percent as of March. Much\nof that decline has occurred since the Great Recession. Thus understanding people’s decisions\nabout whether to participate in the labor force is essential to understanding the economic\noutlook.\nOne obvious explanation for the decline in labor force participation is that workers are\ndiscouraged by adverse labor market conditions. Weak GDP leads to a weak demand for labor,\nand poor job prospects can keep some people from even looking for work. This effect was\npronounced during the Great Recession, given the magnitude of the increase in unemployment.\nBut a good deal of time has passed since the recession, and the unemployment rate has come\ndown significantly. Moreover, labor force participation was affected by demographics and other\nstructural factors even before the recession, and these trends have continued and perhaps\nintensified since then.\nOne development that stands out is the sharp fall in the labor force participation of young people.\nIn December 2007, the participation rate for people aged 16 to 24 was 59.2 percent. It fell during\nthe recession, and since then has fallen further; it now stands at 54.5 percent. One might hope\nthis simply reflects more young people pursuing higher education, or possibly students devoting\nmore time to their studies, and there is some evidence to support that hypothesis. This may\nreflect difficulty finding desirable entry-level jobs, a by-product of weak economic growth. But\nit also may reflect a response to the widening wage premium associated with higher levels of\neducation, a broader structural factor that is unlikely to be reversed rapidly.\nAt the older end of the labor market, a basic demographic fact is that over the last decade the\nbaby boom generation has begun entering an age range in which labor force participation\ntypically falls. Thus an increasing fraction of the labor force is in these low-participation-rate\ndemographic groups. As the baby boomers continue to age, this will continue to pull down\noverall labor force participation rates over time. 3\nTurning to the middle of the age distribution, economists who study labor markets often label\nworkers aged 25 to 54 as the “prime working age” population. This group is characterized by\nhigh-participation rates, generally good health, and relatively high productivity, and they play a\nkey role in economic growth. In recent years, the baby boomers have been aging out of the prime\nworking age population, and smaller cohorts have been entering. Back in the 1980s this group\nwas growing by about 2-¼ percent annually, but by the late 1990s growth had fallen below one\npercent per year. The absolute size of the prime working age population has shrunk each year\nsince 2008.\n\n3\n\n\fIn addition to that demographic challenge, participation rates for the prime working-age\npopulation also have fallen, declining from 84 percent in 2000 to 81.4 percent in 2012. While\nweak economic activity could account for some of this decline, other secular trends may be at\nplay.\nTo summarize then, the slow growth in real GDP in this expansion is related both to lower\nproductivity growth and to the decline in labor force participation. Some of the shortfall could\nreflect the lingering effects of the Great Recession on labor force participation. But longer-run\nstructural trends, such as our aging population and the changing schooling decisions of young\npeople, also seem to be playing an important role. If so, we need to adjust to the implication that\nGDP growth will continue to fluctuate around a 2 percent trend for the foreseeable future.\nWith that long-term perspective in mind, we can turn our attention to the latest data and what we\nmight expect over the next year or two. In recent quarters we’ve seen a seesaw pattern, with\ngrowth looking fairly strong for a few months, but then looking fairly weak for a few months.\nFor example, real GDP grew at a 0.4 percent annual rate in the fourth quarter, but is estimated to\nhave grown at a 2.5 percent annual rate in the first quarter.\nOne exception to the choppiness is that housing activity is finally on a solid growth path. New\nhousing starts have more than doubled since the low point in April 2009, and have risen by an\nespecially rapid 47 percent over the last 12 months. Home prices are also on an upswing, rising\nalmost 10 percent in the last 12 months. Now I should caution that residential investment is only\n2.6 percent of GDP, so that housing by itself is only making a modest contribution to overall\nGDP growth. But the improvement in housing activity does seem to have bolstered households’\nconfidence in the market value of their most valuable asset.\nAnd that leads to the outlook for consumer spending, which accounts for 70 percent of GDP.\nOver the last four quarters, real consumer spending has risen by 2.0 percent, in line with real\nGDP. But real disposable personal income has only risen by 0.9 percent over those same four\nquarters, which raises an obvious concern over the viability of the spending growth. The slow\ngrowth in spending in part reflects sluggish compensation growth; for example, average hourly\nearnings have only risen 1.8 percent over the last 12 months, barely ahead of inflation. Another\nfactor that lowered take-home pay is the increase in federal taxes that took effect in January.\nMore broadly, the breadth and depth of the income and wealth shocks that hit American\nhouseholds during the Great Recession are undoubtedly adding to their cautious attitudes. Such\nmemories are unlikely to fade rapidly, so it’s hard to be very bullish on the outlook for consumer\nspending.\nBusiness capital spending is likely to make a sizeable contribution to growth over the next few\nyears. Not surprisingly, investment fell sharply during the recession, but technological advances\nhave continued to provide ample motive for new investment, even in the absence of rapid GDP\ngrowth. Companies appear to be finding ways to improve effectiveness by deploying new\ntechnologies. Business fixed investment rose 5.5 percent last year and most forecasters expect\nsolid growth this year and next.\n4\n\n\fDespite these bright spots in residential and business investment, there are some important\nchallenges that are holding back growth and deserve mention. First, the federal fiscal outlook is a\nmess. Last year the federal deficit exceeded $1 trillion, and was 6.9 percent of GDP. Projections\nby the Congressional Budget Office show the deficit declining for several years but then\nincreasing, without bound, as a fraction of GDP. That large deficit puts the stock of federal debt\non a steep upward trajectory. In other words, the current course is unsustainable, and some\ncombination of higher taxes and less spending growth is inevitable. It’s not clear, though, when\nand by how much any particular tax will increase. It’s also not clear when and by how much any\nparticular spending program will be cut back. This pervasive uncertainty has undoubtedly\naffected business and household decisions, and it appears unlikely that we’ll soon see a grand\nbargain that will put the federal budget on a sustainable, long-term path.\nAnother challenge for the U.S. economy is Europe. The Euro area is in recession, as are other\ncountries; one result is a weak demand for U.S. exports. Several European countries have fiscal\nimbalances that appear to be unsustainable. Moreover, several European countries have unit\nlabor costs well above the German level, making many of their industries uncompetitive and\nshrinking. While there have been dramatic crises in Greece and Cyprus, the fiscal and\ncompetitive challenges are clearly more widespread. At this time it’s hard to see how the\nstruggling countries can return rapidly to a persistent growth path with a sustainable fiscal\npolicy. And it’s difficult to project much growth for Europe as a whole until these problems in\nthe Euro area are healed.\nYet another challenge comes from the need for firms to adapt to the large volume of new\nregulation that has been added in recent years. This is not the place to argue the ultimate merits\nof any particular legislation, but simply to note that even if net social benefits of new regulations\nare significantly positive, businesses may still face large compliance costs that in turn affect\nhiring and investment decisions. Moreover, many key decisions regarding implementation of farreaching regulations have yet to be made, and this uncertainty is another factor affecting firms\nand households. Banks, for example, are worried about new regulations on mortgage lending that\nhave not yet been finalized. A wide range of businesses are worried about how to respond to new\nhealthcare requirements, many of which have not yet been written.\nLet’s take a step back and survey the landscape. Prospects for housing and business investment\nare strong, but uncertainty about fiscal and regulatory policy in the U.S. and economic activity in\nEurope are an offsetting drag on growth. Consumers are cautious, understandably so given what\nthey’ve been through, and are unlikely to drive a spending surge. Adding it all up, the economy’s\ncurrent trend rate of GDP growth appears to be around 2 percent. We are likely to see brief\nswings above and below that rate from time to time, but I don’t see a compelling case for a\nsustained departure any time soon. That’s a change for me; like most other forecasters I’ve been\nlooking for GDP to significantly accelerate a year or two down the road. But I would add that\nwhen I think about the challenges our economy is facing, 2 percent growth actually looks like a\nfairly good outcome. It represents significant forward momentum and sustained real income\n\n5\n\n\fgains. It also demonstrates the resilience of an economy that has weathered a huge shock in the\nmost recent recession and is back on a solid growth track, despite an array of obstacles.\nI’ll end with a few thoughts on monetary policy. Federal Reserve policy is exceptionally\naccommodative right now, with short-term interest rates near zero and our balance sheet at about\nfour times the size it was before financial turmoil began in 2007. A highly expansive policy was\nan appropriate response to a severe recession, I believe. Growth has resumed, however, and it\nappears as if it’s limited, in large part, by structural factors that monetary policy is not capable of\noffsetting. In this situation, the benefit-cost trade-off associated with further monetary stimulus\ndoes not look promising. The Fed seems to be unable to improve real growth, despite striving\nmightily over the last few years, and further increases in the size of our balance sheet raise the\nrisks associated with the “exit process” when it’s time to withdraw stimulus. This is why I do not\nsupport the current asset purchase program.\nKeeping inflation low and stable is within the capability of a modern central bank. On that score,\nthe recent behavior of inflation has been heartening. Measures of inflation expectations remain\nwithin ranges consistent with price stability, and the low current readings on some inflation\nindices are likely to be transitory. Well-contained inflation, the most fundamental contribution a\ncentral bank can make to economic growth, seems likely to continue.\nThank you for your attention, and I would be happy to take any questions.\n1\n\nI am grateful for assistance from Roy Webb and Andreas Hornstein in preparing these remarks.\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, “Longer-Run Goals and Policy Strategy,” News and Events,\nMonetary Policy Press Release, January 29, 2013. 2013.\n3\nThis has been offset somewhat by the increase in participation rates for people aged 65 and older.\n2\n\n6\n\n\f",

        "content": "Ending ‘Too Big to Fail’ Is Going to Be Hard Work\nMay 9, 2013\nJeffrey M. Lacker\nPresident\nFederal Reserve Bank of Richmond\nCouncil on Foreign Relations\nNew York, N.Y.\nThese remarks are abridged from a speech of the same title delivered April 9, 2013, to the\nGlobal Society of Fellows Conference in Richmond, Va.\nIn my opening remarks, I would like to discuss the problem people refer to as “too big to fail.” A\nwide range of reform proposals for dealing with this problem emerged following the crisis of\n2008, many of which were considered in the debate leading up to the Dodd-Frank financial\nregulatory legislation of 2010. Some found their way into the act itself, but that has not put an\nend to the debate. In fact, an array of proposals have garnered attention in recent months, from\nbreaking up large financial institutions to dramatically increasing their capital requirements.\nDespite the diversity of ideas, there appears to be widespread agreement on at least one of the\ngoals of financial reform — ending “too big to fail.” This morning, I would like to discuss some\nwork that I believe is essential to ending “too big to fail.” As always, my remarks today will\nreflect my own views and are not necessarily shared by others in the Federal Reserve System. 1\nBroadly stated, “too big to fail” consists of two mutually reinforcing problems. First, creditors of\nsome financial institutions feel protected by an implicit government commitment of support\nshould the institution become financially troubled. Second, policymakers often feel compelled to\nprovide support to certain financial institutions to insulate creditors from losses. Instances of\nsuch intervention reinforce creditors’ expectations of support and encourage reliance on highly\nliquid funding sources that make such support more likely. Creditor expectations of support, in\nturn, force policymakers to intervene in the event of distress, since disappointing those\nexpectations by withholding support would provoke a sudden, turbulent readjustment of investor\nexpectations regarding support for other, similarly situated firms. Perceived guarantees thus\nencourage fragility, which induces interventions, which encourages further fragility. The result is\nseriously distorted incentives to monitor and control risk and taxpayer-funded subsidies to\nfinancial firms that are widely viewed as deeply unfair.\nTo end “too big to fail,” therefore, we need to bring about two mutually reinforcing conditions.\nThe first is that creditors do not expect government support in the event of financial distress. The\nsecond is that policymakers allow financial firms to fail without government support. If we can\nachieve that commitment and make it credible to market participants, we can improve private\nsector incentives to avoid fragile financing arrangements and limit risk-taking, thereby reducing\nthe pressure for government intervention.\n\n1\n\n\fAllowing a financial firm to fail without government support for creditors does not mean that the\noperations and activities of the failing firm will simply come to an abrupt halt. Outside of the\nfinancial sector, most firms — even relatively large ones — fail by filing for bankruptcy, thereby\ninitiating court-supervised procedures to either restructure obligations and continue operations or\nliquidate assets and distribute the proceeds to creditors. If it proves collectively more valuable to\ncreditors to continue the firm’s operations as a going concern than to liquidate, bankruptcy\nprovides a mechanism for doing so. Indeed, several large airline companies have gone through\nbankruptcy reorganization while continuing regular flight operations. Our goal should be for the\nbankruptcy of a large financial firm to be as much of a nonevent as the bankruptcy of a large\nairline.\nA key provision of Title I of the Dodd-Frank Act requires that bank holding companies larger\nthan $50 billion in assets, as well as certain nonbank financial companies, draw up detailed plans\nfor their orderly resolution in bankruptcy, without government assistance, and submit them to\nregulators. 2 I believe that these resolution plans, also known as “living wills,” represent the most\npromising path toward ending “too big to fail.” Indeed, I believe that without robust and credible\nresolution plans, other financial reform strategies will be incomplete and likely to fall short.\nSome observers see the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.’s Orderly Liquidation Authority, or\nOLA, as a credible mechanism for resolving financial firms without bailouts. But under the\nOLA, the FDIC can make payments to creditors it deems “necessary,” and it can draw on funds\nfrom the Treasury to do so. 3 Indeed, the FDIC has announced its willingness to do so in some\ncircumstances. 4 This ability, and willingness, opens the door for creditors to believe they might\nbenefit from such treatment and therefore to pay less attention to risk than they should. If\nexpectations of support for financially distressed institutions in orderly liquidation became\nwidespread, regulators would likely feel forced to provide support simply to avoid the turbulence\nof disappointing expectations. We will have replicated the two mutually reinforcing problems\nthat define “too big to fail.”\nMany recent proposals to address the “too big to fail” problem would make structural changes to\nfinancial firms — imposing quantitative limits on their size, for instance, or prohibiting certain\nrisky capital market activities. 5 In my view, it makes perfect sense to constrain the scale and\nscope of financial firms in a way that ensures that they can be resolved in an orderly manner,\nwithout government protection for creditors. But how would you know you have chosen the right\nlimits? Is size alone the issue, and if so, how small should you make them? If activities are the\nproblem, which ones make them hard to resolve? And how do you know you haven’t gone too\nfar and sacrificed valuable efficiencies that may derive from the current industrial organization\nof the financial system?\nThe only approach I can envision to answering such questions is resolution planning — that is,\nthe hard work of mapping out in detail just what problems the unassisted bankruptcy of a large\nfinancial firm as it’s currently structured might encounter. Such maps would provide an objective\nbasis for judgments about how the structure or activities of such firms need to be altered in order\nto give policymakers the confidence to choose unassisted bankruptcy in the event of distress, but\nwithout going too far and unnecessarily eliminating efficiencies associated with economies of\nscale and scope.\n2\n\n\fThe Dodd-Frank Act requires that bank holding companies larger than $50 billion in assets, as\nwell as nonbank financial companies supervised by the Fed, submit resolution plans annually to\nthe Federal Reserve and the FDIC. 6 A final rule implementing this provision was announced by\nthe Fed and the FDIC in October 2011. A plan, or “living will,” is a description of a firm’s\nstrategy for rapid and orderly resolution under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code in the event of material\nfinancial distress or failure. It must contain a detailed description of the firm’s organizational\nstructure, key management information systems, critical operations and a mapping of the\nrelationship between core business lines and legal entities. The heart of the plan is specification\nof the actions the firm would take to facilitate rapid and orderly resolution and prevent adverse\neffects of failure, including the firm’s strategy to maintain operations of and funding for their\nmaterial entities. Firms are required to provide analysis under the three economic scenarios —\n“baseline,” “adverse” and “severely adverse.” Plans may not rely on the provision of\nextraordinary support by the U.S. government.\nThe Federal Reserve and the FDIC can jointly determine that a plan is not credible or would not\nfacilitate an orderly resolution under the Bankruptcy Code, in which case the firm would be\nrequired to submit a revised plan to address identified deficiencies. A resubmission could include\nplans to change the business operations and corporate structure in order to eliminate deficiencies.\nIf the Fed and the FDIC jointly determine that the revised plan does not remedy identified\ndeficiencies, they can require higher capital, leverage liquidity requirements or restrict the\ngrowth, activities or operations of the firm. In essence, regulators can order changes in the\nstructure and operations of a firm to make it resolvable in bankruptcy without government\nassistance.\nRegulators last year required the first round of submissions from the largest U.S. firms and\nforeign-based companies with significant U.S. assets. 7 These plans reflect considerable effort by\ncovered companies to address requirements of the resolution plan rule. Through the process of\ndeveloping the plans, firms have deepened their understanding of their own complex legal entity\nstructures, their financial and operational interconnectedness, as well as the vulnerabilities that\nmay arise in their resolution.\nThe living wills program will require more hard work and detailed analysis. But I see no other\nway to reliably identify exactly what changes are needed in the structure and operations of\nfinancial institutions to end “too big to fail.” I see no other way to achieve a situation in which\npolicymakers consistently prefer unassisted bankruptcy to incentive-corroding intervention and\ninvestors are convinced that unassisted bankruptcy is the norm.\nIt is essential that we eliminate the government backstop implied by “too big to fail.” Ambiguous\ncommitments induce fragilities that in turn induce intervention that expands implied\ncommitments. Richmond Fed economists estimated that, at the end of 1999, about 45 percent of\nfinancial sector liabilities were explicitly or implicitly government guaranteed. At the end of\n2011, as a result of the precedents set during the crisis, they estimated the figure to have grown\nto 57 percent. 8 This fraction is likely to continue to grow unless we end “too big to fail.” And to\nend “too big to fail,” we need to do the hard work of learning what it takes to make all firms safe\nto fail without government rescues.\n3\n\n\f1\n\nI am grateful for assistance from John Weinberg in preparing these remarks.\nSee section 165(d) of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act.\n3\nFunds paid in excess of what a creditor would have received in bankruptcy must be recovered from the\ndisposition of the failed firm’s assets, or if this amount is insufficient, from clawing back any additional payments\n(payments beyond what would have been received in a liquidation) made to creditors, and if that is insufficient, by\ntaxing all large bank holding companies and other systemically important financial institutions. See section 210(o)\nof the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Protection Act.\n4\nSee remarks by Martin J. Gruenberg, acting chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., to the Federal\nReserve Bank of Chicago Bank Structure Conference, May 10, 2012. Gruenberg stated: “The new resolution\nauthority comes with access to a new source of liquidity support provided by the Dodd-Frank Act: the Orderly\nLiquidation Fund, or OLF, located in the Treasury Department. The OLF must either be repaid from recoveries on\nthe assets of the failed firm or from assessments against the largest, most complex financial companies. Taxpayers\ncannot bear any loss from the resolution of a financial company under the Dodd-Frank Act. The OLF does address a\ncritical issue to prevent a system-wide collapse, as we saw with the Lehman bankruptcy, because it provides an\nemergency source of liquidity to allow the bridge financial company to complete transactions that provide real\nvalue and prevent contagion effects. While the OLF can be a source of direct funding for the resolution, it can also\nbe used to provide guarantees, within limits, on the debt of the new company.”\n5\nSee, for instance, Richard W.

        "content": "Statement by\nJeffrey M. Lacker\nPresident\nFederal Reserve Bank of Richmond\nbefore the\nCommittee on Financial Services\nU.S. House of Representatives\nWashington, D.C.\nJune 26, 2013\n\nGood morning. I am honored to speak to the Committee about the Dodd-Frank Act and the\npersistence of “too big to fail.”\nAt the outset, I should point out that within the Federal Reserve System, the Board of Governors\nhas sole authority to write rules implementing the requirements of the Dodd-Frank Act. Federal\nReserve Banks supervise financial institutions under authority delegated to them by the Board of\nGovernors. In keeping with Board of Governors guidance, I will not discuss any current or\npotential Federal Reserve rule-making. I also should say that my comments today are my own\nviews and do not necessarily reflect those of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve or\nmy colleagues at other Federal Reserve Banks. 1 My views have been informed by both my\nleadership of the Fifth Federal Reserve District over the last seven years and my experience as a\nresearch economist studying banking policy for the prior 25 years.\nThe problem known as “too big to fail” consists of two mutually reinforcing expectations. First,\nsome financial institution creditors feel protected by an implicit government commitment of\nsupport should the institution face financial distress. This belief dampens creditors’ attention to\nrisk and makes debt financing artificially cheap for borrowing firms, leading to excessive\nleverage and the overuse of forms of debt — such as short-term wholesale funding — that are\nmost likely to enjoy such protection. Second, policymakers at times believe that the failure of a\nlarge financial firm with a high reliance on short-term funding would result in undesirable\ndisruptions to financial markets and economic activity. This expectation induces policymakers to\nintervene in ways that let short-term creditors escape losses, thus reinforcing creditors’\nexpectations of support and firms’ incentives to rely on short-term funding. The result is more\nfinancial fragility and more rescues.\nThe Orderly Liquidation Authority of Title II of the Dodd-Frank Act gives the Federal Deposit\nInsurance Corporation the ability, with the agreement of other financial regulators, to take a firm\ninto receivership if it believes the firm’s failure poses a threat to financial stability. 2 Title II gives\n\n\fthe FDIC the ability to borrow funds from the Treasury (specifically, the Orderly Liquidation\nFund at the Treasury) to make payments to creditors of the failed firm. The funds are to be repaid\nfrom recoveries on the assets of the failed firm or from assessments against the largest, most\ncomplex financial companies. While the FDIC is to pay creditors no more than they would have\nreceived in a liquidation of the firm, the Act provides the FDIC with broad discretion to pay\nmore. 3 This encourages short-term creditors to believe they would benefit from such treatment\nand therefore continue to pay insufficient attention to risk and invest in fragile funding\narrangements. Given widespread expectations of support for financially distressed institutions in\norderly liquidations, regulators will likely feel forced to provide support simply to avoid the\nturbulence of disappointing expectations. We appear to have replicated the two mutually\nreinforcing expectations that define “too big to fail.”\nExpectations of creditor rescues have arisen over the last four decades through the gradual\naccretion of precedents. Research at the Richmond Fed has estimated that one-third of the\nfinancial sector’s liabilities are perceived to benefit from implicit protection, based on actual\ngovernment actions and policy statements. 4 Adding implicit protection to explicit protection\nprograms such as deposit insurance, we found that 57 percent of financial sector liabilities were\nexpected to benefit from government guarantees as of the end of 2011. This figure was about 45\npercent at the end of 1999.\nA financial system without the broad expectation of government rescues for creditors would\nlikely look different ― potentially quite different ― from the financial system we currently\nhave. Without the expectation of implicit government guarantees, the incentives of market\nparticipants would be better aligned with our public policy goal of a financial system that\neffectively allocates capital and risks. Large financial firms themselves would want to be less\nleveraged and less reliant on unstable short-term funding. Institutions and markets would,\naccordingly, be more resilient in response to financial stress, and policymakers could credibly\ncommit to forgo incentive-corroding rescues.\nThe alternative, accepting the inevitability of an implicit federal backstop and trying to correct\nthe resulting distortions through the regulation of firm size, structure and capital, would lead to\nfar less desirable results, I believe. It would tilt financial innovation toward bypassing regulatory\nconstraints and relying on fragile funding methods that are most likely to elicit government\nprotection. The result would be ever-increasing regulatory costs and repeated bouts of financial\ninstability.\nReducing the probability that a large financial firm becomes financially distressed ― through\nenhanced standards for capital and liquidity, for example ― is useful, but will never be enough.\nThe path toward a stable financial system requires that the unassisted failure of financial firms\ndoes not put the financial system at risk. The resolution planning process prescribed by Section\n165(d) in Title I of the Dodd-Frank Act provides the road map for this journey.\nA resolution plan, or “living will,” is a description of a firm’s strategy for rapid and orderly\nresolution under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, without government assistance, in the event of\nmaterial financial distress or failure. It spells out the firm’s organizational structure, key\nmanagement information systems, critical operations and a mapping of the relationship between\n2\n\n\fcore business lines and legal entities. The heart of the plan is the specification of the actions the\nfirm would take to facilitate rapid and orderly resolution and prevent adverse effects of failure,\nincluding the firm’s strategy to maintain the operations of and funding for their critical\noperations and material entities.\nThe Federal Reserve and the FDIC can jointly determine that a plan is “not credible” or would\nnot facilitate an orderly resolution under the Bankruptcy Code, in which case the firm would be\nrequired to submit a revised plan to address identified deficiencies. A resubmission could include\nplans to change the business operations and corporate structure in order to eliminate deficiencies.\nIf the Fed and the FDIC jointly determine that the revised plan does not remedy identified\ndeficiencies, they can require tighter capital, leverage liquidity requirements or restrict the\ngrowth, activities or operations of the firm. In essence, regulators can order changes in the\nstructure and operations of a firm to make it resolvable in bankruptcy without government\nassistance.\nThe living will process can address the frequently heard objections to ending government\nrescues. Cooperation between international regulators in a crisis is often cited as an impediment\nto orderly resolution. Forming distinct legal entities for the material overseas operations of\nglobally active firms, with separate capital and liquidity holdings, can solve this problem by\nfacilitating the expeditious sale of material foreign operations and obviating dependence on\ncross-national negotiations about interaffiliate movements in capital and funding.\nThe so-called “liquidity needs” of failing institutions is often cited as a stumbling block to\nresolving financial firms in bankruptcy. The U.S. Bankruptcy Code allows the bankrupt firm to\nobtain, subject to court approval, “debtor-in-possession,” or DIP, financing that is generally\nsenior to pre-existing creditors. Such financing can be useful to fund ongoing operations. Other\ncreditors often find it advantageous to approve DIP funding, despite the dilution of their own\nclaims, because it ensures continued access to trade credit. The FDIC’s authority to lend to\ndistressed institutions under its Orderly Liquidation Authority amounts to government-provided\nDIP financing. The beneficial feature of privately provided DIP financing is the presumption\nthat, because it’s provided by market participants but also approved by creditors and the court,\nit’s fairly priced and thus unsubsidized and does not unduly disadvantage any particular class of\ncreditors. Indeed, this is why unassisted bankruptcy is so critical to ending “too big to fail” and\nwhy firms were instructed not to assume extraordinary government support in their resolution\nplans. A financial firm’s liquidity requirements in bankruptcy, however, are a direct function of\ndecisions made prior to entering bankruptcy. A credible living will would include plans for\nfunding critical operations, without government support, throughout the resolution process.\nSome recent proposals to address the “too big to fail” problem would make structural changes to\nfinancial firms ― imposing quantitative limits on their size or prohibiting certain risky activities.\nI am open to the notion that such restrictions may ultimately be necessary to achieve a more\nstable financial system, but I do not believe we have a strong basis yet for determining exactly\nwhat activity and size limits should be adopted. The living will process, however, will provide an\nobjective basis for decisions about how the structure or activities of large financial firms need to\nbe altered in order to assure orderly unassisted resolution. In addition, the process of writing\n\n3\n\n\fcredible living wills would illuminate efforts to identify ways in which the bankruptcy code\ncould be improved to make the resolution of financial firms more orderly. 5\nResolution planning will require a great deal of hard work. 6 But I see no other way to ensure that\npolicymakers have confidence in unassisted bankruptcy and that investors are convinced\nunassisted bankruptcy is the norm. Resolution planning provides the framework for identifying\nthe actions we need to take now to ensure that the next financial crisis is handled appropriately,\nin a way that is fair to taxpayers and establishes the right incentives.\nOnce robust and credible resolution plans are in place, we would be in a position to responsibly\nwind down the Orderly Liquidation Authority and other financing mechanisms, such as the\nFederal Reserve’s remaining 13(3) powers to lend in “unusual and exigent circumstances.” By\nallowing creditors to escape losses, such lending distorts incentives and exacerbates moral\nhazard. Eliminating the ability to provide ad hoc support to firms in financial distress would\ncement our commitment to orderly unassisted resolutions.\n1\n\nI am grateful to John Weinberg for assistance in preparing this statement.\nFor a comparison of the Orderly Liquidation Authority provisions with the U.S. bankruptcy process, see Sabrina R.\nPellerin and John R.

        "content": "Economic Outlook, June 2013\nJune 28, 2013\nJeffrey M. Lacker\nPresident\nFederal Reserve Bank of Richmond\nJudicial Conference of the Fourth Circuit\nWhite Sulphur Springs, W.Va.\n\nIt’s a pleasure to join you in this pleasant setting to discuss the economic outlook. Before I begin,\nI should emphasize that the views expressed are my own and should not be attributed to anyone\nelse in the Federal Reserve System. 1\nLet’s begin with some good news about the economic situation; inflation remains well contained.\nOver the last 12 months, our most reliable measure of prices, the price index for personal\nconsumption expenditure, has risen by only 1 percent. That’s on the low side of our recent\nexperience. Inflation has been fluctuating around 2 percent for two decades now, and just 21\nmonths ago, inflation was 2.9 percent. There appears to be widespread confidence that the\nFederal Reserve will keep inflation low and stable, consistent with our announced inflation goal\nof 2 percent. Indeed, most forecasters view the current readings on inflation to be a temporary\nphenomenon and expect inflation to run at or a little below 2 percent over the next few years.\nHousehold surveys and financial market measures also indicate that inflation is expected to\nremain near its longer-term average. My own view is that the transitory factors depressing\ninflation are likely to ebb, and we’ll see inflation edge back toward the Federal Open Market\nCommittee’s target of 2 percent by next year.\nIn contrast to inflation, which over time is determined by central bank actions, real economic\ngrowth and labor market conditions are affected by a wide variety of factors that are outside a\ncentral bank’s control. And it’s real economic conditions that many now view as disappointing.\nTo get a handle on that disappointment, think back to the beginning of the new millennium and\nrecall the pervasive optimism of that time. Much of that optimism was based on experience.\nOver the previous half-century, we had enjoyed remarkable economic performance — real gross\ndomestic product grew at a 3.5 percent annual rate between 1950 and 2000. Since 2000, though,\ngrowth has fallen short of that long-term average. We had a very severe recession in 2008 and\n2009, our worst since the 1930s, and growth has only averaged 2 percent since the end of 2009,\nwell below the longer-run average. Looking ahead, the key question regarding the economic\noutlook is whether growth will remain relatively low. Many forecasters expect growth to pick up\n\n1\n\n\fto over 3 percent next year. I have become increasingly persuaded, however, that low growth\nrates are likely to persist for several years.\nTo see the logic behind this expectation, it is helpful to break GDP growth into two components.\nOne is the growth in employment, and the other is growth in labor productivity, measured as\nGDP per worker. Labor productivity increased at an average rate of 1.8 percent per year from\n1950 to 2000. In this expansion, labor productivity increased rapidly in the last half of 2009, as is\ntypical when coming out of a deep recession. But since then, productivity has been only 0.9\npercent at an annual rate, and thus slower productivity growth is responsible for a significant\nportion of the growth shortfall in this expansion, relative to the late 20th century. Productivity\ngrowth is the consequence of many disparate factors affecting the deployment of innovations,\nincluding research and development, business capital expenditure, regulatory and tax policies,\nlabor force skills and public infrastructure investment. Note that monetary policy is not on this\nlist.\nAfter accounting for productivity growth, the rest of the reduction in GDP growth has been due\nto slower employment growth. Employment grew at a 1.7 percent annual rate from 1950 to 2000.\nEmployment fell dramatically in the recession and its immediate aftermath, but has expanded at\nonly a 1.1 percent annual rate since the end of 2009. It should not be surprising to see relatively\nslow growth in employment now, though, since the number of people of normal working age is\nitself growing slowly. For example, the civilian population aged 16–64 is only growing at a 0.4\npercent annual rate. The part of the population growing most rapidly is above age 65, as aging\nbaby boomers are hitting traditional retirement benchmarks in increasing numbers.\nIn addition to slowing population growth, labor force participation is also falling, even taking age\ninto account. The most dramatic fall has been among young people, aged 16 to 24, whose labor\nforce participation rate fell from over 59 percent in December 2007 to less than 55 percent now.\nBut participation has declined for other age groups as well ― the participation rate of so-called\nprime-age workers, aged 25 to 54, has fallen from 83.1 percent in December 2007 to 81.3\npercent currently. Part of the decline in participation rates could be due to a sluggish overall\neconomic environment. Another part may be due to structural factors such as an expansive safety\nnet. For example, the number of potential workers receiving disability payments has risen almost\n2 percent over the last year. And among young people, falling labor force participation seems\nrelated to higher school attendance, which could be motivated by the secular upward trend in the\nwage gap between educated and less-educated workers. Note that except for the effect of the\neconomy on labor force participation, these factors behind slowing employment growth are also\nindependent of monetary policy.\nTo summarize then, the slow growth in real GDP in this expansion is related to both lower\nproductivity growth and lower employment growth. While economists understand the principles\nunderlying productivity growth, it’s quite difficult to parse the causes of medium-term swings in\nproductivity growth, particularly as they are happening. At this juncture, low productivity growth\nhas persisted long enough that I think the best guess is that it will remain low for an extended\nperiod. Some of the shortfall in employment could be due to the lingering effects of the Great\n2\n\n\fRecession on labor force participation, but at this point, four years since the recession ended, I\ndoubt this effect is very large. I think longer-run structural trends, such as an aging population\nand higher school attendance among young people, are important drivers of the falling\nparticipation rate. And other persistent structural impediments, which I will discuss in a moment,\nseem to be depressing growth as well. Thus, the combination of relatively low productivity and\nemployment growth leads me to conclude that real GDP growth will fluctuate around a 2 percent\ntrend for the foreseeable future.\nThis view, based on medium- to long-run structural factors, contrasts with the views of some\nleading economic forecasters that I mentioned earlier. They believe that after a brief period of\nsluggish growth, real GDP will accelerate significantly. They see growth as being temporarily\nrestrained by “headwinds” that limit spending and will dissipate relatively soon. A few years ago\nI subscribed to that view as well, and I would routinely predict that growth was about to\naccelerate after a quarter or two. Year after year though, our forecasts of acceleration were\nproven wrong, and growth remained near 2 percent. Eventually I started feeling an affinity for\nCharlie Brown, trying time after time to kick the football that Lucy kindly offers to hold for him,\nonly to yank it away. I began to re-examine my basic premise that growth would soon accelerate\nbehind my forecast, and I came to appreciate the structural factors that appear to be persistently\nlimiting growth.\nAlthough growth has averaged 2 percent since the end of 2009, our experience lately has been\nsomewhat choppy, with significant fluctuations above and below 2 percent from quarter to\nquarter. One exception to this choppiness has been housing activity, which is finally on a solid\ngrowth path. New housing starts have more than doubled since the low point in 2009 and have\nrisen by 29 percent over the last 12 months. Home prices are also on an upswing, rising almost\n12 percent on average over the last 12 months. Now I should caution that home building is still\nfar below the levels we saw before the recession, and even below the typical levels of the 1990s.\nMoreover, residential investment is less than 3 percent of GDP, so housing by itself is not going\nto have a large effect on total GDP growth. But having said that, the improvement in housing\nactivity has bolstered the confidence of many households in the market value of their most\nimportant asset.\nRising confidence would be a good thing for consumer spending, which accounts for over 70\npercent of GDP. Over the last 12 months, real consumer spending has risen by 1.8 percent, in\nline with GDP growth and the growth in real personal income. But the increase in federal taxes\nthat took effect in January took a sizable bite out of take-home pay, and real after-tax personal\nincome has risen only 1.1 percent since last year this time. Despite these headwinds, consumer\nspending has held up pretty well so far this year. The more persistent restraint on consumer\nspending in this expansion has been the aftereffects of the income and wealth shocks that hit\nAmerican households during the Great Recession. Memories of these losses have undoubtedly\nmade individuals more cautious about spending commitments. And while consumers have made\ngreat progress restoring some semblance of order to their balance sheets, much remains to be\ndone. For example, close to 20 percent of all residential mortgages are still underwater. So even\n\n3\n\n\fthough consumers have been fairly resilient in recent months, these fundamentals make it hard\nfor me to be bullish about a pickup in consumer spending growth.\nBusiness capital spending, on the other hand, is likely to make a solid contribution to growth\nover the next few years. While investment fell sharply during the recession, new technologies\ncontinued to be developed and improved. There are ample motives to implement these better\ntechnologies, even in the absence of rapid growth. Business fixed investment rose 5-½ percent\nlast year, and most forecasters expect solid growth to continue. I would agree.\nThus the private sector seems to be in reasonably good shape, and if I could stop here, my\ngrowth forecast would be greater than 2 percent. But for completeness, I need to mention other\nimportant factors. First, the federal fiscal outlook is a mess. Last year, the federal deficit\nexceeded $1 trillion and was almost 7 percent of GDP. Projections by the Congressional Budget\nOffice show the deficit declining for several years but then increasing, without bound, as a\nfraction of GDP. That large deficit puts the stock of federal debt on a steep upward trajectory. In\nother words, the current course is unsustainable, and some combination of higher taxes and less\nspending growth is inevitable. It is not clear, however, what adjustments will be made to specific\ntaxes and spending programs. This pervasive uncertainty has undoubtedly affected household\nand business decisions, and it appears unlikely that we’ll soon see a grand bargain that will put\nthe federal budget on a sustainable, long-term path.\nAnother challenge comes from the need for businesses to adapt to the large volume of new\nregulation that has been added in recent years. This is not the place to argue the ultimate merits\nof any particular legislation, but I would simply note that even if net social benefits of new\nregulations are significantly positive, businesses may still face large compliance costs that in turn\naffect hiring and investment decisions. Moreover, many key decisions regarding implementation\nof far-reaching regulations have yet to be made, or fully litigated, I might add. The magnitude of\nthe uncertainty facing firms and households is bound to be elevated relative to the past. For\nexample, we hear often from our contacts that they are worried about how to respond to new\nhealth care requirements, many of which remain to be written. The fiscal sector is clearly a net\nimpediment to growth right now.\nForecasting is nothing if not a humbling endeavor, but rather than say “caveat emptor,” I will\nsupply you with a list of reasons I could be wrong. Medium-term productivity forecasting is\nnotoriously imprecise, as the 1990s demonstrated. Productivity growth could conceivably come\nin stronger over the next few years, and that could pass through to real wage gains that propel\nconsumer spending at a faster rate. Also on the positive side, growth for our major trading\npartners could improve more rapidly than expected, which would boost export demand and\nincomes. Thus I cannot dismiss the possibility that growth will be somewhat better than I expect.\nBut there are also downside risks to the forecast. It is not clear that countries in the Euro area\nhave solved their fiscal and competitive challenges, and thus there is a chance that stagnant\nconditions there prove more persistent, and growth languishes this year and next. Moreover,\nseveral emerging market economies are facing significant challenges right now, and should their\n4\n\n\fadjustments prove more formidable than expected, their growth could suffer. Closer to home,\nimplementation of provisions of the Affordable Care Act later this year could prove highly\nconsequential for hiring incentives, despite whatever benefits it might bring, and thus could\nconceivably slow down job growth around year-end. So one shouldn’t take my outlook for\nmoderate growth for granted, either.\nI should add one important qualification to my portrayal of the economic outlook. At a longer\nhorizon ― that is, the next couple of decades ― I am fundamentally quite optimistic about\nprospects for the U.S. economy. The resilience inherent in our institutional framework, the\nstrength of our great research institutions and the intrinsic capabilities of our workforce all auger\nwell for our capacity to develop and apply the innovations that drive gains in our standards of\nliving over time.\nAt this point in discussing the outlook, you may have noticed that one topic is missing, and so\nI’ll conclude with some thoughts on monetary policy. Federal Reserve policy is exceptionally\naccommodative right now, with short-term interest rates near zero and our balance sheet about\nfour times the size it was before the financial turmoil began in 2007. Moreover, the balance sheet\ncontinues to expand, consistent with Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke’s announcement last week that\nthe Federal Open Market Committee anticipates reducing the pace of asset purchases later this\nyear and ending purchases around mid-year 2014, provided incoming data are broadly consistent\nwith the Committee’s forecast. This means that over the course of the next 12 months, the\nCommittee will be reducing only the pace at which it is adding accommodation. In other words,\nthe Federal Reserve is not only leaving the punch bowl in place, we’re continuing to spike the\npunch, though at a decreasing rate over the next year.\nA highly stimulative policy was the appropriate response to a severe recession of 2008 and 2009,\nin my view. Growth has resumed, however, and it appears as if it’s limited, in large part, by\nstructural factors that monetary policy is not capable of offsetting. In this situation, the benefitcost trade-off for further monetary stimulus does not look promising. I seriously doubt additional\nmonetary stimulus can provide much impetus to real growth right now. But further stimulus does\nincrease the size of our balance sheet and correspondingly increases the risks associated with the\n“exit process” when it becomes time to withdraw stimulus. That is why I have not supported the\ncurrent asset purchase program.\nI did, however, think it wise of Chairman Bernanke to clarify the Committee’s expectations\nregarding how the pace of asset purchases is likely to evolve. Bond and stock markets fell\nsharply in response, but that should not be too surprising. The Chairman’s statement forced\nfinancial market participants to re-evaluate the likely total amount of securities the Fed would\nbuy under this open-ended purchase plan ― in other words, how much liquor would ultimately\nbe poured into the punch bowl. Market participants also had to reconsider their estimate of when\nthe Federal Reserve would begin to remove the punch bowl by raising interest rates. These\nreassessments appear to have warranted price changes across an array of financial assets. As\nmarket participants gain additional insight from the words of Federal Reserve officials or by\npolicy actions in coming quarters, further asset price volatility seems likely.\n5\n\n\fThis type of volatility is a normal part of the process of incorporating new information into\nfinancial asset prices and should not interfere with the moderate-growth scenario that I have\npresented today. And I would emphasize that keeping inflation low and stable is within the\ncapability of any modern central bank. On that score, the recent behavior of inflation has been\nheartening. Measures of inflation expectations remain within ranges consistent with price\nstability, and the low current inflation readings are likely to be transitory. Inflation is likely to\nremain well contained, and that is the single most important contribution a central bank can make\nto economic growth.\n1\n\nI would like to thank Roy Webb for assistance in preparing these remarks.\n\n6\n\n\f",

        "content": "“A Look Back at the History of the Federal Reserve”\nAugust 29, 2013\nJeffrey M. Lacker\nPresident\nFederal Reserve Bank of Richmond\nChristopher Newport University\nNewport News, Virginia\nThe Federal Reserve, like many other central banks around the world, has been on the hot seat\never since the astonishing events of the financial crisis of 2008. Views about the Federal Reserve\nspan a wide range, from those who would abolish the Federal Reserve outright and return to the\npre-Fed monetary regime that tied the value of money to the value of gold, to those who applaud\nthe institution for heroically preventing a repeat of the Great Depression. In between there are\nthose who propose reforms to the legislation governing the Fed, and others who would leave the\nFederal Reserve Act alone but encourage the Fed to learn the right lessons from the crisis. Why\nthe divergent views? Public debate has focused on the unprecedented interventions in financial\nmarkets and with failing financial firms and the unique operational independence the Fed enjoys\nrelative to other government entities.\nIn our time together, I’ll try to help you understand the current controversies surrounding the\nFed.1 To really understand these controversies, it helps to understand some of our unique\ncharacteristics as a central bank. And to do that, I’ll argue that it’s essential to go back to the\nfounding of the Federal Reserve System in 1913 and learn why we were founded and why we\nwere structured the way we were. It turns out that those who created the Federal Reserve 100\nyears ago wrestled with the same two critical questions that animate debate today: (1) our\nindependence, that is, the structure of our governance and our accountability to the American\npeople, and (2) what sort of assets the Federal Reserve Banks should invest in. These questions\nwere hotly debated when the Fed was founded. I believe that the trade-offs and tensions involved\nare essential for an appreciation of the current debates and how central banking is likely to\nevolve as we enter our second century. Views on these questions differed then, just as views\ndiffer now. In that connection, I should caution that the views I will share with you are my own\nand do not represent the official views of the Federal Reserve System.\nSo let’s cast our minds back 100 years to the signing of the Federal Reserve Act by President\nWoodrow Wilson on December 23, 1913. Why did the founders feel the need to create\nsomething like the Federal Reserve? The short answer they would have given is, “the currency\nproblem,” by which they meant that the supply of currency did not expand and contract\nappropriately with the needs of the economy. This was evident during seasonal increases in the\nneed for money, and during banking panics, when people wanted to withdraw their bank deposits\n1\n\n\fand hold currency instead. When people talked about the Fed’s role in coping with financial\npanics, what they had in mind was expanding the currency supply.\nMoney and Banking Before the Fed\nBut to understand the currency problem, you have to know a little bit about how money and the\nbanking system worked back then. It was different from what we’re used to today. I should warn\nyou that I’ll be discussing some obscure workings of the banking system back then, but I think\nyou’ll see they’re important to the story, so bear with me.\nThe most prominent feature of the U.S. banking system a hundred years ago was that it was\nincredibly fragmented. Laws prevented banks from operating branches, and as a result, there\nwere a large number of individual banks. Banks generally had just one office, and essentially\nevery little town had its own bank. There were nearly 30,000 banks in the United States in 1913.\nLaws limiting branching have gone away, and as a result, there are about 7,000 banks today.\nWhat did people use for money? Coins, for one. They used gold coins, like this beautiful double\neagle. But for small transactions, a gold coin of the right value would be impractically tiny. So\nlarge-value gold coins were supplemented by smaller-valued coins made out of silver or copper.\nFor very large transactions, however, coins were too bulky, and people preferred banknotes.\nBanknotes were paper currency issued by private banks. Here, I have to say a word or two about\nthe National Bank Act, a law passed in 1863, during the Civil War.2 It authorized the chartering\nof “national banks” by the federal government ― up until that time, banks had been chartered by\nthe states, who issued their own paper currency. The 1863 law authorized national banks to issue\npaper notes too, like the ones you see here, and a tax was levied on state bank notes that drove\nthem out of circulation. National bank notes had to be backed by holdings of U.S. government\nbonds. This generated an immediate demand for government bonds, and so it helped finance the\nCivil War ― or, more precisely, one side of the Civil War.\nThe process of issuing national banknotes was somewhat cumbersome. A national bank had to\npurchase the appropriate federal bonds; this was usually arranged through other banks in major\nfinancial centers. The bonds then had to be deposited with the U.S. Treasury, which then\nauthorized the printing of notes by the Bureau of Engraving and Printing, using printing plates\nheld by the Treasury. The notes were then shipped to the bank. The difficulty of this process\nplays an important role later in the story.3\nClearing and Settling Interregional Payments\nThe decades between the Civil War and the founding of the Fed saw rapid growth in\ninterregional trade within the United States. Transportation networks were improving rapidly,\nand manufacturers were selling goods around the country. Making large payments at a distance\nposed special difficulties, however. Banknotes were poorly suited for the job because they were\npayable on demand to the bearer, and thus required insurance against theft when shipped. A\nconvenient alternative was the check. If a check was lost or stolen, but someone presented it for\n\n2\n\n\fpayment, the bank could refuse to pay, so checks are to some degree safer than banknotes.\nChecks became the payment instrument of choice in interregional trade.\nTo understand the founding of the Fed, it helps to grasp some of the details of how checks\nmoved around the banking system back then.4 It will help to focus on a concrete example. So\nimagine a general store in Newport News in the 1890s that sells potbellied stoves made by a\nmanufacturer in Brooklyn. The store owner writes a check drawn on his bank in Newport News,\npayable to the manufacturer, and mails it. The manufacturer deposits the check in his account at\nhis Brooklyn bank. (Keep in mind that there wasn’t an iPhone to scan the check into.)\nNow what happens though? How does the Brooklyn bank get paid for the check drawn on the\nbank in Newport News? More generally, how did banks clear and settle checks? Two different\ninstitutional mechanisms developed to facilitate check clearing.\nOne was the clearinghouse.5 Any decent-sized city would have many individual banks, and they\nwould band together in order to economize on the costs of presenting checks to each other for\npayment. Instead of each bank sending clerks directly to each of the other banks, they would\nsend a pair of clerks to a central location. This engraving depicts the New York Clearinghouse\nsome time in the 1850s. (This admittedly is earlier than 1913, but the operations basically looked\nthe same, with the possible exception of the top hats and cutaways.) One clerk from each bank\nwould move around the outside of the circle of desks, presenting bundles of checks in succession\nto clerks from the other banks. The clerk sitting behind the desk would tally the amount of\nchecks presented by the other banks. After the presentation of checks was complete,\nclearinghouse clerks would collate and reconcile all the banks’ tally sheets. At the end of the\nprocess, each bank has either a net obligation due to the clearinghouse, that is to the other banks,\nor else a net obligation due from the clearinghouse. They could either settle up that day, or carry\nover the balance to the next day.\nClearinghouses were an important feature of the banking system, both before the Fed and for\nmany years after. In fact, as I’ll discuss later on, the Federal Reserve Banks were modeled after\nthe clearinghouses of the time, and several of their features were adopted for the Reserve Banks.\nFirst, banks that were members of the clearinghouse were often owed funds by the clearinghouse\n― that is, by other clearinghouse banks. As a result, member banks had a keen interest in each\nother’s financial health. So clearinghouses set standards for membership, required periodic\nfinancial statements and regularly audited their member banks. In other words, clearinghouses\nperformed functions very much like the supervision and regulation now performed by federal\nagencies, including the Federal Reserve. A second key feature of clearinghouses is that they were\nowned by their member banks. A board of directors, chosen by member banks, would set\nclearinghouse policies and rules and oversee the operations of the clearinghouse. Each Reserve\nBank is overseen by its own board of directors.\nClearinghouses worked well in cities, where sending couriers to a central location every day was\nconvenient. But outside the cities, banks were geographically dispersed. Here’s where the second\ninstitutional mechanism used to clear checks comes in. It was called “correspondent banking.”6\nAll the banks outside the cities ― they were called “country banks” ― established relationships\nwith a number of other banks; these were called their “correspondents.” If the country bank\n3\n\n\freceived a check drawn on a distant bank, it would be sent to a correspondent to collect for them.\nSimilarly, if the city correspondent bank received a check drawn on the country bank, they\nwould send it to the country bank for payment. This slide shows a page from a publication that\nlisted each bank and their correspondents. So if you were a bank in Brooklyn, and one of your\ncustomers deposited a check drawn on, say, the First National Bank of Newport News, you\nwould just look them up in this book and find out who their correspondents were. The\ncorrespondents are listed at the bottom of their entry ― I’ve outlined them in a red box. You\ncould send it to the correspondent and get paid for it.\nOne critical feature of this system is that banks kept deposits with their correspondents. So the\nFirst National Bank of Newport News would have accounts with the banks listed at the bottom of\nits entry. These were called “reserve accounts” or just “reserves,” and they played a critical role\nin the banking system. When checks came in to the city bank drawn on the correspondent\ncountry bank, the city bank would subtract (or debit) the amount from the country bank’s\naccount. Similarly, when the country bank sent checks for the city bank to collect for them, the\ncity bank would add (or credit) the amount to its account.\nIf you multiply this picture across the nation, you end up with an intricate web of correspondent\nrelationships linking very small country banks to larger banks in nearby cities to banks in the\nvery largest financial centers ― New York and Chicago. Through this network of relationships,\npeople were able to make payments easily to people at great distances across the United States,\nanalogous to the way electronic payment systems, like the credit card and ATM networks, link\nbanks together in a way that enables payments to flow. The economics are very similar, it turns\nout.\nThe “Currency Problem”\nI have given you an overview of the internal workings of the banking system in 1913, just before\nthe Fed was founded. So what was the problem with this system that motivated the founding of\nthe Fed? One word: inelasticity. At times, the supply of currency just did not expand rapidly and\nflexibly enough. Here’s an illustration of that idea in a cartoon from 1909. Uncle Sam is pictured\nin the foreground, staring forlornly at a sheaf of wheat. His suspenders ― they called them\n“galluses” then ― are labeled “U.S. currency.” His buttons are labeled “financial center.” In the\nbackground, President Teddy Roosevelt explains the problem to a man labeled Congress:\n“You see, those galluses ought to have rubber in them, so that when Uncle Sam stoops to\nmove the sheaf there won’t be much strain on the buttons.”\nTo understand what they were talking about, think of the banking system as a whole; the public\ncan hold bank deposits or banknotes. At times, people prefer more notes and fewer deposits than\nusual. One of those times was the fall harvest season, when more currency was needed to make\nthe payments necessary to move crops to market; picture middlemen needing cash to pay\nfarmers, who then use the cash to pay for supplies or repay loans. The holiday season in\nNovember and December was another time when the demand for currency rose; picture lots of\npeople getting currency out of the bank to go shopping. But remember those cumbersome\nrequirements associated with issuing new banknotes under the National Bank Act. That meant\n4\n\n\fthe banks found it difficult to issue new notes. Country banks would turn to their correspondents\nfor notes to meet the demand for withdrawals, which transmitted the strains to the big financial\ncenters. The banking system had a hard time accommodating the increase in demand for\ncurrency. What was needed was a more elastic supply.\nThose of you who have had an economics class are probably thinking, what about the price\nsystem? Isn’t that how economies deal with scarcity? Well, the workings of the price system\nactually were evident back then. The price of money, as you economics students are aware, is the\nrate of interest ― that’s the opportunity cost of holding noninterest-earning currency, as opposed\nto holding interest-earning assets. Here is a plot (the blue line) of the average interest rate on\ncommercial paper in New York (a good representative financial market interest rate in those\ndays), shown for various months of the year in the 20 years before the founding of the Fed. You\ncan see that from September through December, interest rates were substantially higher, about a\nfull percentage point on average, compared to other months of the year. This is fairly direct\nevidence of the inelasticity that people were concerned about. After the founding of the Fed (the\ngold line), the curve is relatively flat, which is evidence that the Fed was able to better\naccommodate the seasonal swings in the demand for currency.7\nThe inelasticity problem was also evident during financial panics. These were episodes,\ngenerally during economic downturns, in which a sizeable number of people attempted to\nwithdraw their money from banks. In other words, the public wanted to shift out of deposits into\ncurrency. These “bank runs” tended to happen in response to rumors of insolvency at one or\nmore banks. Again, the cumbersome and time-consuming process for issuing new banknotes\nunder the National Bank Act limited the response in the total supply of notes. Interest rates\nwould spike up, as banks attempted to secure banknotes to meet the demand for withdrawals.\nBanks turned to a number of expedients when faced with runs. One response when demand for\nnotes was particularly acute was to “suspend payments,” meaning that banks would refuse to\nallow depositors to withdraw banknotes. At times, clearinghouses would declare suspensions for\nall their member banks. Often deposits weren’t entirely frozen, however. Banks would issue\n“cashier checks” or other instruments that acted as substitutes for currency. These substitutes\nwere viewed as inconvenient stop-gap measures, however.\nEarlier I mentioned that country banks held deposits at correspondent banks. When their\ncustomers’ withdrawals started rising, country banks would ask their correspondent banks for\nshipments of banknotes, to be paid for with their reserve account balances. During financial\npanics, clearinghouse banks would sometimes refuse those withdrawal requests in order to\npreserve cash for themselves.\nThe Panic of 1907 was the last straw; it sparked a concerted national effort to identify\nappropriate reforms to the currency system. Much debate ensued and numerous proposals were\nadvanced, culminating in passage and signing of the Federal Reserve Act in December of 1913.8\nWhat did the Federal Reserve Act do? According to the preamble of the Act, the intent was “to\nfurnish an elastic currency.” That is, they wanted the aggregate supply of currency to be able to\nexpand when the demand for currency rose, as it did during seasonal crop movements and the\nlarge-scale deposit withdrawals associated with banking panics. You’ll also notice that the\n5\n\n\fpreamble says “to afford a means of discounting commercial paper.” I’ll say more about that\nlater.\nThe Federal Reserve Act\nHow would the Federal Reserve furnish an elastic currency? The natural model was the city\nclearinghouses.9 In banking crises, the clearinghouses often issued certificates to be circulated by\ntheir member banks as a substitute for currency withdrawals. (The clearinghouses were not\nlegally entitled to issue bank notes themselves.) Therefore, the Act authorized the establishment\nof a set of banks modeled on the clearinghouses of the day. They called them “federal reserve\nbanks,” because they would hold the reserves of the banking system, instead of having those\nreserves held in the banks in large cities. Reserve banks would have the power to issue notes, just\nas the national banks did at the time, except that the reserve banks would not be subject to the\ncumbersome requirements of the National Bank Act that made the supply of notes so inelastic.\nBecause the reserve banks were modeled after the clearinghouses, it was natural to provide them\nwith the other features associated with clearinghouses. Thus the reserve banks were membership\norganizations, owned and operated by their member banks, much like a joint venture. They were\ngiven authority to examine their members for safety and soundness, just as the clearinghouses\ndid.10 And they were given the power to clear and settle checks for their members as well, a core\nfunction of the clearinghouses.11\nKey Issue: Structure, Governance and Accountability\nPerhaps the most visible aspect of the structure of the Federal Reserve was hotly debated: the\nnumber and location of the reserve banks themselves. One early version of the Federal Reserve\nAct would have created a single reserve bank with branches around the country. This riled\npopulists, however, and tapped into the deep-rooted 19th century American aversion to large\nfinancial institutions and financial center interests. Carter Glass, the congressman from\nLynchburg, Virginia, who chaired the House Committee on Currency and Banking and helped\ndraft the final version of the legislation, insisted on a system of regional reserve banks.\nPresident Woodrow Wilson, however, a leader of the progressive movement, insisted that\nbecause the reserve banks had a substantial public purpose, they should be supervised by a\nfederal agency. So the Act established what is now called the Board of Governors of the Federal\nReserve System to oversee the operations and policies of the reserve banks. The Board also has\nthe power to appoint three of the nine members of each Reserve Bank’s board of directors ― the\nother six are elected by member banks, and only three of them can be bankers. Members of the\nBoard of Governors are appointed by the president of the United States and confirmed by the\nSenate. The Federal Reserve thus was created with a hybrid public-private governance structure.\nThis structure has provided a measure of independence from political pressures that can induce\nan excessively short-run focus. That independence has been valuable, particularly in keeping\ninflation under control. But it comes with a responsibility to be accountable to our democratic\ninstitutions for the results of the conduct of policy.\n\n6\n\n\fThe Fed’s governance structure also was hotly debated during the drafting of the legislation. It\nhas been questioned and amended over the years and remains controversial today. For example,\ncritics have charged that the role of bankers on Reserve Banks’ boards has biased them toward\nthe interests of the banking industry, at the expense of the public interest. Others, however, cite\nthe valuable operational expertise and economic information that bankers bring to the Fed. The\nfinancial reform legislation passed in 2010 in response to the financial crisis ― the Dodd-Frank\nAct ― imposed restrictions limiting the role of bankers in selecting the top officers of the\nReserve Banks.12 More broadly, the Federal Reserve has made significant moves toward greater\ntransparency into its operations and decision-making over the last 20 years. This photo shows a\ngathering of all the Reserve Bank directors and the Board of Governors in October 1914,\nassembled on the steps of the Treasury in Washington. If the analogous group were assembled\ntoday, I can assure you of two things: You’d see greater diversity and fewer hats.\nKey Issue: What Assets Should the Federal Reserve Hold?\nPerhaps the most critical question the founders had to decide was what the Reserve Banks should\nhold as assets. The Federal Reserve notes that were authorized by the Act are liabilities of the\nReserve Banks. The Reserve Banks also accepted deposits from member banks, another liability.\nThe original goal of the founding of the Federal Reserve was to ensure that the quantity of the\nFed’s currency and reserve deposit liabilities would expand elastically when needed. This left the\nauthors of the Act with some discretion as to what assets the Federal Reserve Banks would hold.\nOne asset that was natural to consider was gold, either in the form of coins or bullion. The\ncountry was on the gold standard at the time, and that required that banknotes be convertible into\ngold on demand. The founders decided to mimic the design of other central banks and require\nthat Reserve Banks hold a certain amount of gold ― 40 percent of the value of their notes\noutstanding, and 35 percent of the value of the bank deposits they accepted. This ensured that the\nReserve Banks’ money supply would tend to expand or contract with the movement of gold into\nand out of the country, as required by the rules of the gold standard.\nBut beyond gold, what assets should the reserve banks hold? One option was U.S. government\nbonds. The pre-Fed regime that required backing by government bonds was viewed as\nproblematic, however, for the reasons I’ve already described. In addition, money backed only by\ngovernment bonds was associated with inflationary wartime finance and thus viewed as\npotentially destabilizing. That left private-sector assets. There were active markets for private\nbonds, but these were relatively risky at the end of the 19th century, and stocks were even riskier.\nEuropean central banks at the time, particularly the Bank of England, provided a natural\nalternative model, however. They held financial instruments called “bills of exchange”; similar\ninstruments in the United States were called commercial paper. These were short-term (3- to 6month maturity) obligations that arose out of the financing of trade. Because they were secured\nby goods in transit and endorsed by banks, they were relatively safe. Conservative eligibility\nrequirements and an endorsement by the borrowing bank (a kind of guarantee) helped further\nreduce the risk to the central bank. So the Federal Reserve Banks were given the authority to\nmake loans backed by certain types of commercial paper or purchase certain types of such\ncommercial paper. This is reflected in the third part of the preamble purpose of the Federal\nReserve Act: “to afford a means of rediscounting commercial paper.” They called it\n7\n\n\f“rediscounting,” because the initial loan was essentially the purchase of an obligation at\ndiscount, which reflected an implied interest rate, and the Fed was discounting it a second time.\nDuring World War I, the Reserve Banks were granted the power to hold Treasury securities, and\nthereafter they used purchases of Treasury securities in the open market to influence monetary\nconditions. Acquiring Treasury securities in the open market avoided the cumbersome collateralposting procedure required under the national bank rules. It is important to note that the Fed\ncreates money whether it buys Treasury securities, buys commercial paper or makes a loan.\nWhen a Reserve Bank acquires an asset, it credits the reserve account of the bank of the party\nfrom whom it acquires the asset. When a Reserve Bank makes a loan, it credits the reserve\naccount of the party to whom it is making a loan. In either case, the new reserve account\nbalances can be withdrawn by the bank, and Federal Reserve notes would be paid out, effectively\nconverting the reserve balances into currency. In either case, the supply of currency plus reserves\nhas increased. The key lesson here is that, for the purposes of the original goal of the Federal\nReserve Act ― that is, to solve the currency problem that the Fed was founded to solve and stem\nfinancial panics ― it doesn’t matter whether the Fed lends or buys Treasury securities. Either\none expands the supply of currency and reserves that people are clamoring for.\nThis highlights an important distinction regarding central bank activities. Some actions change\nthe total amount of currency and bank reserves in circulation. These are best referred to as\n“monetary policy.” Actions that change the composition of the central bank’s asset portfolio, but\nleave the amount of currency and bank reserves unchanged can be thought of as “credit policy,”\nsince they involve intervening in credit markets by buying one instrument and selling another.13\nCredit policy has the potential to direct funds to particular sectors or particular private entities,\neither funds they would not otherwise have obtained or on terms they would not otherwise have\nobtained. The “currency problem” that the founders were seeking to solve was a monetary\nproblem, not a credit problem.\nThis distinction is directly relevant to controversies about the Fed’s crisis lending programs,\nbecause they had little to do with monetary policy, in this sense, and thus little to do with the\noriginal goal of the Federal Reserve Act to furnish an elastic currency. Several emergency\nlending programs were introduced early in the crisis, prior to September 2008.14 Lending under\nthese programs was all offset by sales of Treasury securities, so the supply of currency plus\nreserves did not increase. Instead, the lending programs reallocated credit, effectively selling\nTreasury securities to the public and using the proceeds to provide funds to private entities on\nterms they would not otherwise have obtained in the marketplace. Similarly, the loan made in\nconnection with the failure of Bear Stearns in March 2008 was offset through sales of Treasury\nsecurities. Because the Reserve Banks remit all of their excess earnings to the U.S. Treasury, the\nfiscal implications for the federal budget were exactly as if the Treasury had issued new debt and\nmade the loan.\nLater, in the fall of 2008, the Fed drove short-term interest rates essentially to zero and stopped\noffsetting emergency lending. Clearly, though, the Fed could have driven interest rates to zero\nwithout the emergency lending programs by simply buying large quantities of Treasury\nsecurities. Since the crisis, the Fed has dramatically expanded the size of its asset holdings by\nacquiring longer-term Treasury securities and agency mortgage-backed securities, or MBS. The\n8\n\n\fFed could have expanded its portfolio an equal amount through purchases of Treasury securities\nonly. Compared to that benchmark policy, buying agency MBS channels funds to mortgage\nborrowers, financed through sales of Treasury securities to the public.\nIn popular accounts of the crisis, you may have come across references to the Fed as “the lender\nof last resort.” This phrase is often used to describe the prescriptions of Henry Thornton, the\nBritish economist, and Walter Bagehot, a British essayist and journalist. Both men wrote\ninfluential books on central banking: Thornton at the beginning of the 1800s, and Bagehot in the\n1870s. Their recommendations to the Bank of England have been distilled into the phrase: “Lend\nfreely at a high rate on good collateral.”15 This dictum is often invoked to support extensive\ncentral bank lending in episodes of financial distress. But Thornton and Bagehot wrote when\nlending was the primary mechanism by which the Bank of England increased the stock of money\nin circulation. Their writings make clear that they were not recommending rescues for insolvent\ninstitutions, and that their prescriptions were about monetary policy, not credit policy.\nThe Debate Continues: The Future of Central Banking\nSome modern writers instead interpret the “lender of last resort” idea liberally to justify an\nexpansive approach to central banking, in which all available tools, both monetary and credit\npolicy, are used to minimize financial system “disruptions.” They read central bank charters as\nimplying a “financial stability mandate.”16 Although the term “financial stability” was not at all\ncommon 100 years ago, they construe the founders of the Federal Reserve System as motivated\nby a broad desire to minimize and prevent financial panics, even beyond simply satisfying\nincreased demands for Federal Reserve Bank money. The view that financial markets are\ninherently fragile and unstable provides support for this approach.17\nIn contrast, a narrow and more restrained view of central banking emphasizes the critical core\nfunction of managing the monetary liabilities of the central bank.18 Experience after the demise\nof the gold standard in the 1970s has demonstrated that a measure of independence is a critical\ningredient in the success of monetary policy. Aggressive use of a central bank’s asset portfolio to\nchannel credit to particular economic sectors or entities threatens dragging the central bank into\ndistributional politics and places that governance arrangement at risk.19 This more limited\napproach is supported by the view that excessive financial market instability tends to be induced\nby government rescues, and that policymakers should be humble about their ability to identify\nconstructive interventions in particular financial markets.20\nThe evolution of the Federal Reserve, and central banking more generally around the world, will\nbe driven, I suspect, by how the tension between these two approaches plays out. I just hope that\nfuture debates are informed by the rich deliberations that accompanied the founding of the\nFederal Reserve.\n1\n\nI am grateful to Patricia Wescott for assistance in preparing these remarks.\nMilton Friedman and Anna Jacobson Schwartz. “A Monetary History of the United States: 1867–1960,”\nPrinceton: Princeton University Press, 1963; Allan H.

        "content": "Monetary Policy in the United States: The Risks Associated With Unconventional Policies\n\nSeptember 26, 2013\nJeffrey M. Lacker\nPresident\nFederal Reserve Bank of Richmond\nSwedbank Economic Outlook Seminar 2013\n\nIn the years since the financial crisis began in 2007, the Federal Reserve and other central banks\nhave taken extraordinary and often unprecedented actions, first in responding as the crisis\nunfolded, and later in trying to adapt policy to the economic conditions that have prevailed since.\nThese actions have involved extraordinary central bank lending, expanding central bank balance\nsheets and banking system reserves, broadening the range of assets purchased, and\ncommunicating about future policy settings.\nWhile such unconventional central bank policies can at times be indispensable in responding to\nunconventional developments in national and global economies, there are accompanying risks\nthat are important to bear in mind. In reviewing these tools and their related risks, it’s helpful to\nbe clear about what constitutes conventional policy, so I’ll start there. Before I do, however, I\nalso should be clear that the views I express are my own and do not necessarily represent the\nviews of my Federal Reserve System colleagues. 1\nBefore the financial crisis, the typical central bank conducted monetary policy by controlling a\nshort-term nominal interest rate — usually a rate charged in interbank or other wholesale money\nmarket transactions. In the U.S., as in many other countries, this control was accomplished by\nmanipulating the supply of the central bank’s monetary liabilities. Before the crisis, a relatively\nstable, interest-sensitive demand for reserves by U.S. banks arose from the array of regulations\nsurrounding the use of those balances. Legally required reserves were small, and with no interest\nearned on reserves, banks sought to economize on excess reserves. Against this incentive to\nminimize reserve holdings, banks’ demand was supported by the use of reserves in settlement of\ninterbank obligations and by the desire to avoid costly overdrafts. 2\nThe Fed managed the supply of reserves through purchases and sales of U.S. Treasury securities\n— or repurchase transactions in those securities — so that the overnight interest rate in the\nmarket for interbank loans of reserves hit the Federal Open Market Committee’s target. The\nFOMC in turn adjusted its target in response to changes in economic conditions and the\n1\n\n\feconomic outlook so as to achieve low and stable inflation in a manner consistent with its\ncongressional mandate (which also includes the pursuit of maximum employment and moderate\nlong-term interest rates).\nUnconventional Policy\nIn the wake of the financial crisis and the recession that followed, the Fed’s policy has deviated\nin a number of ways from this conventional, precrisis approach — as have the policies of many\nother central banks. During the period from late 2007 through 2008, as the crisis was unfolding,\nthe Fed conducted several emergency lending operations that went beyond the scope of previous\nprecedents. 3 At first, these loans were not allowed to affect the outstanding amount of Federal\nReserve monetary liabilities. This required offsetting sales of U.S. Treasury securities from the\nFed’s portfolio in order to drain reserves and avoid driving the interbank interest rate below the\nFed’s target. These lending operations changed the composition of the Fed’s asset portfolio\nwithout changing the Fed’s monetary liabilities, and thus constituted “credit policy,” not\nmonetary policy. 4 Such lending raises important issues related to the independence of central\nbanks and their role in the financial system. 5 I have spoken at length about these issues on other\noccasions, but they are not my focus today. 6\nAs the economy weakened in the fall of 2008, the Fed drove the interbank interest rate to near\nzero. As a general matter, unconventional monetary policy is associated with the extended period\nof time since then, during which the Fed’s interest rate target has been essentially as low as it can\ngo — in other words, at the “zero lower bound.” The ability of banks and other members of the\npublic to hold currency constrains the ability of the central bank to enforce a nominal interest\ntarget much less than zero. But in an exceptionally weak economy, the appropriate real rate of\ninterest may be negative. A central bank that has credibility for low and stable inflation — so\nthat inflation expectations are reasonably well anchored — will have difficulty making the real\ninterest rate more than a little bit negative.\nOne possible strategy at the zero lower bound is to seek a lower real interest rate by engineering\nan increase in expected inflation, above the rate the central bank would otherwise target. By\ndeparting from its inflation target for a time, a central bank may be able to support economic\ngrowth by lowering the real interest rate, despite not being able to reduce the nominal interest\nrate below zero. Central banks operating at the zero lower bound have generally avoided this\napproach, and for good reason, in my view. In the United States, for example, the process of\nachieving credibility for low inflation was difficult and costly, taking the better part of two\ndecades. This experience suggests that engineering medium-term variations in inflation\nexpectations would be quite difficult to implement and would set precedents that pose longer-run\nrisks to the central bank’s credibility.\nForward Guidance\nSetting aside strategies aimed at changing expected inflation, the Fed and other central banks at\nthe zero lower bound have focused their efforts on longer-term interest rates. They have tried to\nbolster interest-sensitive sectors by reducing long rates to lower levels. Two broad strategies\nhave been employed to attempt to reduce long-term rates: One provides “forward guidance” to\n2\n\n\faffect the public’s beliefs about the future path of policy, including short-term rates, and the\nother relies on direct purchases of longer-term assets.\nThe Fed has deployed a number of approaches to communicating about its intentions and\nexpectations for the path of short-term rates in recent years. The FOMC began by including\nqualitative language in its policy statements characterizing the time period over which it\nexpected exceptionally low interest rates to be appropriate: At first it was “for some time”\n(December 2008 and January 2009), and then “an extended period” (March 2009 through June\n2011). In August 2011, the Committee sharpened its guidance by specifying the time before\nwhich an increase in the federal funds rate seemed unlikely — and then moving this date further\ninto the future several times. Finally, in December 2012, the Committee replaced this date-based\nforward guidance with a threshold for the unemployment rate, saying that “the exceptionally low\nrange for the federal funds rate will be appropriate at least as long as the unemployment rate\nremains above 6-½ percent, inflation between one and two years ahead is projected to be no\nmore than a half percentage point above the Committee’s 2 percent longer-run goal, and longerterm inflation expectations continue to be well anchored.” This form of forward guidance\nremains in place today.\nThese communication efforts have been generally aimed at easing financial conditions by\npushing back the dates at which market participants believe short-term rates are likely to rise.\nSuch communications by the central bank, however, inevitably face a conundrum. Forward\nguidance is effective when it alters the public’s perception of the central bank’s pattern of\nbehavior in response to incoming data ― in essence, the central bank’s “reaction function.” But\nthere’s always the possibility that the public will interpret the forward guidance in terms of the\nfuture evolution of the economic conditions to which the central bank reacts. The public might\nreason that, under its existing pattern of behavior, the central bank expects low rates to be\nwarranted for a longer period because they expect the economy to be weaker. In this case,\nforward guidance could have the paradoxical effect of reducing current economic activity, by\nreducing expectations about the level of future economic activity. 7 It may be difficult to craft\nforward guidance in a way that definitively separates these two interpretations. The FOMC’s use\nof numerical thresholds is in part an attempt to clarify that forward guidance about short-term\ninterest rates is about the Committee’s reaction function, not its economic outlook.\nIdeally, a central bank can make clear that its communications concern its future reactions to\nincoming economic data. Forward guidance regarding central bank reaction patterns often takes\nthe form of criteria for particular decisions, as in the case of the FOMC’s thresholds for raising\ninterest rates or the conditions under which the open-ended asset purchase program will likely be\nwound down.\nDesigning such conditional guidance involves trade-offs, however. Credibility requires\nconsistency, over time, between a central bank’s statements and its actual subsequent actions. A\ncentral bank’s statements will have greater immediate effect on the public’s expectations the\nmore they are seen as limiting the central bank’s future choices. Yet there are likely to be\ncircumstances, ex post, in which the central bank feels constrained by past statements. Yielding\nto the temptation to implicitly renege by reworking decision criteria or citing unforeseen\neconomic developments may have short-term appeal, but widely perceived discrepancies\n3\n\n\fbetween actual and foreshadowed behavior will inevitably erode the faith people place in future\ncentral bank statements. So central banks face an ex ante trade-off, as well, between the short-run\nvalue of exercising discretion and the ability to communicate effectively and credibly in the\nfuture.\nAsset Purchases\nThe other unconventional method of influencing longer-term interest rates has been the purchase\nof long-term assets. The Fed has conducted four major rounds of asset purchases since 2009,\nincluding the so-called Maturity Extension Program in which purchases of longer-term Treasury\nsecurities were financed by the sale of shorter-term Treasury securities. The other programs were\nfinanced by creating bank reserves and involved purchases of Treasury securities, as well as\nsecurities issued by the housing-related government sponsored enterprises ― so-called “agency\nMBS.”\nLarge-scale asset purchases are motivated by a desire to have an influence on longer-term\ninterest rates, above and beyond the influence of the public’s beliefs about the path of short-term\nrates. That is, they are designed to act directly on the term premium — that part of a long-term\nrate that is not explained by expected future short rates. By reducing rates in this way, asset\npurchases are intended to stimulate economic activity by encouraging interest-sensitive\ncomponents of spending by businesses and households.\nThe ability of central bank asset purchases to directly lower the term premium presumes some\nsorts of friction in financial markets. Otherwise, any decline in rates would create an arbitrage\nopportunity, and markets would undo the effects of central bank purchases. One type of friction\nthat is often invoked to motivate asset purchases is “market segmentation” — the idea that\ncertain investors have a special attraction for holding certain assets. If, in addition, the ability of\nother traders to arbitrage various market segments is limited by wealth or credit constraints, then\ndifferences in risk-adjusted expected returns could emerge and persist.\nI don’t find this theoretical foundation for the efficacy of central bank asset purchases to be\nparticularly compelling. In modern financial markets, many distinct market segments — for\ninstance, Treasury securities of different maturities — are linked by an array of derivative\ncontracts. An investor with a pure preference for, say, a 10-year bond, should be able to closely\napproximate their desired stream of payments with swaps linked to other securities. The breadth\nand variety of such contracts make it hard to believe that the degree of segmentation is enough\nfor asset purchases to generate significant interest rate effects.\nI also have found the empirical evidence on the effects of asset purchases hard to interpret. Some\nof the evidence, using event study analysis of the effects on long-term rates of announcements\nabout purchase programs, is ill-suited to discerning the kind of persistent effect on rates that\nwould be needed to influence economic decisions. During the short windows over which effects\nare measured, asset price movements can be dominated by transitory market liquidity effects.\nOther studies draw on changes in the net supply of U.S. Treasury securities of varying maturities\nusing data from the years before the crisis, and hence before the Fed undertook a purposeful\nprogram of asset purchases. Finally, when an effect on rates is detected, it’s often difficult to\n4\n\n\fdistinguish direct effects on term premia from effects due to changing expectations of future\nshort rates.\nBeyond the interest rate effects of asset purchases, the effect on real economic activity is even\nharder to detect. One approach has been to combine an estimated interest rate effect with\nestimates from previous work on the effects of long-term interest rates on economic activity. 8\nAnother, more integrated approach is to use rudimentary macro models incorporating the\nsegmented markets ideas mentioned above. 9 Efforts along these lines have found relatively small\nmacro effects of large asset purchases. On balance, my reading of the evidence suggests that the\ndirect economic effects of the Fed’s asset purchases have been minimal.\nThis does not mean, however, that asset purchases can have no effect when the central bank’s\ninterest target is at its zero lower bound. Asset purchases increase reserves, after all, and thus in\nprinciple could induce rapid money growth and rising inflation pressures. Now, however, reserve\nbalances are less than half of the liquidity buffer of the banking system, so at this point the\nreserve expansion has not forced inflationary adjustments in bank’s balance sheets. It’s also the\ncase that market participants thus far do not appear to expect such inflationary consequences.\nIn principle, one can think of asset purchases and forward guidance as distinct policy tools. But it\nhas proven difficult to treat them as such, because announcements about asset purchases at times\nseem to also have had an effect on the public’s beliefs about future interest rate policy. Perhaps\nthis should be expected. Both asset purchases and interest rate settings reflect the central bank’s\nreading of economic prospects. A change in one policy will inevitably be attributed to some\nextent to a change in the central bank’s views on economic conditions, which will in turn be\ninformative about the likely path of the other policy instrument. An example of the difficulty in\nseparating the two instruments could be seen earlier this year when the prospects of winding\ndown the Fed’s asset purchase program appeared to reduce the expected time period over which\ninterest rates were expected to remain near zero. Thus it’s unreasonable to expect\ncommunications about near-term asset programs to have no effect on interest rate expectations,\nunless one believes that the Fed is viewed as having no special expertise in assessing economic\nconditions.\nExit Risks\nWhile I have doubts about whether the effects of the Fed’s asset purchases in the current\nenvironment have been large, I do believe those purchases entail some risks. In particular, I see\ntwo areas for concern. First, our current unconventional policies may make it more likely that we\nact too slowly when it’s time to raise rates, and may make such a delay more costly. And second,\nour large purchases and ongoing holdings of MBS open the door to additional political\ndifficulties for the Fed.\nEven in times of conventional monetary policy, there is a risk that short-term interest rates are\nnot adjusted appropriately, in the sense that later information reveals that rates were too low or\ntoo high in relation to the central bank’s objectives. This risk is an inevitable consequence of our\nimperfect information about the economy. Under normal conditions, the central bank’s\ncredibility for its longer-term inflation objectives helps ensure that the consequences of such\n5\n\n\fpolicy misses are small, as long as they are corrected before too long. My concern is that the\ncombination of forward guidance and a very large balance sheet has raised the likelihood of\npolicy mistakes going forward, and also has raised the cost of such mistakes, should they occur.\nThe forward guidance in recent FOMC statements reads, in part, that “highly accommodative . . .\npolicy will remain appropriate for a considerable time after . . . the economic recovery\nstrengthens.” This wording can reasonably be interpreted as promising or foreshadowing a lower\nlevel of short-term interest rates than our usual policy would dictate. Of course, there is a\nrationale for such commitments in the work of Gauti Eggertsson, Michael Woodford and others,\nbut that work typically does not incorporate the possibility of policy mistakes. If there is any\ncontent to the just-quoted FOMC statement, then surely it indicates a willingness to tolerate a\ngreater risk of keeping rates too low for too long. If that outcome does occur, then the large\nquantity of excess reserves ― $2.2 trillion as of last week ― would allow the banking system to\nexpand quite rapidly, compared to conventional times, when excess reserves were typically less\nthan $2 billion. The quantity of net new deposits the banking system is capable of creating at any\none time (absent Fed accommodation through reserve expansion) is limited by the quantity of\nexcess reserves, after all, and a rapid expansion in bank lending, and thus banking system\ndeposits, would tend to generate inflationary pressures. 10\nThe Fed could, of course, respond to those pressures by raising the interest rate it pays on excess\nreserves. What’s more, the FOMC’s forward guidance about interest rates includes inflation trip\nwires (or “knockouts”), and I believe that the Committee sincerely intends to prevent inflation\nfrom persistently exceeding its 2 percent target. But the uncharted nature of the territory we will\nbe in — with very large reserve balances and forward guidance that specifies necessary but not\nsufficient conditions for raising rates — inevitably raises both the odds of a timing error and the\npotential magnitude of the consequences. The need for vigilance regarding the emergence of\nthese risks suggests that we pay more attention to monetary and bank credit aggregates than we\ntypically do in more conventional times.\nRisks to Independence\nIn addition to expanding the size of its balance sheet, the Fed has altered the composition of its\nasset portfolio through substantial purchases of mortgage-backed securities. The Federal Reserve\nheld $1.4 trillion of agency MBS and debt as of September 18, 2013, or 38 percent of total\nassets. Central bank purchases of unconventional securities have the capacity to generate\npolitical risks because they can be seen as altering the allocation and pricing of credit. I’ve\nmentioned my skepticism about the size of the price effects of asset purchases. Nonetheless, the\nFed’s purchases of agency MBS are clearly intended to reduce their relative yields and lower the\nretail cost of housing credit. If these purchases actually succeed in lowering the cost of housing\ncredit, then the cost of credit to other borrowers will be higher than it otherwise would have been\nhad the central bank instead purchased only Treasury debt.\nWhen a central bank uses its independent balance sheet to choose among private sector assets, it\ninvites special pleading from interest groups and risks entanglement in distributional politics.\nSimilar political risks face a central bank, such as the European Central Bank, allocating\ninvestments across multiple sovereign debt issuers.\n6\n\n\fPolitical pressure to channel credit to favored sectors is not without precedent in the United\nStates. Congress gave the Fed authority to buy the debt of U.S. agencies such as the housing\ngovernment-sponsored enterprises in 1966 in response to the “credit crunch” that year that\nreduced flows to housing finance. 11 At first, the FOMC limited its activities in agency securities\nto short-term repurchase agreements, but Congress pressed the Fed to conduct outright\npurchases, at times explicitly threatening legislation to mandate purchases and reduce the Fed’s\nstatutory independence. In 1971, the FOMC relented and began outright purchases of the debt of\nthe housing government-sponsored enterprises. 12 (By 1981, purchases had stopped, and the Fed’s\nholdings ran off gradually over the 1980s and 1990s. Outright purchases of agency securities\nwere not conducted again until early 2009.)\nHow central banks manage the political risks associated with forays into credit policy may prove\npivotal for the evolution of central banking in advanced economies. 13 A central bank’s core\nresponsibility revolves around its liabilities ― that is, the monetary assets it uniquely supplies.\nBeing organized as distinct, off-budget intermediaries, however, requires them to hold assets,\nand just what assets the central bank should hold has been something of a conundrum. 14 Central\nbank operational independence has been critical to effective monetary policy under the fiat\nmoney standard that has prevailed in the decades since the demise of the gold standard and the\nGreat Inflation of the 1970s. That independence has enabled central banks to generally resist\npressures to provide short-term stimulus that in the past led to bad inflation dynamics.\nOf the risks associated with unconventional monetary policies, those associated with central\nbank holdings of unconventional asset classes may be the most consequential. Violating the\nimplied truce under which central banks avoid credit policy has the capacity to perturb the\ndelicate governance equilibrium supporting the independent conduct of monetary policy. History\nprovides numerous examples of compromised central bank independence leading to calamitous\nmonetary policy.\nConclusion\nMore broadly, the variety of ways in which central banks have ventured into unconventional\nrealms has given rise to a broader set of challenges. Taken as a whole, these unconventional\npolicy measures have elevated the public profile of central banks and spotlighted the breadth of\ntheir statutory authorities. To the extent that the public has been surprised in recent years by the\ndegree of autonomy central banks enjoy and concerned about the efficacy or fairness of their\npolicies, the legitimacy of existing central bank governance arrangements is bound to be called\ninto question. This, I believe, is the most critical challenge that central banks will face in the\nyears ahead.\n1\n\nI am grateful to John Weinberg, Alex Wolman, Andreas Hornstein, Robert Hetzel, and Huberto Ennis for\nassistance in preparing these remarks.\n2\nSee Huberto M.

        "content": "Human Capital Investment as a Major Financial Decision\nOctober 4, 2013\nJeffrey M. Lacker\nPresident\nFederal Reserve Bank of Richmond\nCouncil for Economic Education’s 52nd Annual Conference\nBaltimore, Md.\n\nThank you for the privilege of speaking with you today. The Federal Reserve Bank of\nRichmond, like the other 11 regional Reserve Banks around the country, has a rich financial\neducation program for teachers and students at all levels. At first, it might not be obvious why\nthe Federal Reserve is interested in financial education. In the news and in textbooks, the role of\nthe Fed is to conduct monetary policy in order to fulfill our dual mandate of price stability and\nmaximum employment. But as we’ve seen during the recovery from the Great Recession, there\nare significant limits to the power of monetary policy to affect the real economy. Federal Reserve\npolicy actions cannot necessarily counteract the effects of fiscal policy uncertainty, declining\nproductivity growth or structural changes in the labor market — all of which now appear to be\nplaying a role to some degree.\nRecent events have sent us a clear message related to the employment part of our mandate. The\nGreat Recession had a substantial impact on the labor market experiences of many Americans.\nBut as I will spell out today, skill level made a large difference in the ability of individuals to\nweather the recession and its aftermath. The opportunities available to current and future cohorts\nof young Americans thus seem inextricably tied to the skills they acquire. As a result, there are\npotentially enormous payoffs to bolstering economic and financial literacy on the critical issue of\nyoung people’s investments in their own human capital. By providing people better information\nand enabling them to make better choices, we can have an effect on a range of personal and\nsocial outcomes, from employment and standards of living to economic mobility and inequality.\nToday, I’d like to talk to you about the principles that motivate the Richmond Fed’s approach to\nfinancial education and how those principles relate to what we have learned from a large body of\nempirical and theoretical research on human capital accumulation. They suggest that our current\nfocus on helping students decide how to pay for college — which presumes that college is\nnecessarily the right choice for everyone and that success is guaranteed — might be misplaced.\nInstead, a better focus might be educating students about both the risks and rewards of college so\nthey can understand whether it is the right choice for them and how to enhance their prospects of\nsuccess. Before I begin, I should note that these are my own opinions and not those of my\ncolleagues in the Federal Reserve System. 1\nEconomic Principles of Financial Education\n\n1\n\n\fA moment ago, I referred to helping people make better choices, but I use the word “better”\ncautiously. Some financial education efforts, while well-intentioned, presume that consumers are\nprone to making financial mistakes — and, moreover, that certain decisions, such as taking out\nan adjustable-rate mortgage or a short-term high-interest loan, are always mistakes. From an\neconomist’s perspective, however, it’s extremely hard for outside observers to determine when a\nconsumer has made a mistake — although it’s easy for observers to conclude that they would\nhave chosen differently for themselves. But choices should depend on the preferences and\nconstraints of the consumer who is making the decision, not on the limited information and\nbeliefs of the observer. In general, prescriptive, one-size-fits-all approaches to financial decisionmaking may be unproductive. For a consumer who plans to sell a home in a few years, for\nexample, an adjustable-rate mortgage might be an advantageous option when compared to the\nfixed-rate loan with a higher interest rate that might be preferred by those planning to remain in\ntheir home for a longer time.\nConsumers would benefit, however, from high-quality information that helps them determine the\nbest choice for their particular circumstances, particularly for major financial decisions. This is\nwhere I believe we have the greatest opportunity to make a difference.\nA major financial decision, in my view, has four salient characteristics. First, the consequences\nare significant. Attending college, for example, has large financial implications; future earnings\nare uncertain, and many students and parents need to take out sizeable student loans. Second, that\nsignificance is compounded by the fact that the decision is irreversible and illiquid. While you\nmight forget the particulars of some of your classes, once you’ve paid your tuition, you can’t\ndecide to unlearn your knowledge and exchange it for some other good. Third, a major financial\ndecision happens infrequently. College is generally an investment that you make only once,\nwhich limits the opportunities you have to learn from experience. Finally, it’s complex. Figuring\nout how much to spend on college requires you to make estimates about the returns to your\ninvestment 30 years or more in the future.\nWith these characteristics in mind, the Richmond Fed recently launched a new website,\nmajorfinancialdecisions.org, which provides information on buying versus renting a home,\nplanning for retirement and financing college. Each of these decisions is significant, long-lasting,\ninfrequent and complex, so financial education is likely to be especially valuable to the\nconsumer. 2 Today, I want to focus on the last of those decisions, or more precisely, on the even\nbigger question that precedes the decision about how to finance college: Is college necessarily\nthe right investment for every student?\nCollege Is a Wise Investment\nDuring the 2010–2011 school year, the published price for a year of tuition, room and board at a\nfour-year college averaged about $16,000 at public schools and about $33,000 at private schools.\nOverall, college costs have increased 35 percent in real terms since just a decade earlier. Most\nstudents pay less than the sticker price through a combination of student aid and tax benefits, but\nthe numbers still are quite daunting.\n\n2\n\n\fThe well-publicized increase in tuition rates does not appear to have deterred many people from\nattending: Enrollment increased 37 percent between 2000 and 2010. Only part of that increase is\ndue to population growth; the number of 18- to 24-year-olds enrolled in college increased 34\npercent during that period, compared to just 13 percent growth in that population group overall.\nThe increase in enrollment has been accompanied by a dramatic rise in student loan debt, to\nalmost $1 trillion, about triple the level in 2004. In part, this is because the number of borrowers\nhas increased, as you might expect given the increase in enrollment, but the amount borrowed\nalso has risen considerably. Between 2005 and 2012, average debt per borrower increased 56\npercent, from $16,000 to $25,000.\nOn average, this investment pays off well. The median income for a college-educated worker is\n$48,000, compared to $27,000 for a worker with a high school diploma. Over a lifetime, the\nmedian worker with a bachelor’s degree can expect to earn $2.3 million, based on 2009 earnings\ndata, compared to just $1.3 million earned by the median worker with a high school diploma. 3\nWorkers with college degrees also fare better during economic downturns. Following the Great\nRecession, for example, the unemployment rate for college-educated workers peaked at 5.1\npercent, compared to 11 percent for non-college-educated workers. As of August, the\nunemployment rate for workers with a high school diploma was more than double that of\nworkers with a bachelor’s degree or higher — 7.6 percent compared to 3.5 percent. And even\nthough many recent college graduates appear underemployed, they’re still earning more than\ntheir non-college-educated co-workers in the same positions. 4\nBut Is College a Wise Investment for Everyone?\nThe data I just described are averages, and for the average enrollee, college certainly appears to\nbe a prudent investment. But averages, as we all know, can obscure meaningful nuances.\nFirst, earnings data are collected from students who complete college; a student who has not yet\nenrolled may not realize the same return on investment, perhaps because that particular student\ndiffers in some way from the average attendee. But there may well be an important difference\nbetween the premium earned by the average student and the premium earned by the marginal\nstudent. Indeed, some research suggests that as much as half of the college premium is due to\n“selection,” not necessarily the degree itself, meaning that students who choose to enroll in and\ncomplete college are inherently different in some way from those who do not, and those\ndifferences account for about half of the disparity in their earnings. 5 There also is wide variation\nin earnings across majors and occupations. For example, the median income for a worker with a\nbachelor’s degree in counseling psychology is $29,000, little more than the median income of a\nhigh school graduate, as opposed to $120,000 for the recipient of a degree in petroleum\nengineering. 6\nPerhaps the most crucial caveat, however, is that the returns to college depend on finishing\ncollege. There is relatively little benefit, at least in terms of earnings, for students who attend for\na year or two but do not graduate. Median weekly earnings for a worker with some college but\nno degree are about 15 percent higher than the earnings of a high school graduate, compared to\nabout 80 percent higher for a worker with a bachelor’s degree.\n3\n\n\fWe are not talking about a small number of students: Government data show that only a little\nmore than half of students who matriculate at a four-year college complete a bachelor’s degree\nwithin six years. 7 The completion rates are considerably lower for African-American and\nHispanic students, for students from poor families and for students who are the first members of\ntheir families to attend college. Dropping out of college is expensive: The average debt burden\namong all college dropouts is more than $7,000; among only those dropouts who borrowed, it’s\nmore than $14,000.\nOne intuitively appealing explanation for the high college dropout rate is that students and their\nfamilies are credit constrained, and thus unable to continue to finance a college education. Most\nresearch, however, suggests that credit constraints are not a significant factor in the dropout\ndecision. Part of the explanation might be the rise in the number of nontraditional students who\nare balancing work and family responsibilities and thus find it more challenging to complete a\ndegree. But much of the explanation appears to lie in the fact that many of the students who\nenroll in college do not have an accurate assessment of their own readiness for college. Students\nwho enroll presumably believe that the benefits of college attendance are likely to exceed the\ncosts. But as I have discussed, the net economic gain from attending just a year or two of college\nappears to be quite small — which suggests that something must happen in college to students’\nbeliefs about their likelihood of succeeding. Survey evidence has demonstrated that this is in fact\nthe case. 8 When asked, entering college students are highly optimistic about their grades, and\nthey say that they intend to complete a bachelor’s degree within four years. But as they take\nclasses and exams, they revise their assessments of their future performances, and these updated\nbeliefs then play a large role in the dropout decision. These surveys also show that students from\npoor families are more likely to drop out, and drop out sooner, than students from wealthier\nfamilies.\nEquipping Students to Make Good Education Decisions\nWhat do these facts about the high rate of college noncompletion have to do with economic\neducation? As I mentioned at the beginning of this talk, many involved in financial education,\nthe Richmond Fed included, have focused their efforts on informing students about the costs of\nstate versus private school or explaining the many types of federal and private loans that are\navailable. But I would encourage financial education practitioners to give thought to just where\nthe provision of information can yield the greatest marginal benefit. The research I’ve touched\nupon here suggests that might be before the decision to attend college is made. The decision to\ninvest in human capital is fraught with uncertainty as it is. This suggests that prospective college\nstudents would benefit from realistic appraisals of their odds of success, as well as a better\nappreciation of how good preparation for college can improve those odds.\nMany students and families also could benefit from information about options they could pursue\nafter high school other than enrolling in a four-year college. Community colleges, for example,\nare a venue where students can learn more about their interests and aptitudes and practice the\nskills that are required for success at a four-year school, all the while preserving their option to\ncontinue onward toward a four-year degree. And for some students, pursuing a bachelor’s degree\nmight never be their preferred path. These students would be well served by learning about other\n4\n\n\fpost-secondary educational options that could improve their labor market outcomes relative to\nonly completing high school or dropping out of college. For example, a growing number of high\nschools and community colleges are partnering with businesses to offer vocational training and\napprenticeship programs that equip students with specialized training, such as skills especially\nuseful in advanced manufacturing. 9 These skills are in high demand by employers — and may be\nless vulnerable to automation or offshoring than many traditional white-collar jobs.\nIn addition, the flipside of the dropout problem is the failure of relatively high-achieving students\nto apply to college. At first glance, these students might appear myopic or impatient, unwilling to\nwait for the returns on their investments; in economic terms, they would be described as having\nvery high discount rates. But that assumes that these students have accurate information on\nwhich to base their calculations. In fact, many students, particularly low-income students,\noverestimate the costs of college and underestimate their opportunities for financial aid. 10\nStudents might also face social norms that cause them to undervalue the future payoffs or their\nlikelihoods of success. In these cases, what looks like impatience might simply be a lack of\ninformation, as demonstrated by several recent studies.\nIn one study, researchers found that sending targeted information to low-income, high-achieving\nstudents, at a cost of only $6 per student, increased their matriculation rates at selective\ncolleges. 11 Another study focused on high school seniors in New Hampshire who had 10th-grade\ntest scores similar to the scores of college enrollees but were at risk of not applying to college. 12\nIt found that providing them with mentors and assistance with application forms and tests\nsignificantly increased women’s college enrollment, although not men’s, and that so far, these\nstudents are as likely to remain in college as other high school students in the state. This research\nsuggests that information can play an important role in changing the beliefs of students who\nerroneously think that they’re not college material.\nEarly Intervention\nAs I have discussed, the low rate of college completion appears to stem from the fact that many\nstudents are not well prepared for college. One option for improving college completion rates\nand job prospects for potential dropouts is to provide them with accurate information about the\ncosts and benefits of a variety of post-secondary education options. But it’s not enough to ask\nwhat we can do when a student is 16 or 18 or 20 years old. Instead, it’s worth asking why some\nstudents — too many students — are poorly prepared in the first place.\nNumerous researchers and policymakers are currently debating what reforms to our education\nsystem might have the greatest impact on student achievement. But one area where I believe we\nhave very strong evidence for the benefits of reform is in early childhood education. There is\nconsensus now that the foundation for academic and labor market success is laid very early in\nlife, even in infancy. That’s because the early mastery of basic emotional, social and other\nnoncognitive skills makes it easier to learn more complex skills throughout life. As a result,\nchildren who fall behind early on have difficulty catching up: Gaps in cognitive skills are present\nas early as age four and tend to persist into adulthood. But intervening early can yield large\nreturns; many researchers have found that the return on a dollar invested in human capital is\n\n5\n\n\fhighest when the investment occurs at age 3, and children who receive high-quality early\neducation fare much better on a variety of socioeconomic measures.\nResearch also shows, however, that poor and minority children are much less likely to have\naccess to such early education programs and are much more likely to fall behind. Greater\ninvestment in early interventions thus could help ensure that future choices about how much to\ninvest in a student’s human capital aren’t limited by family background, and that more people\nhave the opportunity to achieve their potential. 13\nConclusion\nTo sum up, then, the most critical economic decisions people face over their lifetime concern\ninvestments in their human capital. Financial education has traditionally promoted college\nenrollment by providing prospective students with information on financing options. But success\nin college is by no means automatic, and the benefits of attending — but not completing —\ncollege are relatively low. I have advocated that financial educators shift toward informing\nstudents about the value of college preparedness and the value of alternatives to a traditional\nfour-year college degree, such as community colleges and vocational and apprenticeship\nprograms. In addition, making sure students are well aware of the magnitude of the return to\nsuccessful college completion would reduce the odds of well-qualified students forgoing college\nattendance. And finally, I was unable to resist the opportunity to put in a plug for early childhood\nintervention, where research has demonstrated the value of targeted, high-quality programs.\nIn closing, it’s useful to keep in mind the stakes involved in the quality of decision-making on\nhuman capital investments. The breathtaking gains in living standards that have been achieved\nover the last three centuries depended crucially on investments in physical capital. But\naccompanying improvements in workforce skills, broadly defined, were clearly critical as well.\nThe accumulation of knowledge over time is also essential to the process of uncovering and\ndeploying technological innovations that are essential to economic growth. And when we look at\ndisparities in economic outcomes across our populace, differences in human capital\naccumulation loom quite large. Financial education aimed at improving the ability of students\nand families to make sound human capital investment decisions can help us be sure that people\nare prepared to make the best use of their talents and opportunities. As educators, you are on the\nfront line in influencing and preparing our youth. So I would urge you to view your mission as\nabsolutely essential to the continued vitality of economic growth.\n\n1\n\nI would like to thank Jessie Romero, Kartik Athreya, and Urvi Neelakantan for assistance in preparing these\nremarks.\n2\nJeffrey M.

        "content": "Toward Orderly Resolution\nOctober 18, 2013\nJeffrey M. Lacker\nPresident\nFederal Reserve Bank of Richmond\nFederal Reserve 2013 Resolution Conference\nWashington, D.C.\n\nWelcome to the Federal Reserve 2013 Resolution Conference. This gathering is sponsored\njointly by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and the Federal Reserve Bank\nof Richmond. Our objective is to stimulate constructive dialogue among knowledgeable\nprofessionals and the practitioners involved in constructing and assessing resolution plans. This\nis a critically important element of our collective response to the financial crisis.\nTitle I of the Dodd-Frank Act requires that certain large U.S. financial institutions submit\nresolution plans to the Federal Reserve and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. As most\nof you know, a resolution plan describes a firm’s strategy for liquidation or reorganization under\nthe U.S. bankruptcy code, without extraordinary government assistance, in the event of material\nfinancial distress or failure. The heart of the plan is the specification of the actions the firm\nwould take to facilitate rapid and orderly resolution and prevent adverse effects of failure,\nincluding the firm’s strategy for maintaining the operations of and funding for its critical\noperations and material entities.\nSeparate from Title I, Title II of the Dodd-Frank Act provides for the FDIC to take a firm into\nreceivership if there is a determination that, among other things, the firm’s failure under the U.S.\nbankruptcy code would have serious adverse effects on “financial stability.” One difference\nbetween Title II and the bankruptcy code is that Title II gives the FDIC the ability to borrow\nfunds from the U.S. Treasury to make payments to creditors of the failed firm or to guarantee the\nliabilities of the failed firm. 1 The funds are to be repaid from recoveries on the assets of the\nfailed firm or from assessments against the largest, most complex financial companies.\nClearly, the Dodd-Frank Act envisions bankruptcy without government support as the first and\nmost preferable option in the case of a failing financial institution, and for good reason, in my\nopinion. If Title I resolution comes to be expected as the norm, the incentives of market\nparticipants will be much better aligned with our public policy goal of a financial system that\neffectively allocates capital and risks. Large financial firms will prefer to be less leveraged and\nless reliant on short-term funding. Institutions and markets would, accordingly, be more resilient\nin response to financial stress. Policymakers could then credibly commit to avoiding rescues,\nwhich would reinforce appropriate incentives. In short, robust Title I resolution planning is a\n\n\fstrong complement to the array of ongoing enhancements to prudential supervision that are\naimed at reducing the likelihood of failure.\nA critical success factor for resolution plans is that, in the event of financial distress,\npolicymakers will view them as making bankruptcy preferable to alternative approaches, such as\nTitle II, in which government funding protects some creditors, the prospect of which blunts\nincentives. Title I stipulates that the Federal Reserve and the FDIC can jointly determine that a\nplan is “not credible,” meaning that it would not facilitate an orderly resolution under the\nbankruptcy code. In this case, the firm would be required to submit a revised plan to address\nidentified deficiencies, including altering business operations or corporate structure. If the Fed\nand the FDIC jointly determine that the revised plan does not remedy identified deficiencies,\nthey can mandate tighter capital, leverage or liquidity requirements, or restrict the growth,\nactivities or operations of the firm. In essence, regulators can order changes in the structure and\noperations of a firm to make it resolvable in bankruptcy without government assistance.\nA veritable army of professionals has been devoting considerable time and effort to crafting and\nevaluating Title I resolution plans. Many of you have enlisted in this army, although some of you\nmay have been drafted. The initial wave of firms has provided two rounds of submissions\nalready. Another wave of firms submitted plans midyear, and a third wave is slated to submit\nplans at year-end. Substantial work remains to be done, however, and substantial issues remain\nto be sorted out before regulators and policymakers can convince market participants of the\ncredibility of these plans.\nEnsuring that the relevant portion of the financial sector is covered by robust and credible\nresolution plans can seem like a daunting task. The critical feature to keep in mind, however, is\nthat resolution planning in some sense reverses the usual bankruptcy planning exercise. Instead\nof asking how to take a given financial institution through bankruptcy, Title I asks us to work\nbackward from bankruptcy resolution and determine what the institution needs to look like in\norder for that bankruptcy to be orderly. It invites us to not take any aspect of the structure and\nfinancing of a large financial institution as fixed.\nThis perspective casts a new light on financial firm characteristics ― such as short-term funding\nstrategies ― that might appear to pose impediments to orderly resolution without government\nsupport. Credibility may require altering the funding profile of the firm so that debtor-inpossession financing needs in bankruptcy are manageable without public sector funds.\nResolution planning will require a great deal of hard work. But I see no other way to ensure that\npolicymakers have confidence in unassisted bankruptcy and that investors are convinced that\nunassisted bankruptcy is the norm, both of which strike me as necessary to solving the “too big\nto fail” problem. Resolution planning provides a framework for identifying the actions we need\nto take now to ensure that the next financial crisis is handled appropriately, in a way that is fair to\ntaxpayers and establishes the right incentives. While I expect we will hear diverse perspectives\ntoday on many key issues, I am sure we all share that goal. To that end, I am very much looking\nforward to our discussions today.\n\n\f1\n\nFor a comparison of the Orderly Liquidation Authority provisions with the U.S. bankruptcy process, see Sabrina R.\nPellerin and John R.

        "content": "Global Interdependence and Central Banking\nNovember 1, 2013\nJeffrey M. Lacker\nPresident\nFederal Reserve Bank of Richmond\nGlobal Interdependence Center\nPhiladelphia, Pennsylvania\n\nThank you very much. Because of my deep respect for the ideals and mission of the Global\nInterdependence Center, I am honored and humbled to receive the Global Citizen Award. Like\nvirtually all economists, the considerable benefits of the open international exchange of goods,\nservices, ideas and people are to me self-evident. So the mission of the GIC ― “to improve\ncooperation and understanding among nations, with the goal of reducing international conflicts\nand improving worldwide living standards” ― is one that I support with enthusiasm.\nI have my own historic link to the GIC as well. From 1977 to 1979, and then again in 1980, I\nworked at Wharton Econometric Forecasting Associates ― better known as “WEFA” ― under\nProfessor Lawrence Klein, who passed away just a fortnight ago. Professor Klein, besides being\na Nobel laureate and an econometric pioneer, was an early GIC leader and most recently its vice\nchair emeritus. I knew him as a dedicated researcher with an utterly amazing command of\nmacroeconomic facts. I recall seeing him walk to a podium with a small scrap of paper on which\nhe had jotted three or four numbers from that day’s statistical releases and talk authoritatively for\nan hour straight about the economic outlook for each of the major industrial countries. But I also\nknew him as a soft-spoken and humble man. For example, when I knew him at WEFA he drove\na Dodge Dart.\nThere is a deeper connection as well, though, which I would like to explore with you today.\nGlobal interdependence is essential to understanding the institution at which I have made my\ncareer, the Federal Reserve. When the Federal Reserve Act was signed, 100 years ago this\nDecember 23, the continued operation of the classical gold standard was presumed, and our\ninstitution was designed around the need to sustain it. Less well-known is the extent to which\ncompetition for the business of international trade finance played a role in the passage of the\nFederal Reserve Act and some of the most noteworthy institutional features of the Fed as well.\nAnd during pivotal episodes in the history of the Fed, international monetary considerations\nplayed a decisive role in shaping decisions and events. More recently, the U.S. financial crisis of\n2007–08 and the events leading up to it cannot be understood completely without an appreciation\nof financial institutions and economic policy abroad. So I think it’s fair to say that one can’t tell\nthe full story of the Federal Reserve without an international perspective. I also can’t tell the\nstory without the usual Fed disclaimer, namely, that the views I express are my own and not\nnecessarily those of my colleagues in the Federal Reserve System.\n1\n\n\fThe Gold Standard\nThe international dimensions of central banking have long been recognized by specialists, but\nthey get less attention in popular media coverage than they deserve. At the founding of the Fed,\nthe international considerations were two-fold. 1 First was the fact that when the Fed was\nfounded, the U.S. adhered to the gold standard. The governments of participating countries stood\nready to convert their (paper) currency into gold at a fixed rate. Under this system, the long-run\nstability of the purchasing power of money would be assured as long as the U.S. and other\ncountries adhered to the “rules of the game.” These rules required that countries allow gold flows\narising out of balance of payments gaps to have the appropriate equilibrating effects on domestic\neconomic conditions.\nThe Fed was envisioned as operating within and facilitating adherence to the gold standard.\nWhile price stability was an important goal of the founders of the Fed, one to which they\nexpected the Fed to contribute, their focus in founding the Fed was something else entirely. It\nwas to solve “the currency problem.” This is an unfamiliar term to modern ears, so it deserves a\nbit of explanation. Before the founding of the Fed, paper currency was supplied by national\nbanks, but was subject to a collateral requirement that dated back to the Civil War; banks’ note\nissues had to be backed by holdings of U.S. government bonds. The aggregate supply of notes\nwas widely described as “inelastic,” because expanding a bank’s note issue was often costly and\ncumbersome. At times, the public demand for notes rose as the public sought to convert bank\ndeposits into paper currency or gold. This typically occurred during the autumn harvest season\nand the holiday shopping season, as well as during so-called banking panics, when bank\ncustomers sought to pull deposits out of banks.\nThe inelasticity of the physical supply of bank notes meant that other adjustments had to take\nplace instead. Interest rates tended to be higher in the fall and winter, for example, and tended to\nspike during panics when the banking system scrambled for currency. Significant inflows of gold\nfrom abroad occurred at such times as well. Imperfections in the U.S. banking system caused\ndomestic money demand shocks to be transmitted throughout international financial markets.\nAnother adaptation to the regulatory constraints on note supply was payment suspensions. Banks\nwould at times prevent depositors from withdrawing their entire account. At times, all the banks\nin a clearinghouse would suspend withdrawals but allow transfers between clearinghouse banks.\nSuspensions were a disruptive and dysfunctional feature of the pre-Fed banking system.\nThus the preamble of the Federal Reserve Act lists as one of its purposes “to furnish an elastic\ncurrency.” The ultimate objective can be thought of as keeping the defective legislative\nframework around U.S. banking from damaging domestic and international markets.\nInternational Considerations at the Founding of the Fed\nThere were broader international considerations at work in the founding of the Fed than simply\nthe operation of the gold standard, however. Following the Panic of 1907, an influential group of\nNew York bankers was instrumental in the campaign for the creation of a central bank in the\n2\n\n\fU.S. 2 This group included Benjamin Strong, an associate of J.P. Morgan and later the first head\nof the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, and Paul Warburg, the German-born financier at\nKuhn Loeb. They broadly shared an “internationalist” view that America had emerged as a world\npower and should play an expanded international diplomatic and economic role. 3 Creating a\ncentral bank was integral to promoting the U.S. role in the world economy.\nEurope, for this group, provided the natural institutional models for a central bank. Many of\nthese bankers were very familiar with the central banks of Europe, particularly Warburg, whose\nfamily was active in finance there. In a number of European countries, the central bank issued\ntheir own notes and accepted deposits from banks, which enabled them to rapidly expand or\ncontract the supply of notes in response to fluctuations in demand. Liabilities were at least partly\nbacked by holdings of gold, either in the form of coins or bullion. The Federal Reserve Act\nincluded a 40 percent gold cover requirement so that the Reserve Banks’ money supply would\ntend to expand or contract with the movement of gold into and out of the country, as required by\nthe rules of the gold standard.\nWhile these New York bankers were eager to solve the “currency problem,” a second critical\nmotivation for the founding of the Fed was a desire for New York to supplant London as a center\nof trade finance. One provision of the Act allowed national banks for the first time to issue\n“bankers’ acceptances” ― a type of commercial paper (three- to six-months maturity) that arose\nout of the financing of international trade flows. Typically these were the short-term obligations\nof an importer that were endorsed by the importer’s bank. The bank could then “discount” or sell\nthe obligation to third parties. Prior to the Federal Reserve Act, banks in the U.S. generally were\nnot allowed to endorse such obligations, so markets in such instruments were virtually\nnonexistent. Importers in the U.S. typically issued such bills through a European bank, even\nwhen the import was from Latin America and did not involve Europe. 4 Creating a New York\nmarket in bankers’ acceptances helped promote U.S. trade with the rest of the world, and bring a\nlucrative business to the New York banks.\nEuropean central banks at the time, such as the Bank of England, bought or lent against such\ninstruments, a process called “rediscounting.” That provided a backstop of support that was\nthought essential to the liquidity of a market for acceptances. Indeed, according to Warburg:\n“The central bank system and the discount system cannot be separated; they are absolutely\ninterdependent.” 5 Another purpose of the Federal Reserve Act, therefore, was “to afford means\nof rediscounting commercial paper.” The Reserve Banks were authorized to rediscount a variety\nof commercial paper, as long as it wasn’t backed by stocks or bonds. They were also authorized\nto make outright purchases of bankers’ acceptances.\nWorld War I did a great deal to reorder the international financial system. But among those\nchanges was a significant shift in the bankers’ acceptance market to New York City. By the\n1920s, thanks in part to the active encouragement and support of the New York Fed under\nStrong, the New York acceptance market had grown significantly.\n\n3\n\n\fCritical Episodes in Fed History\nThe demise of the gold standard played a pivotal role at the beginning of the Great Depression,\narguably the most critical episode in the Fed’s history. Strong had passed away, and without him,\npolicymakers struggled with conflicting signals from domestic stabilization needs and gold\nstandard precepts, which impeded interest rate reductions that might have stemmed the fall in the\nmoney supply and the catastrophic deflation that raised real rates. 6 Barry Eichengreen, a leading\nscholar of the interwar international monetary arrangements, argues that the gold standard broke\ndown because its success required credibility and cooperation, both of which were in short\nsupply as the 1920s wore on, because of domestic political developments. 7 Countries left the\ngold standard in succession as they found its defense intolerably costly.\nThe result was misdirected Fed policy that contributed to declines of nearly 30 percent in the\nmoney supply and the overall price level from 1929 to 1933. This resulted in a broad shock to\nborrowers’ ability to repay, which weakened many banks and led depositors to withdraw their\nfunds. The resulting runs led to waves of bank failures, which further exacerbated the\ncontraction.\nWhile current research suggests that other aspects of government policy also may have played\nsignificant roles in the depth and length of the Great Depression, monetary instability was clearly\nconsequential and clearly the fault of the Federal Reserve. As a Fed governor in 2002, current\nFed Chairman Ben Bernanke famously acknowledged and apologized for the Fed’s role in the\nGreat Depression. 8\nInternational considerations also played a role in what is arguably the second most critical\nepisode in the Fed’s history: the Great Inflation that occurred from the late 1960s through the\nearly 1980s. International monetary arrangements were reconstructed at the end of World War II\nunder the Bretton Woods gold-exchange system. Currency values were fixed relative to gold, but\nwith intermittent discretionary changes in parities. Tension again arose between domestic\nadjustment and defending a given parity. Political pressures on the Federal Reserve in the late\n1960s and early 1970s impeded actions that would have prevented the rise in inflation. 9 Rather\nthan make the requisite adjustments in the exchange value of the dollar, in 1971, the Nixon\nadministration simply abandoned convertibility of the dollar into gold. Bretton Woods collapsed\nsoon thereafter.\nCentral banks around the globe were forced to adapt to a world of fiat monies, in which price\nstability rests ultimately on the credibility of government commitments to keeping inflation low.\nTough actions were required to bring inflation back under control, but important lessons were\nlearned. In particular, a measure of central bank independence proved invaluable in the fight\nagainst inflation. Institutional arrangements that helped insulate the central bank’s setting of the\npolicy rate from partisan electoral pressures while clarifying accountability for macroeconomic\nperformance, allowed the central bank to focus on longer-run objectives.\n\n4\n\n\fThe Recent Crisis\nThe recent crisis has given rise to serious questions about central bank independence, however.\nWhat’s important for stabilizing inflation is the central bank’s ability to independently control its\nmonetary liabilities. But that independence comes with discretion over the central bank’s asset\nportfolio as well. Unless prevented by legal restrictions, the central bank’s balance sheet can be\nused to fund lending interventions. Such intervention constitutes fiscal policy, in the sense that,\nholding the central bank’s liabilities constant, funding comes from the sale of securities, such as\ngovernment debt, to the public. To the extent that lending operations are viewed as rescuing the\ncreditors of large financial institutions, the central bank risks becoming embroiled in\ndistributional political disputes. And to the extent that expectations of such rescue operations\ndistort incentives and encourage fragile financing arrangements, the central bank can be accused\nof having contributed to the “too big to fail” problem.\nThe dilemma posed by a central bank’s asset portfolio plays out differently in different settings.\nThe European Central Bank, for example, can face the politically awkward situation of having to\nweigh in on the relative value of the sovereign debt of different euro member states.\nInternational considerations were critical in the crisis of 2007–08. The first special lending\nprogram introduced by the Federal Reserve ― the Term Auction Facility ― was dominated by\nforeign financial institutions. The TAF, introduced in December 2007, auctioned term credit\nfrom the Reserve Banks’ discount windows. Foreign institutions held large dollar-denominated\npositions in illiquid assets, such as mortgage-backed securities, that they had trouble funding.\nBanks in the U.S. had access to borrowing from the Federal Home Loan Banks and made major\nuse of that source of funds when credit risk premiums rose in the third quarter of 2007.\nMore broadly, the subprime mortgage risk that was at the heart of the crisis was held\ndisproportionately by foreign investors and foreign financial institutions, along with Fannie Mae\nand Freddie Mac, the U.S. housing intermediaries. The foreign financial institutions involved\nwere arguably affected by the incentive distortions that accompany perceived public sector\nsupport. Incompletely contained moral hazard in one country can infect and distort financial\nmarkets around the globe. For some time, central banks have been heavily involved in the\ninternational negotiations aimed at leveling the regulatory playing field across countries. Postcrisis efforts to construct more robust and sustainable financial regulatory regimes have been\nmediated through several international forums that bring together central banks as well as the\nrelevant national regulators. Finding a balanced approach to financial stability will be\nchallenging.\nConclusion\nThis has been a brief “helicopter tour” of a century of U.S. central banking, one that’s covered\ntoo much territory to be able to examine any of the terrain in depth. I’ve tried to highlight the\nways in which international considerations were not just another part of the story, but were\nintegral to the entire narrative. I hope it illustrates the ways in which awareness of global\ninterdependence is essential for understanding the 100 year history of the Federal Reserve.\n\n5\n\n\f1\n\nFor a companion account focusing on the reasons behind the founding of the Fed, see Jeffrey M.

        "content": "Starting Early in Workforce Development\nNovember 5, 2013\nJeffrey M. Lacker\nPresident\nFederal Reserve Bank of Richmond\nCharlotte, N.C.\n\nGood afternoon. It is a pleasure to be here in Charlotte. I’ve enjoyed seeing firsthand some\nexciting new technologies and businesses in the area and meeting with the people who do the\nhard work of preparing the next generation to participate in those industries. That preparation is\nthe focus of my talk today. I’ll begin by reviewing some current facts about the labor market and\nthe implications of those facts for economic inequality and mobility. I’ll then share some\nobservations on our nation’s current system of workforce development. In particular, I’d like to\nsuggest that workforce development programs targeted toward young people have the potential\nto affect not only individual employment outcomes, but also broader issues such as economic\nmobility and inequality. But first I must note that my opinions are my own and may not reflect\nthe opinions of my colleagues in the Federal Reserve System. 1\nSkills, Inequality and Mobility\nAs I’m sure you are all well aware, the U.S. labor market has been weak for quite some time,\nwith the national unemployment rate still above 7 percent and more than 4 million people out of\nwork for more than six months. Here in North Carolina, the unemployment rate is 8.7 percent —\nwell above the national average. What is striking, though, is that the view of the labor market\ndiffers depending on workers’ levels of education: Nationally, the unemployment rate for\nworkers with only a high school degree is 7.6 percent, compared with just 3.7 percent for\nworkers with a college degree. Following the Great Recession, the unemployment rate for noncollege-educated workers peaked at 11 percent, more than double the peak rate of 5.1 percent for\nworkers with at least a bachelor’s degree. To put this number in perspective, consider that the\nhighest unemployment rate suffered by college-educated Americans in the recent recession is\nsimilar to the lowest unemployment rates for the overall population seen in the past four decades.\nIn addition to being relatively insulated from the swings of the business cycle, college-educated\nworkers earn significantly more than workers with less education. The median income for a\ncollege-educated worker is $48,000, compared with $27,000 for a worker with a high school\ndiploma. Over a lifetime, the median worker with a bachelor’s degree can expect to earn $2.3\nmillion, based on 2009 earnings data, compared with just $1.3 million earned by the median\nworker with a high school diploma. 2 This difference is known as the “college premium,” and it’s\n1\n\n\fincreased significantly over the past 30 years. Growth in the premium has slowed over the past\nfew years, but the large gap now appears to be an enduring feature of the U.S. labor market.\nOver the same period, the United States also has experienced a significant decline in\nmanufacturing employment, a result of globalization and of changes in technology that have\nreduced the need for manufacturing workers. In 1980, more than 20 percent of Americans were\nemployed in manufacturing, compared with less than 9 percent today. North Carolina was hit\nespecially hard by declines in U.S. textile and furniture manufacturing, although the state, and\nthe Charlotte region in particular, is now experiencing a resurgence in advanced manufacturing.\nUnlike the manufacturing jobs of the past, however, these new jobs require greater skills and\nsignificant postsecondary education. Other sectors that have traditionally employed workers\nwithout substantial formal education, such as construction, also are upgrading their skill\nrequirements. We recently heard from a homebuilder who said that he won’t hire a worker who\ndoesn’t have good math skills.\nMany people are concerned about the effects of the large skill premium, especially those who see\nit not only as an indicator that some skills are scarce, but also as a nagging reminder of the\ndecline in high-paying opportunities for those unable to acquire the needed skills. This viewpoint\nis supported by recent data on economic inequality and economic mobility, which show that\ninequality has increased in recent years, while mobility has decreased. The rich are increasingly\nlikely to remain rich, and the poor are increasingly likely to remain poor. Many factors\ncontribute to inequality and the persistence of that inequality both within and across generations.\nBut the disparity in outcomes between those who have acquired skills, often in the form of\ncollege education, and those who have not likely plays a large role. The children of college\ngraduates are much more likely to attend and graduate from college themselves, and this fact\nmight have its roots in differences that manifest themselves very early in life.\nThere is a large and persuasive body of evidence that the foundation for academic and labor\nmarket success is laid very early in life, even in infancy. That’s because the early mastery of\nbasic emotional, social and other noncognitive skills appears to make it easier to learn more\ncomplex skills throughout life. As a result, children who fall behind early on have difficulty\ncatching up: Gaps in cognitive skills are present as early as age 4 and tend to persist into\nadulthood. Research also shows, unfortunately, that poor and minority children — who are less\nlikely to have college-educated parents — are much less likely to have access to high-quality\nearly education programs. 3\nWorkforce Development\nWhat do these facts have to do with workforce development? I will suggest that they should\ninfluence our understanding of why certain workforce development programs might or might not\nsucceed, and what outcomes we can reasonably expect. They also suggest that the greatest\npotential may lie in workforce development programs that are targeted toward young people.\nTwo decades ago, workforce development was chiefly concerned with the competitiveness of\nAmerican workers relative to workers in other countries. 4 More recently, the focus has shifted to\naddressing earnings inequality in the long run and assisting workers who have been affected by\n2\n\n\fseparations in the short run. As many of you well know, the most recent piece of federal\nlegislation addressing workforce development is the Workforce Investment Act of 1998.\nIncluded in this Act was an effort to consolidate numerous different programs into “one-stop”\nemployment centers and to give more control back to states and localities by creating workforce\ninvestment boards composed of local business, education and labor leaders. Currently, about\none-third of the nation’s public spending on workforce development flows through these boards.\nThe boards direct three-quarters of their funds toward adults, including displaced workers, and\none-quarter toward low-income youth who face specific barriers to employment, such as being a\nparent, a high school dropout or a juvenile offender.\nIn addition to the programs funded through the Workforce Investment Act, there are dozens of\nother workforce development programs administered by multiple federal agencies. These\nprograms primarily provide training to low-skill adult workers. Relatively little is known about\ntheir effectiveness, however; a review by the Government Accountability Office found that only\nfive of 47 programs had conducted an impact study to determine whether or not measured\nemployment outcomes could actually be attributed to the program. The studies that were\nconducted were inconclusive, and the positive results were generally small and short-term. 5 A\nnumber of academic studies also cast doubt on the effectiveness of job training programs, finding\nthat the effects on employment and job retention are modest at best. 6 Evidence also is mixed\nregarding programs funded through the Workforce Investment Act. Recent research has found\nthat adults who receive general assistance with job search and placement are more likely to\nbecome and remain employed. But the same is not true for displaced workers who receive more\njob-specific training; in fact, several studies have found that such workers might actually be less\nlikely to become employed, perhaps because they stop looking for a job while undergoing\ntraining. 7\nThese results are not necessarily a reflection of the programs’ quality or of the hard work of the\npeople running them. Here in North Carolina, we’re witnessing some important changes to the\norganization and operation of workforce development boards. One of the most significant is an\nincreased focus on employer engagement to ensure that local boards are providing training for\nskills that are in high demand. Local boards also will conduct more worker assessment to help\npeople determine which jobs and training programs will best fit their natural aptitude. Here in\nCharlotte, the local workforce investment board Charlotte Works has already put many of these\nchanges in place.\nBut there may be a larger issue underlying the modest results of many traditional workforce\ndevelopment programs: These programs might simply be reaching some people too late. As I’ve\ndiscussed, early skill acquisition is crucial to laying the foundation for later skill acquisition. It’s\nalso the case that the earlier an investment in human capital is made, the longer the worker will\nhave to realize the returns on that investment. Many of our current programs may intervene too\nlate for workers to make large investments in their human capital and have adequate time to\nrecoup that investment. Of course, I’m not suggesting that older workers cannot or should not\nlearn new skills, or that an adult who dropped out of high school cannot go on to earn a college\ndegree later in life. But broadly speaking, there may be workforce development strategies that\ncould be more effective in assisting the majority of workers.\n\n3\n\n\fGetting an Early Start\nAs I mentioned, about one-quarter of Workforce Investment Act funds are directed toward\nprograms that serve young people facing considerable challenges. Traditionally, the goal has\nbeen remediation: to help the participants achieve basic literacy or minimum credentials, such as\na GED. As with adult programs, the results of these youth programs have been mixed at best. But\nwe are now seeing a shift toward providing not just remediation, but also knowledge and\ninspiration about different career opportunities. Local workforce investment boards are touring\nlabs and manufacturing facilities, arranging for young people to participate with first responders\nin disaster preparedness drills, and sponsoring robotics competitions. The private sector also is\nreaching out to young people, for example by partnering with high schools such as Charlotte’s\nOlympic High School to offer advanced manufacturing internships and apprenticeships.\nThese programs also show young people that there are a variety of paths they can follow after\nhigh school. Given the rising college premium and the relative insulation from economic shocks\nprovided by a college degree, it’s understandable that many policymakers have focused on\nincreasing college enrollment. But when promoting college as a pathway, we must acknowledge\na sobering reality: Currently, only a little more than half of students who matriculate at a fouryear college complete a bachelor’s degree within six years. 8 What’s worse, there is relatively\nlittle benefit, at least in terms of earnings, for students who attend for a year or two but do not\ngraduate. Median weekly earnings for a worker with some college but no degree are about 15\npercent higher than the earnings of a high school graduate, compared with about 80 percent\nhigher for a worker with a bachelor’s degree. And dropping out of college can be expensive: The\naverage debt burden among all college dropouts is more than $7,000; among only those dropouts\nwho borrowed, it’s more than $14,000.\nMany students and families could benefit from better information about the level of preparation\nrequired to succeed in college, as well as about options they could pursue after high school other\nthan enrolling in a four-year college. Community colleges, for example, are a venue where\nstudents can learn more about their interests and aptitudes and practice the skills that are required\nfor success at a four-year school, all the while preserving their option to continue on toward a\nfour-year degree. And for some students, pursuing a bachelor’s degree might never be their\npreferred path. These students would be well served by learning about other postsecondary\neducation options that could improve their labor market outcomes relative to only completing\nhigh school or dropping out of college. Recent research suggests that people vary in the returns\nthey’re likely to earn from formal education versus learning on the job, and some are likely to\nearn higher returns from working than from, say, a bachelor’s degree. 9 For these workers, it is\nexciting to see the growing number of high schools and community colleges that are partnering\nwith businesses to offer vocational training and apprenticeship programs that equip students with\nspecialized skills, such as those especially useful in advanced manufacturing. 10 Charlotte has\nbeen a national leader in this area with the Apprenticeship 2000 program, a partnership between\nlocal businesses and Central Piedmont Community College. I had the pleasure of seeing that\nprogram in practice at Siemens Energy yesterday.\nProviding students with more information about such programs also might reduce the high\nschool dropout rate. Nationally, more than 20 percent of high school students do not graduate in\nfour years, and many of those students never graduate at all. That measure climbs to more than\n4\n\n\f40 percent in some large urban school districts.* Given that dropping out of high school has been\ndescribed as an “economic death sentence,” 11 these numbers are unacceptably high. Some\nresearchers have suggested that the focus of most high schools on college preparation, to the\nexclusion of other options, is a factor in the dropout rate. If the only reason to graduate from high\nschool is to enroll in college, then students who do not wish to attend college, or perceive large\nbarriers to doing so, might not see much value in graduating. For these students, learning about\nviable career and educational alternatives could improve their appreciation of the value of\nfinishing high school.\n\nConclusion\nTo sum up, I’ve noted that college graduates earn significantly more than people who have not\ngraduated from college, and they also tend to fare better during economic downturns. Over the\nsame period that the college premium has been growing, manufacturing employment, which used\nto provide relatively high-paying jobs for workers without college degrees, has declined\nsignificantly.\nI’ve also talked about the possibility that some traditional workforce development programs are\nreaching workers too late to make large investments in their human capital. But we are now\nseeing a tremendous amount of energy devoted to programs targeting young people, both in the\nprivate sector and at some workforce investment boards. These programs have the potential to\nsignificantly improve educational and job prospects for students who might otherwise have\ndropped out of high school, or enrolled in but failed to complete college.\nBut we are not concerned with high school or college completion rates simply because of the\nimplications for the production of goods and services. Instead, our concern stems from what\nthese numbers indicate about the well-being of the people underlying those statistics and their\nability to achieve a secure economic future for themselves and, perhaps more importantly, for\ntheir children. When we look at disparities in economic outcomes across our society, it is clear\nthat differences in human capital accumulation play a large role — and human capital\naccumulation begins very early in life. Doing our utmost to help the next generation of workers\nmake the best use of their talents and opportunities will lay the groundwork for their children to\nachieve their full potential, and for the United States to achieve a more inclusive prosperity.\n\n*An earlier version of this speech cited the 8 percent “status dropout rate,” which is the percent of 16- through 24year-olds who are not enrolled in school and have not earned a high school diploma or a GED. The text has been\ncorrected to reflect the percentage of students who do not graduate from high school within four years, according to\nthe National Center for Education Statistics.\n\nI am grateful to Jessie Romero, Urvi Neelakantan, and Kartik Athreya for assistance in preparing\nthis speech.\n2\nAnthony P.

        "content": "Economic Outlook, November 2013\nNovember 21, 2013\nJeffrey M. Lacker\nPresident\nFederal Reserve Bank of Richmond\nAsheboro SCORE\nAsheboro, North Carolina\nIt's a pleasure to be with you today to discuss the economic outlook. It's a special pleasure to visit\nwith my old friend, Jim Culberson. Those of you who know Jim, and I suspect that's right many\nof you, probably know him best as an outstanding local banker, and as the former chairman of\nthe American Bankers Association in Washington, the foremost trade organization in the\nbanking industry. Jim also served on the board of directors of our Charlotte branch, and he then\nwent on to serve on the board of our head office in Richmond. We at the Richmond Fed greatly\nappreciate his service to the country in these roles. And I can assure you that public service was\nJim's constant focus, because he took very seriously the proposition that the purpose of the\nbanking system is to meet public needs. So thank you, Jim, for your service, and thank you for\ninviting me down to Asheboro.\nI will be talking today about the outlook for the economy, but before I do, I should make clear\nthat the views expressed are my own and should not be attributed to any other person in the\nFederal Reserve System. 1\nLet's start with a little background. For several years now, ever since the Great Recession of\n2008 and 2009, most forecasts of overall economic activity have followed a common script.\nThey essentially say that while growth has been modest recently, the economy is likely to pick\nup speed in the next couple of quarters when the headwinds that have been temporarily\nrestraining growth diminish. My own forecasts have followed this script (at least until earlier this\nyear), as have those of a broad range of forecasters who are polled for a publication known as the\nBlue Chip survey. Despite these optimistic forecasts, the reality has been more modest. Real\nGDP — our broadest measure of overall economic activity — grew by 2.0 percent in 2011, 2.0\npercent in 2012, and it looks like GDP growth this year will again be 2.0 percent.\nAnd yet, if you look at the latest compilation, you see that many forecasters are doing it again.\nThe latest Blue Chip projection, for example, is for 2.8 percent growth in real GDP next year. As\nyou may have guessed, I will share a different view in my remarks today. A growing number of\neconomists have taken on board the disappointing forecasting record of the last few years and\nhave come to believe that growth is more likely than not to remain low in the next few years. In\nfact, some have become quite pessimistic about U.S. growth prospects and have gone so far as to\nuse the word “stagnation.” Personally, I don't think that's warranted. We are certainly living in a\nperiod in which improvements in standards of living are harder to come by. Yet new economic\nopportunities do keep emerging, and innovations are being implemented, although at a more\ntemperate pace than in the past. Even though my near-term forecast is closer to 2 percent than to\n\n1\n\n\f2.8, I also see room for optimism regarding our fundamental prospects. So don't count me among\nthe stagnationists.\nA little more background: Before the Great Recession, we came to enjoy a period known as the\nGreat Moderation. From 1983 to 2007, real GDP grew at an average annual rate of 3.3 percent.\nOver that 24-year period, we experienced only two short, shallow recessions that together lasted\nonly five quarters. Real personal income kept pace with GDP, also growing at a 3.3 percent\nannual rate. And consumer spending advanced even more rapidly than income, growing at a 3.6\npercent annual rate.\nPart of the reason consumer spending was able to grow more rapidly than income over that\nperiod was the rise in household wealth. Stock prices, bond prices and housing prices all\nincreased significantly during the Great Moderation. Another reason for the divergence was the\nincrease in credit availability for most consumers. For example, the ratio of credit card debt to\npersonal income rose from 2.4 percent in 1983 to 8.0 percent in 2007.*\nDuring the Great Recession, GDP fell by 4.3 percent over a six-quarter interval, but other\nindicators document even greater hardship. Payroll employment fell by 8.7 million jobs in the\nrecession and its immediate aftermath. The unemployment rate, which was below 5 percent in\n2007, rose to 10 percent in October 2009. Real personal income fell by 3.1 percent from\nDecember 2007 to July 2009. The value of household holdings of stocks and mutual fund shares\nfell by $5 trillion, and the value of household equity in real estate fell by $3.9 trillion. The scale\nand scope of loss of income and wealth experienced by American consumers was far greater than\nanything seen in the previous 20 years.\nGiven that experience, lenders are bound to re-evaluate the riskiness associated with extending\ncredit to a typical household. Indeed, consumers themselves appear to be re-evaluating the\nriskiness associated with indebtedness, no doubt reflecting a sense that their income and asset\nreturns may be substantially riskier than they had come to believe during the Great Moderation.\nUnder these conditions, it's no surprise that credit is no longer available on the same terms. And\nit's no surprise that consumers have been paying off debt and building up savings in order to\nrestore some sense of balance to their household finances.\nThese developments have led consumers to be somewhat cautious in their spending behavior.\nOver the last three years, real consumer spending has increased at an annual rate of 2.2 percent.\nGiven the traumatic events in past few years, it strikes me as quite likely that consumer caution is\nnot a temporary headwind and is likely to be very persistent.\nBusinesses also appear to be quite cautious about their investment and hiring plans. A widely\nfollowed index of small business optimism averaged just over 100 during the Great Moderation\nand fell sharply during the recession. Since then it has only partially recovered and was 91.6 last\nmonth. Interestingly, when asked about the single most important problem they face, the most\nfrequent answer in the latest survey was “government regulations and red tape.” This result\naccords with reports that I have been hearing from business contacts for several years now. There\nappears to have been a substantial increase in the pace of regulatory change, which in itself\nseems to be limiting investment and hiring. Moreover, it appears that there is also greater\n2\n\n\funcertainty about the exact requirements of current regulations and the likely impacts of new\nregulations that are coming along. That uncertainty provides an additional reason for firms to\npostpone expansion plans.\nAdding to the uncertainty is the ongoing fiscal drama in Washington. Even with last January's\ntax increases and with the sequester holding down federal spending, the deficit was about 4\npercent of GDP for the 2013 fiscal year. That level is unsustainably high over the long run.\nMoreover, if you take into account the rising costs of medical entitlements and Social Security,\nit's clear that current federal budget plans are unsustainable over the long run. So at some point\nwe can expect some combination of a lower trajectory of federal spending than is given by\ncurrent law, or higher taxes. In the meantime, businesses and households are unsure about how\ntheir tax liabilities will evolve over time, and firms doing business with the federal government\nare uncertain about their prospects as well. Although it's hard to quantify, I believe this budget\nuncertainty is weighing on business hiring and investment decisions.\nSo far I've mentioned consumer spending and business investment, which together account for\nabout four-fifths of the economy. Residential investment is one area in which we have seen\nstrong growth. Last year, real residential investment increased by more than 15 percent, and so\nfar this year it has increased almost 14 percent at an annual rate. Despite that, however, housing\nmarket indicators, such as housing starts and new home sales, remain well below levels that\nmight be considered normal, so there seems to be room for residential investment to continue to\ngrow. But since this is only 3 percent of GDP, it has only a marginal effect on the overall\noutlook.\nGovernment spending has been weak recently, and my guess is that it will make little, if any,\ncontribution to GDP growth next year. And that leaves net exports, which for various reasons are\nalso likely to make little contribution to GDP growth next year. Adding up all these categories of\nspending yields a forecast for GDP growth next year of just a little above 2 percent — not much\ndifferent from what we've seen for the last three years.\nThat's my forecast for next year, but I believe it's important to look at the longer-run trend as\nwell. To do that, it's useful to do a little economic arithmetic — I promise this will be relatively\npainless. Real GDP is the total output of goods and services in the economy. We can break down\nreal GDP growth into two components. One is growth in the number of workers. The other is\ngrowth in the amount of output per worker, also known as productivity. Real GDP growth is just\nthe sum of productivity growth and the growth in the number of workers. It turns out that both of\nthese components have slowed since the Great Moderation.\nStarting first with productivity: From 1983 to 2000, productivity grew at a 1.8 percent annual\nrate. But toward the end of the Great Moderation, productivity growth slowed and over the last\nthree years, productivity has increased at a very modest 0.9 percent annual rate. There are two\nways to look at this, of course. The first is pessimistic — productivity growth is half of what it\nwas during the Great Moderation. The second perspective — the glass-half-full story — is that\nproductivity growth is continuing. This is important because productivity growth ultimately\ndrives the growth in real wages and incomes.\n\n3\n\n\fLooking ahead, forecasting trends in productivity growth is exceedingly difficult. Having said\nthat, it's hard to see why productivity growth would improve dramatically; there's no sign of a\nmajor surge of technical innovation in the pipeline, significant educational improvement or\nsubstantial deregulation — the kind of developments that would lead to major efficiency gains.\nBy the same token, it's hard to see why productivity growth would fall any further. The most\nlikely outcome, in my view, is more of the same, and thus my outlook is that productivity growth\nwill be about 1 percent for a considerable period.\nEmployment growth also has slowed since the Great Moderation. From 1983 to 2000,\nemployment increased at a 1.8 percent annual rate (as estimated in the survey of households).\nOver the last four years, employment growth has been 0.9 percent per year — so employment\ngrowth has fallen by half. An imminent acceleration in employment does not seem likely to me.\nPopulation growth is now only 0.8 percent per year. Moreover, much of that growth is in older\nworkers who are near traditional retirement benchmarks. The so-called “prime working age\npopulation” — those aged 25 to 54 — is barely growing at all. My longer-run view is that the\ngrowth rate of employment is likely to equal the growth rate of population, which is 0.8 percent\nper year.\nIn the short run, it is possible that employment growth will be above 0.8 percent as we continue\nto recover from the recession. But we should also recognize some impediments to rapid\nemployment growth. When the Affordable Care Act is fully implemented, it is likely to add to\nthe cost of hiring an additional worker for many businesses, and firms are still trying to figure\nout just how costly that will be. Also, I've been struck by the large number of accounts I've heard\nrecently about firms having difficulty finding workers with the appropriate skills, in many cases\nconstraining production.\nTo summarize then, I think that in the short run, we are likely to see real GDP growth of 2\npercent, or perhaps a bit higher. Over the longer run, we are likely to see growth average a bit\nbelow 2 percent.\nBefore I wrap things up, I'd like to make some brief observations on inflation and monetary\npolicy. First, it's important to recognize that inflation has been well-behaved over the last 20\nyears. Since 1993, inflation has averaged 1.92 percent, which is remarkably close to the Federal\nOpen Market Committee's goal of 2 percent. Second, we've seen some fluctuations in inflation\nover that time period, but they have all proven to be transitory. For example, inflation averaged\n2.8 percent over the three years ending in December 2007. I mention this because many people\nhave noticed that over the last 12 months inflation has only averaged 0.9 percent. My sense is\nthat inflation will move back toward 2 percent over the next year or two, in part because\nmeasures of expected inflation remain well contained. This is not a certainty, however, and I\nbelieve the FOMC will want to watch this closely.\nAnd that brings us to monetary policy, which has been particularly challenging of late. As you\nmay recall, the Fed reduced its target for the federal funds rate to essentially zero at the end of\n2008. Given the state of the economy, that was the appropriate response of monetary policy. But\nthat brings us face to face with what economists refer to as the zero lower bound. This refers to\nthe fact that it's generally not practical to reduce interest rates below zero. At times, we might\n4\n\n\fwish we could, though, because the interest rate that is relevant for most economic decisions is\nthe real, or inflation-adjusted, interest rate — the nominal interest rate minus the expected rate of\ninflation.\nWe should be clear that an interest rate near zero does not mean the Fed is paralyzed. By\npurchasing assets, we can increase the supply of monetary assets to the banking system, which in\nsome circumstances can have a stimulative effect. The Fed has purchased significant quantities\nof assets since the end of 2008. The size of our balance sheet has gone from $2.2 trillion to\naround $3.9 trillion, and it continues to increase by about $85 billion per month.\nThe key issue, in my view, is the extent to which the benefits of further monetary stimulus are\nlikely to outweigh the costs. Economic growth trends currently appear to be driven mainly by\npopulation growth and productivity growth, in which case monetary stimulus will only have\nlimited and transitory effects. But further stimulus does increase the size of our balance sheet and\ncorrespondingly increases the risks associated with the “exit process” when it becomes time to\nwithdraw stimulus. This is why I have not been in favor of the current asset purchase program.\nIn conclusion, I'd like to return to the theme with which I began. Yes, 2 percent growth is\ndisappointing relative to our experience during the period of the Great Moderation, and yes,\ngrowth may continue at a rate that is slower than in the past. But productivity is rising, incomes\nare growing, and innovation is occurring. Our institutions of higher learning are worldwide\nleaders in research and education, and they continue to attract exceptional students from abroad.\nOur markets remain flexible and resilient. The public policy problems we face may be difficult,\nbut they are certainly not insoluble. Consequently, when I take a broad view, I am fundamentally\noptimistic about our future.\n\n*An earlier version of this speech incorrectly stated the ratio of credit card debt to personal\nincome in 2007 as 5.5 percent. The text has been updated as of February 6, 2014 with the\ncorrect number, 8.0 percent.\n1\n\nI would like to thank Roy Webb for assistance in preparing these remarks.\n\n5\n\n\f",

        "content": "Statement\nSubcommittee on Regulatory Reform, Commercial and Antitrust Law\nof the Committee on the Judiciary\n\nDecember 3, 2013\nJeffrey M. Lacker\nPresident\nFederal Reserve Bank of Richmond\nThe Committee on the Judiciary\nRayburn House Office Building\nWashington, D.C.\n\nGood morning. I am honored to speak to the Subcommittee about the bankruptcy code and\nfinancial institution insolvency. In my remarks, I will discuss why I believe it’s so important to\nimprove our bankruptcy code to make it feasible to resolve failing financial firms in bankruptcy.\nAt the outset, I should say that my comments today are my own views and do not necessarily\nreflect those of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve or my colleagues at other Federal\nReserve Banks. My views have been informed by both my experience leading the Fifth Federal\nReserve District over the last seven years and as a research economist studying banking policy\nfor the prior 25 years.\nThe events of 2008 provided evidence, in my view, of glaring deficiencies in the way financial\ninstitution distress and insolvency are handled, particularly at large institutions. 1 The problem ―\nwidely known as “too big to fail” ― consists of two mutually reinforcing expectations. First,\nmany financial institution creditors feel protected by an implicit government commitment of\nsupport should the institution face financial distress. This belief dampens creditors’ attention to\nrisk and makes debt financing artificially cheap for borrowing firms, leading to excessive\nleverage. Moreover, it leads to overuse of types of borrowing — such as short-term wholesale\nfunding — that are more fragile and more likely to prompt the need for such protection. Second,\npolicymakers may well worry that if a large financial firm with a high reliance on short-term\nfunding were to file for bankruptcy under the U.S. bankruptcy code, it would result in\nundesirable effects on counterparties, financial markets and economic activity. This expectation\ninduces policymakers to intervene in ways that allow short-term creditors to escape losses, such\nas through central bank lending or public sector capital injections. This reinforces creditors’\nexpectations of support and firms’ incentives to grow large and rely on short-term funding,\nresulting in more financial fragility and more rescues.\nExpectations of creditor rescues have increased over the last four decades through the gradual\naccretion of precedents. Research at the Richmond Fed has estimated that one-third of the\nfinancial sector’s liabilities are perceived to benefit from implicit protection, based on actual\ngovernment actions and policy statements. 2 Adding implicit protection to explicit protection\n1\n\n\fprograms such as deposit insurance, we found that 57 percent of financial sector liabilities were\nexpected to benefit from government guarantees as of the end of 2011. This figure was about 45\npercent at the end of 1999.\nIn response to the experience of 2008, Title I of the Dodd-Frank Act laid out a planning process\nfor the resolution of failed financial institutions. A resolution plan, or “living will,” is a\ndescription of a firm’s strategy for rapid and orderly resolution under the U.S. bankruptcy code,\nwithout government assistance, in the event of material financial distress or failure. Among other\nthings, it spells out the firm’s organizational structure, key management information systems,\ncritical operations and a mapping of the relationship between core business lines and legal\nentities. The heart of the plan is the specification of the actions the firm would take to facilitate\nrapid and orderly resolution and prevent adverse effects of failure, including the firm’s strategy\nto maintain critical operations and funding. 3\nThe Federal Reserve and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation can jointly determine that a\nplan is “not credible” or would not facilitate an orderly resolution under the bankruptcy code, in\nwhich case the firm would be required to submit a revised plan to address identified deficiencies.\nA resubmission could include plans to change the business operations and corporate structure in\norder to eliminate deficiencies. If the Fed and the FDIC jointly determine that the revised plan\ndoes not remedy identified deficiencies, they can require more capital, increase liquidity\nrequirements or restrict the growth, activities or operations of the firm. In essence, regulators can\norder changes in the structure and operations of a firm to make it resolvable in bankruptcy\nwithout government assistance.\nIf there is a determination that, among other things, the firm’s failure under the U.S. bankruptcy\ncode would have serious adverse effects on “U.S. financial stability,” Title II of the Dodd-Frank\nAct gives the FDIC the ability, with the agreement of other financial regulators, to take a firm\ninto receivership. One difference between a Title II receivership and the bankruptcy code is that\nTitle II gives the FDIC the ability to borrow funds from the U.S. Treasury (specifically, the\nOrderly Liquidation Fund at the Treasury) to make payments to creditors of the failed firm or to\nguarantee the liabilities of the failed firm. 4 The funds are to be repaid from recoveries on the\nassets of the failed firm or from assessments against the largest, most complex financial\ncompanies.\nWhile the FDIC is to pay creditors no less than they would have received in a liquidation of the\nfirm, the Act provides the FDIC with broad discretion to treat similarly situated creditors\ndifferently. 5 This can encourage short-term creditors to believe they would benefit from such\ntreatment and therefore continue to pay insufficient attention to risk and invest in fragile funding\narrangements. Given widespread expectations of support for financially distressed institutions in\norderly liquidations, regulators will likely feel forced to provide support to these short-term\ncreditors to avoid the turbulence of disappointing expectations. This would replicate the two\nmutually reinforcing expectations that define “too big to fail.”\nClearly, the Dodd-Frank Act envisions bankruptcy without government support as the first and\nmost preferable option in the case of a failing financial institution, and for good reason, in my\nview. If resolution in bankruptcy without the expectation of implicit government guarantees\n2\n\n\fcomes to be expected as the norm, the incentives of market participants would be better aligned\nwith our public policy goal of a financial system that effectively allocates capital and risks. Large\nfinancial firms themselves would want to be less leveraged and less reliant on unstable shortterm funding. Institutions and markets would, accordingly, be more resilient in response to\nfinancial stress, and policymakers could credibly commit to forgo the creditor rescues that do so\nmuch damage to incentives.\nThe alternative to robust plans for resolution in bankruptcy is to institutionalize the capacity to\nprovide public sector rescues for financial firm creditors outside of bankruptcy, through Title II.\nThis would be a far less desirable path, I believe. Trying to correct these incentive distortions\nthrough the regulation of firm size, structure and capital is likely to fall short. This path thus\nwould fundamentally undermine the incentives of financial institutions and their creditors to plan\neffectively for Title I resolution. And it would continue to tilt financial innovation toward\nbypassing regulatory constraints and relying on the fragile short-term funding methods that are\nmost likely to elicit government protection. The result would be ever-increasing regulatory costs\nand repeated bouts of financial instability.\nReducing the probability that a large financial firm becomes financially distressed ― through\nenhanced standards for capital and liquidity, for example ― is useful, but will never be enough.\nThe path toward a stable financial system requires that policymakers have confidence in the\nunassisted failure of financial firms under the U.S bankruptcy code and that investors are thereby\nconvinced that unassisted bankruptcy is the norm. This is why I believe it is vitally important to\nensure our bankruptcy laws are well crafted to apply to large financial institutions.\nIn evaluating alternative approaches to insolvency and bankruptcy provisions, it would be a\nmistake to assume that the behaviors of financial firms and their creditors will remain\nunchanged. For example, I have stressed that the heavy reliance of large financial institutions on\nwholesale funding markets evolved under the growing expectation of public sector rescues, and\nis likely to depend sensitively on that expectation. In the absence of that expectation, firms and\ntheir creditors would have strong incentives to reduce reliance on fragile short-term funding.\nThis is relevant to the frequently heard claim that the large “liquidity needs” of failing financial\ninstitutions is a stumbling block to resolving such firms in bankruptcy. The U.S. bankruptcy code\nallows the bankrupt firm to obtain, subject to court approval, “debtor-in-possession,” or DIP,\nfinancing that is generally senior to pre-existing creditors. Such financing can be useful to fund\nongoing operations — for example, to pay off certain creditors, such as vendors, rather than\nretain them in bankruptcy proceedings. Other creditors often find it advantageous to approve DIP\nfunding, despite the dilution of their own claims, because it ensures the continuation of ongoing\noperations.\nThe point is that if repayment of short-term obligations in bankruptcy depends on large amounts\nof DIP financing that would be difficult for a financial institution to obtain, one would expect to\nsee less reliance on short-term credit (at least as long as government-provided DIP financing was\nnot expected to fill the gap). Moreover, an inability to fund necessary operations in bankruptcy is\nlikely to compromise the credibility of a Title I resolution plan. In this case, regulators would be\nwarranted to require less reliance on short-term funding in the first place.\n3\n\n\fThe FDIC’s authority to lend to distressed institutions under its Orderly Liquidation Authority\namounts to government-provided DIP financing. The beneficial feature of privately provided\nDIP financing is the presumption that, because it’s provided by market participants and approved\nby creditors and the court, it’s fairly priced and thus unsubsidized and does not unduly\ndisadvantage any particular class of creditors. Indeed, this is why unassisted bankruptcy is so\ncritical to ending “too big to fail” and why firms were instructed not to assume extraordinary\ngovernment support in their submitted resolution plans. Public sector support can be underpriced\nand distortionary, and can reallocate returns between creditor classes outside the procedural\nsafeguards of bankruptcy. Discretionary government provision of DIP financing would\nundermine the integrity and purpose of the bankruptcy code.\nSome recent proposals to address the “too big to fail” problem would make structural changes to\nfinancial firms ― imposing quantitative limits on their size or prohibiting certain risky activities.\nI am open to the notion that such restrictions may ultimately be necessary to achieve a more\nstable financial system, but I do not believe we have a strong basis yet for determining exactly\nwhat activity and size limits should be adopted. The living will process, however, should provide\nan objective basis for decisions about how the structure, financing or activities of large financial\nfirms need to be altered in order to assure orderly unassisted resolution. In addition, the process\nof writing credible living wills should illuminate efforts to identify ways in which the bankruptcy\ncode could be improved to make the resolution of financial firms more orderly. 6\nRobust and credible resolution plans will position us to wind down the Orderly Liquidation\nAuthority and other financing mechanisms, such as the Federal Reserve’s remaining 13(3)\npowers to lend in “unusual and exigent circumstances.” By allowing creditors to escape losses,\nsuch lending distorts incentives and exacerbates moral hazard. Eliminating the ability to provide\nad hoc support to firms in financial distress would cement our commitment to orderly unassisted\nresolutions in bankruptcy, thereby contributing to a more stable and competitive playing field.\n\n1\n\nThe inherent problems have been widely noted by economists going back decades before the crisis.

        "content": "Economic Outlook, December 2013\nDecember 9, 2013\nJeffrey M. Lacker\nPresident\nFederal Reserve Bank of Richmond\nCharlotte Chamber of Commerce Economic Outlook Conference\nCharlotte, North Carolina\n\nIt’s a pleasure to be with you today to discuss the economic outlook. For several years now, ever\nsince the Great Recession of 2008 and 2009, most forecasts of overall economic activity have\nfollowed a common script. They essentially have said that while growth has been modest\nrecently, the economy is likely to pick up speed in the next couple of quarters with the easing of\nheadwinds that have been temporarily restraining growth. My own forecasts have followed this\nscript (at least initially), as have those of a broad range of forecasters. Despite these optimistic\nforecasts, the reality has been more modest. Real GDP ― our broadest measure of overall\neconomic activity ― grew by 2.0 percent in 2011, 2.0 percent in 2012, and it looks like GDP\ngrowth this year will again be about 2.0 percent. Many forecasters are sticking to their scripts.\nThe latest Blue Chip compilation of economists’ projections, for example, calls for 2.8 percent\ngrowth in real GDP next year. As you may have guessed, I will share a different view in my\nremarks today. But before I begin, I should make clear that the views expressed are my own and\nshould not be attributed to any other person in the Federal Reserve System. 1\nA growing number of economists have taken on board the disappointing forecasting record of the\nlast few years and have come to believe that growth is more likely than not to remain low over\nthe next few years. A bit of background helps explain the forecasting disappointments of the last\nseveral years: Before the Great Recession, we came to enjoy a period known as the Great\nModeration. From 1983 to 2007, real GDP grew at an average annual rate of 3.3 percent. Over\nthat 24-year period, we experienced only two short, shallow recessions that together lasted only\nfive quarters. Real personal income kept pace with GDP, also growing at a 3.3 percent annual\nrate. And consumer spending advanced even more rapidly than income, growing at a 3.6 percent\nannual rate. Part of the reason consumer spending was able to grow more rapidly than income\nover that period was the rise in household wealth. Stock prices, bond prices and housing prices\nall increased significantly during the Great Moderation.\nDuring the Great Recession, GDP fell by 4.3 percent and payroll employment fell by 8.7 million\njobs. The scale and scope of loss of income and wealth experienced by American consumers was\nfar greater than anything seen in the previous 20 years.\n\n1\n\n\fGiven that experience, both households and lenders were bound to re-evaluate the riskiness\nassociated with indebtedness, reflecting a sense that income and asset returns would be\nsubstantially less certain than they had come to believe during the Great Moderation. Under\nthese conditions, it’s no surprise that credit is no longer available to consumers on the same\nterms. And it’s no surprise that consumers have been paying off debt and building up savings in\norder to restore some sense of balance to their household finances.\nThese developments appear to have led to a persistent cautiousness in household spending\nbehavior. Over the last three years, real consumer spending has increased at an annual rate of 2.0\npercent. Given the traumatic events of the past few years, it seems quite likely that consumer\ncaution is not a temporary headwind.\nBusinesses also appear to be quite reticent to hire and invest. A widely followed index of small\nbusiness optimism fell sharply during the recession and has only partially recovered since then.\nInterestingly, when asked about the single most important problem they face, the most frequent\nanswer in the latest survey was “government regulations and red tape.” This result accords with\nreports that we’ve been hearing from business contacts for several years now. There has been a\nsubstantial increase in the pace of regulatory change, and a substantial increase in uncertainty\nabout the exact shape of anticipated new regulations. That uncertainty provides an additional\nreason for firms to postpone expansion plans. The disorderly implementation of the Affordable\nCare Act is also likely to be dampening businesses’ willingness to expand.\nAdding to the uncertainty is the ongoing fiscal drama in Washington. Even with last January’s\ntax increases and with the sequester holding down federal spending, the deficit was about 4\npercent of GDP for the 2013 fiscal year. That level is unsustainably high over the long run.\nMoreover, if you take into account the rising costs of medical entitlements and Social Security,\nit’s clear that current federal budget plans are unsustainable over the long run. So at some point\nwe will see a combination of reduced federal spending growth, higher taxes or both. In the\nmeantime, businesses and households will be unsure about how their tax liabilities will evolve\nover time, and firms doing business with the federal government will be uncertain about their\nprospects as well. Although it’s hard to quantify, I believe this budget uncertainty is also\nweighing on business hiring and investment decisions.\nSo far I’ve mentioned consumer spending and business investment, which together account for\nabout four-fifths of the economy. Residential investment is one area in which we have seen\nstrong growth. Last year, real residential investment increased by more than 15 percent, and so\nfar this year it has increased at a 13 percent annual rate. Despite that, however, housing market\nindicators, such as housing starts and new home sales, remain well below levels that might be\nconsidered normal, so there seems to be room for residential investment to continue to grow. But\nsince this is only 3 percent of GDP, it has only a marginal effect on the overall outlook.\nOverall government spending has been weak recently, and, given continuing fiscal pressures,\nthat category is likely to make little, if any, contribution to GDP growth next year. That leaves\nnet exports, which for various reasons are also likely to make little contribution to GDP growth\nnext year. Adding up all these categories of spending yields a forecast for GDP growth next year\n\n2\n\n\fof just a little above 2 percent ― not much different from what we’ve seen for the last three\nyears.\nThat’s my forecast for next year, but when thinking about growth prospects, I believe it’s\nimportant to keep an eye on longer-run trends as well. To do that, it’s useful to break down real\nGDP growth into the sum of the growth in productivity ― that is, output per worker ― and the\ngrowth in the number of workers. It turns out both of these components have slowed since the\nGreat Moderation.\nStarting first with productivity: From 1983 to 2000, productivity grew at a 1.8 percent annual\nrate. But toward the end of the Great Moderation, productivity growth slowed, and over the last\nthree years, productivity has increased at a very modest 1.0 percent annual rate. Forecasting\ntrends in productivity growth is exceedingly difficult. Having said that, it’s hard to see why\nproductivity growth would improve dramatically in the near term; there’s no sign of a major\nsurge of technical innovation in the pipeline, significant educational improvement or substantial\nderegulation ― the kind of developments that would lead to a major acceleration in productivity.\nBy the same token, it’s hard to believe productivity has hit some sort of plateau. It doesn’t take\nmuch digging to find examples of continued innovation in today’s economy, even if it hasn’t\ngenerated the rapid aggregate productivity growth we saw during the Great Moderation. The\nmost likely outcome, in my view, is more of the same, and thus my outlook is that productivity\ngrowth will be about 1 percent for a considerable period.\nEmployment growth also has slowed since the Great Moderation. From 1983 to 2000,\nemployment increased at a 1.8 percent annual rate (as estimated in the survey of households).\nOver the last four years, employment growth has been just 1.0 percent per year ― so\nemployment growth has fallen by almost half. An imminent acceleration in employment does not\nseem likely to me. Population growth is lower now than before. Moreover, the fraction of the\nworking age population that is employed or looking for work ― economists call this the labor\nforce participation rate ― has been declining due to demographic shifts and other structural\nfactors. Also, I’ve been struck by the large number of accounts I’ve heard recently about firms\nhaving difficulty finding workers with the appropriate skills, in many cases constraining\nproduction. It appears as if the nature of current technological advances may be shifting the mix\nof requisite workforce skills more rapidly than in the past.\nBefore I wrap things up, I’d like to make some brief observations on inflation and monetary\npolicy. First, it’s important to recognize that inflation has been well-behaved over the last 20\nyears. Since 1993, inflation has averaged 1.9 percent, which is remarkably close to the Federal\nOpen Market Committee’s goal of 2 percent. Second, we’ve seen some fluctuations in inflation\nover that time period, but they have all proven to be transitory. For example, inflation averaged\n2.8 percent over the three years ending in December 2007. I mention this because many people\nhave noticed that over the last 12 months inflation has only averaged 0.7 percent. My sense is\nthat inflation will move back toward 2 percent over the next year or two, in part because\nmeasures of expected inflation remain well contained. This is not a certainty, however, and I\nbelieve the FOMC will want to watch this closely.\n\n3\n\n\fAnd that brings us to monetary policy, which has been particularly challenging of late. As you\nmay recall, the Fed reduced its target for the federal funds rate to essentially zero at the end of\n2008. Given the state of the economy, that was the appropriate monetary policy response. Since\nthen, the Fed has purchased a significant quantity of assets, which increases the supply of\nmonetary assets to the banking system and in some circumstances can have a stimulative effect.\nThe size of our balance sheet has gone from $2.2 trillion to around $4.0 trillion, and it continues\nto increase by about $85 billion per month.\nWhen the FOMC meets next week, I expect discussion about the possibility of reducing the pace\nof asset purchases. The key issue, in my view, is the extent to which the benefits of further\nmonetary stimulus are likely to outweigh the costs. Economic growth trends currently appear to\nbe driven mainly by population growth and productivity growth, in which case monetary\nstimulus will only have limited and transitory effects. But further stimulus does increase the size\nof our balance sheet and correspondingly increases the risks associated with the “exit process”\nwhen it becomes time to withdraw stimulus. This is why I have not been a supporter of the\ncurrent asset purchase program.\nIn conclusion, I’d like to return to the theme with which I began. Yes, 2 percent growth is\ndisappointing relative to our experience during the period of the Great Moderation, and yes,\ngrowth may continue at a rate that is slower than in the past. But productivity is rising, incomes\nare growing and innovation is occurring. Our institutions of higher learning are worldwide\nleaders in research and education, and they continue to attract exceptional students from abroad.\nOur markets remain flexible and resilient. The public policy problems we face may be difficult,\nbut they are certainly not insoluble. Consequently, a broad perspective suggests a fundamentally\noptimistic view about our future.\n1\n\nI would like to thank Roy Webb for assistance in preparing these remarks.\n\n4\n\n\f",
