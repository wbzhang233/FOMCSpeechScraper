Visit the event page to learn more and register.\nSince last March, when schools started shutting down and transitioning to remote learning,\nwe’ve been worried about students losing touch with the educational system. Those\nconcerns now appear to have been well founded. While we don’t yet have data at the\nnational level, most states have reported declining public school enrollment in the fall of\n2020. In addition, students who are enrolled may be less engaged, and we’ve also seen a\ndecline in the number of students making the important jump from high school to college:\nThe pipeline to higher education, and thus to the workforce, is leaking.\nHere in Virginia, for example, 45,000 fewer students were enrolled in public school than in\nthe fall of 2019, a 3.5 percent drop. (Declines have been similar in other states in our\nDistrict.) More than 18,000 of those students—40 percent—would have been in pre-K or\nkindergarten. This could re�ect parents opting for other schooling options, such as private\nschool or home school, or deciding to delay kindergarten enrollment for a year. But it may\nbe that some kids are missing out on a necessary year of school altogether. This decline in\nour youngest students is especially concerning, as we know from a large body of research\nthat early learning is critical to lay the foundation for education later in life. And in Virginia,\npublic pre-K is available to children from low-income families or to children who have\nspecial needs—the same children who may have di�culty accessing other schooling\noptions.\nOther data also suggest that students are less engaged in learning than they were prior to\nthe pandemic, particularly low-income students. Economists at Harvard University’s\nOpportunity Insights have been tracking students’ participation in a widely used online\nmath course that is typically paired with classroom instruction. Nationwide, between\nJanuary and December 2020, this participation declined 20 percent for low-income students\ncompared to just 2 percent for high-income students.\n\n\fIn a recent national survey, teachers and educators from pre-K to 12th grade reported that\nthey expect 16 percent of their students to receive failing grades at the end of this\nsemester, compared to 9 percent a year ago. There’s a large gap in expectations according\nto income—21 percent of students in high-poverty schools were expected to fail, versus 8\npercent in lower-poverty schools.\nThese expectations have already become reality in Chester�eld County, just outside\nRichmond. In 2020, more than 17 percent of the county’s high school students, and 12\npercent of middle school students, failed at least two courses. In 2019, the shares were 9.2\npercent and 4.8 percent.\nThe increase in students feeling disengaged from school could be contributing to the\ndecline in students enrolling in college. Last fall, the number of students who transitioned\ndirectly from high school to college fell 22 percent compared to the fall of 2019—and once\nagain, the decline has disproportionately been among students from lower-income\nbackgrounds. At low-income and high-poverty schools, around 30 percent fewer students\nwent to college right after high school graduation, compared to about 17 percent fewer\nstudents from high-income and low-poverty schools.\nWhile enrollment declined across all institution types, community college enrollment has\nbeen hit particularly hard. Direct-from-high-school enrollment fell more than 30 percent at\ncommunity colleges, compared to 14 percent at public four-year colleges. And community\ncollege enrollment by students of all ages fell 10 percent, compared to 2.5 percent for\ncolleges overall. The drop has been especially large in �elds where we hear from employers\nthat they’re having trouble �nding workers, such as precision manufacturing and the skilled\nconstruction trades. This is particularly troubling because community colleges are the �rst\ncollege experience for many low-income students, and can be a stepping stone to a fouryear degree—and the higher earnings that come with it. Community colleges also provide\nthe skills people need to land good jobs, including certi�cate programs that can deliver new\nskills in a relatively short period of time.\nSome of these students may eventually enroll—but research suggests that if students don’t\nstart college right out of high school, they are much less likely to ever go back. It is crucial\nthat we not lose focus on the impact this pandemic is having—and will continue to have—\non our nation’s students.\nWill that impact continue to fall most heavily on students from disadvantaged backgrounds\n—and if yes, what are the long-term consequences? What are the downstream e�ects for\nour future workforce and economy? And what will be the implications of looming state\nbudget de�cits on already-stretched education budgets? What solutions can shore up our\npost-COVID pipeline to the workforce?\nTo address some of these questions, the Richmond Fed is hosting a series of six\nconversations with economists, educators and policymakers about the challenges facing\nstudents and schools, and innovative solutions —inside the classroom, outside the\n\n\fclassroom and in transition to the workforce.

        "content": "Home / News / Speeches / Thomas I Barkin / 2021\n\nAs the COVID-19 vaccine rolls out across the United States, it �nally seems timely to think\nabout the economy getting back to “normal.” But what will normal be in an o�ce\nenvironment? The answer doesn’t just matter for individuals and companies—it has\nimplications for our future labor force.\nMany workers who have been able to do their jobs from home feel they have been every\nbit as productive as they were in the o�ce, with the added bonus of reduced commuting\ncosts and less time away from family. (Many people, of course, have not been so fortunate\nas to work from home, as I discussed in an essay last spring.) At the same time, employers\n(and employees) may feel that remote work limits their ability to build culture, provide realtime mentoring, and foster innovation. Those of us who love our “work families” miss those\nconnections and don’t want that social fabric to fray.\nMost �rms are exploring a more �exible “hybrid” model that combines in-person and\nremote work. On the surface, it should work—after all, we already knew how to operate in\nperson, and now we know how to manage virtually. But combining them presents a whole\nnew set of questions.\nTo illustrate, remember what it was like to be in a group meeting with only one or two\npeople on the phone or on video. Which relationships are being reinforced in casual\nconversations before the meeting? Are the people in the room, who can read the subtle\ncues of body language in real time, able to dominate the discussion? What stories are being\ntold in the halls after the o�cial meeting is over? Longer term, do opportunities get\ndisproportionately allocated to the people who are present and therefore “top of mind”?\nDo the people who remain onsite forget about—or even resent—those who are home?\nMany salespeople have been able to work from home successfully. But this is a time when\neveryone is remote and customers are discouraging in-person contact. How will a\nsalesperson (or sales manager) react the �rst time a customer chooses a competitor who\nwas physically present building a relationship? On the �ip side, if he or she wants to travel\n\n\fto renew relationships at an industry conference, what will the “lower-travel” hybrid model\npermit?\nHow robust are human resource policies to a hybrid model? If a company pays di�erently\nby location, how will it handle employees working remotely from lower-cost cities? If a\ncompany values its employees living locally, how will it enforce that? Will remote employees\nbuild the personal relationships that make them loyal to their employer? Could they be\npoached by employers in higher-wage locations?\nAnd what does all this mean for o�ce space—not to mention for the many servicepeople\nwhose livelihoods depend on the concentration of o�ce workers?\nCompanies still have a lot to �gure out. Drawing on conversations with executives across\nthe Richmond Fed’s Fifth District and my own experience, I o�er a few suggestions.\nFirst, companies will need to explicitly de�ne and communicate the value proposition of inperson work—and then make that value proposition a reality. This means balancing (or\nrebalancing) the interests of the institution and its people. It means creating a positive\nenvironment for people to enhance their skills and advance their careers. It means\ninspiring people with connectivity, innovation and development, and translating these\nelements into the company’s objectives.\nSecond, they need to make the rules of the road clear. What is the minimum in-person\nrequirement? What can employees expect of one another? Most of the major consulting\n�rms, who operate largely remote workforces, have found that mandating certain days\n(e.g., every Friday) in the o�ce is critical to building networks and culture. That can require\nexplicit investment—the same consulting �rms also �nd it valuable to program those days\nto ensure that employees attend and �nd their time well spent.\nThird, onboarding and integration will need a rethink. With fewer co-workers on site, the\nchallenge of inculcating new employees into a company’s culture increases. Companies\nmay need to think much more tactically about assimilation and development, for example\nby investing in personal training or assigning mentors and sponsors.\nFourth, a remote connectivity model needs its own set of management practices.\nCompanies with experience in hybrid models operate di�erently. During meetings, they\nexplicitly ask for input from those not in the room. They use pulse surveys to stay attuned\nto morale. Managers reach out proactively rather than waiting for someone to wander into\ntheir o�ce. Teams commit to rituals, such as meals or regular check-ins, to stay connected.\nFinally, all must accept that not every job can be done the same way. Relationship-oriented\nsalespeople may need to be in front of customers, while subject matter experts may be\nable to get more done remotely. Some managers may need to be on-site, while others\ndon’t.\nInvestments in connectivity and training can be costly. But there are huge potential savings\non real estate that could be reinvested in the networks that make the “work family”\n\n\ffunctional.\nA move to hybrid could have meaningful ripple e�ects on the economy. The more �exible\narrangements that come with hybrid could bring more people into the workforce and help\no�set the recent slowdown in women’s labor force participation. Job matching could\nimprove as well, as opportunities open beyond one’s current geography and individuals\n�nd a broader market for their skills. Two-career couples may �nd new opportunities easier\nto navigate. The ability of people to live anywhere could help spur investment in\nbroadband in areas that have struggled to connect.\nAccess to the broader pool of remote talent should also a�ect wages, as suggested earlier.\nIt could relieve wage pressure in the highest-cost cities, more than o�setting wage\nincreases in lower-cost communities. This is very much in line with economic theory on the\ne�ects of declining trade barriers.\nBefore the Industrial Revolution, home and work were deeply intertwined. Then, with the\nrise of factories and o�ces, we separated work from home. Living standards improved and\neconomic growth accelerated. But did we lose anything when we made our personal lives\nso separate from our “work”? Does modern technology mean we can have the best of both?\nI don’t know the answer to that question. But a �exible, hybrid work model is coming. We\nhave a lot to learn about it—and a lot of opportunities to look forward to.\n\nEmployment and Labor Markets\n\nProduction and Investment\n\nReceive an email noti�cation when News is posted online:\nBy submitting this form you agree to the\n\nEmail Address\n\nSubscribe\n\n\f(804) 697-8956\n(804) 332-0207 (mobile)\n\n© 1997-2024 Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond\n\n\f",

        "content": "Home / News / Speeches / Thomas I Barkin / 2021\n\nThe new administration has signaled its intent to propose an infrastructure program. That\nis good. We need investment in our country’s infrastructure. Our roads and bridges are\nlong overdue for repairs. We lag behind other countries in high-speed transit and the shift\nto renewable energy. We have far too many schools and hospitals that need updating. And\ntoo many students in small towns and inner cities have been set back by their lack of\nbroadband, worsening the educational disparities that existed even before the COVID-19\npandemic.\nSupporters of a large infrastructure bill also point to the potential to create millions of jobs\n—a critical priority, given there are currently 9.6 million fewer jobs in our economy than\nthere were a year ago. Jobs were also the focus of the 2009 infrastructure bill, passed at a\ntime when the housing market had crumbled, the rust belt was in turmoil, and millions of\nmanufacturing and construction workers were on the streets. But are the people who are\nout of work today the same ones ready and able to work as wind turbine technicians,\ncement masons, or �ber optic line workers?\nIn the near term, the answer is probably no.\nThe U.S. economy doesn’t have enough production workers or skilled tradespeople. That\nwas true before the pandemic, and it remains true today. As I talk with community and\nbusiness leaders throughout the Richmond Fed’s Fifth District, this is a constant refrain. In\nHickory, N.C., furniture manufacturers are struggling to hire enough sta� to meet demand.\nIn South Carolina’s PeeDee region, I’ve heard from companies that can’t �nd enough\nwelders and maintenance technicians. With the housing market so robust, carpenters,\nplumbers and electricians are scarce. Truckers are hard to �nd anywhere.\nThat’s a big shift from the last downturn. This time, home construction and renovation are\nbooming. Many manufacturers are prospering, as consumers spend money they would\nhave spent on travel or restaurants on appliances and patio furniture.\nThis time, the unemployed are disproportionally personal contact service workers like\n\n\frestaurant servers, retail clerks and housekeepers. These jobs require a very di�erent skill\nset and occur in a very di�erent environment than manufacturing and construction jobs.\nIt’s easy to see why someone would be unable—or unwilling—to move from waiting tables\nin an urban restaurant to working the third shift at a manufacturing plant far outside the\ncity. And one can imagine why someone would hesitate to take the time to acquire the skills\nthey need for such work. Maybe they’re getting by on the support they’ve received from\n�scal and forbearance programs, have reduced their own spending, and are hoping that\nthe proximity of a vaccine will bring back their former jobs. Maybe they are worried\ninfrastructure jobs won’t last beyond the pandemic, or beyond the coming legislation.\nIn so many ways, including racial inequality, educational attainment and child care, the\npandemic has laid bare preexisting problems. And we see it again: We have to recognize\nthat we have underinvested in our infrastructure workforce as much as we have\nunderinvested in infrastructure. Companies have cut back on training. Schools have cut\nback on technical pathways. Parents and guidance counselors, aware that many of these\nsectors have been challenged, have been pointing students elsewhere. The decline in\nimmigration has reduced the number of �rst generation skilled tradespeople.\nWe need to address this underinvestment. The coming infrastructure bill needs to include\nfunding for signi�cant e�orts to create more infrastructure workers. It should also focus its\ninvestments in areas where employment can be sustained once the stimulus spending has\nbeen completed. Examples of initiatives that could make a di�erence include:\n. For example, students can’t\n\n•\n\nuse Pell Grants to pay for workforce training or credential programs. The same is true\nfor many state scholarship programs funded by lotteries. But certi�cate programs,\ngenerally o�ered at community colleges, are a relatively low-cost way to quickly train\nthe next generation of infrastructure workers—we need to make it easier for students\nto pay for them and for community colleges to o�er them. I was encouraged by\nVirginia’s recent move to use $30 million in CARES Act funding to provide scholarships\nfor credential programs in high-demand �elds such as skilled trades.\n. While a growing number of employers have\n\n•\n\ndeveloped apprenticeship programs in recent years, they are still relatively rare in the\nUnited States. But they o�er numerous bene�ts to both workers and employers, as\nFifth District �rms such as Rolls-Royce Crosspointe, Bosch and BMW have found.\n. Not only can these\n\n•\n\nworkers help us deliver on necessary infrastructure projects, but they can also help us\ngrow our workforce—and thus our economy—at a time when demographic trends are\notherwise working against us.\n•\n\n. For example, even before the pandemic, many states\nwere facing training and testing backlogs for commercial drivers, a relatively wellpaying occupation for a worker without a college degree. The closure or limited hours\nof state motor vehicle departments has only made the problem worse.\n\n\fThese are only a few of the possible levers, and the solutions may di�er by state or by the\nneeded skills. But for our country to get the full bene�t of an increased investment in\ninfrastructure, we need to fully take on—in concert—an increased investment in our\nworkforce.\n\nEmployment and Labor Markets\n\nProduction and Investment\n\nReceive an email noti�cation when News is posted online:\nBy submitting this form you agree to the\n\nEmail Address\n\nSubscribe\n\n(804) 697-8956\n(804) 332-0207 (mobile)\n\n© 1997-2024 Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond\n\nFiscal Policy\n\n\f",

        "content": "Home / News / Speeches / Thomas I Barkin / 2021\n\nCredit Suisse Asian Investment Conference 2021 (virtual)\n\n• A year ago, the economy was on the edge of a cli�. With the help of �scal and\nmonetary support, we are moving toward recovery.\n• Despite improvements in the economy since last year, this downturn could leave\nlasting scars. Policymakers have the ability to limit this damage.\n• Many primary caregivers dropped out of the labor force to care for children and\nelderly relatives during the pandemic. Policymakers should focus on programs that\nhelp caregivers return to work.\n• The shift to remote learning could in�ict lifelong losses on students with limited\naccess to computers and fast broadband at home. Schools need resources to safely\nreturn to teaching in person. Support to help students catch up can prevent\ntemporary disruptions from turning into permanent scars.\n• The pandemic has hit small businesses particularly hard. Policies providing support\nfor the companies of today should take care not to hinder the creation of the\ncompanies of tomorrow.\n\nThis speech also was delivered March 22, 2021, to the 37th Annual NABE Economic Policy\nConference of the National Association for Business Economics.\nIt has been quite a year. Had I been with you 12 months ago, we would have been in the\nmidst of an unprecedented economic shutdown. Equity markets had just dropped 30\npercent. Bond markets were in trouble. Even investment grade credits were struggling to\nroll over their commercial paper. More than 700,000 people lost their jobs last March,\nfollowed by another 20 million in April. Our economy was on the edge of a cli�, and no one\nknew what was on the other side.\n\n\fFiscal and monetary policy responded with overwhelming force. The Fed stepped up early\nand powerfully. We took our policy rates to zero in mid-March and worked to repair\n�nancial markets through our balance sheet, purchasing $1.7 trillion of Treasurys and\nmortgage-backed securities in March and April. We also relaunched a number of Great\nRecession-era emergency lending facilities to backstop speci�c bond markets.\nCongress acted decisively as well. Through multiple �scal packages, it supported those who\nlost their jobs as well as small businesses and industries at risk. To put the magnitude of\nthis �scal response in perspective, the nearly $4 trillion in federal relief spending during this\ncrisis is more than four times the size of the 2009 American Recovery and Reinvestment\nAct. And more is on the way.\nWith this support, the economy has come most of the way back. GDP was down 2.4 percent\nin the fourth quarter compared to a year ago. Our recovery has outpaced the rest of the\nworld with the exception of Asia. Despite 9.5 million job losses, the impact of policy on the\neconomy is quite visible:\n• Aggregate disposable income has gone up, not down.\n• Households have increased their savings and paid down their credit cards.\n• Bank portfolios have remained healthy, given all the support to individuals and\nbusinesses.\n• The housing market has been strong, in part thanks to low interest rates.\n• Increased savings have fueled a shift in spending from services to goods, which has\nhelped manufacturers.\n• And the worse o� have bene�tted from stimulus checks, enhanced unemployment\nbene�ts and forbearance.\nThat said, spending has come back faster than employment. Until recently, job losses on a\npercentage basis exceeded those seen at the depths of the Great Recession. The economy\nstill has 6.2 percent fewer jobs than in February 2020.\nStill, I am hopeful that we are on the brink of completing the recovery. Vaccines are rolling\nout, and case rates and hospitalizations are falling. Excess savings and �scal stimulus\nshould help fund pent-up demand from consumers freed by vaccines and warmer\nweather.\nAs we look toward better days, I want to talk about the potential for scarring. Before I say\nmore, the views I express are my own and not necessarily those of my colleagues on the\nFederal Open Market Committee or in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nAs my audience here knows, labor economists have something very speci�c in mind when\nthey use the term “scarring.” They are typically assessing how workers are persistently\nimpacted by a downturn. For example, those who graduate in a recession may start work at\nlower wages than cohorts who start their careers in an expansion, depressing their\n\n\fearnings for years. Those who lose their jobs during a recession can struggle to get rehired\nafter a lengthy period of unemployment.\nThe idea of hysteresis is related to scarring. It proposes that temporary shocks can have\npermanent e�ects on economic growth. But it can be hard to see the lasting impact of\ndemand shocks when looking at the economy as a whole. One of the Richmond Fed’s\neconomists has documented that in a recent paper. He and his co-author �nd no evidence\nof permanent damage to U.S. GDP from demand shocks over the last 60 years.\nStill, I believe that severe downturns can leave scars that, while not always permanent, take\na long time to heal. After the Great Recession, in regions that saw the biggest drop in\nhousing prices, employment remained at 2009 trough levels as late as 2018 and only\nrecovered because unemployed workers moved to seek opportunities elsewhere. Similarly,\nthe decline in manufacturing employment during the 2000s also resulted in a long period of\nelevated market detachment for less-educated, prime-age workers, particularly in the Rust\nBelt. While we did ultimately build toward a robust labor market, it took a decade after the\nGreat Recession ended to get there.\n\nThis time, we’ve had a sharper drop but also a quicker recovery. Perhaps we will see less\ndamage from long-term unemployment than during the Great Recession. Job losses this\ntime have also been heavily concentrated in high turnover occupations, such as\nhousekeepers and waiters. Even before the COVID-19 pandemic, these workers changed\njobs regularly. Workers displaced in these jobs may be able to more quickly transition to\njobs in similar industries, spending less time out of the labor market.\nThe increase in teleworking could also improve matching between workers and jobs\nrelative to what we saw in the last recession. Instead of becoming isolated in towns with\nfew opportunities, job seekers may be able to �nd new employment elsewhere, provided\nthey have the right skills and a reliable broadband connection.\nDespite these positives, I still worry we will see scarring, albeit in new places. COVID-19 has\nhit primary caregivers particularly hard. School and child care closures have put pressure\non parents. The data suggest that this pressure initially fell disproportionately on women.\nDespite some recovery, labor force participation for parents remains about 6 percentage\npoints below where it was prior to the pandemic. If parents who left the workforce don’t\nreturn, that would have long-term negative implications for our growth potential.\nSpeaking of schools, we also face potentially huge losses in human capital from the shift to\nremote education. The Richmond Fed has launched a six-part series on this topic, which\nyou might want to view. We know from decades of research that learning builds on itself.\nThat means that disruptions to schooling are likely to have lifelong consequences. In the\nFifth District, students outside of the suburbs are less likely to have access to computers\nand fast broadband at home, greatly impeding their ability to learn remotely. Students in\nlow-income neighborhoods are more likely to su�er persistent negative e�ects from the\n\n\fshift to remote learning, further widening the education gap that existed before the\npandemic.\nThe pandemic has also accelerated automation, boosting demand for contactless\ntechnology, online retail and telemedicine. As a result, we could see less demand for the\nlow-skill, personal contact jobs that today have higher unemployment. A recent paper\nsuggests that women may also be more exposed to this risk than men.\nOn the business side, this recession, like most, hit small businesses hardest. Larger\nbusinesses generally had the resources to navigate the pandemic. With fewer small\nbusinesses, we risk missing out on the game-changing productivity gains they often\ndeliver.\nTaking an even broader view of scarring, the pandemic has placed a unique strain on cities.\nMany people who used to work in downtown o�ces are home. City residents are afraid to\nget into crowded subways and elevators. City amenities (like theaters) are closed. History\nhas shown us that cities are incredibly resilient, having survived countless wars and\nplagues. So they might well recover. But there are already signs of migration from\ndowntowns to surrounding suburbs in the largest cities. If this shifts commerce from\ndowntown to the suburbs, what will that mean for the many service sector businesses and\nworkers in city centers? We risk scarring our urban platforms of collaboration and\ninnovation.\nThe pandemic also has strained our country’s �nances. On the policy side, the aggressive\n�scal response helped support a quicker recovery. But it has also fueled a record increase\nin federal debt: over $4 trillion last year. While there are no immediate signs of a U.S. debt\ncrisis, we should be wary of diminishing our �scal capacity to respond aggressively to the\nnext crisis. Europe’s overall �scal response to the current crisis has generally been smaller\nthan the United States’, and one could argue that has held their economies back.\n\nThe �rst, and obvious, step is to get the virus under control. Scarring—of workers,\nbusinesses and communities—should be much less in a world that is able to return to\nnormal (or something resembling normal) quickly versus one in which we are still afraid to\nget into an elevator. The priority now is getting vaccines distributed and safely reopening\nthe economy.\nIt is also well worth exploring targeted support for workers a�ected by this crisis. We\nshould pay special attention to programs that allow primary caregivers to return to work.\nThis includes support for child care, elder care and safely reopening schools. Research also\nsuggests that policies like the Earned Income Tax Credit can promote work and the\naccumulation of human capital.\nIn addition, the large number of displaced personal contact service workers need help\ntransitioning to new occupations. States can open up licensing and add instructors for indemand occupations such as nursing or commercial trucking. Funding from Pell Grants and\n\n\fstate lotteries could be freed for community college certi�cate programs.\nWe have to invest further in education. We’ve heard from educators throughout our district\nthat students are falling behind because of remote learning. And while schools are starting\nto reopen, many parents remain fearful of sending their children back. This is especially\ntrue for families of color, who have been so disproportionately harmed by the pandemic.\nMany students will need extra instruction and tutoring. Schools need the resources to\nsafely teach in person, so that parents feel con�dent allowing their kids to return. Perhaps\nthey need to �nd a way to leverage this summer to catch students up. Support for\neducation could help prevent temporary disruptions from turning into permanent scars.\nOn the business side, we will undoubtedly see sectors shrink and sectors grow. That is\nnatural. Now, on the other side of the pandemic, the objective may be less about support\nand more about letting market forces work. Preventing scarring may require taking special\ncare not to hinder the creation of the companies of tomorrow when trying to protect the\ncompanies of today.\nAs someone focused on the rural-urban divide for years, I might call out that small towns\nand inner cities face a common challenge: the lack of a�ordable broadband. This crisis has\ncrystallized the case for its universal deployment, and doing so may be the greatest lever\nfor revitalizing the residential part of inner cities and making small towns competitive in the\npursuit of jobs and talent. Our Bank has made this a research area of focus as well.\nAs I discussed at the beginning, �scal support has been critical to getting us on the path to\nrecovery. Once the economy is on stable footing again, it will be important to take steps to\nget our �scal house in order so we have the capacity to limit scarring the next time we have\na downturn. With the crisis behind us, we need to �nd the political will to bring our de�cits\nto sustainable levels. At the moment, the United States still seems to have �scal capacity.\nBut that is always the case until it isn’t.\nThe Fed is trying to do its part to limit scarring as well, through our new long-run policy\nframework. In our Fed Listens session, we heard from countless people who let us know\nthe least fortunate bene�ted from the historically strong labor market in 2019. We hope to\nsupport bringing more people in from the sidelines by maintaining accommodative\nmonetary policy so long as in�ation stays moderated.\nTo close, I would just reiterate that we will see scarring from this downturn, as always. But\nwe have in our control the ability to limit the unique damage of this one. I hope we will.\nThanks, and now I will open up to questions.\nThank you to Tim Sablik for assistance preparing these remarks.\nBenati, Luca, and Thomas A.

With the help of �scal and\nmonetary support, we are moving toward recovery.\n• As we look toward better days, it’s important we don’t lose sight of the long-standing\ndisparities the pandemic has exposed, including in education, connection to jobs,\naddiction and racial inequity.\n• It is well worth exploring targeted support for primary caregivers to return to work or\nto job retraining programs, and the large number of displaced personal contact\nservice workers need help transitioning to new occupations. Community colleges\nhave an important role to play.\n• We have to invest further in K-12 education, particularly in providing extra instruction\nand tutoring to students who have fallen behind in the virtual environment.\n• Investments in education, employment and connectivity should be made with an\nequity lens.\n• The Fed is trying to do its part to limit the increase in disparities from this pandemic\nthrough its new long-run policy framework.\n\nThank you very much for inviting me to speak with you today. It has been quite a year. Had\nI been with you a year ago, we would have been in the midst of an unprecedented\neconomic shutdown. Equity markets had just dropped 30 percent. Bond markets were in\ntrouble. Even investment grade credits were struggling to rollover their commercial paper.\nMore than 700,000 people lost their jobs last March, followed by another 20 million in April.\nOur economy was on the edge of a cli�, and no one knew what was on the other side.\nFiscal and monetary policy responded with overwhelming force. The Fed stepped up early\n\n\fand powerfully. We took our policy rates to zero in mid-March and worked to repair\n�nancial markets through our balance sheet, purchasing $1.7 trillion of Treasurys and\nmortgage-backed securities in March and April. We also relaunched a number of Great\nRecession-era emergency lending facilities to backstop speci�c bond markets.\nCongress acted decisively as well. Through multiple �scal packages, it supported those who\nlost their jobs as well as small businesses and industries at risk. To put the magnitude of\nthis �scal response in perspective, the $5.6 trillion in federal relief spending during this\ncrisis is roughly seven times the size of the 2009 American Recovery and Reinvestment Act.\nWith this support, the economy has come most of the way back. GDP was down 2.4 percent\nin the fourth quarter compared to a year ago. Our recovery has outpaced the rest of the\nworld with the exception of Asia. Despite 9.5 million job losses, the impact of policy on the\neconomy is quite visible:\n• Aggregate disposable income has gone up, not down.\n• Households have increased their savings and paid down their credit cards.\n• Bank portfolios have remained healthy, given all the support to individuals and\nbusinesses.\n• The housing market has been strong, in part thanks to low interest rates.\n• Increased savings have fueled a shift in spending from services to goods, which has\nhelped manufacturers.\n• And the worse o� have bene�tted from stimulus checks, enhanced unemployment\nbene�ts and forbearance.\nThat said, spending has come back faster than employment. Until recently, job losses on a\npercentage basis exceeded those seen at the depths of the Great Recession. The economy\nstill has 6.2 percent fewer jobs than in February 2020.\nStill, I am hopeful that we are on the brink of completing the recovery. Vaccines are rolling\nout, and case rates and hospitalizations are falling. If I could o�er an analogy, this recovery\nis a roller coaster. Every roller coaster has a pause before the �nal plunge into the\nunknown. For our economy, winter was the pause, and the �nal stretch should be\nsomething as excess savings and �scal stimulus fund pent-up demand from consumers\nexhausted from isolation and freed by vaccines and warmer weather.\nBut as we look toward better days, it’s important we don’t lose sight of the long-standing\ndisparities the pandemic has exposed and the opportunities we now to have to invest to\naddress them. Before I say more, I have to note that the views I express are my own and\nnot necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee or in the\nFederal Reserve System.\nIn the rest of my remarks today, I want to talk about three ideas. The �rst is how this\npandemic has disrupted multiple stories we’ve been telling about the economy for the past\nfew decades. The second is how it has exacerbated many of the core challenges our\n\n\fcountry faces. And �nally, I’ll share some ideas about where we can invest to help address\nthose challenges.\nSo which stories have been upended? The �rst is a trend you might have heard called\n“hollowing out,” which refers to growth in high- and low-income jobs at the expense of\nthose in the middle. But the pandemic targeted the low-end this time: It wiped out 37\npercent of low-wage jobs between February and April. There's been some recovery, but the\nlowest-wage jobs were still down 14 percent at the end of December, while higher income\njobs were actually up.\nThe second story is the triumph of cities: In recent decades, metro areas have seen higher\npopulation and employment growth than nonmetro areas. But the pandemic hit urban\nemployment harder, especially early on, since higher population density necessitated\nearlier and longer shutdowns, and because rural employment is more likely to be in\nessential industries like agriculture and food production. Now we’re also seeing rising\nvacancy rates. People are relocating to less expensive cities, or buying homes outside the\ncenter city, and they’re not being replaced by the typical in�ux of college students and\nyoung families. And what happens to the businesses and employees that depend on\ndowntown o�ce workers if those people keep working from home?\nThe third story that’s been turned on its head is the disparate e�ect of recessions on men.\nIn the previous three recessions, especially the Great Recession, men su�ered higher\nunemployment than women, as they were disproportionately represented in industries like\nmanufacturing and construction. But the COVID-19 recession hit women’s employment\nharder, both in job loss and in labor force participation, given their industry mix and the\nchallenges of schools, child care and elder care.\nThe pandemic has also exposed — and exacerbated — some core challenges our country\nhas been struggling to address. The �rst is education. For decades, a college degree has\nbeen a dividing line: College graduates tend to earn more money, accumulate more wealth\nand have better health. And during the pandemic, it’s been the line between having a job or\nnot.\nDuring the worst of the downturn last spring, employment for people without a college\ndegree fell almost 20 percent, compared to about 6 percent for people with a degree. And\ntoday, the unemployment rate is 7.2 percent for workers with only a high school diploma\nversus 3.8 percent for those with a bachelor’s degree. The latter are back at full\nemployment.\nLooking toward tomorrow, I think there is a real risk it will get worse. Virtual learning is\nleaving students behind, especially those who were already vulnerable. We see it in the\ndata, particularly in math, and it might be even worse than it seems because many\nstudents are missing from the data due to declining public school enrollment. Research\ntells us it's hard to get back the bene�ts of early education once it's lost. Back of the\nenvelope, our economists estimate that we could see a decline of 3.8 percent in the share\n\n\fof children with a high school degree and 2.7 percent in the share with a college degree —\nwhich adds up to huge losses in the future. We already see lower community college\nenrollment, which is especially concerning because that is often the pathway back into the\njob market.\nIn short, I’m worried about losing a generation of students and what that means not only\nfor them, but also for our society as a whole. On our website, you can watch a series of\ndialogues we are having with educators from around our district. The stories are\nheartbreaking.\nThe next issue that’s been underscored is the di�culty many people have connecting to\njobs. One challenge, of course, is broadband. The crisis has illustrated just how critical\nbroadband is for school, work, e-commerce and telehealth. As recently as 2019, nearly onethird of households still had no strong broadband connection.\nAnother is transportation. The less fortunate often don’t have a reliable way to get to work,\nwhether that's because public transit doesn't connect to the available jobs or because they\ndon’t have access to a car. And now, of course, mass transit and car-sharing present health\nrisks, so even if you could take a bus to work, maybe the risk just seems too great. Declining\nridership is already leading many major transit agencies to cut service, which suggests\nconnection could be even more di�cult in the future.\nA third issue is addiction. The opioid epidemic has been a crisis for years, and the pandemic\nis making things worse, as people struggling with addiction have been cut o� from family,\nfriends, support networks and medical providers. According to the Centers for Disease\nControl and Prevention, drug overdose deaths from June 2019 to May 2020 were the most\never recorded in a 12-month period.\nAnd there’s the issue that underpins so many others: racial inequity. The causes are\nnumerous and can be traced to our country’s painful history. The e�ects are numerous as\nwell, including higher unemployment and worse job losses during downturns, lower\neducational attainment, lower incomes, less wealth and poorer health. These have all been\nexacerbated by this crisis in ways that I fear will have long-term repercussions. For\nexample, blacks have died of COVID-19 at 1.4 times the rate of whites, and we see gaps in\nvaccinations too. Here in South Carolina, blacks make up about 26 percent of the\npopulation but only 15 percent of vaccinations. This disproportionate impact of the virus\nhas made many families of color reluctant to send their children back to in-person learning.\nThat’s a choice any parent understands, but it also means those children are at greater risk\nof falling behind.\nSo far I’ve talked about the problems. What about solutions? Where can we invest to make\nthings better? The �rst, and obvious, step is to get the virus under control. Pandemic\ndamage should be much less in a world that is able to return to normal (or something\nresembling normal) quickly rather than one in which we are still afraid to get into an\nelevator. The priority now is getting vaccines distributed and safely reopening the economy.\n\n\fThen we need to address employment. It is well worth exploring targeted support for\nprimary caregivers to return to work or to job retraining programs. This includes support\nfor child care, elder care and safely reopening schools. Employers can play a greater role,\nand we’ve seen some creative examples, like a hospital in West Virginia that’s o�ering a\nproctoring service for its employees’ children.\nIn addition, the large number of displaced personal contact service workers need help\ntransitioning to new occupations. States can open up licensing and add instructors for indemand occupations such as nursing or commercial trucking. Funding from Pell Grants and\nstate lotteries could be freed for community college certi�cate programs. Community\ncolleges can help students access wraparound services to address barriers such as housing\nand food insecurity, transportation, technology, child care and mental health.\nWe have to invest further in K-12 education. Many students need extra instruction and\ntutoring. Schools need the resources to safely teach in person so that parents feel\ncon�dent allowing their kids to return. Perhaps they need to �nd a way to leverage this\nsummer to catch up, as we heard from many educators during the second session of our\nDistrict Dialogues series.\nAnd this crisis has made it crystal clear that we need more investment in broadband. No\none should have to do their schoolwork in the parking lot of a McDonald’s, as I heard tell in\none small town. But more money isn’t the only answer. Our research has found that\nupwards of $20 billion has been allocated and not yet spent. The process is complicated\nand bureaucratic. I’m intrigued by the potential for navigational support to have a big\nimpact.\nI’ve left equity for last. In part, that’s because it is hardest to address, and in part it’s\nbecause investments in education, employment and connectivity should help us make\nprogress toward this goal. But we need to make these investments with an equity lens.\nTake vaccines, for example, a critical health lever. An equity perspective has reoriented\nlocalities toward marketing e�orts to overcome a historic lack of trust in many\ncommunities. It has led them to reexamine distribution points to ensure equal access. It\nhas led to models to reduce price as a barrier. Perhaps this method will be relevant in\nmultiple other settings.\nThe Fed is trying to do its part to limit the increase in disparities from this pandemic as well,\nthrough our new long-run policy framework. In our Fed Listens session, we heard from\ncountless people who let us know the least fortunate bene�ted from the historically strong\nlabor market in 2019. We hope to support bringing more people in from the sidelines by\nmaintaining accommodative monetary policy so long as in�ation stays moderated.\nTo close, I would reiterate that we will see damage from this downturn, as always. But we\nhave in our control the ability to limit the unique damage of this one. I hope we will.\nThanks, and now I look forward to your reactions and questions.\n\n\fThank you to Abigail Crockett and Tim Sablik for assistance preparing these remarks.\nJaison R.

        "content": "Home / News / Speeches / Thomas I Barkin / 2021\n\nIn the past year or so, Congress has passed the largest stimulus bill in American history —\ntwice. Almost $6 trillion has been allocated in response to COVID-19 to date, and at least\n$3.7 trillion has been disbursed or committed. These have been critical investments to help\nsmall businesses and unemployed workers get to the other side of this crisis.\nDespite this funding, we still hear from many people across our district that they are\nstruggling to pay the rent, feed their families, and stay connected to work and school —\neven though these are areas Congress has targeted. For example, $47 billion has been\nallocated speci�cally for emergency rental assistance, yet the Philadelphia Fed estimates\nthat the 1.8 million renter households in arrears still owe $11 billion in rent. And roughly\n$70 billion has been directed toward nutrition assistance, but 45 million people (including\n15 million children) were projected to face food insecurity in 2020.\nWhen it comes to broadband, between 18 million and 42 million people don’t have access\nto high-speed service. More than $13 billion has been made available during the pandemic\nto expand access and help people pay their bills, and the American Rescue Plan includes\nthe potential for up to $10 billion in additional investment. That’s in addition to the roughly\n$30 billion that had been dedicated to broadband before the pandemic. But our analysis\nsuggests that less than half of this prior funding has been distributed due to challenges\nwith application approvals, map de�nitions and the like. So we could see di�culties with\nthe latest rounds of funding as well.\nWhat is standing between the trillions of dollars in support and the people who need it?\nTalking with community leaders throughout our district, we’ve heard four key themes.\nWhether communities are working to provide short-time emergency aid (such as housing\nassistance) or long-term infrastructure (such as broadband), delivering the “last mile”\nrequires awareness, capacity, simpli�cation and alignment.\nThe �rst challenge is awareness: It’s hard to apply for help if you don’t know it exists. In a\nFebruary survey, for example, the rental management company Avail found that almost 48\n\n\fpercent of landlords and 69 percent of renters didn’t know government rental assistance\nwas available. And even people who are aware that programs exist might not know how to\n�nd a local program or how to apply. Similarly, many adults don’t know that there’s an\nemergency broadband bene�t coming to help them pay their internet bills. (Takeup has\nalso been quite low for the Federal Communication Commission’s (FCC’s) Lifeline subsidy\nprogram, which predates the pandemic.) The solutions to raise awareness don’t have to be\ncomplicated — but they require knowing who you’re serving and what they need. For\nexample, when we talked with Hispanic business and community leaders in Manassas, Va.,\nlast month, we heard that reaching immigrant populations has been especially challenging.\nProviding translation assistance and sharing information through trusted local groups can\ngo a long way.\nAnother challenge is that many communities don’t have the capacity — either in terms of\npeople or in terms of technology — to distribute funding. Looking again at rental\nassistance, state and local governments have been responsible for administering these\nprograms from beginning to end: getting the word out, determining eligibility, reviewing\napplications, distributing payouts and all the tasks in between. That’s a lot to do in a short\ntime, especially amid an unprecedented public health crisis. As a result, many local\ngovernments have partnered with nonpro�t organizations to increase their capacity and try\nto meet the demand, but these nonpro�ts are themselves trying to adapt their operations\nand increase their bandwidth.\nWe see similar challenges with nutrition assistance. The U.S. Department of Agriculture\n(USDA) has bought billions of dollars of produce, meat and dairy products from farmers\nwho have lost business due to closed schools and restaurants, and distributed the food to\nlocal food banks nationwide. But especially at the beginning of the pandemic, many food\nbanks didn’t have the logistical capacity — not to mention the storage space — to manage\nthe increase in supply and demand, and they’ve been racing to keep up.\nA little bit of money (at least relative to the stimulus) can go a long way, though. The Annie\nE. Casey Foundation provided $100,000 to hire a consultant to assist the City of Baltimore\nin developing and coordinating temporary rental assistance and enhanced eviction\nprevention programs with multiple city agencies. Collectively, these agencies will distribute\nmore than $40 million of CARES Act and other funding to support renter households\nexperiencing COVID-19-related income and job loss.\nCapacity was a challenge before COVID-19 as well. Take broadband funding, which is\ntraditionally distributed to local groups through grants from national entities, such as the\nFCC or the USDA. But applying for these grants is a complicated process and requires a\ncommunity to have the capacity to research eligibility — to understand and compete for\nvarious available grants, to fund technical support for successful proposals and\npartnerships, and to measure and record actual broadband access (or lack thereof). That’s\nwhy organizations like the Claude Worthington Benedum Foundation, which serves West\nVirginia and Southwest Pennsylvania, are so important. They provide grants to\n\n\fcommunities to help them �ll gaps in necessary technical support costs and federal match\nrequirements so they can develop the resources they need to take advantage of broadband\nfunding.\nThe third challenge we’ve heard is the complicated constraints that accompany government\nfunding. Of course, we want the government to be careful with our tax dollars, but\nstipulations about when and how the money has to be spent don’t always align with local\nneeds. For example, we’ve been talking with educators from throughout the region for our\nDistrict Dialogues series. One superintendent we spoke with shared that CARES Act funding\nhas been valuable to help pay for digital resources and other supplies but can’t be used for\noperations. So if the school district wants to extend the school day or provide extra tutoring\nto help students address pandemic-related learning loss, it has to take money from other\nplaces in its budget. Simplifying restrictions and giving local jurisdictions more autonomy\ncould help get the money to where it’s needed most.\nSo what does it take to increase awareness, build capacity and navigate complicated\nwaters? When we look at the success stories, the common theme is e�ective alignment\nthrough partnerships — nonpro�ts, local governments, and private companies pulling in\nthe same direction. Working together creates a sense of shared investment, shared cost,\nand enables groups to come up with more creative solutions. For example, in Virginia,\nCommonwealth Connect hosts regular calls between public and private entities to help\nthem be on the same page as advocates for broadband. This model allows groups with\ndi�erent focus areas and resources to clarify what funding is available, where the needs\nare, and which solutions are working. In Maryland, the Baltimore County government\nrecognized it didn’t have the capacity to implement an e�ective eviction prevention\nstrategy, so they engaged the United Way of Central Maryland to work with landlords.\nUnited Way is now talking with two other jurisdictions about replicating this arrangement.\nThe massive �scal support that’s been mobilized since last March helped prevent the U.S.\neconomy from falling o� a cli� and continues to support households and businesses. But\nCongress allocating funds is only the �rst step. Making real progress requires concentrated\nwork to raise awareness, build capacity, simplify processes and keep us marching in the\nsame direction.\nDivringi, Eileen, and Davin Reed. \"Household Rental Debt During COVID-19: Update for 2021.\"\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, March 18, 2021.\nScott, Marin. \"Going Into 2021, Renters and Landlords Are Still Hurting From COVID\nConsequences.\"Avail, March 17, 2021.\nIn a January 2021 survey, the Philadelphia Fed found that 22% of respondents had not\napplied for rental assistance because they were not sure how to and that 10% of respondents\nhad not applied because they believed there were no local programs.\n\n\f\"Advancing Racial Equity in Emergency Rental Assistance Programs,\" NYU Furman Center,\nMarch 2021.\n“COVID-19 Emergency Rental Assistance: Analysis of a National Survey of Programs,” NLIHC\nResearch Brief, January 2021.\n\nFiscal Policy\n\nSmall Business\n\nReceive an email noti�cation when News is posted online:\nBy submitting this form you agree to the\n\nEmail Address\n\nSubscribe\n\n(804) 697-8956\n(804) 332-0207 (mobile)\n\n\f© 1997-2024 Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond\n\n\f",

        "content": "Home / News / Speeches / Thomas I Barkin / 2021\n\nThe “she-cession” has been a dominant narrative of this pandemic. Unlike the Great\nRecession, which primarily a�ected male-dominated sectors such as manufacturing and\nconstruction, the COVID-19 recession disrupted the service sector, which employs more\nwomen. From February to April 2020, women’s employment fell 17.9 percent, compared to\n14.3 percent for men. More than 12 million jobs held by women went away, and school\nclosures and child care constraints further limited workforce participation for primary\ncaregivers who are disproportionately women. Employment of women of all ages, races\nand educational levels fell more than employment of men with similar backgrounds.\nBut, over the last several months, that overall gap has largely closed. As of the\nMay 2021 jobs report, employment for women and men was down 5 percent and 4.6\npercent, respectively — a di�erence of just a few tenths of a percentage point. But it’s\nimportant to note that not all women have recovered equally. And a new dichotomy has\nsurfaced by age.\nTo be clear, the employment recovery for\nwomen still trails the recovery of\nsimilarly educated men. For women with a high school diploma or less, employment is still\ndown more than 9 percent, compared to 5 percent for men with the same education. Black\nand Hispanic women have also seen a slow recovery. Compared to February\n2020, employment is still 7.4 percent lower for black women and 6.4 percent lower\nfor Hispanic women. But it’s down 4.1 percent for black men and 2.1 percent\nfor Hispanic men.\nMinorities and women with lower levels of education are more likely to work in low-wage\nroles with a high degree of personal contact, such as those in leisure and hospitality, that\nwere disrupted by the pandemic. As of 2019, 10.1 percent of women without a bachelor’s\ndegree worked in leisure and hospitality, compared to 8.4 percent of men without a\nbachelor’s degree. Almost 30 percent of women without a bachelor’s degree were\nemployed in service occupations, compared to just under 16 percent of their male peers.\n\n\fIn contrast, college-educated women are now actually\ntheir male peers —\ntheir employment in April 2021 was 2.1 percent higher than it was in February 2020,\ncompared to 0.8 percent lower for college-educated men. Part of the reason may again be\nsector mix. Nearly 50 percent of women with bachelor's degrees work in education and\nhealth care, sectors where employment has fared relatively well for college-educated\nworkers.\nThese employment di�erences by educational levels may well be driven by disparities in\ncircumstances. In a late 2020 study, 19 percent of adults with a high school degree had\nsomeone in their household who had substituted remote work for in-person work, versus\n62 percent of adults with a bachelor’s degree. Women not able to work remotely may well\nhave been more concerned about their health or less able to �nd an alternative\narrangement to support child care or remote schooling. Perhaps those concerns reduced\ntheir ability to participate in the workforce.\nAnother segment where women are now outperforming men is older workers. Employment\nis down 6 percent for men 55 and older, versus 5.5 percent for women the same\nage, compared to February 2020.\nThis comes amid a surge in retirement, which accounts for nearly 50 percent of the decline\nin overall labor force participation. And many of those retirements likely wouldn’t have\nhappened were it not for the pandemic: Excess retirements, meaning people who appear\nto have retired earlier than they otherwise would have, account for more than half of this\ndrop.\nWhy did the pandemic push people to retire? There are numerous potential explanations,\nincluding fear of exposure to the coronavirus, family responsibilities such as caring for\nelderly parents or grandkids, or �rm incentives like early retirement packages. Older\nworkers might also have been more hesitant about the steep learning curve associated\nwith remote work or about the challenge of training for a new position after a layo�. And\nfor workers with 401(k) accounts, the robust stock market may have made retirement more\n�nancially feasible.\nThese factors a�ect men and women equally, so they don’t explain why employment is now\nrecovering somewhat more strongly for women. As with educational di�erences, the\nanswer might be industry mix. Looking at job loss among older workers, the industries in\nwhich older women are the most concentrated — education and health — together fared\nbetter than the industries in which men are the most concentrated (professional and\nbusiness services, manufacturing, and wholesale and retail trade). But less visible factors\ncould also play a role. Older men on average are less healthy than women, and their\ncomorbidities could have given them higher vulnerability to COVID-19. This may have\nreduced their willingness to engage in the workforce during the pandemic.\nSo what’s ahead? As the service sector returns to normal, it’s likely that its recovery will help\nmany women make up lost ground. Family responsibilities should also become less of a\n\n\fbarrier, as schools and child care facilities reopen. Access to remote work may become an\nenabler of �exibility rather than employment.\nBringing retirees back might be more of a challenge. Historically, the likelihood of retirees\nreturning to the workforce has been very low. But maybe COVID-19 retirements will be\ndi�erent — perhaps, once wages grow and barriers such as health concerns or family\nresponsibilities disappear, retirees will be lured back to the labor force.\nWe may still see some scarring when we reach our new normal. This could take the form of\nskill mismatch for lower-wage workers and technology requirements for\nretirees. Research also shows that the longer someone is unemployed, the harder it is to\n�nd work, as both skills and relationships weaken with time.\nGrowing the economy means growing the workforce, and the Richmond Fed focuses on the\nevolving story of workforce engagement as we monitor progress toward maximum\nemployment. That in turn requires understanding employment success by demographic\nsegment and recognizing that the story changes over time. But one theme common to all\nour analyses is that our least educated citizens face major challenges, and the returns of\ninvesting in education are high. This pandemic has been no di�erent.\nAll calculations based on data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics via Haver and IPUMS-CPS.\nThe probability is 1.4 percent, according to Andreas Hornstein, Marianna Kudlyak, Fabian\nLange, and Tim Sablik, “Does the Unemployment Rate Really Overstate Labor Market\nRecovery ?” Richmond Fed Economic Brief no. 14-06, June 2014.\n\nEmployment and Labor Markets\n\nEducation\n\nReceive an email noti�cation when News is posted online:\nBy submitting this form you agree to the\n\n\fEmail Address\n\nSubscribe\n\n(804) 697-8956\n(804) 332-0207 (mobile)\n\n© 1997-2024 Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond\n\n\f",

        "content": "Home / News / Speeches / Thomas I Barkin / 2021\n\nGiven the historic job losses experienced during spring 2020, we might have expected wage\ngrowth to have slowed considerably during the pandemic. After all, nominal wage growth,\nas measured by the Atlanta Fed’s Wage Growth Tracker, declined in the wake of the Great\nRecession, falling from 4.5 percent in December 2007 to 1.8 percent in October 2010, and\nremained sluggish for years. But it has been heartening to see that during the COVID-19\nrecession, the decline in wage growth has not mirrored the scale of job loss. COVID-19\nbrought only a muted and brief decline. In February 2020, overall wage growth was 4\npercent. It hit its lowest point of the pandemic, 3.6 percent, by the end of the year. Wage\ngrowth in early 2021 has stayed near that level, �uctuating between 3.6 percent and 3.7\npercent.\nWhat cut the dive so short in comparison to the prior recession? I would point to three\nfactors: the concentrated nature of the downturn, the perception that it would be short in\nduration and the impact of the policy response.\nDamage to the economy was heavily concentrated in the service sectors, a�ecting primarily\nlow-skill workers. This stands in contrast to the Great Recession and its impact on\nmanufacturing, construction and �nance. As a consequence, downward wage pressure did\nnot ripple out much to workers overall. Low-skill wage growth did fall 0.7 percentage points\nbetween February 2020 and January 2021; at the same time, wage growth in middle- and\nhigh-skill occupations fell by only 0.1 and 0.2 percentage points, respectively.\nThe uncertainty of the pandemic also dampened its impact on wages. Early on, the\nshutdowns and job losses seemed temporary. Many were thinking in two-week timelines\nand therefore had little focus on adjusting wages even as short-term demand for labor\nplummeted. By the time the extended length of the disruption became obvious, Congress’\npolicy response had bolstered demand for labor. By supporting businesses through the\nPaycheck Protection Program and consumers through direct payments, policy helped\nmitigate downward pressure on wages as well.\n\n\fWe are now well into the recovery, and I hear businesses around the Richmond Fed’s Fifth\nDistrict say they are struggling to �nd workers. Basic supply and demand would suggest\nthat a scarcity of workers should lead to faster wage growth and indeed, it seems that every\nday you see another company announcing entry-level wage increases. But the data don’t\nyet show much rebound in overall wage growth; at 3.6 percent in April 2021, it remains\nnear its recent low and below pre-pandemic levels, not yet re�ecting the escalation that\nanecdotes prime us to expect.\nData limitations could be one factor; it might take time for recent announcements to be\nre�ected. Concentration again likely plays a role. The hiring challenges we’re hearing about\nare primarily for lower-skill jobs. Between January and April 2021, wage growth for low-skill\noccupations increased from 3 percent to 3.5 percent. In the same period, wage growth for\nmid-skill occupations declined 0.1 percentage points and was unchanged for high-skill\noccupations. Because of how the wage tracker is calculated, these increases at lower skill\nlevels have a muted e�ect on the overall numbers.\nDuration may also be having a dampening e�ect, as it did in the spring. Many businesses,\nbelieving that labor supply is being only temporarily suppressed by issues of child care,\nhealth or stimulus, are pushing through to the fall, avoiding “sticky” wage increases. They\nare using short-term measures such as recruiting bonuses and one-time signing bonuses.\nBut if and when more employers adjust base wages, the impact could be more persistent.\nPolicy, having stabilized wages during the pandemic, might well amplify wage pressures\ngoing forward. A number of our contacts point to the impact that government stimulus\nchecks and enhanced unemployment bene�ts could be playing in suppressing labor supply.\nSo, where will wage growth go from here? Given that the initial decline in wage growth was\nunexpectedly muted and the recovery has brought stories of wage pressure even as\nmillions remain on the sidelines, I won’t venture to predict the future. However, I will be\nwatching the same three factors over the next several months, as I think they will matter:\n•\n\n: Does wage pressure stay concentrated in the lower end of wages, or\ndoes it start to put pressure further up the wage ladder?\n\n•\n\n: Will “temporary” factors such as health concerns and school closures\ndisappear, freeing up labor supply, or will their impact linger? Will announced entrylevel wage increases pressure others to do the same?\n\n•\n\n: Will the impact of policy on labor supply subside at the end of the summer? Or\nwill additional policy impacts be felt on the demand side, for example via infrastructure\nspending, or on the supply side, via the forthcoming monthly child tax credit or\nminimum wage legislation?\n\nLonger term, wage growth is in�uenced by numerous additional factors, in particular\ntechnological change as re�ected in productivity growth. Understanding these dynamics,\nand how they interact, is essential to our understanding of how wage growth �ts into the\nmacroeconomy more broadly and is a priority for Richmond Fed researchers.\n\n\fThe Atlanta Fed’s Wage Growth Tracker re�ects the median percent change in the hourly\nwage of individuals observed 12 months apart. Aggregate statistics are weighted 12-month\nmoving averages, while those broken down by occupation are unweighted 12-month moving\naverages.\nLow-skill occupations include food preparation and serving, cleaning, individual care services\nand protective services. Middle-skill occupations include o�ce and administration, operators,\nproduction, and sales, while high-skill occupations comprise managers, professionals and\ntechnicians.\n\nEmployment and Labor Markets\n\nReceive an email noti�cation when News is posted online:\nBy submitting this form you agree to the\n\nEmail Address\n\nSubscribe\n\n\f(804) 697-8956\n(804) 332-0207 (mobile)\n\n© 1997-2024 Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond\n\n\f",

        "content": "Home / News / Speeches / Thomas I Barkin / 2021\n\nThe pandemic has changed us. It reminded us how precious time with family and work-life\nbalance are. It threatened baby boomers’ health while expanding their 401k plans, perhaps\ndriving the recent surge in retirements. It even allowed us to discover hidden talents, like\nbaking or gardening, increasing the value we place in our leisure time. Many of these shifts\ncould dampen future workforce participation and productivity. But one change, if it\npersists, could be a force in the opposite direction — a productivity booster. We saw a\ndramatic reduction in �u incidence.\nFlu season comes every winter. While we never know how severe it will be, we know it will\nbe disruptive. But we’ve never seen the pendulum swing this far before. This winter, we\nbasically bypassed the entire �u season. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\n(CDC) estimates we had 38 million �u cases the winter before the pandemic. But reported\n�u incidence was so low this season that the CDC hasn’t even published estimates.\nWe can see the same decline by looking just at the reported cases, which are much lower\nthan the CDC’s total estimates each year. Positive �u tests dropped from tens of thousands\nper week during the winter of 2019-2020 to just hundreds or fewer per week this past year.\nAccording to local news coverage, reported �u cases in Japan were down more than 99\npercent from the previous season’s levels. The data are clear: There has been a global drop\nin �u incidence.\nWe have a pretty good idea why. We made decisions to reduce our personal and collective\nrisks. We stayed home and avoided crowds. If we went out or worked in person, we wore\nmasks, distanced ourselves and were hyperaware of hygienic precautions. These individual\ndecisions were matched with institutional actions, such as paid leave incentives and facility\nmodi�cations that normalized hand sanitizer stations and socially distanced �oor plans.\nThe realization that we may be able to mitigate the impact of �u season is powerful. We\nnow know that the annual disruption is not necessarily a given. That leads me to wonder:\nWhat if we could retain this low infection rate beyond the pandemic? What could we gain in\n\n\ffuture years?\nFor one, we would see fewer deaths. While we may tend to think of the �u as an\ninconvenience rather than a lethal threat, tens of thousands of people die from the �u each\nyear. The CDC estimates 22,000 individuals passed away from the illness during the\n2019-2020 season. Nearly three times that many people died during the severe 2017-2018\nseason. And while those �gures may seem low compared to our recent experience with\nCOVID-19, the �u is an annual occurrence, not a once-in-a-generation pandemic. In�uenza\nand pneumonia are among the top 10 leading causes of U.S. deaths every year.\nThe second-order bene�ts of fewer deaths would be considerable. The majority of �u\ndeaths occur among older Americans, a group whose increasing labor force participation is\ncritical to our workforce over the coming years. Reducing �u incidence could also help us\navoid emotional, �nancial and productivity losses. A 2018 study places the �nancial loss\nfrom lost earnings due to �u deaths at $4 billion.\nWe would also see fewer hospitalizations. Approximately 400,000 individuals were\nhospitalized with the �u during the 2019-2020 season, according to the CDC. More than\ndouble that number were hospitalized during the 2017-2018 season. Reducing �u cases as\nwe have this past year could reduce hospitalizations by nearly tenfold. Fewer\nhospitalizations could reduce medical costs by up to $3.2 billion each year and free up\nscarce medical resources such as provider time and hospital beds.\nEven reducing nonsevere cases would help our economy. Fewer missed days of work would\nincrease output, particularly for smaller �rms that struggle to continue normal operations\nwhen �u outbreaks hit their workforce. Annual �u-related employment absences average\n20.1 million days, at a cost of $3.8 billion, according to one estimate. Estimates from the\nglobal outplacement �rm Challenger, Gray & Christmas place the cost of the 2019-2020 �u\nseason at approximately three times those levels (57.3 million days and $13 billion). To put\nthose estimates into perspective, that’s equivalent to every one of the 2.7 million workers in\nthe grocery store subsector missing between eight and 21 days of work each year just due\nto the �u. Those missing days of work hurt the employer and the employee, but they also\na�ect individual consumption — which then a�ects other businesses. As we’ve learned\nduring the pandemic, we can spend less when we are home than when we are going out to\nlunch or popping into stores after work.\nWe could also see fewer low-productivity work days. It’s pretty hard to be e�ective while\nbattling the �u or while taking care of a loved one who’s ill. That raises another bene�t of\nmitigating the �u: reduced school absenteeism. Given the learning gap we face coming out\nof the pandemic, every day in the classroom matters.\nFewer deaths and hospitalizations. Less productivity loss at work. More consumption.\nReduced school absenteeism. The bene�ts are compelling. But are we likely to see this\nlower infection rate continue?\nSome �u-suppressing behaviors are going to go away. We have an understandable desire\n\n\fto gather, to collaborate, to shake hands or hug and to smile with more than just our eyes.\nAs the pandemic eases, we are already relaxing.\nBut we don’t necessarily need to quarantine ourselves to have a real impact on �u\nincidence. Perhaps the lessons from the COVID-19 vaccines will enhance the e�ectiveness\nand take up of �u vaccines. Perhaps businesses will maintain policies that have helped\nreduce spread this year, such as remote work options, leave for sick employees, hand\nsanitizing stations and facility modi�cations. Perhaps each of us will internalize a healthier\nset of behaviors.\nI will try to do my part and retain some of my pandemic habits. I'll be taking some extra\nseconds for hand-washing and reserving my hugging primarily for family. Perhaps others\nwill do the same, and we can elbow bump our way to a healthier, more productive\neconomy.\nPutri, Wayan C. W. S., David J. Muscatello, Melissa S. Stockwell, and Anthony T.

        "content": "Home / News / Speeches / Thomas I Barkin / 2021\n\nVisit District Dialogues for video highlights from the Richmond Fed's recent conversations about\neducational disparities and COVID-19.\nWe spent the spring talking to educators, administrators, researchers and policymakers\nabout how the COVID-19 pandemic has a�ected students and what we can do to help close\nthe gaps. We learned a lot — and it wasn’t always what we were expecting.\n• White students had more access to in-person school. Overall, black and Hispanic students\nwere less likely to be given the option to return to in-person school. But even when\nstudents did have the option to return to in-person school, minority families were\nmore likely to remain virtual — perhaps because they faced higher infection and\nfatality rates from COVID-19. But it also means these students may face greater\nlearning loss as research shows that virtual learning is an imperfect substitute for faceto-face instruction. Income and wealth were a contributing factor, as higher-income\nfamilies had more resources for private schools, tutors and learning “pods.”\n• Recovering that learning loss is going to take an intense and dedicated e�ort. That includes\nsummer school, high-intensity tutoring, acceleration academies and the like. These\nsolutions can be unpopular and are expensive to implement at scale, but the cost pales\nin comparison to the cost if we do nothing.\n• Parents are going to need help. We heard from educators across the region that parental\ninvolvement, especially in lower-income communities where students are already at\nrisk, is a challenge, whether that’s staying home to help kids get online or driving them\nto extra tutoring sessions. It’s not because parents don’t want to help — it’s because\nthey’re riding a bus for hours to get to work, as we heard in Yemassee, South Carolina;\nor because they’re themselves looking for work; or because they don’t have a car.\nSolutions need to recognize and address these barriers.\n\n\f• We have e�ective tools to increase access to higher education — we need to expand them.\nDespite the di�erences in their schools, both Ángel Cabrera and Meredith Woo\nadvocated for a major expansion of the federal Pell Grant program, which gives grants\nto undergraduate students with exceptional �nancial need and generally don’t have to\nbe repaid. We’ve come to similar conclusions from our own research and outreach on\nthe potential upside of Pell Grants, speci�cally allowing students to use Pell Grants at\ncommunity colleges to pay for noncredit workforce training and credential programs\nthat would bene�t students, schools, employers and taxpayers.\n• Broadband access isn’t only an issue in rural areas. We also heard from educators in\nurban areas about the challenges their students face getting connected: sometimes\nthey live in areas with poor service, sometimes they can’t a�ord service, sometimes\nthey don’t have devices and sometimes all three. Expanding broadband access is\ncritical. As one panelist, Oleta Garrett Fitzgerald (Southern Regional Director, Children’s\nDefense Fund) explained, “[N]ot having internet in 2021 is like not having lights.”\n• More money alone isn’t the solution. Allocating money is just the beginning — we also\nneed to make a concerted e�ort to distribute the money to where it’s needed most and\nreduce the hang-ups that make it hard to spend. That requires e�ective alignment\nthrough partnerships — nonpro�ts, local governments, and private companies pulling\nin the same direction — to build awareness and capacity in communities.\nAmid all the challenges, though, we learned about some unexpected silver linings.\n• Stimulus funding helped schools meet long-standing goals. For example, we talked to\nadministrators who were able to purchase computers, mobile devices and other\ntechnology that had been on their wish lists for years. Vance-Granville Community\nCollege, in North Carolina, used stimulus funds to buy tractor trailers for its new truck\ndriver training course.\n• Virtual learning helped the best teachers reach more students. In a typical setup, a teacher\nonly reaches the students in his or her classroom. But with online instruction, the most\ntalented and experienced teachers could help students beyond their four walls.\n• Virtual learning helped meet the needs of some underserved populations. We learned\nabout incarcerated students in Baltimore, for example, who gained access to materials\nand instruction they’d never had before — and thrived.\nBy most measures, the pandemic may be in the rearview mirror — infections are falling,\nvaccinations are rising, businesses are reopening, and schools are planning to resume inperson instruction in the fall. Still, our period of remote learning has led to new challenges,\nincluding addressing learning loss and its implications for labor force participation and\naccess to higher education.

        "content": "Home / News / Speeches / Thomas I Barkin / 2021\n\nVirtual Presentation to Regional Hispanic Chambers of Commerce\n\nGracias por haberme invitado a venir aquí con ustedes el día de hoy, y extiendo mi\nagradecimiento especial a la Cámara Hispana de Maryland por organizar este evento. Es la\nprimera vez que estas 5 cámaras se han reunido, y espero que esto sea el inicio de una\nnueva tradición. Tenemos tanto que aprender unos de otros, y sé que las conversaciones\ndel día de hoy inspirarán nuevas ideas para todos nosotros.\nAntes de entrar en detalles, debo señalar que las opiniones que expreso son las mías\npropias y no necesariamente las de mis colegas del Comité Federal de Mercado Abierto o\ndel Sistema de la Reserva Federal. Dicho esto, he pensado que hoy podría hablar un poco\nsobre cómo la pandemia de la COVID-19 ha afectado a la mano de obra hispana. Se trata\nde un tema importante que debemos estudiar en la Reserva Federal porque la comunidad\nhispana es esencial para el crecimiento de nuestra fuerza laboral, y el crecimiento de la\nfuerza laboral es un ingrediente clave del crecimiento económico. Espero que mis\ncomentarios de hoy ofrezcan un contexto útil y de alto nivel para la próxima mesa redonda.\nLos temas importantes que se debatirán, como la educación, la atención de salud y el\nacceso al capital, han contribuido a la manera en que los trabajadores hispanos se las han\narreglado durante la COVID-19 y serán herramientas clave durante la recuperación y más\nallá.\nMientras que la tasa de desempleo capta la mayoría de la atención, hoy quiero examinar a\nla fuerza laboral hispana a través del lente de la relación empleo-población. Esta medida\nre�eja tanto la ausencia de las personas desempleadas y que están buscando el empleo,\ncomo a las que han abandonado por completo a la fuerza laboral, por lo que nos ofrece\nuna imagen más completa de la recuperación del mercado laboral.\nEmpecemos con algo de contexto. Durante las dos últimas décadas, la relación empleopoblación ha sido mayor para la población hispana que para la no hispana. Esto puede\nparecer sorprendente, ya que los trabajadores hispanos han experimentado\n\n\fsistemáticamente tasas de desempleo más altas que los trabajadores no hispanos durante\nel mismo período de tiempo. Pero se debe a la elevada relación empleo-población de los\nhombres hispanos, que desde el año 2000 ha variado entre 4 y 9 puntos porcentuales más\nque la de los hombres no hispanos. En gran parte, esto re�eja el hecho de que los hombres\nhispanos son, en promedio, más jóvenes que los hombres no hispanos y, por tanto, tienen\nmás probabilidades de estar en lo que los economistas llaman \"la mejor edad\" para la\nfuerza laboral. Pero incluso cuando comparamos personas similares, es decir hombres\nhispanos en la mejor edad con hombres no hispanos en la mejor edad, vemos relaciones\nde empleo más altas entre los primeros.\nPor el contrario, las mujeres hispanas han estado históricamente rezagadas en\ncomparación con sus contrapartes no hispanas en lo que respecta al empleo. Sin embargo,\npara febrero de 2020, la prolongada expansión económica, el aumento de los logros\neducativos y un descenso en las tasas de fertilidad habían equiparado la relación empleopoblación de las mujeres hispanas con sus contrapartes no hispanas.\nEl mercado laboral, históricamente fuerte antes de la pandemia, había bene�ciado también\na los trabajadores hispanos masculinos y, en general, la tasa de desempleo de los\ntrabajadores hispanos estaba cerca de su punto más bajo en la historia. El resultado es que\nen febrero de 2020, la brecha entre las relaciones empleo-población entre hispanos y no\nhispanos estaba en su punto más amplio registrado.\nPero entonces llegó la pandemia, y las consecuencias económicas fueron mayores para los\ntrabajadores hispanos que para los no hispanos. Entre febrero y abril de 2020, más del 20%\nde los empleados hispanos perdieron su empleo, en comparación con algo menos del 15%\nde los empleados no hispanos. ¿Y qué fue de esa amplia brecha récord entre las relaciones\nempleo-población que habíamos visto en febrero de 2020? Pues, se redujo a casi cero en\nsólo dos meses.\n¿A qué se debe esto? La concentración de trabajadores hispanos en el sector de servicios\njugó un rol clave. Por ejemplo, en 2019, ellos representaban el 27% de los empleados en los\nservicios de alojamiento y alimentación, en comparación con el 17.6% de la fuerza laboral\ngeneral. Todos conocemos el drástico descenso del empleo que se experimentó en este\nsector al inicio de la pandemia: se perdieron casi la mitad de los puestos de trabajo -un\ndescenso de 6.9 millones- entre febrero y abril de 2020. Y si echamos una mirada más\namplia a todas las ocupaciones de servicios, vemos que emplean a una cuarta parte de\ntrabajadores hispanos. La proporción es aún mayor para las mujeres hispanas: casi un\ntercio trabaja en ocupaciones de servicios. Esto es sorprendente, teniendo en cuenta que la\nproporción de todos los trabajadores empleados en ocupaciones de servicios es menos de\nuna quinta parte.\nEsta concentración en puestos de servicio, que operan en gran medida de forma\npresencial, también signi�có que los trabajadores hispanos tenían menos probabilidades\nde tener empleos que les permitieran trabajar desde casa. El Instituto de Política\nEconómica ha estimado que sólo el 15% de los empleados hispanos pudieron realizar\n\n\fteletrabajo en respuesta a la pandemia, en comparación con el 26% de los empleados\nblancos no hispanos. Esto puede haber agravado los desafíos laborales para los\ntrabajadores hispanos, especialmente para las mujeres, dado el cierre de escuelas,\nguarderías y centros de atención de adultos mayores.\nLa concentración en puestos de servicio también signi�có que aquellos trabajadores que\nno perdieron su empleo se enfrentaban a un mayor riesgo de exposición a la COVID-19, un\nriesgo que se extendió a sus hijos y padres, ya que los adultos hispanos son más\npropensos a vivir en hogares multigeneracionales. Y de hecho, las comunidades hispanas\nhan soportado una carga desproporcionada de la COVID-19. Aunque los hispanos\nconstituyen el 18% de la población estadounidense, representaban casi el 29% de los casos\nde COVID-19 hasta el 23 de junio, según los datos de los Centros de Control y Prevención\nde Enfermedades. La tasa de hospitalización es 2.8 veces mayor y la tasa de mortalidad es\n2.3 veces mayor.\nHemos sufrido pérdidas trágicas, pero la recuperación económica está en marcha. Las\nvacunas están cada vez más disponibles y, a medida que van disminuyendo los casos de\nCOVID-19, la actividad económica se va recuperando. La demanda de mano de obra parece\nfuerte, y estamos viendo ofertas de trabajo históricamente altas.\nEl empleo hispano se ha recuperado rápidamente. A mayo, el empleo hispano es un 4.8%\nmenor de lo que era en febrero de 2020, en comparación con un 4.4% menor para el\nempleo no hispano. Teniendo en cuenta la caída inicial más pronunciada en el empleo\nhispano, esto es notable. Y si se observa la relación empleo-población, una vez más ha\nsurgido una brecha, ya que la relación para los trabajadores hispanos es de 3 puntos\nporcentuales más alta que para los trabajadores no hispanos.\nEs importante señalar, sin embargo, que los datos agregados ocultan la recuperación más\nlenta de las mujeres hispanas. Una vez más, los hombres hispanos son los que marcan la\ndiferencia en la relación empleo-población, mientras que las mujeres hispanas van\nrezagadas de las mujeres no hispanas. De hecho, los hombres hispanos están más cerca de\nla recuperación del pleno empleo que los hombres no hispanos: el número de hombres\nhispanos que trabajan es solamente 1% menor que lo que era en febrero de 2020, en\ncomparación con el 3.3% inferior de los hombres no hispanos. En contraste, 5.3% menos\nmujeres hispanas están trabajando que en febrero de 2020, en comparación con un 2.8%\nmenos de mujeres no hispanas. De nuevo, la industria juega un rol importante en estas\ndiferencias. Aunque las industrias de servicios, como el ocio y la hostelería, siguen\nagregando puestos de trabajo, todavía hay un gran dé�cit en comparación con la situación\nprevia a la pandemia. Y aunque la continua reapertura del sector de servicios podría\npermitir a las mujeres hispanas recuperar el terreno perdido, es posible que veamos un\ndaño duradero. Por ejemplo, los puestos de trabajo en el sector de servicios pueden\nparecer menos atractivos que hace año y medio, y no todo el mundo está dispuesto o es\ncapaz de invertir y volver a capacitarse en una nueva carrera.\nEntonces, ¿qué necesitamos para contribuir a una recuperación más completa? Hay\n\n\falgunas palancas que vale la pena explorar.\nEl despliegue de las vacunas ha\nimpulsado la recuperación económica. Pero todavía hay margen de crecimiento entre la\ncomunidad hispana. Al �n de junio, los datos de 40 estados mostraban que el 38% de los\nhispanos había recibido al menos una dosis de la vacuna de la COVID-19, en comparación\ncon el 46% de los blancos. Si podemos superar las barreras de acceso y las brechas de\ninformación, podemos avanzar e impulsar nuestra recuperación.\nEl Congreso aprobó el año pasado un\nestímulo histórico. Al igual que las vacunas, el estímulo sólo es e�caz cuando llega a la\npersona individual. Los programas de ayuda con el alquiler están empezando a ponerse en\nmarcha, y los pagos de los créditos �scales por hijos empezarán en julio. Sabemos que las\ncomunidades hispanas se enfrentan a obstáculos únicos para acceder a la ayuda, que van\ndesde las barreras lingüísticas hasta la indecisión inducida por la inmigración, pero si\npodemos garantizar que la ayuda disponible esté llegando a las personas individuales,\nentonces veremos una recuperación aún más sólida.\nEl Programa de\nprotección de cheques de pago ya no acepta nuevas solicitudes, pero nuestra necesidad de\nfomentar el crecimiento de las pequeñas empresas sigue vigente. Según una medida, el\nnúmero de pequeñas empresas abiertas hoy en día sigue estando un cuarenta y cuatro\nporciento por debajo del nivel de enero de 2020. La pérdida se ha sentido especialmente\nmás entre las empresas de propiedad de mujeres hispanas. Las empresas de propiedad\nhispana son vitales para nuestro ecosistema de pequeñas empresas: después de la Gran\nRecesión, el número de pequeñas empresas en los Estados Unidos habría disminuido si no\nfuera por el crecimiento de las empresas de propiedad hispana.\nTengo la esperanza de que con el impulso actual de nuestra economía y los esfuerzos\npersistentes en estas tres áreas, veremos un crecimiento continuo en la economía general\ny en la fuerza laboral hispana. Con esto, permítanme pasarles la palabra a nuestros\npanelistas de la mesa redonda. Estoy deseando escuchar sus puntos de vista.\nGracias a Maia Cotelo y Abigail Crockett por asistir en la preparación de estos comentarios.\nLas fuentes de información se pueden encontrar en la versión en ingles del discurso.\n\nEconomic Inequality and Poverty\n\nEmployment and Labor Markets\n\n\fReceive an email noti�cation when News is posted online:\nBy submitting this form you agree to the\n\nEmail Address\n\nSubscribe\n\n(804) 697-8956\n(804) 332-0207 (mobile)\n\n© 1997-2024 Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond\n\n\f",

        "content": "Home / News / Speeches / Thomas I Barkin / 2021\n\nVirtual Presentation to Regional Hispanic Chambers of Commerce\n\nThanks for inviting me to be with you today, and a special thank you to the Maryland\nHispanic Chamber for hosting us. This is the �rst time these �ve chambers have gotten\ntogether, and I hope it’s the start of a new tradition. We have a lot to learn from one\nanother, and I am con�dent the discussions today will inspire new ideas for all of us.\nBefore I dive in, I have to note that the views I express are my own and not necessarily\nthose of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee or in the Federal Reserve\nSystem. That said, I thought I might spend some time today talking about how the\nCOVID-19 pandemic has a�ected the Hispanic workforce. This is an important topic for us\nto study at the Fed because the Hispanic community is essential to the growth of our\nworkforce, and workforce growth is a key ingredient of economic growth. I hope that my\nremarks today will provide helpful, high-level context for the upcoming roundtable. The\nimportant issues that will be discussed, such as education, health care and access to\ncapital, contributed to how Hispanic workers fared during COVID-19 and will be key tools\nduring the recovery and beyond.\nWhile the unemployment rate gets most of the attention, today I want to look at the\nHispanic workforce through the lens of the employment-to-population ratio. As the name\nimplies, this measure tells us the share of a given population that is working. Because it\naccounts for both people who are unemployed and looking for work and people who have\ndropped out of the labor force entirely, it gives us a more complete picture of the labor\nmarket’s recovery.\nLet’s start with some background. During the past two decades, the employment-topopulation ratio has been higher for the Hispanic population than the non-Hispanic\npopulation. This might seem surprising since Hispanic workers have consistently\nexperienced higher unemployment rates than non-Hispanic workers during the same time\nperiod. But it’s driven by the high employment-to-population ratio of Hispanic men, which\n\n\fsince 2000, has ranged from 4 to 9 percentage points higher than that of non-Hispanic\nmen. In large part, this re�ects the fact that Hispanic men on average are younger than\nnon-Hispanic men and thus are more likely to be what economists call “prime age” for the\nworkforce. But even when we compare apples to apples — prime-age Hispanic men to\nprime-age non-Hispanic men — we see higher employment ratios among the former.\nIn contrast, Hispanic women have historically trailed their non-Hispanic counterparts with\nrespect to employment. But by February 2020, the lengthy economic expansion, increased\neducational attainment and a decline in fertility rates had brought the employment-topopulation ratio for Hispanic women in line with that of their non-Hispanic peers.\nThe historically strong labor market prior to the pandemic had bene�ted male Hispanic\nworkers as well, and overall, the unemployment rate for Hispanic workers was near its\nlowest point ever. The upshot is that in February 2020, the gap between the Hispanic and\nnon-Hispanic employment-to-population ratios was at its widest point on record.\nBut then the pandemic hit, and the economic fallout was larger for Hispanic workers than\nnon-Hispanic workers. Between February and April 2020, more than 20 percent of Hispanic\nemployees lost their jobs, compared with just under 15 percent of non-Hispanic employees.\nAnd that record-wide gap between employment-to-population ratios that we’d seen in\nFebruary 2020? It shrank to about zero in just two months.\nWhy was this? Hispanic workers' concentration in the services sector played a key role. For\nexample, as of 2019, they accounted for 27 percent of employees in accommodation and\nfood services, compared to 17.6 percent of the workforce overall. We’re all familiar with\nthe drastic employment declines this industry experienced at the onset of the pandemic: It\nlost nearly half of its jobs — a decline of 6.9 million — between February and April 2020.\nAnd looking more broadly at all service occupations, we see they employ one-quarter of\nHispanic workers. The share is even larger for Hispanic women; almost one-third work in\nservice occupations. This is striking, considering that the share of all workers employed in\nservice occupations is less than one-�fth.\nThis concentration in service occupations, which operate largely in person, also meant that\nHispanic workers were less likely to have jobs that allowed them to work from home. The\nEconomic Policy Institute has estimated that only 15 percent of Hispanic employees were\nable to telework in response to the pandemic, compared with 26 percent of white nonHispanic employees. This may have exacerbated employment challenges for Hispanic\nworkers, especially women, given school, child care and elder care closures.\nConcentration in service occupations also meant that those workers who didn’t lose their\njobs faced a greater risk of exposure to COVID-19 — a risk that extended to their children\nand parents, as Hispanic adults are more likely to live in multigenerational households.\nAnd indeed, Hispanic communities have borne a disproportionate burden from COVID-19.\nAlthough Hispanics are about 18 percent of the U.S. population, they accounted for nearly\n29 percent of COVID-19 cases as of June 28, according to Centers for Disease Control and\n\n\fPrevention data. The hospitalization rate is 2.8 times higher for Hispanics than for white\nnon-Hispanics, and the death rate is 2.3 times higher.\nWe have experienced tragic losses, but the economic recovery is underway. Vaccines are\nwidely and increasingly available, and, as COVID-19 cases drop, economic activity is picking\nup. The demand for labor looks strong, and we are seeing historically high job openings.\nHispanic employment has recovered quickly. As of May, Hispanic employment is 4.8\npercent lower than it was in February 2020, compared with 4.4 percent lower for nonHispanic employment. Considering the steeper initial drop for Hispanic employment, this is\nnotable. And looking at the employment-to-population ratio, a gap has once again\nemerged, with the ratio for Hispanic workers 3 percentage points higher than for nonHispanic workers.\nIt’s important to note, however, that the aggregate data hide the slower recovery of\nHispanic women. Once again, Hispanic men are driving the gap in employment-topopulation ratios, while Hispanic women lag behind non-Hispanic women. In fact, Hispanic\nmen are closer to full employment recovery than non-Hispanic men: The number of\nHispanic men working is just 1 percent lower than it was in February 2020, compared with\n3.3 lower for non-Hispanic men. In contrast, 5.3 percent fewer Hispanic women are working\nthan in February 2020, compared with 2.8 percent fewer non-Hispanic women. Again,\nindustry plays a big role in these di�erences. Although service industries, such as leisure\nand hospitality, continue to add jobs, there’s still a large de�cit compared to before the\npandemic. And while the continued reopening of the services sector might allow Hispanic\nwomen to regain the ground they’ve lost, it’s possible we’ll see long-lasting damage. For\nexample, service jobs might seem less attractive than they did a year and a half ago, and\nnot everyone is willing or able to make an investment in retraining for a new career.\nWhat do we need to contribute to a fuller recovery? There are a few levers worth exploring.\nThe vaccine rollout has fueled\nthe economic recovery. But there’s still room for growth among the Hispanic community. As\nof late June, data from 40 states showed that 38 percent of Hispanics had received at least\none COVID-19 vaccine dose, compared with 46 percent of whites. If we can get beyond\naccess barriers and information gaps, we can make progress and bolster our recovery.\nCongress passed historic stimulus over the past\nyear. Much like vaccines, the stimulus is only e�ective when it reaches individuals. Rental\nrelief programs are starting to get going, and child tax credit payments begin in July. We\nknow Hispanic communities face unique obstacles to accessing aid, ranging from language\nbarriers to immigration-induced hesitation, but if we can ensure available support is\nreaching individuals, then we will see an even stronger recovery.\nThe Paycheck Protection Program is no\nlonger accepting new applications, but our need to foster growth among small businesses\nremains. By one measure, the number of small businesses open today is down more than\n\n\f44 percent from January 2020. The loss has been especially acute for businesses owned\nby Hispanic women. Hispanic-owned businesses are vital to our small business ecosystem:\nAfter the Great Recession, the number of small businesses in the United States would have\ndeclined were it not for the growth in Hispanic-owned �rms.\nI’m hopeful that with our economy’s current momentum and persistent e�orts in these\nthree areas, we will see continued growth in the overall economy and in the Hispanic\nworkforce. With that, let me turn it over to our roundtable panelists. I look forward to\nhearing their perspectives.\nThank you to Maia Cotelo and Abigail Crockett for assistance preparing these remarks.\nUnless otherwise speci�ed, employment data come from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS)\nand are seasonally adjusted by either BLS or Haver Analytics.\nEmployed persons by detailed industry, BLS.\nEmployed persons by occupation, BLS.\nGould, Elise, and Jori Kandra. “Only One in Five Workers Are Working From Home Due to\nCOVID.” Economic Policy Institute’s “Working Economics Blog,” June 2, 2021.\nCohn, D’Vera, and Je�rey S.

        "content": "Home / News / Speeches / Thomas I Barkin / 2021\n\nThe following text is a lightly edited version of remarks delivered at the Raleigh Chamber\nPartners Forum on June 24, 2021.\nA little over a year ago, we shut down the U.S. economy to slow the spread of COVID-19. It\nwas a painful, di�cult process, and thankfully, we seem to be on the other side. But it turns\nout that reopening our economy isn’t easy either. Who would have thought that the same\nauto plants that went idle last March would once again be closed — this time because of a\nchip shortage? Who could have imagined �ying somewhere but not being able to �nd a\nrental car when you land? And who would have expected hotels, restaurants and theme\nparks to be paring back their menus and hours just when consumers are ready to travel\nand eat out again?\nWe are seeing elevated net worth — from �scal stimulus, quarantine-suppressed spending\nand rising asset prices — funding pent-up demand from consumers exhausted from\nisolation and freed by vaccines and warmer weather.\nThat demand is outpacing supply. Inventories are low. Ships have been backlogged at West\nCoast ports. The ice storm in Texas disrupted chemical manufacturers. Chip shortages are\nlimiting auto production. The inventory of houses for sale is historically low. Manufacturers\nwho got behind during the downturn have struggled to catch up.\nMany �rms are also constrained by an inability to �nd workers. The jobs opening rate is the\nhighest it’s been in the 20-plus years of that data series. But at the same time, strangely, the\nunemployment rate is still elevated at 5.9 percent, and 7.1 million fewer people are\nemployed than before the pandemic. What’s the story here? In part, we’re seeing a drop in\nlabor force participation driven by parents with elevated care responsibilities and a surge of\nretirements. In addition, stimulus payments and a year of reduced spending might have\ngiven workers the �nancial wherewithal to be more selective about pay, working conditions\nor health risks. We might also be seeing regional, sector or skill mismatch between the\npeople looking for work and the open jobs. These labor constraints are particularly notable\n\n\fat lower wage levels.\nBasic economics teaches that strong demand plus limited supply equals higher prices. And\nit has. In May, 12-month headline PCE rose at a 3.9 percent annual rate. The 12-month core\nPCE, which strips out more volatile food and energy prices, rose at a 3.4 percent annual\nrate. And fast-growing prices are making up a larger share of overall spending — in May,\nprices went up more than 10 percent for nearly 18 percent of the items in an in�ation\nmeasure produced by the Dallas Fed.\nSo the topic on many people’s minds is in�ation. And why wouldn’t it be? We’ve got high\nreported data, spiking commodity prices, trillions in �scal spending, signi�cant Fed asset\npurchases, rates at zero, unexpected supply chain outages at a time of severe pent-up\ndemand, a depreciating dollar, short labor supply and a daily media drumbeat about higher\nprices.\nBut how concerned should we be? I’ll note that the word “in�ation” conjures up di�erent\nthings for di�erent people. Businesses, conscious of their tight margins, focus on input\nprices, which have soared; central banks pay attention to changes in the overall price level,\nwhich have been moderate until just recently. Consumers feel in�ation when food and gas\nprices rise, yet their volatility takes them out of our core metrics. Businesses focus on today\nand the customer resistance they face when they raise prices; central bankers focus more\non tomorrow and what expectations are for prices down the road. And market measures of\nlonger-term in�ation compensation, like the TIPS indices, have stayed steady as the recent\ndata has come in, at e�ectively the Fed’s 2 percent target.\nDuring a recent discussion, one of the economists on my team posed the question, “What\ndecade are we in?” How you answer that question informs what you think we will see in the\ncoming years and the optimal path forward for policy.\nYou might think we’re in the 1970s: a period of high in�ation that didn’t end until the\nVolcker interest rate increases of the early 1980s. For sure, in�ation has increased recently,\nand we even saw gas lines last month. But it’s hard to ignore how much of the current rise\nin in�ation is due to temporary factors. Used car price increases were a third of last\nmonth’s increase. Return –to normal prices in the travel industry were another big factor,\nas were supply chain challenges across the spectrum. You have to imagine many of these\nincreases will ease and that we may even see price reversals — daily car rental rates won’t\nbe $400 forever because more supply will come online. A great cure for high prices is, well,\nhigh prices.\nYou might think we’re in the 2000s, when — after a period of low rates — in�ation\nincreased and the equity and housing markets exploded before collapsing and causing the\nGreat Recession. For sure, valuations are up, housing sales are frenzied and price increases\nare at September 2008 levels. But it’s hard to ignore how much more stable the �nancial\nsystem has become, with less leverage in the housing market and in the banking system.\nBank risk weighted capital ratios are at a record high 14.3 percent today, compared with 9.8\n\n\fpercent in the third quarter of 2008.\nYou might think we’re in the 2010s, when many people feared the Fed’s low rates and asset\npurchases would lead to in�ation, but that fear never really materialized. PCE in�ation did\nincrease somewhat to 2.5 percent in 2011, but it reverted once temporary pressures\nsubsided and then remained below 2 percent for many years. That path could well repeat\nitself. Of course, it’s hard to ignore the long list of present-day in�ationary events I\ndescribed earlier; presumably they will have some impact on in�ation expectations.\nOr you might think we’re in the mid-1960s: when in�ation started its acceleration after\nalmost two decades of stability. Perhaps you see a risk that in�ation expectations once\nagain become unanchored, given the similarities of sizable �scal de�cits and\naccommodative monetary policy. But while one should never say never, it’s hard to ignore\nthe number of other factors that led to the Great In�ation, including no longer pegging the\ndollar to the price of gold, the rise of OPEC and wage and price controls — as well as the\nlockstep compensation and price environment of the time given pattern bargaining and\nregulated industries. And today’s Fed has learned the lessons of that era.\nThe decade game is a fun one. Maybe you think automation will cause a productivity boom\nlike the one that limited in�ation in the 1990s, or that we will have a short but steep\nin�ationary cycle like we saw as the economy adjusted at the end of World War II. Or maybe\nyou look at all this excess savings and want to imagine a return to the Roaring ‘20s.\nFor me, all I can say is that every decade is unique. I do believe we are in the middle of a\ntemporary adjustment cycle, during which workers will return to the workplace as schools\nopen and �scal payments expire, and suppliers will catch up to demand. For those reasons,\nI expect our near-term in�ationary pressure to ease as we go into the fourth quarter.\nThe key question, then, will be whether this episode has a signi�cant lingering e�ect on\nbusinesses and consumers. Will they accept higher annual price increases going forward? I\nthink the past 30 years of relative price stability must outweigh a few months of pressure.\nBut one can never be too careful. That’s why you see the Fed starting our process of\ndiscussing normalization, and hopefully why you hear legislators talking about how they will\npay for their proposed spending packages.\nHistory doesn’t repeat itself, but they say it can rhyme. So I’m hoping for a 1940s-era\ntemporary price adjustment process, followed by a return to the growth and price stability\nwe experienced during the 1950s and mid-1960s. But every decade has its story, and we\nwill soon see what is ours.\n\n\fEmployment and Labor Markets\n\nIn�ation\n\nReceive an email noti�cation when News is posted online:\nBy submitting this form you agree to the\n\nEmail Address\n\nSubscribe\n\n(804) 697-8956\n(804) 332-0207 (mobile)\n\n© 1997-2024 Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond\n\n\f",

        "content": "Home / News / Speeches / Thomas I Barkin / 2021\n\nJob openings reached 9.2 million in May, the highest level in the 20-year-plus history of the\ndata. We hear businesses are struggling to �ll those openings, and the issue is particularly\nacute for low-wage positions. This di�culty is, of course, strange given there are still over 7\nmillion fewer people employed today than in February 2020.\nOur contacts o�er a variety of reasons why labor supply might lag demand. Some point to a\ncontinued fear of infection or logistical barriers related to remote schooling or child care.\nOthers point toward increased retirements or the adverse incentives created by enhanced\nunemployment insurance. Still others believe workers have reassessed their perspectives\non work versus time at home.\nEconomics has an explanation for this: an increase in the “reservation wage.” The\nreservation wage is the lowest wage an unemployed person is willing to accept for a new\njob. If an individual’s reservation wage rises above an employer’s o�ered wage, then the\nindividual will likely keep looking for another opportunity, or even opt out of the labor\nforce.\nWe have data to validate that reservation wages have increased over the past year,\nespecially for individuals making less than $60,000 per year and those without college\ndegrees. The Federal Reserve Bank of New York conducts a regular survey that asks\nrespondents for the lowest wage they would be willing to accept for a new job. Between\nMarch 2020 and March 2021, the average reservation wage for those making less than\n$60,000 and those without college degrees went up more than $10,000\n(up 26 percent). This increase is far in excess of the range that survey has seen historically\nfor these groups.\nIn comparison, the average reservation wages of those making more than $60,000 and\nthose with college degrees only increased about 3 percent and 6 percent, respectively,\nduring the same time period. What spurred this increase in reservation wages?\nPart of the answer may be the impact of the pandemic experience. Increased health\n\n\for child care concerns or better understanding the pain of a commute might elevate\nthe costs that individuals associate with a job. At the same time, enhanced unemployment\ninsurance might make staying unemployed more feasible. Bolstered savings might reduce\nthe sense of urgency.\nAnother force seems to be playing a role: the dialogue around a $15 minimum wage. To be\nclear, e�orts to increase the minimum wage have existed for years. But the outpouring of\ngratitude for essential workers, support for stimulus to jump-start the economy and a new\nCongress gave that movement renewed energy this spring. Congress didn’t pass a new bill,\nbut there are signs that $15 has become a wage anchor point.\nFor one, several states and cities are moving toward $15 without waiting for federal change.\nPre-pandemic, seven states and the District of Columbia had committed to reach $15 over\ntime. Last year, Florida joined this list, representing a broadening consensus beyond\ntraditional progressive states and localities.\nIn addition, the private sector increasingly seems to be adopting a similar message. In the\nlast few months, a number of large employers, such as Southwest Airlines and\nUnder Armour, have announced bumps in entry level wages to $15. In perhaps the\nstrongest evidence of the importance of the “$15 anchor,” several others, like Chipotle and\nMcDonald’s, have announced an average $15 starting wage. Presumably, those �rms see an\nadvantage to adopting the number in messaging even if they do not adopt the wage �oor.\nThis combination of private and public momentum could be boosting workers'\nexpectations, which in turn raises their reservation wages. Google searches\nfor “$15 minimum wage” reached their all-time high in the �rst quarter. And higher worker\nexpectations could be pushing employers to raise wages, further cementing the higher\nwage �oor.\nWhether due to pandemic factors or expectation shifts, economic theory gives us a pretty\ngood idea of the implications of a reservation wage increase. If fewer jobs meet\nindividuals’ standards, then fewer people enter or remain in the workforce. If there\nare fewer people in the workforce, employers must raise wages or lower their dependency\non labor. If employers raise wages, they likely pass on part of the increased labor cost to\nconsumers via higher prices. If they lower their dependency on labor instead, they turn to\nautomation or o�shoring, or make adjustments to the quantity or quality of their products.\nWe already see this theory happening around us. As I discussed in an essay last month, we\nsee wages for lower-skilled workers rising as workforce participation stays stubbornly low.\nWe also see price increases. While other factors, such as supply bottlenecks, are\ncontributing to in�ationary pressures, businesses also point to wage pressure. For\nexample, Chipotle linked its latest price hike to wage increases.\nAnd in sectors struggling to �nd labor, �rms are �nding ways to reduce their reliance\non workers: turning to automation, o�oading tasks to customers or third parties, reducing\nthe frequency of service or sacri�cing quality. If you have taken a trip this summer, you\n\n\fhave experienced this. Perhaps your airline rescheduled your �ight. Perhaps you waited\nlonger to be served at dinner or ordered your meal through a QR code menu. Perhaps your\nhotel stay came without daily housekeeping.\nIt is too early to tell whether this increase in reservation wages is temporary or permanent.\nIf labor supply gets a boost over the next few months, as vaccines help put the virus behind\nus, enhanced unemployment ceases and schools reopen, then wage and price pressures\nshould ease, and the incentive to reduce labor should weaken. We will see.\nOne area to watch in the near term is how employment evolves in states that are ending\nenhanced unemployment insurance early. I am paying close attention to real-time data on\njob search activity.\nIn the longer term, there are a few other areas worth watching.\nHow durable is the expectation of a $15 minimum wage? While current expectations might\nact as an e�ective anchor, this could be less durable than a minimum wage codi�ed in law.\nIt is possible that a negative labor demand shock in the future could lead to lower wages in\na way that would not be likely with an o�cial wage �oor.\nHow will businesses’ compensation strategy shift? We may see employers tweak the\nbalance between wages and bene�ts in response to the higher reservation wage. Some\nmay move toward higher wages and away from fringe perks to present an o�er that meets\nworkers’ mental model of what wages should be. Others may try to better communicate\nthe monetary value of their fringe bene�ts, as happens with cafeteria plans that place an\nexplicit �nancial value on a bene�ts package.\nWhat will be the impact on wages more broadly? Higher entry wages compress pay scales\nof current workers who often respond with demands for higher compensation for\nthemselves. The broader the reverberations, the greater the resulting pay and price\npressure.\nThe fall will bring much change: Schools will reopen, employees will return to o�ces and\ngovernment assistance will decline. We’ll be keeping our eyes on the impact of these\nmultiple factors on the reservation wage, and in turn the economy.\nPissarides, Christopher A (2nd ed.), “Equilibrium Unemployment Theory.: 2nd Edition.”\nCambridge, Mass.: MIT Press, 2000.\n\n\fEmployment and Labor Markets\n\nReceive an email noti�cation when News is posted online:\nBy submitting this form you agree to the\n\nEmail Address\n\nSubscribe\n\n(804) 697-8956\n(804) 332-0207 (mobile)\n\n© 1997-2024 Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond\n\n\f",

        "content": "Home / News / Speeches / Thomas I Barkin / 2021\n\nAn economic recovery has the potential to de�ne the labor market for years. It can shut\nworkers out, leaving them on the sidelines while the labor market heals without them, or it\ncan bring them in, ultimately boosting long-term economic growth.\nFollowing the Great Recession, we saw the great majority of jobs go to college graduates.\nCollege graduates made up less than 40 percent of the workforce between 2010 and 2016,\nbut as many as 8.4 million jobs of the 11.6 million jobs created during that time went to\nthose with a college degree.\nThe skewed nature of the recovery re�ected how di�erent industries fared. For example,\nthe recession pummeled manufacturing and jobs in that industry, and the less-educated\nworkers who �lled them were left behind. However, it also re�ected an ongoing shift in\nemployer expectations. Jobs that had previously been available to those without a college\neducation increasingly required a degree. For example, in 2014, more than 60 percent of\njob postings for supervisors of production and operation workers required a college\ndegree, while fewer than 20 percent of workers in those positions held degrees.\nWhy did employers expect more from candidates?\nEven prior to the recession, employers were losing con�dence in the quality of non-degree\ncandidates, perhaps because of increased complexity in the skills required to successfully\nexecute tasks in a world of technological innovation.\nBut labor market dynamics also played a role. Labor supply outweighed labor demand,\nmeaning employers could be pickier and recruit more quali�ed workers. Unemployment\namong the college educated was elevated. Even in jobs that typically did not require a\ncollege degree, employers had the ability to select candidates with more formal education.\nUnderemployment among recent college graduates increased about 15 percent (from 40.6\npercent to 46.6 percent) between January 2008 and 2012.\nYears into the economic expansion, as the available talent pool shrank, we saw some\n\n\femployers start to widen their search parameters. In the tech space, for example, we saw\ncompanies such as Google, Apple, and IBM emphasize openness to and new pathways for\nnon-degree holders. But for many employers, degree requirements remain. Hiring\nprocesses likely play a role. Automated resume screens, for example, mean candidates who\ndo not meet basic requirements, such as a bachelor’s degree, can get �ltered out before a\nhuman ever sees their resume.\nThe COVID-19 recession had the potential to cause a repeat of what we saw a decade ago.\nWith so much job loss and rapid technology adoption in the face of lockdowns and social\ndistancing, the conditions seemed ripe for employers to raise their expectations and be\nchoosier with job candidates.\nBut this time, labor market dynamics have shifted. Labor demand is strong, with the\nnumber of job openings already surpassing pre-pandemic levels. This time, it is labor\nsupply that seems suppressed. Even though there are millions more people without jobs\nthan before the pandemic, the number of unemployed individuals per job opening has\nfallen below one. There are more openings than people looking for work.\nEmployers likely won’t be able to �ll vacancies by recruiting overquali�ed candidates.\nCollege-educated workers saw less severe job loss than lower-educated workers — thanks\nto remote work — and they have now recovered to their February 2020 employment levels.\nMore important, that recovery does not seem to be predicated on graduates accepting jobs\nfor which they are overquali�ed; the share of recent graduates who are underemployed is\nbelow February 2020 levels.\nThat leaves employers looking for ways to recruit workers with less formal education. But\nthis group isn’t an easy hire either. The Great Recession led employers to raise their\nexpectations; the dynamics in the COVID-19 recovery have led workers to raise theirs. It is\nnow workers holding out for a better match. The reservation wage for workers with less\nthan a college degree has increased 26 percent since March 2020.\nEmployers are already responding to these expectations with wage increases. In 2021,\nworkers with a high school education or less have seen stronger wage growth than collegeeducated workers.\nIt is possible that the start of the school year and the end of enhanced unemployment\nbene�ts will naturally bring people back into the labor force. But if they don’t return, then\nemployers may need to change their recruitment strategy to widen their eligible candidate\npool and pull in workers from the sidelines. Those changes could de�ne our labor market\nfor years to come.\nEmployers may open roles to job candidates that previously lacked necessary credentials.\nCVS announced in early August that they would be dropping their requirement for a high\nschool diploma or GED diploma for entry-level roles. Similarly, a big transportation\ncompany recently replaced its base education requirement with basic skills requirements,\nas pro�led in a recent piece published by the Atlanta Fed.\n\n\fEmployers may revisit policies that by nature shrink the eligible candidate pool, such as\ndrug testing or background check policies. In a recent survey of 40 manufacturers, labor\nand employment law �rm Ogletree Deakins’ Manufacturing Industry Group found that 37\npercent have stopped screening for marijuana in preemployment drug tests, and 32\npercent narrowed their de�nition of a disqualifying conviction.\nEmployers may provide their own training to candidates who otherwise would be\nunquali�ed. Food distributor Sysco recently announced a driver training school to help\ntackle the shortage of drivers. They pay trainees to complete the training, cover their\nlicensing and certi�cation fees, and recruit current warehouse associates to join the\npipeline. Employers may alternatively build their workforce through partnerships with\ncommunity colleges.\nEmployers may invest in work enablers, such as child or elder care support, to help recruit\ncandidates who are quali�ed for a position but unable to pursue it. McDonald’s, for\nexample, recently introduced a pilot for an emergency child care program. And it’s not\nalone. At least 75 companies have started o�ering similar bene�ts through Bright Horizons\nFamily Solutions (an employer-based child care company) this year, according to the\ncompany.\nComing out of the Great Recession, we saw labor market dynamics have a lasting impact.\nEmployers’ expectations of who and how they recruit became engrained in hiring\nprocesses. Coming out of the COVID-19 recession, we could see labor market pressures\nlead employers to open doors to new populations — which would be good news for our\nfuture workforce and economy. If that happens, then what has started out as yet another\ndivided recovery has the potential to leave behind an entirely di�erent legacy.\nCarnevale, Anthony P., Tamara Jayasundera, and Artem Gulish. “America’s Divided Recovery:\nCollege Haves and Have-Nots.” Georgetown University Center on Education and the\nWorkforce, 2016.\n“Moving the Goalposts: How Demand for a Bachelor’s Degree is Reshaping the Workforce.”\nBurning Glass Technologies, September 2014.\nFuller, Joseph B., and Manjari Raman. “Dismissed by Degrees: How Degree In�ation Is\nUndermining U.S. Competitiveness and Hurting America’s Middle Class.” Harvard Business\nSchool, October 2017.\nUnderemployment Rates for College Graduates, Federal Reserve Bank of New York.\nUnderemployment rate is de�ned as the share of graduates working in jobs that typically do\nnot require a college degree.

        "content": "Home / News / Speeches / Thomas I Barkin / 2021\n\nThe labor market story this summer has been employers’ struggle to �nd workers. Job\nopenings are at a record level. And while 5.6 million fewer people are employed today than\nbefore the pandemic, there don’t seem to be enough people looking for work to �ll the\navailable openings. Labor force participation is down, and reservation wages are up.\nBut hiring is not employers’ only challenge. In what some are calling the “Great\nResignation,” employers are also struggling to retain workers. In April, the quits rate —\nquits as a percent of total employment — hit a record high of 2.8 percent. In July, the rate\nwas only slightly lower at 2.7 percent.\nSo far, these hiring and retention issues seem most concentrated in lower-paying jobs.\nRecent increases in wage growth among the lowest quartile of wage earners and lower-skill\nworkers — increases that outpace other workers’ — re�ect employer challenges in\nrecruiting and retaining these workers.\nOver the coming months, with enhanced unemployment insurance ending, schools\nreopening, and virus fears — hopefully — waning, we have been anticipating labor supply\nand demand to better balance. But contacts across the Richmond Fed’s district do not seem\ncon�dent that we are near the end of the retention challenge, which in turn will further\npressure hiring. They’re preparing for further churn on the horizon — and this time, they\nexpect it to extend further into professional and managerial roles, where quit rates have\nnot yet been as elevated.\nA few signs point to continued and perhaps, more broad-based, pressure on quits.\nThe quits rate re�ects con�dence in the labor market. The Conference Board’s labor market\ndi�erential — the di�erence between those who think jobs are plentiful versus hard to get\n— reached the highest reading (44.1 percent) in July since 2000. And this con�dence can be\ncontagious. As co-workers leave for other jobs, workers may become more aware of the\nopportunities they’re missing. And as new hires onboard with higher wages, current\nemployees may consider a change to secure a higher salary.\n\n\fThere may also be a backlog of quits. Many workers hung onto their jobs over the past year\nand a half, waiting to make a move until the pandemic ended. Some may have been\nmotivated by a desire to avoid further instability in an already unstable period. Others may\nhave wished to avoid a fully remote onboarding experience. We may see some of this\nbacklog clear over the next several months.\nSome of those who stayed in their jobs have had to bear excess workloads as �rms have\noperated short-sta�ed. This issue is most visible in restaurants as managers beg for\npatience with stretched-too-thin sta�. But it’s not only an issue in service-sector jobs.\nAnalysts who had to work long hours when the strong rebound caught employers who’d\nslowed hiring o�-guard may also be ready to seek a better balance.\nThe reassessment of life and career choices that we have been hearing so much about may\nalso keep quits elevated in the coming months. Twenty-two percent of American workers —\nand 30 percent of those younger than 40 — have considered changing their occupation or\n�eld of work since the pandemic began, according to a Washington Post-Schar School poll\nfrom July.\nAnd the return to o�ce could expose new mismatches between employers and employees.\nSome workers who want to work remotely may �nd policies mandating a return to in\nperson. A recent survey found that 17 percent of those working remotely during the\npandemic would consider looking for another job if required to return. Others who are\nexcited to return to the workplace may �nd their o�ces moving to remote. Those who\nmoved to a new location during the pandemic may �nd even hybrid work impractical.\nVaccine mandates may play a role too. People who won’t get vaccinated will �nd\nthemselves required to �nd a new job; others may seek out a new employer that is willing\nto provide that guarantee.\nWhat are the implications of the quits rate remaining elevated and potentially spreading\nfurther into professional and managerial roles? Employers, including those who have thus\nfar been relatively immune, will want to prioritize investments that strengthen employees’\nconnections to the �rm, its culture, and each other to minimize the risk of seeing their own\nwave of resignations.\nFor the economy as a whole, it could mean in�ationary and productivity pressures.\nA higher job switching rate suggests higher future wage growth. Workers switching jobs\ntend to command a wage premium. For example, job switchers saw 4.1 percent median\nwage growth in August, while job stayers saw a more modest 3.1 percent. Over time, even\njob stayers can see wage growth as employers become more concerned about attrition.\nTo maintain margins, employers turn to productivity improvements and price hikes.\nWe have seen this at lower levels of pay. For example, the adoption of QR code ordering\nsystems has enabled restaurants to reduce demands on sta�ng while CPI prices for\nrestaurants have increased to levels not seen since the 1980s.\n\n\fThus far, wage pressure seems to be concentrated in lower levels of pay. But increased\nchurn among higher-paid workers could spark wage pressure in higher levels too. Pressure\nacross the wage ladder would mean higher wage bills for employers which could lead them\nto pursue additional, perhaps larger, changes. And what does that potential for higher\nlabor costs, productivity investments and price hikes mean? It means those of us paying\nclose attention to our economic potential and in�ation need to watch who’s leaving jobs as\nclosely as we watch who’s taking them.\nLevanon, Gad, and Frank Steemers, \"Why Wages Are Growing Rapidly Now—And Will\nContinue to in the Future.\" The Conference Board, August 20, 2021.\n\"Wage Growth Tracker.\" Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, August 2021.\nLong, Heather, and Scott Clement. “Nearly a third of U.S. workers under 40 considered\nchanging careers during the pandemic.” The Washington Post, Aug. 16, 2021.\nOzimek, Adam. “The Great Resignation: From Full-Time to Freelance.” Upwork.\nBirinci, Serdar. “Job Switching Rates during a Recession.” Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis,\nAug. 19, 2021.\n\"Wage Growth Tracker.” Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, August 2021.\n\nEmployment and Labor Markets\n\nLearn more about labor market trends in the latest Macro Minute blog post, which\nasks if people are reconsidering the tradeo� between labor and leisure.\n\n\fReceive an email noti�cation when News is posted online:\nBy submitting this form you agree to the\n\nEmail Address\n\nSubscribe\n\n(804) 697-8956\n(804) 332-0207 (mobile)\n\n© 1997-2024 Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond\n\n\f",

        "content": "Home / News / Speeches / Thomas I Barkin / 2021\n\nSmall Towns: Making It Work\n\nNext week is the Richmond Fed’s Rural America Week. It’s the third year in a row we’re\nbringing together funders and community organizations, exploring solutions to gaps in\neducational attainment, and sharing some of the many success stories we’ve heard in rural\ncommunities throughout the Richmond Fed’s district.\nThe Richmond Fed has an ongoing commitment to understanding the unique challenges\nand opportunities faced by rural areas. Every month, I visit three to �ve small towns in our\ndistrict (socially distanced) to meet with business and community leaders. While I’ve seen\nsmall towns thriving, it’s safe to say that in general, smaller towns have fallen behind more\nurban areas in recent decades.\nOne measure of this is the employment/population ratio. In the Richmond Fed’s district, the\n\n\femployment/population ratio for people between 16 and 64 years old is almost 11\npercentage points higher in urban areas than in smaller towns. The Fed’s mandate includes\nmaximum employment, so this gap means that understanding and helping small towns\nsucceed is a priority for us.\nWhile every community is di�erent, we’ve identi�ed some common themes in the\nchallenges they face, as shared when I spoke at our �rst annual Investing in Rural America\nConference in Harrisonburg, Virginia. The �rst is education, or providing students with the\ninformation and preparation they need to succeed. The second is connection—facilitating\nworkers’ access to good jobs. Isolation is another challenge, as geographic remoteness can\nlead to informational and institutional gaps. Finally, many people in smaller towns face\nobstacles to labor force participation, such as health problems. And of course, COVID-19\nhas exacerbated many of these challenges over the past year and a half. Remote education\nhas widened preexisting gaps. Community college enrollment has declined. Broadband has\nbecome even more critical. Both mental and physical health have been issues.\nHow do we address these challenges? Sometimes the best place to start is looking at who is\ngetting it right. So let me put forward some of the innovative strategies I’ve encountered\nthroughout our district.\n\nI’ll start with education, which builds the foundation for economic growth in a community.\nEducated workers attract new businesses, and good schools attract new residents. I should\nnote that while there is an overall education gap, there are many smaller towns with highperforming educational systems. The public school system in Wise, Virginia, for example,\nhas been in the top tier of Virginia schools for years.\nBut I have kept my eyes open for interesting stories of transformation and improvement.\nAnd while improving educational outcomes is a challenging task, some communities have\nmade a real di�erence. Danville, Virginia, for example, has made big investments in early\nchildhood education that have led to large increases in kindergarten readiness. In\nLexington Park, Maryland, which is home to the Naval Air Station Patuxent River, leaders at\nthe base have collaborated with business and community leaders to make major\nimprovements in K-12 education.\n\nEducation is just the �rst step. When I was in Fayetteville, North Carolina, someone\nremarked that their “biggest export is educated kids.” How do you ensure that there are\nopportunities worth staying in town for?\nA lot of communities focus on recruiting major company operations. Of course, if one can\nattract the right stable employer that can be of help. But recruitment is a hard game to win.\nSo, many communities have put their e�orts into better connecting their workforce to jobs\nthat already exist. That’s particularly helpful in today’s tight labor market. Here there’s an\nimportant role for community colleges, and we have some great examples in our district of\n\n\fschools and businesses partnering to train and connect residents to job opportunities.\nIn Hickory, North Carolina, the Catawba Valley Furniture Academy at Catawba Valley\nCommunity College is a training program designed by local furniture manufacturers to train\nstudents for skilled positions. Pitt Community College in Greenville, North Carolina, works\nclosely with pharmaceutical manufacturers in the region to train workers for their growing\nindustry. Procter & Gamble partnered with Blue Ridge Community and Technical College in\nMartinsburg, West Virginia, to train workers for its Tabler Station plant. And in Lake City,\nSouth Carolina, the Florence-Darlington Technical College has partnered with the Darla\nMoore Foundation and Francis Marion University to create a regional center (the\nContinuum) to train people for high-quality jobs. Manassas, Virginia, is using CARES Act\nmoney to fund a training program that o�ers eligible city residents up to $5,000 for\nprogram costs and wraparound services to help them secure retraining. And Virginia is\nusing CARES Act funding to provide scholarships for workers displaced by the pandemic.\nNot all training has to be provided by schools. The Carolina Textile District, for example,\npart of the Industrial Commons based in Morganton, North Carolina, o�ers workshops to\ntrain people for the resurgent �eld of industrial sewing. It also o�ers classes to help people\nstart and scale their own textile �rms, which brings me to my next point: It’s not just about\nattracting existing employers. It’s also about giving people the tools to become employers\nthemselves. We’ve visited multiple communities in West Virginia that are doing great jobs\nfostering entrepreneurship.\nIn Beckley, West Virginia, the West Virginia Hive provides aspiring or current business\nowners with technical assistance, networking, and business advising. In Taylor County, West\nVirginia, nearly one-third of the job growth since the Great Recession is accounted for by\nself-employment. Over the past �ve years, Taylor County has seen 27 percent growth in\nnew businesses, the second-fastest growth in the state. That is 221 new businesses in a\ncounty of just under 17,000 people. They’ve achieved this by creating a local network of\ncommitted residents who met weekly to share ideas, make plans and reinvigorate their\ncommunity. That created an environment where people were striving for more and were\nmore able and willing to take risks—and helped one of the county’s towns be selected for\nthe Energizing Entrepreneurial Communities Program (E-Communities).\nIt doesn’t stop with the jobs. Workers need places to live and they need transportation—so\ncommunities working to boost employment also need to look around the corner and\nanticipate the needs of the people they’re hoping to attract and retain.\nWe’re hearing a lot about housing challenges in the current environment of low supply and\nescalating costs. Here, there is a vital role for community foundations and rural community\ndevelopment �nancial institutions (CDFIs). For example, Woodlands, headquartered in\nElkins, West Virginia, has played a crucial role in revitalizing downtowns and building\nattractive, a�ordable housing, such as the Golden Rule in Belington. This former store and\nwarehouse, built in 1902, now features a�ordable apartments, an artist market and an\noutdoor community space.\n\n\fOften in more rural areas, people have to travel long distances between home and work. So\nin South Carolina, the Palmetto Breeze transit system helps people get from their inland\nhomes to jobs on the coast. In Lynchburg, Virginia, the HumanKind nonpro�t organization\nhas been a partner in the national Ways to Work program for more than 20 years, serving\nover 18,343 families in the Lynchburg region with over $6.3 million in auto loans. This\nunique program provides nonpredatory, a�ordable auto �nancing, �nancial coaching and\nvehicle maintenance education to enable working families to get access to the\ntransportation they need.\n\nUnderpinning the challenges related to education and employment is isolation. The most\nobvious example is lack of broadband access. Broadband removes the obstacle of distance,\nopening up a wealth of educational resources and health care options, and giving\nentrepreneurs access to new markets. Small towns face challenges in funding and in\n�nding providers.\nOne promising avenue is leveraging rural electrical cooperatives, which serve many of the\nsame areas that lack broadband access. Choptank Electrical Cooperative on Maryland’s\nEastern Shore, for example, formed a broadband subsidiary last year and connected its\n�rst customer in April of this year. Communities also need help accessing available funding.\nIn West Virginia, communities are working with the Claude Worthington Benedum\nFoundation and Generation West Virginia to help them navigate various broadband funding\nsources, such as the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the Federal Communications\nCommission, the U.S. Economic Development Administration, and the Appalachian\nRegional Commission.\nBreaking down isolation is also about human connection: role models and mentors who\ncan show small town residents a path to a better future. In Maryland, the Garrett County\nCommunity Action Committee’s “2Gen approach” promotes family economic security by\nproviding coaching, �nancial education, and job search support for parents, and highquality early childhood services. The Roanoke Valley’s Total Action for Progress (TAP)\ncommunity action agency in Virginia also serves the entire family to make a sustainable\nimpact on poverty. The College Advising Corps, based in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, places\nadvisers in high schools to provide personalized college guidance to students from\ndisadvantaged backgrounds. In addition to helping students navigate the application and\nenrollment process, advisers also help students and their families see college as an option\nin the �rst place.\n\nMany people in small towns also face obstacles to labor force participation such as health\nconcerns or the potential loss of needed safety-net programs. There are promising\nprograms to help people recovering from substance abuse return to work, such as West\nVirginia University’s “West Virginia Inspiring Hope” program. This initiative creates an entire\n\n\frecovery-to-work ecosystem of job training and placement, treatment, housing, and\ntransportation. The Williamson Health and Wellness Center, in Mingo County, West Virginia,\ntakes a holistic approach to helping residents with chronic health problems such as\ndiabetes, obesity and addiction—and has become a driving force behind the community’s\nrevitalization.\nThere’s been a lot of talk recently about bene�ts programs potentially creating a\ndisincentive to work. The Richmond Fed is working with employers, policymakers, and\nnonpro�ts throughout our region to help them identify and plan around “bene�ts cli�s”\n(using the CLIFF tool developed by Atlanta Fed) —situations where an increase in income\nfor low-income individuals and families actually makes them worse o�, because their\nearnings rise by enough to render them ineligible for the public bene�ts that they were\npreviously receiving, but not by enough to a�ord them what the bene�ts would have\notherwise provided.\n\nIt’s not enough to have a single program or initiative. The places that are making it work\nalso have several key elements in common: a sense of place, regional cooperation,\ndedicated funding, and, harder to de�ne—what I like to call scrappiness.\nTowns need a story: a reason to visit and a reason to stay; a sense of place to rally around.\nThe story is for employers, and the story is for talent. But, importantly, the story is less\nabout marketing the plan to outsiders and more about marketing it to those who live there\n—why one should come and why one should stay.\nThis is a relatively easy task for beach towns and college towns—but many places also have\nnatural resources to take advantage of. In Fayetteville, West Virginia, a thriving\noutdoorsports industry has helped rejuvenate the area. A robust all-terrain vehicle trail\nsystem draws visitors to Gilbert, West Virginia. Danville, Virginia, has capitalized on its\nriverfront and New Bern, North Carolina, on its thriving waterfront district.\nOther towns could build on history, as Cambridge, Maryland, is doing by honoring Harriet\nTubman and by capitalizing on its rich maritime history. Abingdon, Virginia, has a revitalized\ndowntown that dates back to the Revolutionary War (along with a thriving theater\nprogram). I could keep listing examples— the arts scene in Lake City, South Carolina; the\n“walking mall” in Winchester, Virginia.; the vibrant downtown in Aiken, South Carolina ; the\nlively retail district in Leonardtown, Maryland —but the common thread is that these\ncommunities all believe in what they have to o�er and are committed to making others\nbelieve too.\nRegional collaboration also is key. Almost by de�nition, small towns are surrounded by\nother small towns, and the strategy for that region needs to be integrated across\njurisdictions. Together, small towns are more attractive to funders. They need to speak with\none voice and operate together, whether it’s on education, business recruitment or housing\ndevelopment. Similarly, a nearby bigger city isn’t a problem but a bene�t, as proximity to\n\n\famenities and transportation can enhance the story. The path to success isn’t going it\nalone; instead, it’s working together. The GO Virginia initiative is pushing that sort of\nregional cooperation, leveraging state funding.\nOf course, everything I’ve talked about requires money. Funding can come from a lot of\nplaces. Some communities are fortunate to have a local philanthropist or corporate\nbenefactor. But not every town has that option.\nSome places have gotten creative — Danville and Martinsville, Virginia, and Asheville, North\nCarolina, used the sales of local hospitals to endow regional foundations that invest in\nhealth, education and workforce programs. In Hagerstown, Maryland, a local business\nassociation worked with a state senator to secure legislation to issue bonds to fund a new\nbaseball stadium, which is in turn supporting downtown revitalization.\nAnd the COVID-19 stimulus money is a huge opportunity. It has made billions available to\nfund infrastructure and broadband investments. Even more is potentially available to\nsupport child care, early education and community colleges.\nThe challenge for small towns now is local capacity. Government institutions are slow to\nrelease money, and they tend to distribute it to places with a proven track record, access to\nmatching funds and a well-written plan for using the money. Some communities have built\nthat grantwriting and funding capacity, but most have not. We have seen this issue starkly\nwith broadband funding in our broadband summit this summer that highlighted the\nimportance of capacity building and public-private partnerships.\nBringing all these pieces together—building a sense of place, collaborating with neighbors\nand being opportunistic about funding—requires what I heard one community leader\ndescribe as “scrappiness.” It’s a hard thing to de�ne, but we know it when we see it: a mix of\ndetermination, optimism and creativity that sets some places apart. Every town I’ve\nmentioned has scrappy local leaders who just won’t give up.\nAs we’ll see during Rural America Week, and continue to share in our Rural Spotlight series,\nthere are small towns throughout our district that have found creative ways to evolve and\nthrive. And next March, we’ll be hosting our fourth conference devoted to the challenges\nand opportunities of the small towns in our district and beyond. We’ll be talking in more\ndepth about the issues highlighted in this essay—capacity building, barriers to workforce\nparticipation and digital inclusion, to name a few. Keep an eye on our website for more\ninformation, and we hope to see you there.\n\nSmall Town and Rural Communities\n\nBroadband\n\n\fReceive an email noti�cation when News is posted online:\nBy submitting this form you agree to the\n\nEmail Address\n\nSubscribe\n\n(804) 697-8956\n(804) 332-0207 (mobile)\n\n© 1997-2024 Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond\n\n\f",

As the recovery has progressed, there has been a lot of talk about how\nand when the Fed will unwind these measures. We have attempted to give guidance on our\npath forward by tying our policies to speci�c outcomes.\nSpeci�cally, we said in September 2020 that we would reinforce our new monetary policy\nframework by keeping rates near zero until “labor market conditions have reached levels\nconsistent with the Committee’s assessments of maximum employment and in�ation has\nrisen to 2 percent and is on track to moderately exceed 2 percent for some time.” In\nDecember, we committed to continue asset purchases “until substantial further progress\nhas been made” toward our maximum employment and price stability goals.\n\n\fToday, I want to talk about the value of issuing policy guidance tied to outcomes and share\nmy thoughts on how to address the challenges of this approach. I hope this will be of\ninterest to you, as forecasters. Before I dive in, I should note that the views I express are my\nown and not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee\n(FOMC) or in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nFor much of its history, the Fed was famously tight-lipped about its actions. It’s hard to\nbelieve now, but until 1994, we did not publicly release a policy statement after each\nmeeting. The minutes of FOMC meetings also remained secret until the late 1960s and then\nwere only released with about a 90-day lag. The Fed defended this secrecy for years —\nRichmond’s own Marvin Goodfriend analyzed many of those arguments in a 1985 paper.\nThis opacity led Fed watchers to seek information wherever they could get it, including\nanalyzing the thickness of Alan Greenspan’s briefcase as he headed to FOMC meetings for\nclues about whether the Fed might change policy.\nWe have come a long way since those days. Today, the Fed issues a policy statement\nimmediately after each FOMC meeting, releases the minutes three weeks later, and\nreleases verbatim transcripts after �ve years. This increased transparency is healthy for the\nFed as a public institution, and it was also supported by a growing body of research which\nemphasized the importance of central bank communication and credibility.\nAt �rst, the Fed’s initial steps toward greater transparency involved providing more\ninformation about current monetary policy. But in the early 2000s, the Fed also began to\nprovide information about the likely path of future policy through “forward guidance.” In\n2003, the FOMC voted to reduce the federal funds rate to 1 percent and chose not to go\nany lower. However, the Fed still wanted to provide more accommodation to strengthen\neconomic conditions. As argued in a key paper that same year by Gauti Eggertsson and\nMichael Woodford, central bank communications about the trajectory of future policy\nbecome crucial at the e�ective lower bound (ELB). Such forward guidance can allow the\nFed to in�uence longer-term rates when it has run out of room to reduce short-term rates\nby setting expectations for the likely future path of short-term rates.\nInitially, the Fed’s forward guidance was very general. In its August 2003 policy statement,\nthe FOMC wrote that it believed “policy accommodation can be maintained for a\nconsiderable period.” The following year, when the FOMC was considering raising rates, it\nsignaled that it would be “patient” and that the pace of rate increase was “likely to be\nmeasured.” True to its word, the Fed increased rates gradually between 2004 and 2006 in\nincrements of 25 basis points (although no one would call that pace “gradual” in today’s\neconomic environment).\nDuring the Great Recession, the Fed again employed and continued to evolve its forward\nguidance. At �rst, the FOMC used general language similar to 2003. Then, it introduced\nspeci�c, calendar-based guidance in its August 2011 statement, signaling that it would likely\n\n\fbe necessary to maintain low rates “at least through mid-2013.”\nThe move to calendar-based forward guidance was heavily debated at the time, as the\ntranscripts of the FOMC meetings from that period reveal. Some policymakers felt that a\ncalendar date helped reinforce the Fed’s forecasts for the future path of the economy,\nwhich the FOMC began releasing in the form of the Summary of Economic Projections (SEP)\nearlier that year. But others worried that tying future policy to a date put the Fed in an\nawkward position. If economic conditions didn’t evolve the way policymakers predicted,\nthen they would either have to follow through on a date-based plan that no longer made\nsense or revise the date, diminishing its value as a signal of future behavior. In times of\ngreat uncertainty, that was asking for Fed credibility to be put on the line.\n\nIn December 2012, the FOMC moved from calendar- to outcome-based guidance. It said it\nwould be “appropriate” to keep rates low “at least as long as the unemployment rate\nremains above 6-1/2 percent, in�ation between one and two years ahead is projected to be\nno more than a half percentage point above the Committee’s 2 percent longer-run goal,\nand longer-term in�ation expectations continue to be well anchored.”\nThis made it clearer that Fed policy would be driven by economic conditions, not dates. This\napproach tried to provide the public with a clearer understanding of how the Fed would\nreact to new data and it gave the Fed greater �exibility in times of heightened uncertainty.\nStill, the transition to outcome-based guidance wasn’t seamless. The formula outlined at\nthat time (like the one we have outlined today) isn’t a simple one. Certainly, those three\ncriteria don’t just roll o� the tongue. It’s also not a precise one as judgment calls are\nrequired. How would the public know if in�ation expectations were no longer well\nanchored?\nAnother potential problem is that the outcomes de�ned could prove wrong if the economy\nshifts. The maximum level of unemployment, for example, moves over time, making it hard\nfor the Fed to provide outcome-based guidance that is appropriate at all circumstances.\nThis means that like dates, the Fed might need to revise its outcomes, leading to similar\ncommunication and credibility challenges. This is one reason why the Fed doesn’t attach a\nspeci�c number to the employment goal in its forward guidance today.\nThe Fed is facing challenges now as it seeks to navigate a highly uncertain recovery from\nthe pandemic. In�ation has been above our long-run 2 percent target for months, but will\nthis run-up in prices be transitory or sustained? Unemployment remains above prepandemic levels, but has the economy changed in ways that have shifted the maximum\nlevel of employment? What does “substantial further progress” look like for a broad-based\nand inclusive metric that has many measures? Should �scal policies not imagined when our\nguidance was de�ned change its terms?\nFinally, it seems clear to me that many audiences �nd outcome-based guidance\nunsatisfying because it cannot provide a de�nitive roadmap of the Fed’s future policy path.\n\n\fTrading instruments are often date-based, so traders would prefer to know exactly when\nmonetary policy is going to change. For reporters and the public they serve, outcome-based\nguidance can seem like inside baseball and is not as easy to process as dates. You as\nforecasters get this, I’m sure.\nI think this has led reporters and market analysts to overemphasize the SEP, particularly\nthe “dot plot” that presents FOMC members’ individual estimates of the appropriate future\npath of policy. The median forecast is often treated as a commitment by the Fed to a\nparticular date-based path. But as Chair Powell has made clear in his press conferences,\nthe SEP is a collection of individual forecasts, not a committee consensus. It can’t be a\nsubstitute for the forward guidance the FOMC presents in its policy statement.\n\nIf the public keeps asking for dates, should the Fed go back to issuing calendar-based\nforward guidance? It’s clear from past experience that this isn’t the optimal path. Markets\nand reporters may want clear dates, but in times of high uncertainty, the Fed can’t credibly\ncommit to guiding policy by dates rather than data.\nSticking with outcome-based guidance, the Fed could try to be more speci�c about its\nthresholds, but past experience also suggests this approach has limitations. It’s harder to\nget alignment among the committee. The higher the level of speci�city, the higher the risk\nthat you’ll bind yourself to a suboptimal path. Surely, there’s some value to leveraging good\njudgment. In addition, some of the Fed’s objectives, like maximum employment, are hard to\nforecast and are in�uenced by factors outside of our control.\nWe could strengthen the connection between the SEP and outcome-based guidance. I like\nthe SEP because it disciplines me to tie my policy prescription to my economic forecast. In\ntimes when forward guidance is a crucial component of Fed communications, I think that\nthrough very carefully. Currently, however, the SEP does not tie economic forecasts to a dot\non the dot plot. Doing so would provide a clearer picture of each FOMC member’s\nindividual reaction function, and taken as a whole, this could help shed more light on the\nFed’s overall reaction function. That said, since the SEP isn’t a committee consensus, we\ncould still run into a problem where the SEP and policy statement send con�icting\nmessages.\nUltimately, I think the most important thing we can do to build con�dence in forward\nguidance is to cleanly execute. In the early 2000s, the Fed signaled that it would follow a\ngradual path for rate lifto� and then did so. The 2013 taper tantrum was an example of\nwhen Fed communications and forward guidance were not so well aligned.\nHopefully, we are executing during the COVID-19 recovery in a way that builds credibility.\nRegarding our guidance on asset purchases:\n• In December, we said we would continue “until substantial further progress has been\nmade toward the Committee’s maximum employment and price stability goals.”\n\n\f• In July, we said that “the economy has made progress toward these goals.”\n• In September, we said that “if progress continues broadly as expected, the Committee\njudges that a moderation in the pace of asset purchases may soon be warranted.” That\nis the advance warning we had promised so that no one would be surprised. Hopefully\nit will enable a seamless transition when the time to start tapering comes.\nThat still leaves rate forward guidance, which is explicitly di�erent. We have hit 2 percent\non in�ation, but we still have a lot to learn about whether recent in�ation levels will be\nsustained and how much room we have to run in the labor market until we get to\nmaximum employment. As COVID-19 hopefully eases, I expect the answers to these\nquestions to become clearer.\nCleanly executing communication going forward is my goal. Doing so best cements\noutcome-based guidance as a tool comfortable for us and valuable for the market, for the\npublic, and for you as forecasters.\nThank you to Tim Sablik for assistance preparing these remarks.\nMarvin Goodfriend, “Monetary Mystique: Secrecy and Central Banking,” Federal Reserve Bank\nof Richmond Working Paper No. 85-7, Revised August 1985.\nWilliam T.

        "content": "Home / News / Speeches / Thomas I Barkin / 2021\n\nSouth Carolina Chamber Annual Workforce Development Symposium\nGreenville, S.C.\n\n• This year, we’ve seen that shortages in labor supply can constrain economic growth.\nThis might seem unique to the pandemic but as our workforce ages and birthrates\ndecline, we could �nd workforce availability limiting our economic growth.\n• There are nearly 108 million on the sidelines. Approximately 8 million are\nunemployed and roughly 100 million are out of the labor force.\n• The pandemic has exacerbated four key barriers to employment: mismatches, family\ncare, health and incentives.\n• Overall, this is a math problem. Those on the sidelines won’t come back to the labor\nmarket unless the math makes better sense to them, whether it be child care,\nbene�ts, compensation, transportation or investment in education.\n\n\fWhat's Sidelining Workers?\n\nThis year, we’ve seen that shortages in labor supply can constrain economic growth. As\nlockdowns lifted, consumer demand picked up quickly. Job openings hit all-time records.\nBut employers in many sectors were unable to sta� to meet demand. Shockingly, that\nmeant amid this strong recovery, we saw �rms cutting hours and turning down business.\nThis scenario might seem unique to the pandemic. After all, labor market frictions should\nease once the virus is behind us, schools and child care stably reopen, the impact of\npandemic bene�ts ceases and excess savings wane. But we may �nd labor shortages\nlasting far beyond this pandemic. As our workforce ages and birthrates decline, we could\n�nd workforce availability limiting our economic growth.\nTo avoid that scenario, we need to grow our workforce. Fertility and immigration could\nhelp. But we also need to do a better job connecting individuals on the sidelines with\nemployment. This challenge predated COVID-19 and will likely persist long after. I want to\nfocus my remarks today on who is on the sidelines, why they aren’t working and how to get\nthem into the workforce. Before I dive in, I should note that the views I express are my own\nand not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC)\nor in the Federal Reserve System.\nSo, �rst: Who is on the sidelines?\nWe have nearly 262 million people ages 16 or older in the United States. Almost 60 percent\n— roughly 154 million people — are employed. That leaves us nearly 108 million on the\nsidelines. Of those, approximately 8 million are unemployed, de�ned as actively seeking\nemployment. This translates to an unemployment rate of 4.8 percent. In South Carolina,\nthat number looks better, at 4.2 percent.\n\n\fBut, as evident in this recovery, the unemployment rate tells only a part of the story. It\nmisses the roughly 100 million individuals (about 1.8 million in South Carolina) who aren’t\nworking and haven’t recently looked for work. Disproportionately, those out of the labor\nforce are women and those without a college degree. They are in smaller towns and rural\nareas. The pandemic exacerbated disparities, but it did not create them.\nNearly 52 percent of those out of the labor force are retired; last year, retirees grew by over\n2 million more than what was expected. Nearly 13 percent have a disability. Another 15\npercent identify as caregivers, and 14 percent are students.\nOpting out of work is the right decision for many. Those in school are better preparing\nthemselves in the workforce. Some prefer being home with their kids or their parents.\nOthers are enjoying a well-earned retirement. But it is easy to imagine many could be open\nto working. In fact, almost 6 million of those out of the labor force say they want a job but\njust aren’t looking. If we remove barriers to participation, we may help more people come\no� the sidelines. If about 16 percent returned to the workforce, the United States would be\nback at its peak employment-to-population ratio — 64.7 percent in 2000 (it is 58.7 today).\nThe questions are then, what is keeping folks from working, and what can be done? In my\nconversations, I hear four key barriers to employment: mismatches, family care, health and\nincentives. All these issues existed before the pandemic, but it’s fair to say they have\nintensi�ed in the last 18 months.\nLet’s look at mismatches �rst. There are several types that come up.\nThere’s a skills mismatch. Even prior to the pandemic, we had a shortage of workers with\nthe training and skills necessary to sta� trucking �eets, manufacturing operations, nursing\nshifts, technology companies and construction crews. But now these shortages are ever\nmore acute as demand for these sectors booms.\nThere’s a location mismatch. Jobs are concentrated in cities. But it may not make sense to\nleave a small town to move to a high-cost city. Transportation challenges may keep those\nalready in cities from accessing good jobs. The pandemic has made big cities less attractive\nand challenged urban transportation.\nAnd expectations are becoming an issue, too. Increasingly, we are seeing misalignment\nbetween the jobs available and the jobs workers want. Reservation wages for lower-wage\nand lower-educated workers are up signi�cantly post-pandemic. Potential employees\nexpect higher compensation, bene�ts or workplace �exibility. At the same time, the\npandemic emphasized the downsides of jobs with low pay, poor bene�ts, unpredictable\nschedules, unattractive work environments, in-person work and instability.\nHow do we address these mismatches?\nWe need to fully leverage the skill building capacity of our economy. One natural path is\ncommunity colleges, and their partnerships with local employers. Yet, during the pandemic,\nwe saw enrollment decline. That’s unusual in a recession because workers usually are\n\n\flooking to reskill. Perhaps remote school and child care responsibilities held students back.\nIn response, we are seeing communities invest in whole life support. For example, in\nManassas, Virginia, local leaders used CARES Act funding to o�er eligible city residents up\nto $5,000 for program costs and wraparound services to help them secure retraining.\nWe also need to refocus on K-12. We are now in our third school year impacted by\nCOVID-19. Those most disrupted were children in marginalized communities. Inequities in\neducation feed through to unequal participation in the workplace. We simply have to keep\nschools safe and open and invest in whatever it takes to reduce the learning loss.\nWe need to fully leverage the funding now given to broadband. If the worker can’t get to the\njob, remote work lets the job come to the worker. But it is di�cult to get government funds\ndeployed, and local communities need help. I’ve been intrigued by a program I saw in West\nVirginia providing navigation support for local leaders.\nEmployers can also open the door to a wider talent pool. We are hearing employers\nrevising policies like drug testing, providing more in-house training, and reviewing hiring\ncriteria to ensure relevant prior experience, when appropriate, can be recognized in place\nof a degree. We are also seeing employers reassess their o�erings to tackle the job\nexpectations mismatch. We've seen strong wage increases for entry-level positions,\nbroadened education and child care bene�ts and more and improved �exible working\nconditions.\nSo then let me turn to the second barrier: family care.\nCaretaking has been front and center throughout the pandemic. School closures forced\nsome parents to stay home. Nursing home outbreaks shifted the focus for those with aging\nparents. And all of this came in the middle of child care a�ordability and availability\nchallenges that predated the pandemic and only worsened with lockdowns.\nAs I outlined earlier, we’ve seen some institutions make adjustments in response.\nInstitutions invested in on-site proctoring programs to enable parents to work. Employers\nare implementing new bene�ts like emergency child care. We are also seeing conversations\nopen up about the longer-run challenges in the child care industry, such as labor shortages\nand slim margins despite prices many families can’t a�ord.\nWe can take some inspiration from abroad. While our labor force participation has declined\nover the last 20 years, Canada’s has increased, particularly for women. Research from the\nSan Francisco Fed points to parental leave policies in the two countries as a key\ndi�erentiator. The same research highlights �exible work arrangements as a driver of\nincreased women’s participation in other industrialized countries.\nA third barrier — one that’s been front and center throughout the pandemic — is health.\nMore than 1 in 5 prime-age individuals out of the labor force — those between 25 and 54 —\nreport a disability. And more than one-third of nonworking, nonelderly Medicaid recipients\nreport living with multiple chronic conditions.\n\n\fOf course, the pandemic exacerbated health challenges. Fear of getting the virus may have\nkept some from taking on a part-time service-sector job. Those over 65 were told they were\nat highest risk and should avoid personal interactions. They may also have found remote\ntechnology a challenge. And it didn’t help that the services sector and part-time work o�er\nless access to health insurance than the economy as a whole. Getting the virus under\ncontrol will be a big part of tackling the health barrier in the near term.\nHealth is a particularly important barrier given our aging demographics. Identifying ways to\nkeep Americans healthier longer, or to accommodate older Americans with health concerns\nin workplaces, is a key opportunity area that will grow over time.\nWe again can look abroad for ways to tackle this barrier. Japan has grown the number of\npeople working as its working-age population has shrunk; increased participation among\nolder workers plays a central role. Between 2000 and 2019, the employment-to-population\nratio for Japanese adults ages 60 to 64 increased 19.3 percentage points to 70.3 percent.\nFor context, the U.S. ratio is 56 percent. Japan has funded subsidies for employing older\nworkers and mandated later retirement ages. It has �elded training programs for\nemployers on how to make jobs friendlier for older workers. I should acknowledge that\nJapan has a healthier population. Public health is of course a broader challenge for the\nUnited States.\nThe �nal barrier has also received much attention lately: the potential unintended\nincentives within our bene�ts system. Our bene�ts can provide critical support for people\nin need. But it can also make formal participation in the workforce a costly choice. A small\nboost in earned income can cause an individual to lose meaningful bene�ts. That’s referred\nto as a “bene�ts cli�,” and it can push individuals out of the workforce or toward the\nshadow economy.\nWe see this with health insurance, as people consider jobs that put their kids’ CHIP bene�ts\nat risk. We see it with disability insurance, which makes individuals forfeit lifelong bene�ts\nto engage in the workforce. And we see it in the tax code. We tax the �rst dollar earned by\nthe second earner at the same rate as the last dollar earned by the primary earner.\nCombined with the cost of child care and other work-related expenses, a family’s monthly\ntake-home pay may actually be higher without a second labor market participant.\nI won’t prescribe speci�c policy changes — that's for legislatures — but at the Richmond\nFed, we have invested in distributing a tool that helps organizations understand the\ndynamics of the cli� in their geography. We hope it will help nonpro�ts and employers\nbetter understand how bene�ts impact families’ �nancial calculus.\nOverall, this is a math problem. Over time, we can’t grow without more workers. The best\nsource of more workers is those on the sidelines. And those on the sidelines won’t come\nback to the labor market unless the math makes better sense to them, whether it be child\ncare, bene�ts, compensation, transportation or investment in education. It’s a challenge to\nimprove the real and perceived bene�ts versus the costs of employment, but it is doable, as\n\n\fother countries have shown.

That makes\nthis recovery a good and necessary time to discuss how to bolster women’s\neconomic security.\n• Of the roughly 100 million adults out of the labor force, almost 60 percent are\nwomen. For many, opting out of work is the right decision, but there are others who\nwould prefer to work if not for barriers in their way.\n• The pandemic exposed barriers that have a more signi�cant impact on those with\nmore fragile economic security: family care, mismatches, incentives and health.\n• All across the country, employers are looking for workers and asking how they can\nengage them. That makes this a unique opportunity to tackle the barriers keeping\nwomen out of the labor force.\n\nFor most of us, the word that de�nes the past 19 months is “uncertainty.” Remember last\nMarch, we were asking: How does COVID-19 spread? How long can our economy be shut\ndown? Will we ever �nd an e�ective treatment or vaccine? And the uncertainty persists\ntoday: Will there be a new variant? When will supply chain disruptions clear?\nSuch extended uncertainty is exhausting, even for those of us with good, stable jobs. And\nwomen working in low-wage, high-personal contact roles and those caring for young\nchildren have even more questions: Will my employer survive? How will I stay safe at work?\nWho is going to take care of my kids if they’re quarantined from school? The idea of “same\nstorm, di�erent boats” has rarely been more evident. That makes this recovery a good and\nnecessary time to discuss how to bolster women’s economic security — how to shore up\n\n\fthose boats.\nToday I want to focus on a decision that plays an important role in women’s economic\nsecurity: participating in the labor market. Before I go further, I should note that the views I\nexpress are my own and not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal Open\nMarket Committee (FOMC) or in the Federal Reserve System. Of the roughly 100 million\nadults out of the labor force, almost 60 percent are women. Some are students, some are\nretired, some live with a disability, and some prefer being home with their kids or parents.\nFor many, opting out of work is the right decision for that moment in their lives. But there\nare others who would prefer to work if not for barriers in their way and for whom work\nwould provide �nancial stability now and into retirement.\nWe’ve seen a lot of progress in women’s labor force participation since the mid-20th\ncentury. It’s risen across all ages, races, ethnicities, marital statuses and education levels.\nAnd the increase has been a boon for our country. It contributed to economic growth and\nrising household incomes and o�set long-term declines in men’s participation.\nBut the dramatic increase since the 60s has not been an uninterrupted climb, and it’s not\nguaranteed to continue. In fact, between 1997 and 2015, the participation rate for primeage women in the United States dropped almost 3 percentage points. Women with a high\nschool degree or less saw the largest drop. It took a historic economic expansion and tight\nlabor market to reverse that decline. By late 2019, participation had returned to 1997\nlevels. But this rise in participation didn’t mean that all the barriers had been addressed.\nNothing made that more clear than the pandemic.\nIn just two months, from February to April 2020, we erased the gains we’d seen in women’s\nlabor force participation since 2015. Unlike the Great Recession, which primarily a�ected\nmale-dominated sectors such as manufacturing and construction, the COVID-19 recession\ndisrupted the majority-female service sector. More than 12 million jobs held by women\ndisappeared, and we saw a corresponding decline in participation as many women didn’t\nseek new employment. This was especially the case for women with very young children;\ndespite being only 10 percent of the pre-pandemic workforce, they accounted for nearly 25\npercent of the COVID-19 employment decline.\nWe have made progress since last April. However, not all women have recovered equally.\nWomen with a bachelor’s degree have seen a strong recovery — one stronger than men\nwith the same level of education. In contrast, women with lower levels of education lag not\nonly college-educated women, but also their male peers. For women with only a high\nschool diploma, the remaining gap relative to the February 2020 participation rate is more\nthan double that of peer men. Minority women also lag their male peers.\nThe pandemic exposed barriers that have a more signi�cant impact on those with more\nfragile economic security — those with less sturdy boats. In my conversations, I hear about\nfour key barriers: family care, mismatches, incentives and health.\nLet’s look �rst at family care. The majority of primary caregivers are women, and the\n\n\fpandemic has spotlighted the challenges they face. School closures forced some to stay\nhome. Nursing home outbreaks shifted the focus for those with aging parents. And all of\nthis came in the middle of child care a�ordability and availability challenges that predated\nthe pandemic and only worsened with lockdowns.\nIn the past year and a half, we’ve seen some institutions make adjustments. Institutions\ninvested in on-site proctoring programs to enable parents to work. Employers are\nimplementing new bene�ts like emergency child care. We are also seeing conversations\nemerge about the longer-run challenges in the child care industry, such as labor shortages\nand slim margins despite prices many families can’t a�ord.\nWe can take some inspiration from abroad. While our prime-age women’s labor force\nparticipation has declined over the past 20 years, Canada's has increased. Research from\nthe San Francisco Fed points to parental leave policies in the two countries as a key\ndi�erentiator. The same research highlights �exible work arrangements as a driver of\nincreased women’s participation in other industrialized countries.\nThis brings me to the second barrier: mismatches. Let me talk about two: skills and\nexpectations.\nEven prior to the pandemic, we had a shortage of workers with the training and skills\nnecessary to sta� trucking �eets, manufacturing operations, nursing shifts, technology\ncompanies and construction crews. But now these shortages are even more acute as\ndemand for these sectors booms. Many of those jobs have historically been held by men.\nWomen who lost their jobs during the pandemic may not have the training and\ncerti�cations needed to access work in these sectors. Even nursing training is constrained,\nmaking it hard to switch into that �eld.\nOrganizations dedicated to helping women break further into male-dominated �elds will be\nkey. We will need to fully leverage our community colleges, and their partnerships with local\nemployers. We are seeing communities invest in whole life support. For example, in\nManassas, Virginia, local leaders used CARES Act funding to o�er eligible city residents up\nto $5,000 for program costs and wraparound services, such as child care, to help them\nsecure retraining.\nExpectations are becoming an issue too. Increasingly, we are seeing misalignment between\nthe jobs available and the jobs workers want. Potential employees expect higher workplace\n�exibility, compensation and bene�ts. At the same time, the pandemic emphasized the\ndownsides of jobs in the disproportionally-female services occupations, such as low pay,\npoor bene�ts, unpredictable schedules, unattractive work environments and instability.\nThe expectation mismatch becomes apparent in the debate about remote work. Women\nwith access to remote-friendly jobs may want to continue working in a �exible environment\nthat allows for things like school drop-o�s and pickups, or reduces the time spent\ncommuting or preparing for the workplace.\nThe third barrier is incentives. Our bene�ts system can provide critical support for women\n\n\fin need. But it can also make formal participation in the workforce a costly choice. A small\nboost in earned income can cause an individual to lose meaningful bene�ts. That’s referred\nto as a “bene�ts cli�,” and it can push women out of the workforce or toward the shadow\neconomy.\nWe see this with health insurance, as moms consider jobs that put their kids’ CHIP bene�ts\nat risk. We see it with disability insurance, which makes individuals forfeit lifelong bene�ts\nto engage in the workforce. And we see it in the tax code. We tax the �rst dollar earned by\nthe second earner at the same rate as the last dollar earned by the primary earner.\nCombined with the cost of child care and other work-related expenses, a family’s monthly\ntake-home pay may be higher without a second labor market participant.\nI won’t prescribe speci�c policy changes — that's for legislatures — but at the Richmond\nFed, we have invested in distributing a tool that helps organizations understand the\ndynamics of the cli� in their geography. We hope it will help nonpro�ts and employers\nbetter understand how bene�ts impact families’ �nancial calculus.\nThe �nal barrier is health. This often comes up in conversations about why men may be on\nthe sidelines, but it’s a key barrier for millions of women, too. More than 1 in 5 prime-age\nindividuals out of the labor force report a disability, and women make up almost half of this\ngroup (47.8%). On top of this, because women are more likely to be primary caregivers,\nthe health of their loved ones also plays a part.\nOf course, the pandemic exacerbated health challenges. Women whose jobs could not be\ndone remotely — especially those in poor health, over the age of 65, or caring for\nvulnerable loved ones — faced di�cult decisions about whether to continue working. And it\ndidn’t help that the services sector and part-time work o�er much less health insurance\nthan the economy as a whole. Getting the virus under control will be a big part of tackling\nthe health barrier in the near term.\nIn the longer term, women may be healthier and live longer on average, but they may need\nto work longer, too. To allow them to do so, we need to re-examine the jobs available, as\nJapan has done. Can we redesign jobs to accommodate older workers, with shorter shifts\nand lower physical demands?\nIn closing, I will just say that given the unique labor market we �nd ourselves in, this\nconversation about connecting women with employment is not just happening here at this\nsummit. It’s happening all across the country as employers, looking for workers, ask\nthemselves who is on the sidelines and how they can engage them. That makes this a\nunique opportunity to tackle the barriers keeping women out of the labor force. I look\nforward to the discussions today.\n\n\fAdults here refers to the civilian noninstitutionalized population, meaning individuals 16 and\nolder that are not in the military or institutionalized.
