        "content": "Home / News / Speeches / Mark L Mullinix / 2018\n\nBlack Communities Conference\nDurham, N.C.\nGood afternoon. I’m pleased to be here with so many leaders and thinkers from\nthroughout our community. It’s not often that Federal Reserve o�cials get to share a stage\nwith artists and religious leaders and historians and public health experts, to name just a\nfew of the many disciplines represented here.\nIn fact, I’d posit that it’s not often a crowd this intellectually diverse gets together, period —\nwhich is a testament to both the importance and the complexity of the challenges and\nopportunities we’re discussing.\nBefore I say any more, I have to note that my remarks represent my own views and not\nnecessarily the views of the Richmond Fed or the Federal Reserve System.\nIn a few minutes, you’ll be hearing from some of the Fed’s community development team\nabout our e�orts in workforce development. This might prompt you to ask two questions:\nWhy does the central bank have a community development function? And why is the\ncentral bank interested in workforce development?\n\nThe answer to the �rst question can be traced back to 1977 and the passage of the\nCommunity Reinvestment Act. This law was intended to discourage “redlining,” or the\nreluctance of many banks to market their products in certain (often minority)\nneighborhoods. More precisely, it encouraged banks “to help meet the credit needs of local\ncommunities in which they are chartered.” (Most people attribute the term “redlining” to\ncolor-coded maps produced by the Home Owners Loan Corporation in the 1930s, which\ndeemed certain neighborhoods “hazardous” for mortgage lenders.)\nThe CRA set up a process to enable citizens and community groups to protest if they\nbelieved a bank was discriminating against a particular neighborhood. Some Reserve Banks\ncreated departments to help those groups navigate the administrative process of �ling a\n\n\fprotest. The Board of Governors asked every regional Reserve Bank to establish a similar\nfunction, and by 1981, community development had a presence throughout the System.\nOver time, community groups needed less assistance with the protest process.\nConcurrently, banks and community groups were increasingly seeking each other out:\nbanks were looking for community investment opportunities, and community groups were\nlooking for funding. So the Fed’s community development function evolved, and we shifted\ninto more of a facilitator role — bringing together community groups, �nancial institutions\nand other stakeholders to provide people and businesses in low- and moderate-income\nneighborhoods with tools and resources to address credit and development issues.\nFor nearly three decades, then, understanding the constraints and the opportunities in\ncommunities throughout our District has been part of our mandate.\n\nAnother major component of our mandate, of course, is the charge to promote “maximum\nsustainable employment.” Employment is in�uenced by a variety of factors outside the\npurview of monetary policy, including the education and training of the workforce.\nFor example, during economic downturns and expansions alike, college graduates on\naverage have much lower unemployment rates than workers with less formal education.\nAnd during recessions, the unemployment rate for college graduates tends to rise less than\nthe rate for less-educated workers. Thus, a well-educated workforce may o�er the promise\nof an economy with a low and stable unemployment rate.\nNow, it’s not news to this audience that many communities don’t have equal access to\neducational and work opportunities. And that matters not only for the well-being of the\nindividuals who live in those communities, but also for the well-being of our society as a\nwhole.\nI’ll refrain from going into too much detail, but in short, economists generally believe that\nproductivity growth is the key contributor to long-run economic growth. And the key to\nproductivity growth, in turn, is our society’s “human capital” — the skills and knowledge we\ncollectively possess.\nSo to the extent that some people are not able to reach their full potential simply because\nthey don’t have the same opportunities as others, we are in essence throwing away human\ncapital that could be contributing to more economic growth and higher living standards for\nall of us. And as a policymaker, that is what I am ultimately concerned with.\nDay-to-day, the Fed’s mission is to foster the stability, integrity and e�ciency of our nation’s\nmonetary, �nancial and payments systems. But the reason that’s our mission is because we\nwant to help create a society in which people have the freedom and the opportunity to\nprosper.\nI am grateful to Jessie Romero for assistance in preparing these remarks.\n\n\fHornstein, Krussell and Violante (2007).\n\nReceive an email noti�cation when News is posted online:\nBy submitting this form you agree to the\n\nEmail Address\n\nSubscribe\n\n(804) 697-8956\n(804) 332-0207 (mobile)\n\n© 1997-2024 Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond\n\n\f",

        "content": "Unlocking Our Potential\nThomas I. Barkin\nPresident, Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond\nHotel Roanoke, Washington Lecture Hall\nRoanoke, Virginia\nAugust 8, 2018\n\nThank you for inviting me to speak with you this morning. Since I joined the\nFed in January, I’ve been traveling throughout our district, which extends\nfrom Maryland to South Carolina and also includes most of West Virginia, to\ntalk with the people who live and work here. This is my first trip to the\nRoanoke Valley, and I look forward to coming back.\n\nI came to Richmond after a 30-year career in consulting at McKinsey, where\nI served as chief financial officer, chief risk officer and led our offices in the\nSoutheast. So while I’m new to “economics” in the sense that I don’t have a\nPh.D., I’m not new to the economy. I’ve spent my professional life helping\nfirms make decisions about hiring, compensation and prices, and I’ve made a\nlot of those decisions myself. (I’m also not new to the Fed; I served on the\nAtlanta Fed’s board from 2009 to 2014, including two years as chair.)\n\n1\n\n\fMy colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) are some of\nthe most talented macroeconomists, bankers, academics and financial\nregulators in the country. But as the only committee member coming from\nmanagement, I hope I can bring a different perspective. This morning, I’ll\nshare some of that perspective with you. I’ll start with what I’m seeing in the\neconomy today. Then I’ll look forward to tomorrow, including some key\nquestions I’m wrestling with. And then I’ll be glad to take your questions.\n\nBefore I say more, I have to note that the views I express are my own and\ndon’t represent those of the FOMC or the Federal Reserve System. 1\n\nToday\nGDP Growth\n\nIn the 1970s, economist Arthur Okun invented the Misery Index, the sum of\nthe inflation and unemployment rates. At its peak in 1980, the index was\nalmost 22 percent. Today, it’s about 6 percent. The economy is strong.\n\n2\n\n\fWhat’s contributing to that? Let’s start with growth. Real GDP grew at about\n2.6 percent last year and topped 4 percent in the second quarter of this year.\nUnderlying that growth, in my view, is confidence. Small business optimism\nis historically high, and the University of Michigan’s Index of Consumer\nSentiment is as high as it’s been since the early 2000s. We’ve had fiscal\nstimulus in the form of tax cuts and the omnibus bill. There’s a sense that\nwe’re in a deregulatory moment. People have jobs, and the markets are\nstrong. Overall, it’s starting to feel like we’ve got some tailwinds rather than\nheadwinds.\n\nThat said, I’m with the Fed now, so I have to be cautious. And certainly,\ntariff concerns are making people more nervous than they did a few months\nago. In the Michigan Survey, the number of households that mentioned tariff\nconcerns has more than doubled since May. In another survey conducted by\nthe Conference Board, we’re seeing a large gap open up between people’s\nperceptions of today and their expectations for tomorrow. We’ve also got\nsupply chain constraints, geopolitical instability, market volatility and the\npotential effects of higher interest rates.\n\n3\n\n\fAt least for now, though, businesses and consumers seem to be looking\nthrough these risks. Many people are forecasting growth in the high 2s, or\neven 3 percent, for the remainder of the year.\n\nLabor Markets\nOne reason they’re doing so is the strength of the labor market. The economy\nhas added an average of more than 200,000 jobs per month since the start of\nthe year. That’s a very large number; for perspective, the “breakeven” to keep\nup with our country’s population growth is around 80,000 – 100,000 jobs per\nmonth. Strong job growth has contributed to unemployment below 4 percent,\nin the range of our lowest levels since the late 1960s. At the same time,\ncompanies still want to hire — at 4.3 percent, the job vacancy rate is higher\nthan the unemployment rate and about the highest it’s been since the Bureau\nof Labor Statistics started tracking the data in 2000. Vacancies are especially\nhigh in fields such as nursing, skilled trades and truck driving.\n\nIn short, the labor market is really tight. And we all were taught that when the\nlabor market is tight, companies raise wages. To date, however, wage growth\nhas been modest. Why? One thing I’ve been hearing is that companies don’t\n4\n\n\fthink, from a competitive standpoint, that they can raise prices or capture\nenough productivity to compensate for higher wages. So they’re trying\ndifferent strategies, such as outsourcing and offshoring, retraining existing\nemployees or just delaying filling jobs. Some firms are also expanding their\nhiring pool; for example, I spoke with one firm that’s relaxed its view on\nhiring people with criminal records.\n\nIn addition, until recently, turnover hadn’t escalated significantly, perhaps\nbecause employees were still experiencing a “hangover” from the Great\nRecession that reduced their confidence in switching jobs for a modest pay\nincrease. This is a trend I’m watching closely, because until turnover\nbecomes a consistent issue, businesses are unlikely to give the significant\nacross-the-board wage increases that drive significant moves in overall\nwages.\n\nWe’re also hearing increasingly about businesses finding innovative ways to\ngive workers more nonwage compensation — everything from flexible work\nhours to culture improvement efforts to one contact who has started beer cart\nFridays. (As an aside, beer cart Fridays are often seen as a leading negative\n5\n\n\feconomic indicator.) Of course, these practices aren’t all free, but it’s\npossible employers have found that, at least for now, such benefits are a less\ncostly way than direct compensation to increase employee satisfaction and\nreduce turnover.\n\nInflation and Monetary Policy\nLet’s turn to inflation. We’re coming off a fairly long stretch where inflation\nran below the Fed’s 2 percent target. The numbers have firmed around our\ntarget in recent months, but it’s reasonable to ask why we’re not seeing more\ninflation, given not only the tightness of the labor market, but also\ncommodity cost pressure in places like pulp, steel and oil.\n\nPart of the answer, as I mentioned, is that many firms don’t think they can\npass on higher costs to consumers. There are a number of reasons for this,\nincluding the buying power of big-box retailers, the price transparency\nprovided by the internet and competition from lower-priced imports. Another\nfactor keeping inflation in check is that people believe the Fed is going to\nkeep inflation in check. The 1970s taught us that inflation expectations play a\nlarge role in determining future inflation. Currently, multiple measures of\n6\n\n\finflation expectations are holding steady in line with the Fed’s 2 percent\ntarget.\n\nSo now I imagine you’re wondering, is the FOMC going to keep raising\nrates? And if yes, how far and how fast? I’m not going to tell you — and in\nfact, we don’t know yet, because it will depend on incoming data. But I can\ntell you about the underlying thinking.\n\nThe case for further gradual rate increases goes like this: Although the\nFOMC has begun raising interest rates, they are not yet back to normal levels.\nIt is difficult to argue that lower than normal rates are appropriate when\nunemployment is low and inflation is effectively at the Fed’s target. In\naddition, we don’t want to risk the credibility of our commitment to low and\nstable inflation. That means when the economy calls for moving back to\nnormal levels, as do the conditions I just described, we should follow\nthrough. Given the strength of the underlying economy and the recent\nadditional fiscal stimulus, the risk of normalization is reduced. How high\nrates will ultimately need to rise depends on economic growth: The higher\n\n7\n\n\fthe underlying growth prospects, the higher the policy rate — which brings\nme to the topic of tomorrow.\n\nTomorrow\nIn my former life as a consultant, it was my job to find opportunities for\nimprovement. So let me do a bit of that now. Despite the fairly rosy picture I\njust painted, I’m concerned about our economy’s ability to keep growing.\nThat’s because the math of growth is pretty simple: We need more people to\nwork, and/or we need them to be more productive.\n\nThe Labor Force and Productivity\nThe first thing to look at, then, is the labor force — and if current trends\ncontinue, it’s going to grow slowly. Population growth has been slow, around\n0.7 percent per year, and the Census Bureau projects it will slow even more\nin the future. (It’s not just us; fertility rates have fallen in nearly every\ndeveloped country.) In addition, since the 1990s, immigration has contributed\nabout half of the growth in the working-age population. But that seems\nunlikely to continue in the present environment. Also, labor force\nparticipation (percent working or looking for work) has been trending down,\n8\n\n\fand it’s projected to fall further as my generation retires. Our Richmond team\nestimates a 2 percentage point drop over the next five years based on\ndemographics alone. It’s a challenge facing the greater Roanoke Valley: For\nevery 100 people of working age in the area, there are 31 people of retirement\nage or older. That’s in contrast to Richmond, where there are 24 per 100\nworking-age people. (To be clear, my recent retirement from McKinsey isn’t\nincluded in the Richmond numbers.)\n\nSo labor force growth requires tackling the many labor segments operating\nunder their full potential. For example, there’s a large divide between urban\nand rural areas; here in Virginia the employment-to-population ratio among\nworking-age adults is about six points higher in urban areas than in rural\nareas. People in rural areas often don’t have the same opportunities as people\nin urban areas. I’ve seen it as I’ve traveled around the district, including\ndriving here today; it’s striking how quickly things change as you leave the\ncity. The textbook economics answer would be that people should move to\nthe cities, but there are many valid reasons why people don’t want to, or\ncan’t, relocate.\n\n9\n\n\fAt the same time, there are divides within cities. Roanoke’s downtown\nrevitalization has been remarkable: The city itself is attracting young people,\nthere’s a craft brewery on every corner and new businesses continue to move\nin. At the same time, the poverty rate in the city is 22 percent, well above the\nnational average of 13 percent — clearly, not everyone has been equally able\nto participate in Roanoke’s success.\n\nWe also see a divide by education. Employment rates are much lower for\npeople who don’t have a four-year college degree. But there are well-paying\njobs that don’t require a degree that employers are desperate to fill, such as\ntruck drivers, airline mechanics or skilled trades in construction and\nmanufacturing. There are opportunities to let students know about these jobs\nand help them develop the skills they need to access them.\n\nAnd, finally, after increasing steadily for decades, women’s labor force\nparticipation started to decline around 2000. The United States used to have\none of the highest rates of women’s participation; now we’re in the bottom\nhalf of developed economies.\n\n10\n\n\fGiven slow labor force growth, productivity matters. But a lot of research\nsuggests that productivity growth has declined and that over the past decade\nit’s only grown about half as quickly as the long-term average. The\nRichmond Fed estimates that today it’s around 1.25 percent.\n\nThat’s lower, in my view, than the potential of American businesses. In my\nconversations with businesspeople, they believe they are driving more\nproductivity than the data suggest, via automation, capital investments and\noperating efficiencies. They might be wrong — or it might just take time to\nrealize the benefits of those strategies, as happened in the mid-1990s. It’s also\npossible some businesses are getting more productive at the expense of their\ncompetitors, thus dampening the effect in aggregate.\n\nChallenges for Policymakers\nGrowth matters in and of itself. It also matters for our resilience in the next\ndownturn. As I mentioned, the appropriate policy rate depends on how\nquickly the economy can grow. So in a slow-growth environment, interest\nrates are likely to be lower. This creates some challenges for monetary\npolicymakers, as they have less ability to lower rates to stimulate the\n11\n\n\feconomy in the event of a downturn. 2 As a result, we might at some point\nhave to come back to “unconventional” (and controversial) policies like those\nemployed after the Great Recession. It is not clear how large an impact these\npolicies would have or how well supported they would be.\n\nThe other critical lever in a downturn is fiscal stimulus. But our nation’s\nfiscal capacity is limited. The debt-to-GDP ratio is nearly 80 percent — the\nhighest it’s been since the late 1940s — and the Congressional Budget Office\nprojects it could rise to 100 percent by 2028, depending on whether the recent\ntax cuts are made permanent. For comparison, it was 48 percent in 1994 and\n35 percent in 2007. This fiscal situation challenges our resilience. Will the\ngovernment have enough stimulus available during the next downturn? Will\nthose efforts be offset by investors requiring a higher yield on our debt?\n\nPolicies to Promote Growth\nGiven these challenges, I’m concerned about monetary and fiscal\npolicymakers’ capabilities to provide an effective backstop in the next\nrecession. But stronger underlying growth would address this concern.\nStronger growth would allow the FOMC to raise rates higher without\n12\n\n\fconstraining the economy, giving us more ammunition when we need it.\nStronger growth would create revenues to reduce our deficit, giving us more\ncapacity for fiscal stimulus. Stronger growth would help to lessen the pain\nthat many people in our communities are feeling.\n\nCreating growth is easier said than done, of course, and I won’t presume to\nhave all the answers. And I should point out that monetary policy has a\nlimited effect on the factors that ultimately determine long-run growth. But I\ncan share what I think are important themes.\n\nEducation and workforce development are critical. If we expect the labor\nforce to grow slowly, that means our country has to do a stellar job educating\nand training the workers we already have. In part, that means ensuring\nstudents who want to attend college receive the preparation they need to be\nsuccessful, because far too many students do not. 3 Roughly 40 percent of\nstudents who enroll in a four-year college don’t graduate within six years,\nand many of those who leave without a degree are still left with significant\ndebt. It also means ensuring that young people have viable alternatives other\nthan four-year colleges and that they’re aware of those alternatives. 4\n13\n\n\fThere might be other levers policymakers can pull to increase the labor force,\nsuch as providing more opportunities to rural and inner-city communities.\nThat includes creating jobs in both places as well as investing in initiatives\nthat enable people to travel to, or live near, the jobs. As a country, we can\nlook at ways to support women’s participation in the workforce, such as\ngreater availability of child care and paid leave, 5 and to admit more legal\nimmigrants, who bring with them much-needed skills and entrepreneurial\nenergy. Policymakers might also look at how to continue investing in\ndelivering productivity and in incentive strategies that drive such\ninvestments. For example, although business investment has grown rapidly\nover the past four quarters, it’s still low as a share of GDP relative to\nprevious expansions. And, of course, we should all support efforts to\nresponsibly address our nation’s fiscal situation.\n\nI do want to leave you with the thought that the economy’s pulse, as we sit\nhere today, is strong. Growth is solid, unemployment is low and inflation is at\ntarget. The challenge isn’t so much today, but rather unlocking the sustained\n\n14\n\n\fgrowth that will make the country healthier and more resilient tomorrow.\nThank you, and I look forward to your questions.\n1\n\nThank you to Jessie Romero for assistance preparing these remarks.\nSee John C.

        "content": "Closing the Gap\nThomas I. Barkin\nPresident, Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond\nBanking and the Economy: A Forum for Minorities in Banking\nSeptember 28, 2018\nCharlotte, North Carolina\nThank you very much for inviting me to talk with you today. Diversity is a major priority for us\nat the Richmond Fed and throughout the Federal Reserve System. And it’s important for us to\nthink about diversity not only in the context of our own workforce and supplier base, but also in\nthe financial industry more broadly.\nIn many ways, the disparities we see at the management level — which I’m looking forward to\nhearing Daniel Garcia-Diaz discuss in our next session — have their roots very early, in the\nopportunities available to people even as young children. Today I’d like to talk about those\ndisparities and put them in the context of the macroeconomy. I’ll talk particularly about human\ncapital, which plays a critical role in labor market outcomes. Before I say more, the views I\nexpress are my own and might not be shared by my colleagues in the Federal Reserve System or\non the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).1\nGrowing the Labor Force\nThe FOMC met this week and reviewed a pretty healthy economy. Growth is strong. Inflation is\nmoderate, and the unemployment rate is as low as it’s been since the late 1960s. We’ve been\nadding an average of more than 200,000 jobs per month for over five years, which is a very large\nnumber when the “breakeven” to keep up with population growth is around 80,000-100,000 jobs\nper month. There are actually more job openings than there are people looking for jobs.\nOne question many people have is, how long can this kind of growth last? Economic growth\ndepends on how many people are working and how productive they are. But currently, our labor\nforce is growing quite slowly due to declining fertility rates, an aging population and declining\nimmigration. None of these seem likely to change in the near term. At the same time,\nproductivity growth has been relatively slow. Absent a major productivity surge, then, our\ngrowth depends on whether there are still a lot of people on the sidelines who can be drawn into\nthe labor force.\nThere are definitely a lot of people on the sidelines. The labor force participation rate has\ndropped about 4.5 percentage points since 2000, from a little over 67 percent to less than 63\npercent. That might not sound like a lot, but it is a really big number to the people who study this\nkind of thing. That means that while the unemployment rate has dropped about 6 percentage\npoints since its Great Recession-era peak, the employment-population ratio has barely budged\nand is still below pre-recession levels.\nBut that doesn’t tell us everything we need to know about how deep the labor market’s bench is\n— we also need to consider how likely those people are to return to the labor force. Much of the\n1\n\n\fdrop is due to demographics, such as baby boomers retiring and more young people attending\ncollege. If we look at the labor force participation rate for so-called “prime-age” workers,\nbetween 25 and 54, the labor force participation rate is much higher, around 82 percent, and is\nonly 2 percentage points lower than it was in 2000. This suggests that the people most likely to\nbe in the labor force are already in the labor force.\nSo what can we do to bring people off the sidelines? We’re unlikely to force retirees back into\nthe workforce, and we want kids to go to school. But there are large disparities between groups\nof people of prime working age across a variety of dimensions, particularly education, which in\nturn is correlated with various measures of socioeconomic status, as well as with race and\nethnicity. Education gives us an opportunity to boost labor force participation and improve\nemployment outcomes for these groups. In my view, it’s the biggest opportunity for the growth\nof our economy.\nThe Education Gap\nBeginning around 1980, having a college degree emerged as one of the great dividing lines in\nour economy. College-educated workers earn about 80 percent more than workers with only a\nhigh school degree. They’re also less likely to be unemployed and are less affected by swings in\nthe business cycle. Following the Great Recession, for example, the unemployment rate for\ncollege-educated workers barely topped 5 percent; for workers with only a high school diploma,\nit peaked at 11 percent. Currently, the unemployment rate for workers with at least a four-year\ndegree is 2.3 percent, while it’s 4 percent for workers with only a high school diploma.\nGranted, 4 percent is still a pretty low number. But it has to be weighed against the number of\npeople with only a high school degree who have stopped looking for work: The labor force\nparticipation rate for this group is less than 58 percent, compared to 74 percent for college\ngraduates. Putting together unemployment and participation, the employment/population ratio\nfor workers who only completed high school is 55 percent. It’s more than 72 percent for college\ngraduates.\nCollege enrollment has increased significantly since the 1980s. But roughly 40 percent of\nstudents who enroll don’t graduate within six years — and they often leave with significant debt\nloads and without the benefits a degree offers. Both enrollment and completion are tied to\nsocioeconomic status: Children from lower-income families and children who attend schools\nwith a higher proportion of lower-income students are less likely to attend college and less likely\nto leave with a degree. For example, one study found a gap of nearly 30 percentage points in\ncompletion rates for students from low-income versus high-income families.2 We also see\nvariation by race and ethnicity, particularly when it comes to graduation rates. Black and\nHispanic students are as much as 20 percentage points less likely to complete a degree than white\nand Asian students.\nLet’s dig in deeper — why is socioeconomic status tied to college achievement? It’s not as\nsimple as not being able to afford to go, although that is certainly an obstacle for some students.\nWe also see wealth and income interact with how prepared students are for college. College is a\nrisky investment, so, for example, a student from a low-wealth household who doesn’t think he\n2\n\n\fhas a great chance of graduating might decide, quite rationally, to not enroll in the first place.3\nSimilarly, a student from a lower-income family who learns after several semesters that she\ndoesn’t have the necessary skills might be more prone to drop out than a similarly skilled student\nwith more family resources.4\nWe also know that socioeconomic status is tied to the opportunities students have to obtain those\nskills in the first place, beginning with access to high-quality early childhood education and\ncontinuing on through K-12. Finally, income is linked to how much “knowledge about college”\nstudents have, such as navigating the application process, taking entrance exams, and applying\nfor financial aid. In part, this could be because students from lower-income backgrounds know\nfewer adults who have completed college. It also could be because they attend high schools with\nfewer resources for college guidance.\nOne avenue for policymakers is looking at how to reduce these differences in access and\npreparation during the elementary and high school years.5 Schools can also look at how to help\ntheir attendees graduate; for example, mentorship programs such as the one offered at the online\nWestern Governors University, which has an 80 percent graduation rate, can be very effective.\nCollege Isn’t the Only Option\nI’ve spent the last few minutes emphasizing the benefits of a college education. But for some\npeople, a four-year college just isn’t the right fit. And at present, as I mentioned, there are\nactually more job openings than there are people looking for work — and many of those\nopenings are for well-paying jobs that don’t require a college degree. Health care workers, airline\nmechanics, truck drivers, and skilled tradespeople, for example, are all in high demand right\nnow.\nThus, part of preparation at the K-12 level should be informing students about those\nopportunities and about how they can train for them, for example, at community colleges or via\napprenticeship programs. This could help students improve their prospects relative to quitting\ntheir labor market preparation after high school, which they might do if they think a four-year\nschool is their only postsecondary option, or by enrolling in and then dropping out of a four-year\ncollege.\nConclusion\nThe challenges are huge and the stakes are high, both for individuals and for our ability to\ndevelop the workforce we need. If we want to increase the diversity of our corner offices and\nboardrooms — and build a pipeline of diverse candidates for these offices — we need to address\nthe disparities that exist well before the job interview. This is also one of our best opportunities\nto ensure our economy’s continued growth.\nThe size of the opportunity is significant. If we could bring the employment/population ratio of\nthose with only a high school degree up to the ratio of college graduates, for example, we would\nhave roughly 11 million more people at work. That’s a lot of people contributing to our country’s\neconomic growth.\n3\n\n\fThe Richmond Fed is digging deeply into the issues and welcomes any thoughts you have on\npossible solutions.

        "content": "Crossing the Geographic Divide\nThomas I. Barkin\nPresident, Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond\nReinventing Our Communities\nFederal Reserve Bank of Richmond, Baltimore Branch\nOctober 2, 2018\n\nThank you for inviting me to talk with you today, and thank you to the many members of our\nBaltimore Board of Directors and Community Investment Council who have taken the time to\njoin us as well. I’m sure you’re all looking forward to hearing from director Mary Ann Scully, a\npanelist in the “Women and Wealth Building” workshop later this afternoon.\nThis conference addresses issues that have been of interest to me for a long time and have taken\non a particular urgency for me since I joined the Fed. You may have heard of the economist\nRobert Lucas, who won the Nobel Prize in 1995. Several decades ago, in an article about\neconomic development, he wrote, “The consequences for human welfare involved in questions\nlike these are simply staggering: Once one starts to think about them, it is hard to think about\nanything else.” He was right. I’ve spent the past nine months traveling around the Fifth District,\nand I’ve been struck by the tremendous diversity in our communities and by the diversity of the\nchallenges and opportunities facing these communities. The more I learn about our district, the\nmore I want to understand why some areas are thriving while others are struggling — and what\ncan be done to help everyone.\nOur upcoming panel has a lot of experts on that topic. I thought I might set up their conversation\nin the context of the macroeconomy. Before I say more, the views I express are my own and\nmight not be shared by my colleagues in the Federal Reserve System or on the Federal Open\nMarket Committee (FOMC). 1\nGrowing the Workforce\nThe FOMC met last week and reviewed a pretty healthy economy: GDP growth is strong,\ninflation is moderate and the unemployment rate is as low as it’s been since the late 1960s.\nWe’ve been adding an average of more than 200,000 jobs per month for more than five years.\nThat’s a very large number when the “breakeven” needed to keep up with population growth is\naround 80,000 to 100,000 jobs per month. There are actually more job vacancies than there are\npeople looking for jobs.\nOne question many people have is, how long can this kind of growth last? To try to answer that\nquestion, let’s look at what drives growth, which you can boil down to a pretty simple statement:\nEconomic growth depends on how many people are working and how productive they are. Right\nnow, productivity growth is fairly slow. So absent a productivity surge, future growth will\nrequire increasing our labor force. But our population is also growing slowly — which means the\ngrowth in our labor force will have to come from people currently on the sidelines of the labor\nmarket.\n1\n\n\fThere are a lot of people on the sidelines. The labor force participation rate (which includes\npeople working or actively looking for work) has dropped about 4.5 percentage points since\n2000, from a little over 67 percent to less than 63 percent. That might not sound like a lot, but it\nis a really big number to the people who study this kind of thing. So while the unemployment\nrate has dropped about 6 percentage points since its Great Recession-era peak, the employmentpopulation ratio has barely budged and is still below pre-recession levels.\nHow likely are people who have left the labor force to return? Much of the drop in labor force\nparticipation is the result of demographics, such as baby boomers retiring and more young\npeople attending college. If we look at the labor force participation rate for what we call “primeage” workers, aged 25-54, it is much higher, around 82 percent, and is only 2 percentage points\nlower than in 2000. That suggests many of the people on the sidelines intend to remain there.\nSo what can we do? We’re unlikely to force retirees back into the workforce, and we want our\nstudents to finish school. But there are large disparities between groups of people of prime\nworking age across a variety of dimensions, including education, race, gender and geography.\nGrowing the labor force requires improving employment outcomes for these groups. I believe\nit’s the biggest opportunity for the growth of our economy.\nUrban, Inner City and Rural Divides\nGiven the themes of this conference, I’ll focus today on geographic differences. One thing that’s\nstruck me is the stark difference between the opportunities available to people in urban areas and\npeople in rural areas. It’s remarkable how quickly, and how much, things change as you leave\nthe city.\nI see it as I travel throughout the Fifth District, and I see it in the data. Across the district as a\nwhole, the employment-population ratio and labor force participation rates are about 6\npercentage points higher in urban than in rural areas. (Both those numbers are calculated for\npeople between the ages of 16 and 64, so the difference doesn’t just reflect that rural populations\ntend to be older.) Interestingly, Maryland is an exception — it’s the only state in the district\nwhere these measures are about the same. That probably reflects the state’s size, which puts rural\nareas in closer proximity to urban areas than in other states.\nThere are a number of factors to untangle about why this divide exists, and it’s something the\nRichmond Fed has begun studying in depth. But in many cases, it’s because the jobs that\ntraditionally supported these communities have moved, and the people (often understandably)\nhaven’t.\nWhile broadly speaking, labor market outcomes are better in urban areas than in rural areas,\nthat’s not true for every part of an urban area: There are divides within cities as well. In this,\nunfortunately, Maryland is not an exception. Here in Baltimore, at the same time new shops and\nrestaurants are being built on Pratt Street and luxury apartment towers are rising on Light Street,\nthere are parts of the city where people can’t find jobs and row houses sit vacant.\n\n2\n\n\fThis is a topic our Bank has been actively studying for several years. For example, we are\ncurrently in the midst of an extensive research project, focused on Baltimore, to understand how\nsome individuals are able to move out of intergenerational poverty. 2 And last year, we brought\ntogether some of the leading researchers in urban economics for a conference here. I wish I could\ntell you we’d found a silver bullet, but as you know the challenges and solutions are complex.\nWe have to keep searching for the answers, because the size of the opportunity is significant.\nAreas with higher employment rates tend to have lower poverty and crime rates and fewer\nchallenges with substance abuse. And on the national level, increasing our labor force is an\nimportant opportunity to support continued economic growth.\nWorkforce Development and Mobility\nWhile there’s no one-size-fits-all answer, I do think there are some common themes; in\nparticular, workforce development and mobility.\nI mentioned that there are currently more open jobs than there are people looking for jobs — and\nI’ve lost count of how many “now hiring” signs I’ve seen outside retail stores and on highway\nbillboards. So why aren’t people in inner cities and rural areas filling these jobs? Part of the\nanswer seems to be a mismatch between the skills employers are seeking and the ones people\nhave. I have heard from a number of my contacts in the district that they’ve having trouble\nfinding skilled workers.\nOne qualification many employers are looking for is a four-year college degree. But students\nfrom rural areas are less likely to attend college than students from suburban areas. Economists\nat the University of Virginia, for example, studied outcomes in that state and found that college\nattendance ranges from less than 50 percent of high school graduates in some low-income,\npredominantly rural school districts to more than 80 percent in some high-income, suburban\nschool districts. 3 Students who grow up in the inner city also are less likely to attend college than\ntheir suburban peers — perhaps because they are significantly less likely to graduate from high\nschool.\nGetting kids to enroll in college is just part of the challenge; roughly 40 percent of college\nattendees fail to earn a degree within six years. These students may be left with significant debt\nand few benefits. So we also need to look at preparing students to succeed in college. That\npreparation begins very early in life, before a child even enters kindergarten, and continues\nthrough high school.\nOf course, there are well-paying jobs that don’t require a four-year college degree, and there are\nstudents for whom a four-year college just isn’t the right fit. Preparation at the K-12 level needs\nto include informing students about those opportunities and about how they can train for them,\nfor example at community colleges or via apprenticeship programs.\nAll that said, it doesn’t do much good to train people for jobs that don’t exist, so we need to look\nat the demand side as well. It can be challenging to lure employers to some rural and inner-city\n\n3\n\n\fareas, but workforce development can help by creating the skilled workers potential employers\nare looking for.\nMobility is another challenge in both rural and inner-city areas: Even if there are jobs, it can be\ndifficult for people to get to them. Rural areas lack public transportation, and in cities, you might\nhave to transfer buses three times. This is a topic outside the purview of a central bank per se, but\nour community development team has convened several symposia devoted to the topic.\nConclusion\nThe challenges are huge but so are the opportunities. If we want to our economy to continue to\ngrow, we need to find ways to address the obstacles many people face to joining the labor force.\nBy doing so, we also can address the poverty and associated ills that afflict far too many of our\nneighbors. The Richmond Bank is digging deeply into the issues and welcomes any thoughts you\nhave on possible solutions. And now, I look forward to hearing the thoughts of our panel.\n1\n\nThank you to Jessie Romero for assistance preparing these remarks.\nFor more on community development efforts in Baltimore, see Jeanne Milliken Bonds, Anne Burnett and Emma\nSissman, “Community Finance in East Baltimore: a Study of Phase One Redevelopment and Financing,” Federal\nReserve Bank of Richmond Community Practice Paper #3, 2018.\n3\nSee Emily Cook, Jessie Romero, and Sarah Turner, “Transitioning from High School to\nCollege: Differences across Virginia,” Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond Economic Brief no. 17-12, December\n2017.\n2\n\n4\n\n\f",

        "content": "The Outlook for Tomorrow: Five Numbers to Watch\nThomas I. Barkin\nPresident, Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond\nWest Virginia Economic Outlook Conference\nCharleston, West Virginia\nOctober 3, 2018\n\nThank you for inviting me to speak with you this morning. Since I joined the Fed in January, I’ve\nbeen traveling throughout our district to talk with the people who live and work here. This is my\nfirst trip to Charleston, and my goal is to be interesting enough that you’ll invite me back!\nI came to Richmond after a 30-year career in consulting at McKinsey, where I served as chief\nfinancial officer, chief risk officer and led our offices in the Southeast. I’ve spent my\nprofessional life helping firms make decisions about hiring, compensation and prices, and I’ve\nmade a lot of those decisions myself. My colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee\n(FOMC) are some of the most talented macroeconomists, bankers, academics and financial\nregulators in the country. But as the only committee member coming from management, I hope I\ncan bring a different perspective.\nThis morning, I’ll share some of that perspective with you. I’ll start with what I’m seeing in the\neconomy today. But my real focus is the outlook for tomorrow, including some key indicators\nI’m watching. And then I’ll be glad to take your questions. Before I say more, the views I\nexpress are my own and not necessarily those of the FOMC or the Federal Reserve System. 1\nToday\nGDP Growth\nIn the 1970s, economist Arthur Okun invented the Misery Index, the sum of the inflation and\nunemployment rates. At its peak in 1980, the index was almost 22 percent. Today, it’s about 6\npercent — they might want to rename it.\nWhat’s contributing to the economy’s strength? Let’s start with growth. Real GDP grew at about\n2.6 percent last year and topped 4 percent in the second quarter of this year. We won’t know for\na few more weeks if that pace continued in the third quarter, but most estimates put it above 3\npercent. Underlying that growth, in my view, is confidence. Business optimism is high, and the\nUniversity of Michigan’s Index of Consumer Sentiment is as high as it’s been since the early\n2000s. We’ve had fiscal stimulus in the form of tax cuts and the omnibus bill. There’s a sense\nthat we’re in a deregulatory moment. People have jobs, and the markets are strong. Overall, it’s\nstarting to feel like we’ve got some tailwinds rather than headwinds.\nThat said, I’m with the Fed, so I will be cautious. And certainly, trade disputes are making\npeople more nervous than they did a few months ago. In the Michigan Survey, the number of\nhouseholds that mentioned tariff concerns has more than doubled since May. In another survey\n1\n\n\fconducted by the Conference Board, we’re seeing a large gap open up between people’s\nperceptions of today and their expectations for tomorrow. The economy also faces supply chain\nconstraints and the risks of geopolitical instability and market volatility.\nLabor Markets\nAt least for now, though, businesses and consumers seem to be looking through these risks. One\nreason they’re doing so is the strength of the labor market. The economy has added an average of\nmore than 200,000 jobs per month since the start of the year. That’s a very large number; for\nperspective, the “breakeven” to keep up with our country’s population growth is around 80,000 –\n100,000 jobs per month.\nStrong job growth has contributed to unemployment below 4 percent, in the range of our lowest\nlevels since the late 1960s. At the same time, companies still want to hire — at 4.4 percent, the\njob vacancy rate is higher than the unemployment rate and about the highest it’s been since the\nBureau of Labor Statistics started tracking the data in 2000. In short, there are more job openings\nthan there are people looking for work. Vacancies are especially high in fields such as nursing,\nthe skilled trades and truck driving.\nI should note, however, that there are parts of the country still struggling. Here in West Virginia,\nfor example, there are counties where the unemployment rate remains near or even above 8\npercent, and the employment/population ratio is the lowest in the country at around 50 percent.\nThese are real challenges, and it’s important we do not lose sight of them when we talk about the\nstrength of the U.S. economy as a whole.\nInflation and Monetary Policy\nLet’s turn to inflation. We’re coming off a fairly long stretch where inflation ran below the Fed’s\n2 percent target. The numbers have firmed around our target in recent months, but it’s reasonable\nto ask why we’re not seeing more inflation, given the tightness of the labor market, the impact of\ntariffs and commodity cost pressure in places like pulp and oil.\nPart of the answer is that many firms don’t think they can pass on higher costs to consumers.\nThere are a number of reasons for this, including lagging productivity at rates that don’t offset\nwage increases; the buying power of big-box retailers; the price transparency provided by the\ninternet; and competition from lower-priced imports.\nAnother factor keeping inflation in check is that people believe the Fed is going to keep inflation\nin check. The 1970s taught us that inflation expectations play a large role in determining future\ninflation. Currently, multiple measures of inflation expectations are holding steady in line with\nthe Fed’s 2 percent target.\nTomorrow\nNow you might be wondering, how long can this continue? After all, the current economic\nexpansion has been going on for more than nine years — one of the longest upturns on record.\n2\n\n\fWell, I should be humble here: Economists are not the best at predicting the future. (Maybe I\nshould be doubly humble: Guys with 30 years in management aren’t that great at it either.) So\ninstead of telling you what’s going to happen, I’ll tell you about the numbers I’m watching,\nwhich hopefully will be of interest to you as well. Please recognize that when I talk about these\nnumbers, I’m not trying to anticipate shocks, such as a hard Brexit or a political crisis.\nBusiness Investment\nI watch business investment closely. It’s a strong indicator of continued confidence — firms\naren’t going to invest in the future unless they feel good about where we’re headed. This, in my\nview, is the major challenge presented by the discussions we’re having right now about tariffs.\nThey unsettle businesses at a time when strong growth ought to be motivating them to invest.\nInvestment has lagged for the past 10 years. Of course, we had a severe recession, but even\nduring the recovery it’s looked low relative to previous periods and relative to corporate\nprofitability. The last four quarters have been quite strong, however — as we’ve seen here in\nWest Virginia with, for example, the major expansions Toyota and Hino announced last fall.\nSome of that might be catch up; some of it might be those tailwinds I mentioned earlier. Either\nway, we need that confidence to continue for the economy to keep growing at its current rate.\nProductivity\nI’m also paying attention to productivity. That’s because if we want the economy to grow, we\nneed more people to work and/or we need them to be more productive. But the labor force is\ngrowing quite slowly for a variety of reasons, including declining fertility rates, an aging\npopulation and less immigration. This is certainly a challenge facing West Virginia, where the\npopulation has been declining since 2010 and which has the highest ratio of older adults to\nworking-age adults of any state in the Fifth District.\nIf the labor force is growing slowly, then that means economic growth depends on faster\nproductivity growth. But productivity growth also has been slow: Between 2006 and 2017, it\naveraged just 1.3 percent, compared to an average of 2.9 percent between 1995 and 2005. 2 I have\nto confess that I find this challenging to explain because it’s lower than what I think is the\npotential of American businesses. In my professional experience and in my conversations with\ncontacts throughout the district, businesses believe they are driving more productivity than the\ndata suggest, via automation, capital investments and operating efficiencies. Many are.\nIt’s unlikely that the slowdown is simply the result of measurement error, so there must be\nsomething else going on. It’s possible that the past decade of underinvestment has had an impact\non productivity. In addition, economists have found a lot of evidence pointing to decreased\nentrepreneurship. 3 Startups are responsible for a lot of innovation, so this could be contributing\nto slower productivity growth overall. Another explanation could be that some businesses are\ngetting more productive, but they’re doing so at the expense of their competitors, thus\ndampening the effect in aggregate.\n\n3\n\n\fProductivity growth was strong in the second quarter of this year, at 2.9 percent. If that marks the\nstart of a sustained upturn due to investments paying off and technology coming to fruition, it\ncould drive long-term healthy growth. If it’s a one-quarter blip and productivity returns to its\nslower trend, it could limit our economy’s potential growth.\nCompensation Growth for Job Stayers\nI’m watching growth in compensation. As I mentioned, the labor market is very tight. Yet wage\ninflation has been sluggish, averaging just 2.4 percent since 2015 (although it climbed to 2.9\npercent in August). During previous upswings, wage inflation approached 4 percent. One factor\nrestraining wage growth is that absent faster productivity, companies don’t think they have the\nability to increase prices to compensate for paying higher wages. Another major factor, in my\nview, is that turnover has been relatively low. A high percentage of wage costs goes to the\nretained base, and wages tend to rise more when people change jobs. We typically see faster\nwage increases when companies are competing for each other’s employees. But we’re not really\nseeing that competition yet.\nI see three potential paths for the evolution of the labor market. One possibility is that we find\nways to draw more people into the labor force. Although the decline in labor force participation\nover the past two decades is largely the result of demographic changes, there are large gaps by\ngeography, race, gender and education. 4 If we can address these gaps and more people come off\nthe sidelines, we would likely see continued economic growth combined with moderate wage\ngrowth. West Virginia is a state where the opportunities are huge.\nThe second possibility is that we see more of the same: The labor market remains tight but\ncompanies are unable to pass on wage increases so they accept supply constraints instead. In this\nscenario, wage growth is moderate and job growth eventually falls.\nThe third path is that companies decide they need to hire from their competitors. Turnover\nincreases, and companies start paying their current employees more to retain them. That could\ndrive faster inflation. For this reason, compensation growth for job stayers will be a number I’m\nwatching closely.\nConsumer Durables Prices\nI pay attention to prices for durable consumer goods, such as cars and refrigerators. Their prices\nare a key indicator of core inflation. Until around 1995, the price indices for durables,\nnondurables and services increased in tandem. But since then, prices for durable goods have\ndeclined while prices for nondurables and services have continued to increase.\nAs I noted, the internet and big-box retailers have likely been holding prices down, which has\nboth benefited consumers and restrained inflation. But as consumer goods companies’ margins\ncontinue to be squeezed due to increasing pressure from commodity costs and tariffs, they may\nhave no choice but to try to raise prices. We’ve already seen reports of price increases at some\nprominent consumer products firms. If these and future efforts are successful, inflation might\nwell pick up pace.\n4\n\n\fYield Curve\nThe final indicator I’m watching closely is the yield curve, which is the difference between\nshort-term and long-term interest rates. When these rates are close together, it could suggest\nmarkets are losing confidence in the outlook. Currently, many people are concerned about the\ncompression of the spread between 2-year and-10 year Treasuries. Their concern may well be\nwarranted, since an inversion of this yield curve has predicted seven of the last six recessions.\nI respect the 2-year/10-year spread as a signal. That said, I’m not inherently inclined to blindly\nfollow the market’s lead, so I’ve been digging into the research. The Board of Governors, for\nexample, recently published an article suggesting that nearer-term spreads have a better\nforecasting record than the traditional 2-year/10-year measure. 5 These have remained more\nstable and don’t show an elevated risk of recession at present.\nOf course, these market reads are complicated by our own large holdings of Treasuries, the\ndesire of foreign governments for safe assets and recent increases in Treasury purchases driven\nby our increasing deficit. Still, the yield curve is worth watching as well.\nConclusion\nNet, I’m watching five signals: business investment, productivity, compensation for job stayers,\nconsumer durables prices and the yield curve. While forecasting the future evolution of these\nsignals is challenging, I do want to leave you with the thought that the economy’s pulse, as we sit\nhere today, is strong. Growth is solid, unemployment is low and inflation is at target. The\nchallenge is not so much today, but rather ensuring that growth continues. I hope you’ll monitor\nthese five metrics with me over the next year as the Fed tries to do its part to support the\ncountry’s economic growth. Thank you, and I look forward to your questions.\n\n1\n\nThank you to Jessie Romero for assistance preparing these remarks.\nBased on real output per hour in the nonfarm business sector.\n3\nFor example, see Ryan A.
