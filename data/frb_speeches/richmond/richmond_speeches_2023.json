        "content": "Home / News / Speeches / Thomas I Barkin / 2023\n\nThe Richmond Fed has a beautiful building in downtown Richmond. It’s in a great location,\noverlooking the river, and serves as a focal point for collaboration, mentorship and\nconnection. But physically, it is quite literally an ivory tower. As we try to assess the macro\nforces a�ecting the economy, we don’t want our thinking to match the exterior of our\nbuilding.\nSo, we have oriented the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond outward. My colleagues and I\nare on the ground in the Fifth District constantly, meeting and learning from community\nmembers. Last year, we had over 1,700 engagements with external contacts — with\nbankers, business and community leaders, workers and public o�cials. These meetings\ntake us to every corner of our district — you can see on this map where I’ve been in the last\nfew years.\nI’ve been on the other side of these conversations. During my time in business in Atlanta, I\ngained a lot from interacting with the Atlanta Fed and Dennis Lockhart (the president at\nthat time). I learned from them, and hoped I helped them learn a little something too.\nBut this kind of high-touch outreach requires time and e�ort. And — perhaps most\nimportantly — it relies on the generosity of community members to share their time and\nperspective with us. Why go to all this e�ort?\n\nTake consumer demand. Overall, it looks solid, but conversations with retailers in our\ndistrict have helped us understand the nuance. Lower-price retailers tell us their customers\nhave pulled back amid in�ation and recession fears. As lower-income consumers are\nsqueezed on the essentials, say at the pump and the grocery store, their demand for items\nlike washing machines and TVs has dropped. In contrast, higher-priced retailers are still\nseeing wealthier consumers spend.\n\n\fOur conversations also help us see di�erences across geography more clearly than if we\nonly relied on local statistics, which often come with a lag and high margins of error. Take\nthis recent post-pandemic recovery period. Foot tra�c was back in South Carolina long\nbefore it returned in the District of Columbia. But we haven’t just learned about when areas\nrecovered, we’ve also gotten insight into the nature of their recovery. For example, a\nbusiness serving restaurants in the D.C. area told one of my colleagues that lunch demand\nhas still not recovered, likely given continuing remote work in the DMV area.\n\nFor example, why has the labor market stayed tight — even as rates have risen, sentiment\nhas fallen and the economy has slowed? On the demand side, employers tell us they are\nreluctant to let go of workers they fought for months to hire. They don’t want to lose them\nunless absolutely necessary.\nOn the supply side, we hear about workers facing new challenges that keep them from\nwork even as pandemic-related barriers fade. We saw this up close in a recent visit to\nsouthern Virginia (part of our Community Conversations event series which allows us to dig\nin deeply to local economies). My colleagues and I learned that the escalating costs of gas,\nhousing and child care have raised the barriers to working, even as wages have been rising.\nThis may be particularly problematic in rural areas given the distances required to drive to\nwork and the challenges providing basic services in less dense areas.\n\nThe national data we get comes a month late and can be revised multiple times over the\nnext year. It is far from de�nitive on what is happening in real time, so we supplement it\nwith conversations with our contacts who help us better understand how things are\nchanging.\nFor instance, in market outreach, we saw early signs of the housing market turn when\ncontacts shared that furniture sales had started to recede. And outside residential, we’ve\nheard about more projects in the commercial real estate space being put into “wait and\nsee” mode and many being canceled outright.\nBut we aren’t just relying on anecdotes. Our team �elds rigorous economic\nsurveys throughout our district. Take our monthly manufacturing and non-manufacturing\nsurveys — the two that probably get the most attention. The labor market has been tight\nacross the board, but they helped us spot a subtle shift. At the beginning of the year, �rms\nreported that it was relatively more di�cult to �ll low- to –mid-skill jobs than higher-skill\npositions. More recently, we are hearing that it is now harder to �ll mid- to –high-skill jobs,\nincluding everything from roles that require a CDL for truck driving to roles like marketing\nexecutives and accountants.\n\n\fWe �nd this especially important for small towns and rural communities. The data reports\nthat these communities are falling behind in employment, health and education. On-theground conversations allow us to understand what is being done to improve these\noutcomes.\nFor example, one underlying gap is access to capital. Our community development team\nhas heard about the challenges preparing for and absorbing capital. We saw this in the\nearly days of COVID-19, as communities told us they weren’t resourced to access even basic\nrelief funding. But we’ve also found people throughout our district working on creative\nsolutions to increase local capacity. These initiatives include investing in intermediary\norganizations, o�ering technical assistance and creating mentorship opportunities for\naspiring leaders. We shared these �ndings at our 2022 Investing in Rural America\nConference. We are already looking forward to our 2023 conference, where we hope to\nkeep learning and sharing.\n\nWe have 14 Community Conversations scheduled for the year ahead and our team will\nhave hundreds of touch points with business and community leaders throughout the Fifth\nDistrict. Here’s what I’ll be watching:\nIs in�ation calming? Are consumers slowing spending? Are supply issues resolving? What are\nbusiness leaders’ attitudes toward pricing? How are consumers reacting to higher prices?\nIs the labor market cooling? Will we see layo�s spread beyond housing and tech? Will those\non the sidelines �nally come back into the workforce? Will compensation increases\ncontinue, or slow?\nAre we headed for a recession? Businesses seem to have pulled out and updated their\nrecession playbooks. What happens next? Do they turn the pages in the book, or return it\nto the shelf?\nHow much of the pandemic economy sticks around? Do the sectors that bene�tted from\nCOVID-19 (e.g., recreational goods) get a permanent boost? How will commercial centers\nevolve in the context of hybrid work?\nWe will �nd answers to these questions (and likely learn of new ones) as we meet with\nmembers of our community this year. Thanks to all of you who have given and plan to give\nyour time, thoughts and insights.

I enjoy these January economic outlook conferences.\nThe timing is great to re�ect on the past year and then look forward. So, I will try to share\nmy re�ections on both, with a particular emphasis on the Fed and the economy. These are\nmy thoughts alone, and not those of anyone else in the Federal Reserve System.\nA year ago, the economy was booming. GDP grew 5.7 percent year-over-year in the fourth\nquarter of 2021, driven by the post-COVID-19 reopening, and the deployment of excess\n\n\fsavings built from �scal stimulus, suppressed pandemic-era spending and equity\nappreciation. The unemployment rate was at 4 percent, on its way to matching its 50-year\nlow. In�ation, on the other hand, was 6.1 percent headline and 5.2 percent core; it had\nsustained, broadened and become a problem.\nDuring the pandemic, the Fed supported demand by taking rates to zero and buying\ntrillions in government bonds. But at our December 2021 meeting, we announced the\ntapering of our asset purchase program and forecasted the start of rate increases in 2022.\nIt was time to prioritize containing in�ation.\nAnd that’s what we did last year. We started raising rates in March, accelerated the pace\nduring the summer and have now moved the overnight rate to 4.3 percent. That is the\nfastest tightening pace in 40 years. We also started reducing our balance sheet this\nsummer; it is down over $400 billion from its peak with more to come.\nWhy did the Fed move so aggressively? Well, the logic was straightforward. With in�ation so\nhigh and demand so strong, it made no sense to keep stimulating the economy. Doing so\ncould further put in�ation expectations at risk. So, we removed that stimulus as fast as we\nthought we could.\nBut I’d also make the case on an emotional level. Last year reminded all of us how much we\nhate in�ation. In�ation creates uncertainty. As prices rise unevenly, it becomes unclear\nwhen to spend, when to save or where to invest. In�ation is exhausting. It takes e�ort to\nshop around for better prices or to handle complaints from unhappy customers. And\nin�ation feels unfair — the wage increase you earned feels arbitrarily taken away at the gas\npump. We all hate in�ation and — when I look in the mirror — I ask, “If the Fed doesn’t do\nsomething about it, who will?”\nSo how is it working?\nMonetary policy works most directly through �nancial markets. As borrowing becomes\nmore costly, capital investment slows. So does consumer spending, especially in interestsensitive sectors like housing, auto and consumer durables. The dollar strengthens,\nlowering export demand and import prices. All these e�ects have been substantial. The\ndollar and the euro are now close to parity. Investment in structures is down. Mortgage\nrates more than doubled last year, bringing the housing market down from its pandemic\nhigh. Asset valuations have dropped, without any signi�cant structural market disruptions.\nDemand reduction in less interest-sensitive segments tends to take a bit longer. And\nremember that the pandemic era is still partly with us. Excess savings and the return of\nconsumer borrowing to pre-pandemic levels are funding continued strong consumption,\nespecially for services like travel. Billions in �scal appropriations are still being distributed.\nStrong pandemic-era order pipelines and the need for inventory replenishment are\nsustaining businesses. Employers who fought hard to hire scarce workers are reluctant to\n�re them. The unemployment rate remains at the historically low rate of 3.5 percent (and\nwe are still adding jobs, 223,000 in the December report).\n\n\fOnce demand weakens, studies estimate it can take another six to 12 months before those\npullbacks quiet the rate of in�ation. So, with demand slowing but resilient, labor markets\nhealthy, and the added and enduring shock of the war in Ukraine, it shouldn’t be a surprise\nthat in�ation — while likely past peak — is still elevated. The 12-month headline PCE\nremains at 5.5 percent, and the core is at 4.7 percent. Wage gains are still higher than prepandemic levels.\nWhere is the Fed headed next?\nLet me start by saying we still have work to do. In�ation is too high, and we will need to stay\non the case until it is sustainably back to our 2 percent target. We have forecasted\nadditional rate increases this year.\nThat said, we have slowed the pace of those increases. We moved quickly last year, but\nwhat we were doing was taking our foot o� the gas. Now, with forward-looking real rates\npositive across the curve and therefore our foot unequivocally on the brake, it makes sense\nto steer more deliberately as we work to bring in�ation down in the context of the lags I\njust discussed.\nTo that end, the last three months’ in�ation prints have been a step in the right direction,\nbut I would caution that while the average dropped, the median stayed high. That’s because\nthe average was distorted by declining prices for goods like used cars that escalated\nunsustainably during the pandemic. I saw one commentary celebrating that core CPI less\nshelter actually declined. But we all know what people care most about: food and gas and\nshelter.\nWith the Fed resolute on in�ation, that brings me to the outlook for the economy.\nThis has been the most predicted potential recession in memory. But, despite some scares\nearlier in the year, the data we’ve seen on spending, investment and employment keep\npushing the timeline out —unless you are in housing or sell into a low-income customer\nbase, or are a deal maker or are dependent on digital advertising.\nIn the rest of the economy, �rms know the Fed is taking strong action to combat in�ation\nand realize that creates downturn risk. They believe many of the arti�cial elements\nsupporting consumer spending will likely wane over time. They have updated their\nRecession Playbooks and may even be working the items on the �rst page, like headcount\nfreezes or discretionary spend reductions. But most haven’t turned the pages yet given\ntheir demand remains solid.\nBut they might. Perhaps because in�ation remains stubbornly high and requires more from\nus. Perhaps because a sector moves in unison as recently happened in tech. Or perhaps\nbecause of unexpected outside events like those that drove the last three recessions.\nI get a lot of questions about whether the Fed should remain this committed given that risk.\nI guess my simple answer is that everyone hates in�ation, and we are the ones mandated\nto address it. The Fed’s objective isn’t to hurt the economy; it’s to reduce in�ation.\n\n\fThe experience of the ’70s showed that if you back o� on in�ation too soon, it comes back\nstronger, requiring the Fed to do even more, with even more damage. If you change the\ntarget before it is achieved, as some have recently advocated, you put the Fed’s credibility\nat risk, which in turn increases the sacri�ce required in order to control in�ation. And if you\nthink supply chain improvements and our actions to date are enough to bring in�ation\ndown quickly, then our more gradual rate path should limit the harm.\nAnd I should use this moment to remind you that in�ation doesn’t come from statisticians.\nIt comes from the sum of actions of individual �rms. (So, if any of you in the audience have\na price increase in the works, feel free to help us all out by backing o�.)\nI like analogies, and one that hit me recently was hiking down a narrow trail after having\nclimbed a mountain. The peak of course being in�ation. You are tired. If you go too fast,\nyou could easily slip; so you move deliberately. There’s always a chance a storm could come\nup and muddy the trail. A path that seems solid could give way, forcing you to an\nalternative route. But you know your map is good, your tools are high-quality and there’s\nstill a lot of daylight left. So, like you, I’m looking forward to getting down this particular\nmountain, and telling the story of how we did it — preferably in front of a warm �re.\nWith that, let me open it up for questions and comments.\n\nIn�ation\n\nMonetary Policy\n\nReceive an email noti�cation when News is posted online:\nBy submitting this form you agree to the\n\nEmail Address\n\nSubscribe\n\n\f(804) 697-8956\n(804) 332-0207 (mobile)\n\n© 1997-2024 Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond\n\n\f",

        "content": "Home / News / Speeches / Thomas I Barkin / 2023\n\n2023 SIEPR Annual Economic Summit\nStanford University\nStanford, Calif.\n\n• The question of when in�ation gets back to normal is an important one for policy.\n• We would all like in�ation to fall quickly back to target. I am con�dent it will in time,\nbut doubtful the process will be quick.\n• I think it will take time to return to target, and, as a consequence, believe we still\nhave work to do.\n\nThis speech was delivered remotely.\nThanks for that nice introduction and for having me here today.\nOne favorite Fed buzzword is “data-dependence,” meaning we adjust our policy based on\nwhat we learn from incoming data. That sounds sensible but isn’t easy. After all, the prints\nwe see largely come in with a month’s delay and can be revised multiple times. So, I spend\na good part of my time outside our building trying to learn by gathering “real-time”\ninformation from businesses, community organizations and groups like the Stanford\nInstitute for Economic Policy Research (SIEPR).\nIf you are following the economy closely, you know that recent data has been confusing, so\nI thought I might spend my time today talking about how I am seeing the economy, and the\nimplications for in�ation and for policy. I caution these are my thoughts only and not\nnecessarily those of anyone else in the Federal Reserve System.\nIf you were looking at economic data a few weeks ago, the story seemed pretty clear and\nconsistent. Demand was softening. The labor market was cooling. And in�ation was\n\n\fsettling. People were actually starting to imagine we were well on our way to the proverbial\n“soft landing.”\nBut January data is telling a very di�erent story. Consumer spending, job growth and\nin�ation have all accelerated. Is January an aberration, or is the economy actually stronger\nthan we had thought?\nLet’s start with demand. In January, real consumer spending saw the largest monthly\nincrease since March 2021, up 1.1 percent. Real disposable income jumped 1.4 percent as\nJanuary wage and Social Security increases came on line. Real-time information from credit\ncard companies con�rms that consumers spent freely in January. So, I see the jump as real,\nbut doubt that it is as large as portrayed, or is sustainable. The weather has been\nunseasonably warm (everywhere but California), and that likely has goosed spending. And it\nseems clear that the holiday season (with gift cards) has now stretched from two months to\nfour months. Retail sales in October to January grew at only a 2.6 percent annual rate,\nmaking January partly a payback for a weak December. Finally, this data is seasonally\nadjusted, and I do wonder whether the last two year’s January COVID-19 outbreaks didn’t\namplify the strength of this January.\nSeasonal adjustments also matter in the labor market. We saw a huge jobs number in\nJanuary — more than half a million added. But to give you a sense of how these\nadjustments work: Normally employment drops by about 2.9 million in January as holiday\nhiring is reversed. This year, employment dropped only 2.5 million. After adjustment, you\nsee the half million growth number. Is it likely that, in today’s labor market, employers were\nmore reluctant to shed workers than in previous years? I think so.\nBut that said, the labor market is still quite tight. The unemployment rate is 3.4 percent, a\n54-year low. Employers tell me they aren’t as desperate as they were a year ago, but it is\nstill di�cult to �nd workers. I hear that particularly for skilled trades like nursing,\nconstruction and mechanics.\nThere have been a number of layo� announcements recently, particularly here, but I would\nnote they have been disproportionately professionals rather than frontline workers.\nRepotting is never easy, but unemployment for those with a college degree is quite low: 2\npercent. That suggests whatever labor market adjustments are required may come with\nless of a price than prior downturns. We aren’t likely to repeat the Great Recession’s painful\nRust Belt construction and manufacturing challenges.\nFinally, let’s spend some time on in�ation. After several months on a downward path,\nin�ation accelerated in January, in both month-over-month and year-over-year terms. And\nthe encouraging fourth quarter in�ation numbers were revised upward. Is this just a blip on\nthe path back to our 2 percent target? Or a signal that we still have a long way to go?\nThe question of when in�ation gets back to normal is an important one for policy, so I want\nto spend some time on it. Some believe this will happen pretty quickly. Until a recent\nupward spurt, that’s where markets were. And, ahead of the most recent in�ation data, the\n\n\faverage respondent in the Survey of Professional Forecasters projected in�ation at 2.6\npercent annualized by the fourth quarter of this year. Why may you expect a quick return\nto normal?\nYou might hang your hat on the transitory concept. Transitory has two di�erent de�nitions:\nbrief, and not permanent. In�ation certainly hasn’t been brief, but maybe getting to the\nother side just takes time. After all, supply chain issues are easing. Most people are back to\nwork. Transportation costs have come down. Broad commodity price in�ation has returned\nto pre-pandemic levels. And �scal stimulus is waning. If in�ation was largely physical or\n�scal-driven, then it could decline pretty quickly as we return to normal.\nOr you might think the Fed’s rate hikes and balance sheet reductions thus far are su�cient\nbut will take e�ect with the usual delay. Our moves impact �nancial conditions fairly quickly\nbut take time to work their way through the real economy. If we’ve hiked enough, as we\nmake our way through that lag, in�ation could quickly fall. After all, liquidity is leaving the\nsystem, the housing boom has subsided, demand is likely normalizing and wages are\nsettling.\nOr you could even believe the Fed is going to do more than we have signaled to date and is\nplanning to clamp down in an even more aggressive manner, risking a deep recession, to\nsnap in�ation down quickly. Volcker proved we have this power should we want to use it.\nTo be clear, I have not seen anyone suggest in�ation has yet become the problem Volcker\nfaced in the early 1980s.\nBy this point, you might have gathered that I don’t think normalization will be this easy.\nReturning prices to the stability of the last 30 years will likely take a lot more time and\ne�ort. I think my view is in step with the actions of the Federal Open Market Committee\n(and with the most recent Summary of Economic Projections (SEP) that showed in�ation\nnot returning to 2 percent until 2025). Why do I see this �ght lasting longer?\nPartly because some of the dislocations we saw in the pandemic are enduring. Over a\ntrillion in excess savings are still funding consumption, as are continuing �scal outlays like\nthe infrastructure bill. New auto inventories and houses for sale remain near historic lows,\nsupporting prices in those sectors. Supply chain challenges remain, for example, in\nswitchgears and cabinets. The labor market remains historically tight, as I said earlier. And\nChina’s reopening and events in Ukraine may well also pressure commodity prices.\nAdditional in�ationary pressure comes from �rms and workers trying to recapture lost\nground. I hear from a number of sectors (like health care, utilities and food) whose margins\nhave compressed and who feel the need to restore them through further price increases.\nThey will presumably be motivated to move more aggressively than those sectors whose\nmargins improved and who may eventually be pushed by their customers to give on price.\nSimilarly, workers whose real wages fell are pressing to catch up. I’ve heard of many largerthan-normal increases in the end-of-year merit process.\nAnd I’d also point to in�ation expectations. While they remain well anchored on average,\n\n\fthere’s been enough movement under the surface to warrant caution. The University of\nMichigan Survey of Consumers has seen the one-year median expected in�ation rate fall\nfrom its pandemic high of 5.4 percent to 4.1 percent in the most recent reading. But this\nmasks an increase in the range of responses. By one measure, that spread is at levels last\nseen in 1982. And research on the ’70s found that an increase in the standard deviation of\nin�ation expectations preceded high and unanchored in�ation expectations. It’s worth\nremembering that even with Volcker’s aggressive approach, it took years to corral\nexpectations back to a narrow range. While his era was certainly di�erent (unanchored\nexpectations, no target, higher in�ation), it took until 1983 to get in�ation below 4 percent\nand 1986 to get to 2 percent.\nMost fundamentally, two years of high in�ation, and ubiquitous conversation about\nin�ation, has surely had an impact on �rm behavior. I think about it like this: For a\ngeneration, business leaders have learned not to count on pricing to drive pro�ts. Large\nretailers (like Walmart or Home Depot) resisted every price increase with fervor and had\noptions to redirect their business to lower-cost suppliers overseas. Consumers found that\nthey had power as well through price-shopping enabled by e-commerce. The Fed had\nearned real credibility for its ability to deliver stable prices; you could say we played a role\nin every wage and every price negotiation.\nNow, pricing is back in play. Its impact is considerable: Successful increases �ow straight to\nthe bottom line. Businesses have found inelasticity they hadn’t had the courage to test for\npreviously and are looking to �nd more. Supply chain challenges have worn down\npurchasing departments; they seem now more willing to accept increases, at a time when\nvolatility has made supplier cost structures more opaque and availability more important.\nIn most companies, there is a continual tug of war between a �nance team that sees price\nas a path to pro�ts and a sales team that fears loss of business and market share. Sales\nwon for years, but �nance is winning now and will continue to keep pressure on prices until\ncustomers and competitors reassert themselves.\nMonetary policy plays an important role here. We have raised rates and reduced our\nbalance sheet aggressively in the last year in an e�ort to bring demand and supply back\ninto balance. In�ation is likely past peak. But I think it will take time to return to target, and,\nas a consequence, believe we still have work to do. We have forecasted additional rate\nincreases and the SEP has made clear that we don’t anticipate rate cuts this year.\nThe Fed’s objective isn’t to hurt the economy, it’s to reduce in�ation. And if there is one\nthing we’ve relearned over the last two years, it is that everybody hates in�ation. High\nin�ation creates uncertainty. As prices rise unevenly, it becomes unclear when to spend,\nwhen to save or where to invest. In�ation is exhausting. It takes e�ort to shop around for\nbetter prices or to handle complaints from unhappy customers. And in�ation feels unfair —\nthe wage increase you earned feels arbitrarily taken away at the gas pump.\nThe Fed is the organization charged with �ghting in�ation, and we have made our resolve\nclear. The experience of the ’70s is compelling. If you back o� on in�ation too soon, it\n\n\fcomes back stronger, requiring the Fed to do even more, with even more damage. I’d like to\navoid that.\nBut with real rates having risen dramatically in the last year, and sitting at positive levels\nacross the curve, it makes sense to move more deliberately than we did last year. Here’s\nwhere I come back to data dependence. If I’m right and in�ation persists, we can react by\nraising rates further. And, of course, I’d be happy to be wrong.\nWe would all like in�ation to fall quickly back to target. I am con�dent it will in time but\ndoubtful the process will be quick. But I should close by reminding you that in�ation doesn’t\ncome from statisticians but from the sum of individual actions. (So, if any of you in the\naudience have a price increase in the works, feel free to help us all out by backing o�.)\nWith that, I am looking forward to your questions and input.\n\nIn�ation\n\nMonetary Policy\n\nReceive an email noti�cation when News is posted online:\nBy submitting this form you agree to the\n\nEmail Address\n\nSubscribe\n\n(804) 697-8956\n\n\f(804) 332-0207 (mobile)\n\n© 1997-2024 Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond\n\n\f",

But I still think it could take time\nfor in�ation to return to target.\n• Policy will need to be nimble. If in�ation persists, we can react by raising rates\nfurther. If I am wrong about the pricing dynamics at play, or about credit conditions,\nthen we can respond appropriately.\n\nThank you for that kind introduction and for having me here today.\nYou follow the news. One of the 20 largest banks, one with heavy sectoral and regional\nexposure, was caught wrongfooted. There was a run on the bank. The Federal Deposit\nInsurance Corporation (FDIC) took over in the second largest bank failure in U.S. history.\nDepositors were protected, but it was a shock, nonetheless. In order to control higher-thandesired in�ation, the Fed chose not to back o� its plan to continue tightening. You know\nthis story. But I’m not talking about Silicon Valley Bank. I’m describing the 1988 failure of\nFirst Republic Bank in Texas. There’s no connection to the bank with the same name in the\nnews today.\nWhy do I start with that story? It’s not a perfect historical parallel, but it’s worth\nremembering that not every bank failure becomes Lehman Brothers. We are all\nunderstandably scarred by that memory, but banks have failed throughout our history,\n\n\fmany without creating a broader crisis. Thirty-�ve years later, few of us remember First\nRepublic Bank in Texas (which by the way was also sold to a North Carolina bank — one\nnow called Bank of America).\nHow does that story relate to today? F. Scott Fitzgerald wrote: “The test of a �rst-rate\nintelligence is the ability to hold two opposed ideas in the mind at the same time ...” My dad\nput it simpler, saying I “needed to learn to walk and chew gum.” The challenge in assessing\ntoday’s economy is reconciling the strength of the recent data with the potential for\nweakness coming from the banking system. Let me take you through how I am thinking\nabout each, and the potential implications for Fed policy. These are my thoughts alone and\nnot necessarily those of anyone else in the Federal Reserve System.\nLet’s start with the banking system. The past few weeks brought the failure of two banks\noverexposed to crypto, and one with a severe asset/liability duration mismatch. Depositors\ngot nervous and moved with unprecedented speed. The resulting systemic risk brought\nstrong interventions. To mitigate the risk of comparable runs at other banks, the FDIC\nguaranteed all uninsured deposits at Silicon Valley Bank and Signature. To reduce liquidity\nrisk, the Fed Board, with Treasury approval and backstop, created an emergency lending\nfacility particularly attractive to banks holding Treasury and mortgage-backed securities\nwith unrealized losses.\nThe broader implications of these events aren’t yet clear. There are still, to be sure, a few\nindividual banks working through their own issues. But overall deposit �ows appear\nrelatively stable. Banks have worked with intensity to ensure they have adequate liquidity.\nAnd, as I’ve talked to banks in my district, I’ve been encouraged by the resilience I’ve seen.\nBut even resilient banks can impact the broader economy if, to minimize their liquidity risk\nand protect capital, they choose to tighten access to credit. Research shows that such a\npullback would limit consumer spending and curtail business investment. But it is too early\nto know whether that will happen now, or not.\nThese failures hit at a time when economic data was coming in strong. 351,000 jobs were\nadded on average over the past three months — about four times the pace needed to keep\nup with labor force growth. Unemployment remains historically low, at 3.6 percent.\nIn�ation, though down from peak, continues to come in hot. Headline CPI was at 6 percent\nin February, and core was at 5.5 percent. Monetary policy is famously said to work with long\nand variable lags, but our 475 basis points of rate hikes over the past year have not yet\ncompellingly moved in�ation back toward our 2 percent target.\nIt is possible that tightening credit conditions, along with the lagged e�ect of our rate\nmoves, will bring in�ation down relatively quickly. But I still see three reasons why it could\ntake time for in�ation to return to target.\nFirst, the pandemic is still with us. Not the public health crisis, thankfully, but the economic\ndislocation it caused. Over a trillion dollars in excess savings and trillions more in equity\nand housing wealth are funding consumption. Fiscal outlays are continuing, like the\n\n\finfrastructure bill and state tax cuts. Order backlogs are still being worked down.\nInventories remain short in autos and homes, supporting prices in those sectors. The labor\nmarket remains historically tight, as I said earlier, in part because employers who have\nstruggled to �nd workers are reluctant to let them go.\nSecond, �rms and workers are intent on recapturing lost ground. I hear from a number of\nsectors (like health care, utilities and food) that margins have compressed and that they\nnow feel the need to restore them through further price increases. Similarly, workers\nwhose real wages fell are pressing to catch up. Both of these imply further in�ationary\npressure.\nAnd third, and perhaps most fundamentally, two years of high in�ation and ubiquitous\nconversation about in�ation have surely had an impact on �rm behavior. I think about it\nlike this: For a generation, business leaders learned not to count on pricing to drive pro�ts.\nLarge retailers resisted every price increase and had options to redirect their business to\nlower-cost suppliers overseas. Consumers found that they had power as well through priceshopping enabled by e-commerce. The Fed had earned real credibility for its ability to\ndeliver stable prices; you could say we played a role in every wage and every price\nnegotiation.\nBut now pricing is back in play. Its impact is considerable as successful increases �ow\nstraight to the bottom line. Businesses have found inelasticity they hadn’t had the courage\nto test for previously and are looking to �nd more. Supply chain challenges have worn\ndown purchasing departments; they seem now more willing to accept increases, at a time\nwhen volatility has made supplier cost structures more opaque and availability more\nimportant. In most companies, there is a continual tug of war between a �nance team that\nsees price as a path to pro�ts and a sales team that fears loss of business and market\nshare. Sales won for years, but �nance is winning now and will continue to keep pressure\non prices until customers and competitors reassert themselves.\nLet me now turn to our most recent meeting. I saw substantial in�ationary pressure and a\nresilient banking system. So, I supported raising rates 25 basis points. I am heavily\nin�uenced by the experience of the 70s. If you back o� on in�ation too soon, in�ation\ncomes back stronger, requiring the Fed to do even more, with even more damage. With\nin�ation high, broad-based and persistent, I didn’t want to take that risk.\nBut policy will need to be nimble. Most forecasts of our policy path seem to average the risk\nof higher in�ation with the risk of further contagion in banking. I still see the range of\npotential outcomes as pretty wide. If in�ation persists, we can react by raising rates further.\nIt was only a few weeks ago that some were calling for a 50-basis-point increase. And if I am\nwrong about the pricing dynamics at play, or about credit conditions, then we can respond\nappropriately.\nI started by quoting two great Americans: F. Scott Fitzgerald, and my dad. So let me close by\nquoting a third one: Ted Lasso, who said, “There’s two buttons I never like to hit … And\n\n\fthat’s ‘panic’ and ‘snooze.’” So, I am keeping calm in these uncertain times, and watching\ncarefully.\nThanks, and I look forward to your questions and comments.\nIn 1988, 40 bank subsidiaries and one credit card subsidiary of the First RepublicBank\nCorporation in Dallas — the 14th largest bank holding company at the time — failed.\n(Source: FDIC in Managing the Crisis: The FDIC and RTC Experience).\n\nIn�ation\n\nMonetary Policy\n\nReceive an email noti�cation when News is posted online:\nBy submitting this form you agree to the\n\nEmail Address\n\nSubscribe\n\n(804) 697-8956\n(804) 332-0207 (mobile)\n\n\f© 1997-2024 Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond\n\n\f",

        "content": "Home / News / Speeches / Thomas I Barkin / 2023\n\nInvesting in Rural America Conference\nHotel Roanoke\nRoanoke, Va.\n\n• As I talk to employers considering expansions and as I talk to community leaders\ntrying to recruit �rms, there's an increasing focus on talent.\n• Small towns are going to have to up their games on the attraction, development and\nretention of talent.\n• Small towns in our district are recruiting talent like they cultivate employers: they are\ntelling their stories, making moving easy, creating incentives and strengthening their\nhomegrown workforce pipelines.\n\nThanks for joining us today. At the Richmond Fed, we're committed to understanding the\nunique challenges faced by small towns and rural communities across our district. We are\nconstantly on the ground with local stakeholders in these communities, learning about\ntheir challenges and promising solutions. Once a year, we invite these leaders, along with\nother rural development experts, to share their perspectives on a bigger stage. I hope you\ncome away from this event as energized and recommitted as we do each year.\nOver the last few decades, we've seen small towns struggle, particularly those that lost\nmanufacturers who had historically helped build communities, employ residents and forge\nlocal identities. As a natural reaction, economic development in small town America has\noften focused on replacing those big employers in order to rebuild the tax base and\nreemploy those displaced. These e�orts attracted heavy investment in time and money, but\nsuccess wasn't easy.\nIn the last few years, the focus of recruiting e�orts has shifted. We saw it nationally with\n\n\fAmazon's HQ2 decision a few years ago. When northern Virginia won this very competitive\ncontest, the determining factor didn't seem to be the direct economic incentives but\ninstead the state's workforce and commitment to develop an even stronger employee\npipeline.\nThe same criteria are coming to smaller towns. As I talk to employers considering\nexpansions and as I talk to community leaders trying to recruit �rms, there's an increasing\nfocus on talent. You hear it most clearly in reshoring conversations; businesses question\nhow they could relocate when they don't have con�dence they will �nd the necessary\nworkers.\nThe importance of a robust, reliable labor supply isn't news to small towns. We all know\ntheir challenges in workforce recruitment and development. But, especially now that the\npandemic has tightened the labor market further, smaller communities are going to have\nto �gure out how to put their best foot forward. To win, small towns are going to have to up\ntheir games on the attraction, development and retention of talent. What does that entail?\nOne way that I like to frame this challenge is by comparing it to cultivation of employers.\nSmall towns will need to recruit talent the way they recruit companies, which means\npursuing four strategies.\n\nSmall towns need to tell their stories. The last few years opened a door. Workers seem to\nincreasingly value what small towns o�er — space, a�ordability, the outdoors. And of\ncourse, remote work frees workers to live anywhere. But open doors don't guarantee new\nworkers will walk in. Each town is now competing with every other small town. That's where\nthe story comes in.\nThese stories almost always start with a sense of place, and there are a lot of options. In\nLake City, South Carolina, for example, a nine-day art festival and competition has\nexpanded the creative economy and brought crowds to town. With displays in a wide array\nof local venues, the town isn't just showcasing art, it's showcasing what Lake City has to\no�er.\nOther towns create a sense of place by rehabilitating their downtowns and bringing in\nshopping and restaurants. Danville, here in Virginia, comes to mind. It has developed its\nriverfront, building apartments with nearby dining establishments and creating a lively,\ndowntown feel.\nTowns can leverage nearby amenities. As Fayetteville, West Virginia, transitioned away from\ncoal, it turned to outdoor recreation, which in turn attracted entrepreneurial types who in\nturn created an entrepreneurial culture that persisted.\nIf a town can't tell a story on its own, we are seeing regions work together to bundle one.\nSouthwest Virginia has The Crooked Road heritage music trail, the historic Barter Theatre in\n\n\fAbingdon, the Spearhead Trails for adventure, and wineries, breweries and shopping for\nafter the adventure. In southern West Virginia, we've seen similar e�orts built around the\nHat�eld-McCoy Trails.\nIt's not always about starting something new to create a sense of place but about\nsuccessfully selling what you already are. We'll hear this afternoon from Colleen Roberts\nwho will share on the \"If you build it, will they come?\" panel about how New Bern, North\nCarolina, survived a hurricane and found a compelling way to communicate its story.\nThese stories bring in new talent. But they also help keep kids from moving away. I grew up\nin Tampa. In Tampa, the draw was clear. It's warm. We have beaches. We constantly asked\nourselves: Why would anyone leave? And really only I did.\n\nIn today's world, the ultimate barrier to moving is housing. Every town seeing success is\nexperiencing this challenge. Simply put, the math isn't working to put new residents into\na�ordable homes. We don't have enough supply. And building is getting ever more\nexpensive with construction, interest and labor costs up.\nSmall towns face their own issues. Their housing stock is often less contemporary. Rough\nterrain and absentee landlords often inhibit construction. Developers often have better\noptions elsewhere.\nBut I ask myself: Why can't we change the math? If we can �nd the funding to create\nbuildable sites for businesses, why can't we develop buildable homesites for developers? If\ncities can transform o�ce space into apartments, why can't small towns repurpose their\nold commercial or municipal spaces into residences?\nCarroll County, Virginia, did just that. Working with Virginia Housing Development Authority\nand developer Landmark Asset Services, it transformed a historic high school into 51\na�ordable housing units. The county donated the school. Virginia Housing helped identify\nLandmark as a willing developer and o�ered permanent �nancing at a below-market rate.\nLandmark brought its expertise in adaptive reuse and a�ordable housing development.\nTogether, they made the math work.\nThis afternoon, we will hear from DeWitt House of the Harvest Foundation who will be\nsharing how public-private partnerships can make the math work. They are standing up a\nnew neighborhood with a�ordable housing units in Martinsville, Virginia.\nMaking moving easy (for both workers and their spouses) also means ensuring access to\nhigh-speed, reliable broadband. We've talked about this for years, but the last three years\nreally brought it home. Progress is coming, as the funds provided in the Infrastructure\nInvestment and Jobs Act fully roll out. But the mere existence of funding is not enough — it\nneeds to reach the communities in need. At one of this morning's panels, you can hear\nfrom Heidi Binko of the Just Transition Fund which is focusing on ensuring available public\n\n\ffunding makes it to such communities.\n\nWest Virginia is actually testing out a pretty direct incentive. Through their Ascend West\nVirginia program, they are paying a select set of individuals to move to the state. The\nincentives include $12,000 over the �rst two years, access to free coworking space, and free\noutdoor recreation and gear rental for a year. We're glad to have one of the key architects\nof the program, Danny Twilley, here with us today.\nBut there are other ways to motivate people to join their local workforce.\nLet's start with child care because �nding and paying for high quality child care can become\nso costly it makes more sense for a parent to stay home. United Way of Southwest Virginia\nhas leveraged state and federal funding to expand access to a�ordable child care by\ncreating a new facility, giving technical assistance to existing ones and building up the\nsector's workforce — with the intent that local employers will support these facilities over\ntime. In West Virginia, the Chamber of Commerce worked to get legislation passed last year\nto provide a tax credit to businesses that create a childhood facility on their premises.\nTransportation is also a motivator to connect people to places of employment. It has\nattracted some controversy, but beach communities have transported workers into their\nmarkets for years. The city of Wilson, North Carolina, is trying a more tailored approach; it\nhas partnered with Via Transportation to replace its traditional bus system with an ondemand microtransit service. This allows riders to get curb-to-curb rides for a low price,\nsaving time and expanding access to those who did not previously live near a bus route.\nApproximately half the rides are to or from work.\nCommunities are also tackling more personal barriers to entry, like health or criminal\nrecords. We will hear more in this morning's panel on drawing talent o� the sidelines.\n\nEducation and connecting locals to jobs is an evergreen challenge. But we are seeing a lot\nof innovation in this arena.\nGO TEC (which stands for Great Opportunities in Technology and Engineering Careers) is\nhelping build a pipeline of talent for Virginia's strategic sectors. Hoping to spark early\ninterest, the program exposes middle schoolers to various career pathways, such as\nrobotics and health care, as well as industry jargon and relevant equipment. Once in high\nschool, students have access to industry certi�cation programs, and may then pursue\npostsecondary degrees. Telly Tucker, president of the Institute for Advanced Learning and\nResearch, is a key partner in the e�ort and is on one of our panels this afternoon.\nThe STEM East Network in North Carolina is training the key in�uencers in youth's lives —\neducators — to understand the workforce needs of the region. The hope is they in turn will\n\n\fhelp students visualize what participating in the local labor market could be like.\nThe Surry-Yadkin Works partnership, in North Carolina, allows high school students to\nintern at local companies and access resources at their local community college. Students\nearn a real wage, a transportation subsidy, work experience, and the opportunity to get\ncollege credit and industry-recognized credentials. Nearly 70 percent of participants\ncontinued to work on their internships after �nishing the experience.\nTo close, it's trendy to say that post-COVID-19 we are in a \"new normal.\" But I really do\nthink, when it comes to small town economic development, the ground has shifted. The\nfocus that employers are placing on talent is palpable, and those who can supply that talent\nwill be the winners. The good news is that remote work puts a lot more small towns in the\ncompetitive set, and that small towns o�er a sense of place and community that many of\ntoday's workers want, so long as they can provide the housing, broadband and amenities\nthat these workers need.\nI walked through some promising examples today of how communities are innovating, but\nthere are many more to share, and I look forward to learning from all our panelists. Now I\nwant to turn it over to U.S. Sen. Mark Warner. You all know him well, but I want to thank\nhim for setting me and the Richmond Fed on this journey supporting small towns. In my\n�rst meeting with him, he urged me to dig into the di�erences in economic outcomes\nbetween urban and rural markets, and between similarly situated smaller towns. He\ninspired all we are doing, and I look forward to learning more from him now. Thanks, and\nenjoy the rest of the day.\n\nEmployment and Labor Markets\n\nSmall Town and Rural Communities\n\nCommunity Development Finance\n\nReceive an email noti�cation when News is posted online:\nBy submitting this form you agree to the\n\n\fEmail Address\n\nSubscribe\n\n(804) 697-8956\n(804) 332-0207 (mobile)\n\n© 1997-2024 Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond\n\n\f",

That story relies on\nweakening demand to control in�ation.\n• I am still looking to be convinced, both that demand is settling and that any\nweakness is feeding through to in�ation. We will learn a lot more over the next few\nmonths.\n• The Fed has moved aggressively against in�ation. But we have been moderating the\npace of those increases. Think of it as slowing your boat as you approach the dock.\n• If coming data doesn’t support the plausible story, I’m comfortable doing more. The\nexperience of the ‘70s provides a clear lesson: If you back o� in�ation too soon,\nin�ation comes back stronger, requiring the Fed to do even more, with even more\ndamage.\n\nThank you for that kind introduction and for having me here. I will talk a bit about the state\nof the economy and then look forward to your questions. These are my thoughts alone and\nnot necessarily those of anyone else in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nI want to start with in�ation. While down from its peak, in�ation remains too high. Our\ntarget is 2 percent, and that has served us well for a generation. But in April, 12-month\nheadline PCE was 4.4 percent. Core was at 4.7 percent. We got the May CPI on Tuesday, and\nit showed 12-month headline at 4.0 percent and core at 5.3 percent.\n\n\fIf there is one thing we have relearned over the past two years, it is that everyone hates\nin�ation. High in�ation creates uncertainty. As prices rise unevenly, it becomes unclear\nwhen to spend, when to save or where to invest. In�ation is exhausting. It takes e�ort to\nshop around for better prices or to handle complaints from unhappy customers. And\nin�ation feels unfair — the wage increase you earned feels arbitrarily taken away at the gas\npump.\nThe Fed has moved aggressively against in�ation, hiking rates 5 percentage points in the\nlast 15 months. But in�ation has proven stubbornly persistent. That’s true even if you\nexclude shelter in�ation, whereby some accounts the data is lagging. I like to monitor\nmonthly median PCE to look at the breadth of in�ation. But it hasn’t come in at levels\nconsistent with our 2 percent target in any month since spring of 2021. It’s hard to say we’re\napproaching our target when we haven’t yet hit it even for one month.\nIn part, I think in�ation has persisted because the pandemic has remained with us — not\nthe public health crisis, thankfully, but the economic dislocation it caused. Demand remains\nelevated, supported by ongoing �scal outlays, nearly a trillion dollars in excess savings and\ntens of trillions more in added equity and housing wealth. At the same time, supply is still\nconstrained by pandemic-era retirements and residual supply chain challenges in areas like\nautos, switchgears and machinery. The process of getting supply and demand back in\nbalance has been slow.\nIt’s also clear that the in�ation experience of the last few years has left its mark. Businesses\nhave rediscovered the pricing lever. If they can raise prices and not lose much volume, they\nhave an e�cient path to increased earnings. They won’t throw that option away until\ncompetitors and customers force their hand.\nSo, the Fed is still working to bring in�ation back to target.\n\nNow I do see a story — a plausible story — for how in�ation comes down. That story relies\non weakening demand to control in�ation.\nDemand weakens because rate increases work with a lag. We started increasing rates 15\nmonths ago, and many models estimate their impact starts to really hit around now.\nDemand weakens because credit conditions tighten. Following the bank turmoil earlier this\nyear, banks preserve liquidity and protect earnings by stepping back from marginal\nlending. And demand weakens because the pandemic economy continues to fade. Savings\nare spent down. Fiscal stimulus wanes. Consumption normalizes. As demand settles, that\nreduces its imbalance with supply and brings in�ation back to target.\nIt’s a plausible story. But this isn’t our �rst camp�re. We have all told ourselves a number of\nstories over the last two years. They each seemed compelling at the time, but in�ation\nhasn’t yet seen a happy ending. At �rst, in�ation seemed transitory, as �scal stimulus faded\nand the economy fully reopened. Then supply chain remediation and lower commodity\nprices looked likely to feed through to prices. Then, when we raised rates and shrunk our\n\n\fbalance sheet so aggressively last year, you might have thought in�ation would have\nquickly come back in line. But in�ation, while down, is still elevated.\nSo, I am still looking to be convinced, both that demand is settling and that any weakness is\nfeeding through to in�ation. That is particularly challenging because the data has been\njumping around.\nLet me take you through how I’m seeing that story develop.\nI do believe demand is softening. You can see the impact of rate hikes in more interestsensitive sectors like housing, manufacturing and business investment. Banks are feeling\nmargin pressure and tell me they are absolutely stepping back from riskier sectors, newer\ncustomers and less pro�table loans. That seems to have particularly hit small businesses\nand commercial real estate. And those who sell to lower-income segments tell me these\nconsumers are cutting back and trading down, as pandemic era supports expire.\nBut consumer spending remains resilient. Think of it as weaker but not yet weak. Higherincome consumers are still spending, and higher wages are supporting consumption too.\nOver the last six months, the o�cial data has bounced around, with two strong months and\nfour weak ones. I take a lot of signal from credit and debit card data which shows yearover-year spending �attish since February.\nThat brings us to the labor market. Here, while secondary indicators like job openings and\nquit rates seem to be normalizing, we keep adding jobs month after month after month.\n339,000 jobs were created in May — over three times the breakeven rate. Supply is getting\na boost from increased prime-age participation and a bounce back in immigration. My\ncorner sports bar has now reopened on Sundays and Mondays. Unemployment remains at\na historically low 3.7 percent, and wage growth is still above pre-pandemic levels.\nI’m increasingly wondering whether the pandemic era hasn’t made the labor market\nsomewhat more resilient. When you think of a slowdown, you naturally think of 2008 when\nmanufacturing workers were sidelined across the Rust Belt and those last into the\nworkforce bore a disproportionate burden. But those are the workers I hear are most in\ndemand today, as manufacturing plants, hotels, construction sites and restaurants remain\nshort of workers. Recent large company layo� announcements have targeted\nadministrative functions, not front-line workers. These workers may have a lower\npropensity to �le for unemployment, typically are unemployed for shorter periods, and\noften can leverage backup savings to bridge their consumption.\nThe question is whether in�ation can settle while higher-income consumers are still\nspending, and the labor market remains this robust. We will learn a lot more over the next\nfew months.\n\nAs I said earlier, the Fed has raised rates aggressively. But, with forward-looking real rates\nnow positive across the curve, we have been moderating the pace of those increases. Think\n\n\fof it as slowing your boat as you approach the dock. That gives us time to assess the data\non demand and in�ation and determine what more we might need to do.\nI want to reiterate that 2 percent in�ation is our target, and that I am still looking to be\nconvinced of the plausible story that slowing demand returns in�ation relatively quickly to\nthat target. If coming data doesn’t support that story, I’m comfortable doing more. I\nrecognize that creates the risk of a more signi�cant slowdown, but the experience of the\n’70s provides a clear lesson: If you back o� in�ation too soon, in�ation comes back\nstronger, requiring the Fed to do even more, with even more damage. That’s not a risk I\nwant to take.\nSo that’s my story.

Forecasts keep getting\npushed out. No one banished the business cycle, so those who keep predicting a\nrecession will eventually be right. But most recessions come suddenly.\n• Some fear that the Fed’s commitment to reining in in�ation will be that shock to the\neconomy. To be sure, the Fed’s objective is not to cause a recession; it’s to reduce\nin�ation, in line with our mandate.\n• There is still a plausible story that in�ation normalizes in short order and the\neconomy dodges additional trauma. Certainly, last month’s in�ation read was a good\none and I hope it is a sign.\n• As I talk to �rms, I hear reasons to believe that — if a recession were to occur this\ntime — it might be less severe.\n\nThank you for that kind introduction and for having me here. Today, I want to speak about\nthe economy and where we may be headed. I caution you these are my thoughts alone and\nnot necessarily those of anyone else in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nI look forward to your questions at the end, but I will start with the number one question\nI’ve been hearing, which is:\n“‘Are we headed into a recession?’ I would caution you that no one canceled the business cycle,\nso one can never fully rule out a recession — it’s just a question of timing. But I get why the\nconcern might be elevated today. Fiscal support from the pandemic is waning and … in�ation is\n\n\fmoving the Fed to increase rates. … Those who look more closely for signals may be pointing to\n… the yield curve, a closely watched recession predictor that has predicted eight of the last seven\nrecessions …”\nNow, what makes forecasting a recession so hard is that the question never seems to go\naway. In fact, the response I just gave comes word for word from a speech I gave last\nsummer. I know it’s a bit self-referential to quote yourself, but it’s telling that we are having\nthe same conversation over and over again.\nThis has been called the most predicted recession in memory. Forecasts keep getting\npushed out. For example, in a November 2022 Bloomberg economist survey, the median\nrespondent expected a recession in the �rst quarter of this year. In January, that got\npushed to the second quarter. In May, it was the third quarter. The Conference Board’s\nLeading Economic Index, historically a credible indicator, has been deteriorating and\ntherefore predicting a recession, over each of the last 15 months.\n\nBut a recession hasn’t happened, even though the Fed has raised rates 525 basis points\nover the last 17 months in an e�ort to �ght in�ation, which is now in the 4 percent range.\nGDP remains solid, growing 2.4 percent in the second quarter, in no small part thanks to\nthe consumer. Higher-income consumers are still spending, and higher wages are\nsupporting consumption, too. The labor market has also remained remarkably resilient,\nwith the unemployment rate at a historically low 3.6 percent. We have added nearly 1.7\nmillion jobs and 2 million people to the labor force thus far this year.\nSo, why haven’t we seen a recession? I think it’s because the pandemic is still with us — not\nthe public health crisis, thankfully, but the economic dislocation it unleashed.\nBusinesses experienced severe shortages over the last few years. So, they tell me they are\nholding on to workers and investing in safety stock. More fundamentally, they are still\nseeing healthy demand from their customers, and working through order backlogs. And\nmanufacturing and construction are seeing a boost from coming government investments\nin infrastructure and the like. If your business is healthy, why cut back?\nAt the same time, consumers continue to spend, funded by excess savings accrued during\nthe pandemic, elevated equity and housing wealth, and a robust jobs market. This year, the\ndrop in gasoline prices has freed up additional spending capacity. In June, the\nTransportation Security Administration hit a new daily record for number of passengers\nscreened. Barbie grossed $162 million in its �rst weekend. Taylor Swift is on a billion-dollar\ntour. Consumer spending is 68 percent of the economy and, while weaker, is still far from\nweak, as was shown in the most recent strong retail sales report.\nYou might still ask: Well, how about now? Are we �nally going to experience the recession\neveryone has been predicting? Well, we will someday. As I said up front, no one banished\nthe business cycle, so those who keep predicting a recession will eventually be right.\n\n\fBut most recessions come suddenly. Remember the pandemic or the global �nancial crisis.\nUnexpected shocks cause consumers and businesses to pull back in unison. For sure that\ncould happen here; imagine, for example, a cyber shutdown. I’m not going to try to make a\nprediction on the unexpected.\n\nBut I usually get the recession question these days due to a fear that the Fed’s commitment\nto reining in in�ation will be that shock to the economy. In�ation remains too high. And if\nthere is one thing we have relearned over the past two years, it is that in�ation is painful,\nand everyone hates it. They hate the uncertainty. They hate that it feels unfair. And frankly\nthey �nd it exhausting.\nOur e�orts to address in�ation arguably have pushed several industries into minirecessions already. Interest-sensitive sectors like housing and manufacturing have slowed.\nCommercial real estate (particularly o�ce) is challenged. Banks have experienced turmoil.\nAnd those with lower incomes are trading down and slowing spending as their savings are\ndrawn down.\nFurther slowing is almost surely on the horizon. A number of pandemic-era �scal support\nprograms are ending. Rate increases work with a lag; many models estimate their impact\nshould start to really hit around now. In addition, as banks preserve liquidity and protect\nearnings by stepping back from marginal lending, credit conditions have tightened,\nreducing consumer and business spending capacity.\n\nNo one wants a recession, but it’s worth remembering that not all recessions are created\nequally. We’ve been scarred by our memories of the Great Recession and the Volcker\nRecession, but they were particularly long and deep.\nAs I talk to �rms, I hear reasons to believe that — if a recession were to occur this time — it\nmight be less severe.\nIt could cause less dislocation in the labor market. When you think of a slowdown, you\nnaturally think of 2008 when manufacturing workers were sidelined across the Rust Belt\nand those last into the workforce bore a disproportionate burden. But those are the\nworkers I hear are most in demand today, as manufacturing plants, hotels, construction\nsites and restaurants remain short of workers. Recent large company layo�\nannouncements have targeted administrative functions, not front-line workers. These\nprofessionals may have a lower propensity to �le for unemployment, be unemployed for\nshorter periods and often can leverage backup savings to bridge their consumption.\nUnemployment for those with a college degree runs at 2 percent.\nA spending slowdown could be mitigated by latent demand. Houses and cars became\nexpensive and hard to �nd. But should supply open up in a weakening economy, I suspect\nwe would �nd a number of buyers who have deferred purchases over the last few years\n\n\fand are ready to spend.\nAnd the prolonged recession preamble we’ve seen could reduce the cost. Businesses planned\nlast year and are planning this year for a recession. They have slowed hiring, streamlined\ncosts, managed inventory levels and deferred investment. Banks have cut back on marginal\nloans. Many consumers have tightened their belts. So, if a recession does come, the\neconomy should �nd itself less vulnerable. And if it doesn’t come, today’s conservatism can\nfuel tomorrow’s revival. You might even argue that the recent strength in the economy is\nbeing supported in part by businesses, consumers and governments that have\noutperformed their recessionary forecasts. These windfalls may be lifting consumer\nsentiment too.\nFinally, of course, there is still a plausible story that in�ation normalizes in short order and\nthe economy dodges additional trauma. There has been a lot of talk over the last few weeks\nabout the potential for what is often called a “soft landing.” Certainly, last month’s in�ation\nread was a good one and I hope it is a sign. To be sure, the Fed’s objective is not to cause a\nrecession; it’s to reduce in�ation, in line with our mandate. We learned in the ’70s that if\nyou don’t get in�ation under control, it comes back even stronger.\nWith that, let me say I certainly hope I will be back with you next year and that the economy\nwill be resilient enough that I will have the opportunity to quote myself yet again!\nAnd now let me open it up for your questions and input.\nCurran, Enda, and Reade Pickert. “Recession Calls Keep Getting Pushed Back, Giving Soft\nLanding Believers Hope.” Bloomberg, May 17, 2023.\n\nIn�ation\n\nMonetary Policy\n\nBusiness Cycles\n\nReceive an email noti�cation when News is posted online:\nBy submitting this form you agree to the\n\n\fEmail Address\n\nSubscribe\n\n(804) 697-8956\n(804) 332-0207 (mobile)\n\n© 1997-2024 Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond\n\n\f",

The pandemic era\nseems to have made the jobs market less predictable and left a number of\nemployers scrambling for workers.\n• Employers caught short aren’t standing still.

That’s why I supported our\ndecision to hold rates steady at the last meeting. We have time to see if we’ve done\nenough, or whether there’s more work to be done.\n\nThank you for that kind introduction and for having me here. I want to spend some time\ntoday talking about the economy and particularly the labor market. And then I look forward\nto your questions. Before I jump in, let me note these are my thoughts alone and not\nnecessarily those of anyone else in the Federal Reserve System.\nThe U.S. economy has proven remarkably resilient. The Fed has raised rates 525 basis\npoints in the last year-and-a-half to �ght in�ation and, yet, GDP remains solid, growing 2.1\npercent in the second quarter. S&P Global forecasts 3.6 percent growth in the third\nquarter. That growth has been in part due to the consumer, who has continued to spend\ndown pandemic-era savings and bene�t from higher wages and rising equity valuations.\nUnemployment is low at 3.8 percent.\n\n\fAt the same time, in�ation has started to settle. In August, 12-month headline CPI was 3.7\npercent, down from its peak of 9.1 percent in June 2022. Core was at 4.3 percent. Gas prices\nhave fallen from last year’s highs, supply chains have largely opened up, and the Fed’s\nmonetary policy moves have begun to have their e�ect, particularly on interest-sensitive\nsectors like housing, commercial real estate and deal-making.\nWhere will demand and in�ation go from here? It’s hard to know. There are those who\nbelieve in�ation will settle further without much additional erosion of demand; there are\nthose who believe the �ght against in�ation will require a more signi�cant slowdown. I\nbelieve the labor market will be key to answering this question.\nEverywhere I go, from farms to factories to ballparks, I still hear that labor is short. Yes,\nhiring has become easier than in early 2022. Yes, the Great Resignation has largely passed,\nparticularly for professionals. And, yes, people are slowly coming back to the o�ce. But\neasier isn’t the same as “back to normal.” Demand is still healthy, and, for many employers,\nthe labor market still feels out of balance. If good workers remain hard to �nd, wages could\nrise further, pressuring margins and prices in turn. So, I want to spend my time today\ndigging into what’s happening in the labor market, and where it may go from here.\n\nLet me start with some math. In February 2020, 61.1 percent of the population was\nemployed. Today, that number is down 0.7 percentage points (equivalent to nearly 1.8\nmillion workers) at a time when real GDP has expanded over 6 percent since before the\npandemic. That gap helps explain why labor feels so short. It is. Demographics play a role.\nSome was predictable due to natural aging of the baby-boom generation. But the rest of\nthe gap is almost entirely attributable to lower participation rates for those at or near\nretirement age, perhaps supported by stronger 401(k) plans or the desire to help with child\ncare for grandkids.\nDemographers have forecast this reduction in the workforce for a while. For decades, our\neconomy operated with a growing labor force. We bene�tted from the baby boom, women\nmore fully entering the workforce, increased educational attainment better preparing\nworkers, improved health leading to longer careers and historically high levels of\nimmigration. All of that was supplemented by access to ever-growing pools of o�shore,\nlow-cost labor.\nThese tailwinds look like they are becoming headwinds. The growth of the working-age\npopulation is relatively straightforward to forecast, and predictions aren’t good. Fertility\nrates are down. K-12 school enrollment is projected to decline by nearly 8 percent between\n2019 and 2031. My generation is aging out of the workforce. Immigration policy looks\nunlikely to materially change soon. O�shoring has been complicated by increased\nawareness of the risk associated with dependence on foreign labor sources.\n\nBut it’s more than the overall numbers that are discombobulating employers. It’s not just\n\n\fthe level of supply but its distribution.\nOver time, employers had become comfortable with where their jobs rated versus those\no�ered by others. Think of it as a job hierarchy. They knew the level of investment in wages,\nbene�ts and working conditions they needed to make to hire and retain workers in what\nwas a relatively stable marketplace.\nBut the pandemic era seems to have reshu�ed that hierarchy considerably, making the\njobs market less predictable and leaving a number of employers scrambling. Three things\nhappened during COVID-19.\nThe �rst was a shift in relative compensation. Firms didn’t sit idly by as the pandemic created\nlabor shortages. Growth sectors, like warehousing, �lled their needs by o�ering high entry\nwages. Employers that found themselves short o�ered new perks or higher wages to\nconvince workers to come. In leisure and hospitality, for example, wages have increased 26\npercent since the start of the pandemic, compared to an 18 percent increase in the private\nsector overall. Segments that struggled to �nd the money to raise wages, such as state and\nlocal government, fell behind.\nThe second shift was that the COVID-19 experience made a number of jobs objectively less\nattractive. Whole sectors, like restaurants and theme parks, shut down, sending a message\nthat those sectors weren’t as secure as they had seemed. Supply chain challenges\nincreased stress on those in manufacturing. And for some jobs, like teachers, nurses and\nchild care providers which had historically earned points for the revered roles they hold in\nour society, the pandemic also crystallized that they face higher health risks, at least during\na crisis.\nThird, there was a shift in employee attitudes. The most obvious place is in preference for\nremote work. Jobs that can provide days at home have rocketed up the hierarchy. But there\nseems to be an even broader change in employee willingness to trade o� work and home.\nMy travels in the Fifth District drive this home. I talked to a coal company that in part can’t\nhire miners at high pay because cell phones don’t work in the mine shaft. And I heard from\na manufacturer in South Carolina that was losing workers to the Bojangles down the street.\nThe pay gap between the two companies may have shrunk, yes. But the attrition seemed\nmore linked to the ability to control work schedules and work in an indoor environment.\nConditions taken in stride prior to the pandemic, such as last-minute overtime shifts or\ngrueling physical labor, seem to require more of a premium now.\n\nThose employers caught short aren’t standing still.\nMany are investing to increase the supply of labor. This is good for workers, good for growth\nand reduces in�ationary pressure. I hear of a number of e�orts to bring in new workers o�\nthe sidelines, through training partnerships with community colleges, apprenticeships and\ninternships, and investments to reduce barriers to work like transportation, child care and\naccess to housing. This investment in talent could be particularly important given the\n\n\fimpact of the pandemic on the social and educational preparedness of those entering the\nworkforce.\nOthers are investing to reduce demand for labor. You can see that clearly in hotels, where\nhousekeeping is no longer always automatic every day, and many lounges are still closed.\nMore fundamentally, wage and sta�ng pressure has made automation more economically\ncompelling. McKinsey estimates that automation, including AI, could replace tasks that\naccount for about 30 percent of the hours worked in the United States by 2030. All else\nequal, these investments are also likely disin�ationary and increase capacity for growth.\nBut, while the buzz around automation and AI is inescapable, most jobs won’t change\novernight.\nAnd, of course, we are seeing employers �ght their way up the job hierarchy by adjusting wages,\nbene�ts and the work environment. Some are doing so by improving working conditions,\nlimiting overtime or last-minute scheduling, o�ering more �exible work arrangements or\ninstalling air conditioning. But those who can a�ord to reprice are doing so, raising wages\nto remain competitive. After all, workers expect more now. The New York Fed’s Survey of\nConsumer Expectations suggests that the average reservation wage — the lowest wage\nsomeone would accept for a new job — has increased over 20 percent from its prepandemic level. This has been quite visible in the recent negotiations in parcel companies,\nairlines and now autos, but is true in nonunion environments too. It's worth noting that\nwages generally only move in one direction. Those who are ahead of the curve won’t cut\nthem. Those who are losing out on workers eventually will raise them. We can expect that\nnet impact to be in�ationary, barring any adjustments to monetary policy.\n\nIt is hard to know how this will balance out. Will labor supply come back even further as\nemployers invest in training and retirees �nd themselves bored or squeezed? Will labor\ndemand settle as automation rolls out or the economy weakens? Will employees return to\ntheir pre-COVID-19 preferences? Or will employers bite the bullet and increase wages and\nthen prices even further?\nThe range of potential outcomes, to me, is still pretty broad. That’s why I supported our\ndecision to hold rates steady at the last meeting. We have time to see if we’ve done enough,\nor whether there’s more work to be done. The path forward to me depends on whether we\ncan convince ourselves in�ationary pressures are behind us, or whether we see them\npersisting. I will be watching the labor market closely for those signals.\nWith that, let me open to questions or comments.\nThis �gure was updated in order to represent the forecast available at the time of\npublication.\n“Generative AI and the future of work in America.” McKinsey Global Institute, July 26, 2023.\n\n\fIn�ation\n\nMonetary Policy\n\nBusiness Cycles\n\nEmployment and Labor Markets\n\nReceive an email noti�cation when News is posted online:\nBy submitting this form you agree to the\n\nEmail Address\n\nSubscribe\n\n(804) 697-8956\n(804) 332-0207 (mobile)\n\n© 1997-2024 Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond\n\n\f",

        "content": "Home / News / Speeches / Thomas I Barkin / 2023\n\nThe Real Estate Roundtable\nWaldorf Astoria Hotel\nWashington, D.C.\n\n• I am still looking to be convinced, both that demand is settling and that any\nweakness is feeding through to in�ation.\n• I don’t like depending solely on data. That’s why I’ve made it my priority to be on the\nground every week in the hopes of understanding the economy better.\n• There is somewhat of a disconnect between the data and what I hear on the ground.\nI see an economy that is much further along the path to demand normalization than\nmuch of the data would tell you.\n• But the question is how much of this softening is feeding through to in�ation. The\npath for in�ation isn’t yet clear.\n• That’s why I supported our decision at our last meeting to keep rates steady and wait\nfor more information. We have time to see if we have done enough, or whether\nthere’s more work to do.\n\nThank you for that kind introduction and for having me with you. You may know that the\nlast time the Fed tackled high in�ation, in the ’80s, homebuilders sent Paul Volcker two-byfours inscribed with the message: Lower interest rates. I look forward to hearing from you\ntoday but am hoping you checked your lumber at the door.\nTo set up our discussion, I thought I might share how I am seeing the economy. Let me\ncaution these are my thoughts alone and not necessarily those of anyone else in the\nFederal Reserve System.\nAs you well know, the Fed has moved aggressively against in�ation that was way too high.\n\n\fWe have raised rates 525 basis points in just a year and a half. Hopefully you agree we\nneeded to take action because, if there is one thing we have relearned over the past two\nyears, it is that everyone hates in�ation. High in�ation creates uncertainty. As prices rise\nunevenly, it becomes unclear when to spend, when to save or where to invest. In�ation is\nexhausting. It takes e�ort to shop around for better prices or to handle complaints from\nunhappy customers. And in�ation feels unfair — the wage increase you earned feels\narbitrarily taken away at the gas pump.\nWe are the folks mandated to tackle in�ation, but we only have one primary tool: raising\ninterest rates. It’s a powerful tool, as you know, but a blunt one. As we raise rates,\nborrowing becomes more costly, banks pull back, capital investment slows and consumer\nspending weakens, particularly in interest-sensitive sectors like real estate, autos,\nmanufacturing and deal-making. Reduced demand lessens the rate of in�ation in time.\nBut this tool doesn’t hit all sectors evenly. And, of course, I recognize our rate hikes hit your\nindustry early and disproportionately.\nI hope you agree we are making progress on in�ation. Our in�ation target is 2 percent. In\nSeptember, 12-month headline CPI in�ation was 3.7 percent, down considerably from its\npeak of 9.1 percent in June 2022. Core was 4.1 percent, and in the last three months has\nbeen 3.1 percent annualized. We aren’t there yet, but we’re headed in the right direction.\nWe’ve had some help. Supply chains have largely opened up. Labor force participation has\nrebounded. And gas prices have fallen from last year’s highs.\nNow there’s a story — a plausible story — that weakening demand is already working to\nbring in�ation down to 2 percent. Demand is weakening because rate increases work with a\nlag, and many models estimate their impact really starts to hit around now. Demand is\nweakening as long-term rates rise. Demand is weakening because credit conditions\ntightened following the bank turmoil earlier this year. And demand is weakening because\nthe pandemic economy continues to fade. Savings are being spent down. Fiscal stimulus\nhas waned. As demand settles, that reduces its imbalance with supply and brings in�ation\nback to target.\nIt's a plausible story but — if I can borrow from my time as a Boy Scout — this isn’t our �rst\ncamp�re. We have all told ourselves a number of stories about in�ation over the last two\nyears. They each seemed compelling at the time, but none have yet seen a happy ending.\nAt �rst, in�ation seemed transitory, as �scal stimulus faded and the economy fully\nreopened. Then supply chain remediation and lower commodity prices looked likely to feed\nthrough to prices. Then, when we raised rates and shrunk our balance sheet so\naggressively last year, you might have thought in�ation would have come back in line\nquickly. But in�ation remained elevated.\nSo, I am still looking to be convinced, both that demand is settling and that any weakness is\nfeeding through to in�ation. These are particularly hard questions to answer today because\nthere is somewhat of a disconnect between the data and what I hear on the ground.\n\n\fThe data will tell you that demand is not weak. GDP remains solid, growing 2.1 percent in\nthe second quarter. S&P Global forecasts a remarkable 5.2 percent in the third quarter.\nThat growth has been in no small part due to the consumer who has continued to spend\ndown pandemic-era savings and bene�t from higher wages and rising stock prices. Despite\na slowdown in housing activity, home prices have renewed their upward climb this year — a\ntestament to continued demand amid tight supply. And after slowing last year, business\ninvestment has rebounded, reaching 7.4 percent annualized growth in the second quarter.\nThe data will also tell you that the labor market is not weak. Unemployment remains low at\n3.8 percent. Job growth came in at 336,000 in September, triple the breakeven pace. It has\naveraged 266,000 over the last three months. Vacancies remain higher than pre-pandemic\nlevels. Wage growth is still elevated. Initial jobless claims in the last four weeks were below\n2019 levels.\nSo, if you believe the data, something’s got to give. Demand that strong isn’t the �x for\nin�ation.\nBut I don’t like depending solely on data. It comes in a month late. Then it is revised\nmultiple times. And it is adjusted by seasonal factors distorted by the pandemic. That’s why\nI’ve made it my priority to be on the ground every week talking to groups like this in the\nhopes of understanding the economy better. I’m hearing a di�erent message on the\nground.\nI’m hearing demand is softening. Interest-sensitive sectors like yours are of course feeling\nthe impact of higher rates. Businesses that sell to lower-income consumers tell me those\nconsumers are stretched thin and reprioritizing their spend. Middle-income consumers are\ntrading down. Banks are feeling margin pressure and have stepped back from riskier\nsectors, newer customers and less pro�table loans. Construction backlogs are being\nworked down.\nI’m also hearing that parts of the labor market are coming into better balance. It’s easier to\n�nd workers, especially professionals. Turnover is down. Wage pressure still exists but has\nmoderated from last year’s extreme levels. An exception, to be sure, is skilled trades, which\nremain quite tight.\nThe question is how much of this softening is feeding through to in�ation. Goods de�ation\nis back, as inventories and demand come into better balance. Rental vacancies are\nincreasing, which should mitigate in�ation in that key sector. But while most businesses\nacknowledge that the period of major pricing power is behind them, I’m still talking to a\nnumber that want and feel they need to push price where they can.\nSo, I see an economy that is much further along the path to demand normalization than\nmuch of the data would tell you. But the path for in�ation isn’t yet clear. That’s why I\nsupported our decision at our last meeting to keep rates steady and wait for more\ninformation, both from data and conversations on the ground. We have time to see if we\nhave done enough, or whether there’s more work to do.\n\n\fBut I recognize there are a wide range of potential paths going forward — from resurgence\nto recession to return to the pre-COVID-19 normal. And we are walking a �ne line. If we\nundercorrect, in�ation re-emerges. If we overcorrect, we do unnecessary damage to the\neconomy. And even the best policy has the potential to be waylaid by external events, as\nwe’ve been reminded with the recent news from the Middle East.\nI will say that if we do see the economy weaken, it’s worth remembering that not all\nrecessions are created equally. We’ve been scarred by our memories of the Great\nRecession and the Volcker Recession, but they were particularly long and deep. As I talk to\n�rms, I hear reasons to believe that any downturn this time might be less severe.\nFirst, it could cause less dislocation in the labor market. When you think of a slowdown, you\nnaturally think of 2008 when manufacturing workers were sidelined across the Rust Belt\nand those last into the workforce bore a disproportionate burden. But those are the\nworkers I hear are most in demand today, as manufacturing plants, hotels, construction\nsites and restaurants remain short of workers. Large company layo� announcements this\nyear have primarily targeted administrative functions, not front-line workers. These\nprofessionals may have a lower propensity to �le for unemployment, be unemployed for\nshorter periods and often can leverage backup savings to bridge their consumption.\nUnemployment for those with a college degree is just 2.1 percent.\nSecond, a spending slowdown could be mitigated by latent demand. Houses and cars became\nexpensive and hard to �nd. But should supply open up in a weakening economy, I suspect\nwe would �nd a number of buyers who have deferred purchases over the last few years\nand are ready to buy.\nAnd, �nally, the prolonged recession preamble could reduce the cost. This has been called the\nmost predicted recession ever. Businesses have been planning for a downturn for 18\nmonths. They have slowed hiring, streamlined costs, managed inventory levels and\ndeferred investment. Banks have cut back on marginal loans. Many consumers have\ntightened their belts. So, if a recession does come, the economy should �nd itself less\nvulnerable. And if it doesn’t come, today’s conservatism can fuel tomorrow’s revival.

In�ation remains too high.\n• There is an unusually wide range of potential paths for the economy going forward\n— from resurgence to soft landing to recession.\n• What path do I see? I do anticipate some sort of a slowdown. I see that slowing as\npart of what it takes to bring in�ation back to target. Price setters need to be\nconvinced.\n• Whether a slowdown that settles in�ation requires more from us remains to be seen.\nWe have time to reconcile competing narratives on demand and to test di�erent\nviews on the trajectory of in�ation.\n\nThank you for that kind introduction. I thought I might take 10 minutes to share how I’m\nseeing the economy. Let me caution these are my thoughts alone and not necessarily those\nof anyone else in the Federal Reserve System.\nAs you well know, the Fed has moved aggressively against in�ation. We have raised rates\n525 basis points in just a year and a half. Hopefully, you agree we needed to take action\nbecause, if there’s one thing we have relearned over the past two years, it is that everyone\nhates in�ation. High in�ation creates uncertainty. As prices rise unevenly, it becomes\nunclear when to spend, when to save or where to invest. In�ation is exhausting. It takes\ne�ort to shop around for better prices or to handle complaints from unhappy customers.\nAnd in�ation feels unfair — the wage increase you earned feels arbitrarily taken away at\nthe gas pump.\nWe are making real progress. In September, 12-month headline PCE in�ation was 3.4\n\n\fpercent, down considerably from its peak of 7.1 percent in June 2022. Core was 3.7 percent,\nand in the last three months, core has been 2.5 percent annualized. We aren’t at our 2\npercent target yet, but we’re heading in the right direction.\nAt the same time, the data shows an economy that has remained remarkably healthy.\nDespite fears of a recession, we continue to see strong demand and a resilient labor\nmarket. GDP grew at a remarkable 4.9 percent in the third quarter. Consumer spending\nwas robust, up 4 percent annualized. Unemployment remains low at 3.9 percent. Job\ngrowth has averaged 204,000 over the last three months, roughly double the breakeven\npace.\nIf you had asked me for my forecast a year ago, I would have been pretty happy to be at 3.4\npercent in�ation and 3.9 percent unemployment at this point. We’ve come a long way\nquickly, but the job isn’t done. In�ation remains too high, and the Fed has to walk a �ne\nline. If we undercorrect, high in�ation could return, as happened in the ’70s. If we\novercorrect, we do unnecessary damage to the economy. And even the best policy has the\npotential to be waylaid by external events, as we’ve been reminded with the recent news\nfrom the Middle East.\n\nOur job is complicated by the unusually wide range of potential paths for the economy\ngoing forward — from resurgence to soft landing to recession. Let me talk about each and\nthe implications for policy.\nOne path is reacceleration — demand picks up and, in turn, so does in�ation. The recent data\nlargely tells this story. Third quarter GDP growth de�ed expectations, fueled by consumers\nspending down pandemic-era savings and bene�tting from higher wages and stock prices.\nThe high-end experience economy is a particular hot spot. Despite a slowing in housing\nactivity, home prices have renewed their upward climb — a testament to continued\ndemand amid tight supply. Construction remains strong, supported by infrastructure\nspending and an AI-fueled data center boom. And the job market has been remarkably\nresilient — vacancies have ticked back up, jobless claims have moved down and wage\ngrowth remains elevated. Demand this strong isn’t the �x for in�ation and would likely\nrequire more from us.\nBut I don’t like depending solely on the data, which is published with a lag and revised\nmultiple times. I’ve made it my priority to be on the ground every week in the hopes of\nunderstanding the economy better.\nAnd I’m hearing a di�erent story on the ground. Interest-sensitive sectors, like real estate,\nmanufacturing and deal-making, report they are feeling the impact of higher rates.\nPandemic-era stimulus and excess savings have been largely spent down. Retailers tell me\nlower-income consumers are stretched thin and reprioritizing their spend, and middleincome consumers are trading down, perhaps still buying beef at the grocery store but\nschool notebooks at the dollar store. Banks are feeling margin pressure and have stepped\n\n\fback from riskier sectors, newer customers and less pro�table loans. Another way to look\nat consumer spending is year-over-year where growth numbers look solid but not frothy,\nmaking me think the data may just be showing a catch-up from a weak spring.\nA second potential path is the elusive “softish landing,” in which demand remains solid while\nin�ation comes down to target. Rate increases and tightened credit conditions both work\nwith a lag and may well work to bring in�ation down further in the coming months. Labor\nmarkets seem to be coming into better balance. In�ation expectations remain anchored,\nand the supply side has been working to bring in�ation pressures down: Supply chains\nhave largely been repaired, gas prices have backed o� last year’s highs, productivity has\ngone up, and prime-age labor participation has rebounded. If all these forces continue to\nwork to relieve supply pressure, perhaps in�ation could return to target without more help\nfrom us and without too much damage to demand.\nBut I’m not yet convinced that in�ation is on a smooth glide path down to 2 percent. The\nin�ation numbers have come down, but much of the drop has been the partial reversal of\nCOVID-19-era goods price increases driven by elevated demand and supply shortages.\nShelter and services in�ation remain higher than historical levels. As I talk to businesses, I\nstill hear of too many above-normal cost and price increases. Health care and insurance\ncosts are spiking. Merit pools are down but still above pre-pandemic levels. The recent UAW\nsettlement could spark another round of labor cost pressure. Large consumer goods\ncompanies in sectors like detergents, frozen foods and soft drinks are still raising prices at\nrates much higher than before COVID-19. After decades without pricing power, businesses\naren’t going to back down from raising prices until their customers or competitors force\ntheir hands. Don’t get me wrong — a softish landing would be great. But I fear more will\nhave to happen on the demand side to convince price setters the in�ation era is over.\nA third path is the traumatic recession so many have been forecasting for so long. It could be\ndriven by the Fed’s aggressive rate path, by banks pulling back in force, by geopolitical\nevents, or by some new �nancial crisis stemming from troubled sectors like commercial\nreal estate. Such a downturn usually works to bring in�ation down and turn policy on its\nhead, unless of course it emanates from a supply shock in commodities like oil.\nWe are clearly not in a recession today, based on the strong data I shared. We will be in a\nrecession someday, because no one ever canceled the business cycle. And it’s worth\nremembering that most recent recessions have come from unforeseen events like the\npandemic or 9/11.\nSo, what path do I see? I do anticipate some sort of a slowdown, as I just have to believe the\nnet impact of all this tightening will eventually hit the economy harder than it has. As an\nexample, I saw data suggesting that corporate interest payments as a percent of revenue\nand household interest payments as a percent of disposable personal income have both\nonly gotten back to 2019 levels. These bene�ts from pandemic-era re�nancing and debt\nrepayment won’t last long at current interest rates.\n\n\fI see that slowing as part of what it takes to bring in�ation back to target. As I said, price\nsetters need to be convinced. Whether a slowdown that settles in�ation requires more\nfrom us remains to be seen, which is why I supported our decision to hold rates at our last\nmeeting. With rates restrictive and �nancial conditions tightened, we have time to reconcile\ncompeting narratives on demand and to test di�erent views on the trajectory of in�ation.\nI will say that if we do see the economy weaken, it’s worth remembering that not all\nslowdowns are created equal. We’ve been scarred by our memories of the Great Recession\nand the Volcker Recession, but they were particularly long and deep. As I talk to �rms, I\nhear reasons to believe that any downturn this time might be less severe.\nFirst, it could cause less dislocation in the labor market. When you think of a slowdown, you\nnaturally think of 2008 when manufacturing workers were sidelined across the Rust Belt,\nand those last into the workforce bore a disproportionate burden. But those are the\nworkers I hear are most in demand today, as manufacturing plants, hotels, construction\nsites, and restaurants remain short of workers. Large company layo� announcements this\nyear primarily targeted administrative functions, not front-line workers. These\nprofessionals may have a lower propensity to �le for unemployment, be unemployed for\nshorter periods and often can leverage backup savings to bridge their consumption.\nUnemployment for those with a college degree is just 2.1 percent.\nSecond, a spending slowdown could be mitigated by latent demand. Houses and cars\nbecame expensive and hard to �nd. But should supply open up in a weakening economy, I\nsuspect we would �nd a number of buyers who have deferred purchases over the last few\nyears and are ready to buy.\nAnd, �nally, the prolonged recession preamble could reduce the cost. This has been called\nthe most predicted recession ever. Businesses have been planning for a downturn for 18\nmonths. They have slowed hiring, streamlined costs, managed inventory levels, and\ndeferred investment. Banks have cut back on marginal loans. Many consumers have\ntightened their belts. So, if a recession does come, the economy should �nd itself less\nvulnerable. And if it doesn’t come, today’s conservatism can fuel tomorrow’s revival. You\nmight even argue that the recent strength in the economy is being supported in part by\nbusinesses, consumers and governments that have outperformed their recessionary\nforecasts.\nSo, that's how I'm seeing the economy today.

But we hear\ncommunities are struggling to meet that need because they lack housing.\n• The key is more supply. To create that supply, communities need to own the\nproblem, compete for developers, innovate in o�ering a�ordable land and lowering\ncosts and engage with nontraditional partners.\n\nThank you for that kind introduction.\nAt the Richmond Fed, we serve Virginia but also the District of Columbia, Maryland, West\nVirginia and the Carolinas. We are constantly on the ground working to better understand\nthe economy. Just last year we had over 1,700 community engagements. These meetings\ntake us across our district, from Bristol to Alexandria, Winchester to Danville, and Virginia\nBeach to Harrisonburg.\nOver the last few years, talent availability has become critical for economic development.\nBut wherever we go, from the largest cities to the most remote towns, we hear\ncommunities struggling to meet that need because they lack housing. They are short sta�\nin schools, hospitals, child care and local governments. These essential employees all too\noften can’t �nd nearby housing they can a�ord.\nIn my remarks today, I’ll focus on ways communities — like the ones I’ve spent time with\nthis past year — are working to bring housing within reach for workers. These are my\nthoughts alone and not necessarily those of anyone else in the Federal Reserve System.\nAnd if you're wondering why the Fed cares about housing, it’s pretty simple. It impacts both\n\n\fsides of our dual mandate — maximum employment, and as has been evident in recent\nyears — in�ation.\n\nLet’s start with homeownership, which is becoming increasingly unattainable for too many\nworkers.\nTake teachers for example. The math all too often just doesn’t work for them. In 2022, the\nmedian middle school teacher made just over $60,000. With that salary today (and without\nbecoming cost-burdened), that teacher can a�ord a $228,000 house with a 20 percent\ndownpayment. But the median price for a new starter home last year was $299,000, and\nthat’s on the o� chance you could even �nd one.\nAnd the math has been getting worse. Average hourly earnings have increased 21 percent\nsince 2019. But one measure of home prices (Case-Shiller) has increased nearly 48\npercent. At the same time, of course, mortgage rates rose from 3.9 to almost 8 percent\ntoday. Why did prices spike so much? Demand and supply.\nDemand was picking up prior to the pandemic but really took o� in the last three years.\nNothing makes you more aware of the �aws of your current residence (or roommate) than\nspending every waking moment at home. So, with interest rates low, people started looking\nfor new places to live, with fewer people per household. Millennials began to settle down.\nInstitutional investors added to demand, as did second-home purchasers.\nBut the buying frenzy ran into constrained supply. Construction costs (including interest\nrates) increased, and the shortage of skilled trades worsened. Timelines got extended as\ngarage doors, counters, appliances and windows became hard to track down. At the same\ntime, fewer existing homes are being listed, as older Americans opt to age in place and\nhomeowners choose not to trade into higher-rate mortgages.\n\nAll this means that it’s now signi�cantly cheaper to rent than to buy. But the math for\nrenting also isn’t great. Supply and demand hit the rental market, too. In 2021, rents spiked\nas national rental vacancy rates dropped to levels not seen in almost 40 years. Our same\nteacher looking for a place to live in 2019 would have faced a median asking rent of $1,643\nper month, already a stretch for their budget. Now, that sum is up 22 percent to $2,011. I\nwill note that we are now seeing some relief in rent growth nationally, as construction has\nbrought more units online.\n\nWe need to make the math work better, both for homeownership and renting. But how?\nWell, subsidizing current prices at a wide scale will only increase demand further,\nworsening the imbalance with supply. Suppressing demand isn’t an attractive option either.\nSo, that leaves us with the need to increase housing supply. Everyone is struggling with this\nissue, but we can learn from each other. For those of you with a competitive spirit, both\n\n\fSouth and North Carolina have issued more permits for private, single-family homes than\nVirginia in each month since 2016. What are we seeing work?\n\nWhile the need for more housing may be obvious to us, it often isn’t to those who don’t\nwant their town to change, or who don’t like the speci�c change being proposed. They\nunderstandably worry about environmental impacts, or infrastructure capacity or school\ncrowding. NIMBYism is real, and failing to secure buy-in from the community adds time,\ncost and uncertainty. How do leaders rally their communities?\nThey articulate the case for housing. The community needs to see housing as integral to\neconomic growth, and regional leaders need to speak with one voice. A good example is\nthe I-68 Regional Alliance, an economic development organization that formed a housing\ncoalition linking rural counties in West Virginia, Maryland and Pennsylvania.\nThey also acknowledge and address legitimate concerns. Cecil County, Maryland, did this by\nmitigating stress about the area losing its rural identity. It created a development plan that\nrestricted growth to a “growth corridor” along the freeway, allowing the rest of the county\nto retain its character.\n\nDevelopers can go wherever they choose. These days, they are scarce, and they are\nrational. Most will go where the upside is highest and the risk is lowest. To get more\nhousing built, jurisdictions need to communicate that they welcome and support\ninvestment. What might that look like?\nUnsurprisingly, �nancial incentives never hurt. In 2022, Wise County implemented a tax\nincentive for renovation, rehabilitation or replacement of residential and commercial\nproperties. In West Virginia, the newly created Build WV program o�ers a tax exemption for\npurchasing construction materials, a 10-year property value tax credit, and the potential for\na business and occupation tax exemption. And I have heard Virginia is exploring a\ndeveloper incentive tied to business recruitment as well. Incentives can be targeted in\norder to attract developers that will build the type of housing the community needs.\nBut it’s not just about money. Developers will go where they can expect cooperation and\ne�cient, predictable timelines. Streamlined permitting helps, as does reducing\nunnecessary regulation. Ensuring su�cient municipal sta�ng can also minimize processing\nand approval timelines. We heard from a group involved in comparable projects on the\nEastern Shore of Maryland and nearby Delaware. The Delaware project progressed much\nfaster. The community did a better job processing permits, and its regulatory standards\nwere clearer. But the most important di�erence was local support. In Maryland,\ndevelopment was slowed by environmental and zoning challenges that delayed the\npermitting process, added cost and increased uncertainty.\n\n\fIn 2022, �nished lot costs made up nearly 20 percent of the average sales price of a new\nsingle-family home, so minimizing these costs can go a long way. In fact, in the few\ncommunities in which housing availability seems less of an issue and the national\nhomebuilders are everywhere — for example, eastern North Carolina — contacts have\npointed to easily available and a�ordable land. What are communities doing to make\na�ordable land more available?\nStart with zoning. Rezoning unlocks underleveraged land for higher density development.\nThat’s what we saw in a Harrisonburg partnership between the local housing authority and\nEquityPlus, LLC. And several jurisdictions, such as Raleigh, North Carolina, are looking to\naccessory dwelling units to expand supply in already built neighborhoods.\nInvest in buildable homesites. States have gotten in the habit of preparing buildable\nindustrial sites to attract businesses. Why not put a similar investment toward buildable\nhomesites available for residential developers? We’ve seen communities, like the City of\nSanford, North Carolina, do this in concert with a particular development partner. Perhaps\nit could be done even earlier in the development cycle.\nLeverage unused land and structures. Many communities are repurposing older structures\nthat are no longer in use to build apartments. Carroll County transformed a historic school\ninto 51 new units. Fayetteville, West Virginia, is retooling an elementary school. In\nCumberland, Maryland, it is an old hospital. Danville is transforming an old textile mill into a\nretail space and 150 apartments. Once you start thinking of the possibilities, it is hard to\nstop, and I know Virginia has e�orts underway to look at all state-owned land that could be\nused for housing.\nPurchase to repurpose. Another way to maximize availability is to prevent older housing\nfrom leaving the market. Some localities are purchasing and converting private dilapidated\nstructures. This process often requires tracking down absentee landlords and clearing up\ntitles. Several towns in West Virginia have used land banks to take ownership of abandoned\nproperties and put them in the hands of developers.\n\nIn 2022, construction costs were three-�fths of the average sales price for a new singlefamily home. These costs are way up and may well stay up. With that reality, can the same\nhousing be built for less? Well, there hasn’t been meaningful productivity growth in the\nconstruction sector in decades. Turning that around would be a good start. Until then, we\nmight ask a di�erent question: whether we need to make “the same homes.”\nCan we make smaller homes? Homes under 1,400 square feet have fallen from 14 percent of\nnew, single-family homes built for sale in 1999 to only 3 percent today. Could that change?\nIt’s worth noting that this is another area where zoning matters. Minimum lot sizes may\ndiscourage smaller builds.\n\n\fCan we make a di�erent type of home? In Hagerstown, Maryland, they are standing up a new\ncommunity of factory-built single-family homes with smaller units starting at $250,000.\nThese homes look like typical single-family homes, but they are built more quickly and\na�ordably. And, importantly, because they are built in a factory, they reduce the need for\nskilled tradespeople on location. While promising, this path has its challenges, such as\nnegative perceptions and zoning limitations.\n\nA number of nontraditional partners are helping improve the math throughout the Fifth\nDistrict.\nFoundations are engaging. In North Carolina, the Golden LEAF Foundation is providing up to\n$6 million to help �nance tax credit projects for federal low-income housing in\ncollaboration with the North Carolina Housing Finance Agency. They are also working with\nthe state disaster recovery agency to fund infrastructure for new housing outside of the\n100-year �oodplain. And they are partnering with Bertie County and the State Employees\nCredit Union Foundation to �nance new housing units exclusively for teachers and state\nemployees.\nEmployers are increasingly investing too. If you think back to the company town era,\nbusinesses used to invest in housing for their employees. Those days may be returning. We\nhear resorts in West Virginia, Pennsylvania and the Northern Neck are building housing for\ntheir employees. In northern Virginia, Amazon is investing to support new housing, too.\nColleges have a lot of potential. Students need housing too, and presumably, new dorms free\nup space for others. In 2022, Southwest Virginia Community College became the �rst in the\nstate to o�er housing, and there is a lot more potential to add housing on community\ncollege campuses if states are willing to clear the barriers to building.\nEven churches are getting into the game. North of Charlotte, Wesley Community\nDevelopment is working with area churches to convert surplus church property into\nhousing. Several local parishes, including Caldwell Presbyterian, have partnered with the\ncity to build a�ordable housing; they have donated land, properties and direct funding.\nTo close, we all know housing availability is limiting communities. The key is more supply.\nTo create that supply, communities need to own the problem, compete for developers,\ninnovate in o�ering a�ordable land and lowering costs and engage with nontraditional\npartners. As I said upfront, this is a math problem — but one where potential solutions are\nbeginning to multiply.\nS&P Dow Jones Indices LLC, S&P/Case-Shiller U.S. National Home Price Index.\n“The Rent.
